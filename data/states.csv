It was a historic vote. Incorporated in 1956 by well-to-do hill dwellers trying to keep out the encroaching urbanity of nearby cities, the town’s “country residence zoning” rules only permit the construction of one type of building: Single-family homes, and no more than one per acre. 
But town officials felt they had no choice. Bowing to state mandates to plan for more residential development, they zeroed in on three sites with apartment potential. The most promising of the three was Twin Oaks Court,  a cluster of lots on a dead-end street sprouting from a frontage road along the I-280 freeway. State housing regulators signed off on the plan that spring.
Now, with a project proposed at Twin Oaks that would include the town’s first-ever affordable housing units, Los Altos Hills is having second thoughts.
Earlier this summer, the town council voted to amend its state-mandated development plan, cutting the number of new homes that could be legally crammed onto the site by nearly two-thirds.
Town officials and many local residents say the proposed changes to the municipal land-use blueprint, known as a housing element, still meet the letter of the state’s planning requirements while capping would-be development at a scale better suited to the town’s rural character. 
Packing hundreds of new residences along a narrow access road out of town is “totally inappropriate,” said Michael Grady, a retired lawyer who lives near the Twin Oaks site and who created an online petition calling on the town to revise its original plan. He said development at the densities initially permitted would snarl emergency access to and from the area, turbocharge traffic and disrupt local wildlife. 
Pro-development activists are characterizing the proposed change as a bait-and-switch by an affluent community trying to evade state housing law and their obligations to make space for new residents, including those with lower incomes. The typical price of a home in the town currently tops $5.5 million, according to Zillow. 
“Local agencies should not be allowed to amend their housing elements the moment that they are confronted with a real housing development project,” the California Housing Defense Fund, a legal advocacy group that regularly sues cities for violating state housing laws, in a letter to the California Department of Housing and Community Development last month. 
As far back as 2018, state housing department regulators, newly emboldened by a raft of California laws, have been sparring with municipalities over their state-mandated plans to make way for more houses and apartments. These battles have taken the form of lawsuits, threats of funding cuts and, in some cases, cities losing authority over local development entirely. Now, years into the process, most of California’s cities and towns have housing elements in place with the state’s certification.
The local tussle over Twin Oaks Court shows that getting the housing department’s seal of approval isn’t the end of the fight, but possibly the beginning of a new one. 
California housing regulators are slated to respond to the town’s proposed changes later this week. 
‘Testing the waters’
Cities across the state have reason to watch and see how things play out.
After receiving housing department certification for its housing plan in 2024, Carmel, a picturesque beach town in Monterey County, almost immediately began working to change it. The main goal: remove city-owned parking lots from the city’s list of potential affordable housing sites and replace them with less politically controversial alternatives. 
The town has yet to submit an amended version of its plan with the state, but formed a working group composed of town staff and a group of local activists opposed to development on the lots.
South Pasadena has likewise submitted its own amendment to reduce the number of new homes allowed, citing a calculation error that led to the original plan providing far more capacity than is required by law.
Other affluent towns have sought out such changes in the past — with mixed results. 
Earlier this summer, Rancho Palos Verdes in south Los Angeles County considered removing a handful of parcels from its state-approved list of developable properties. The town argued that its original plan included more development capacity than was strictly required under state law, so trimming the sites — including one with a proposed cluster of townhomes — was perfectly legal. The town eventually backed down in the face of threatened litigation. 
In May, Sausalito, a well-heeled suburb overlooking the San Francisco Bay, succeeded where Rancho Palos Verdes failed. The town amended its state-approved housing plan, reducing the amount that can be built at the site of a controversial condo project. The housing department approved the changes.
“We’re in the ‘testing the waters’ phase,” said Matt Gelfand, an attorney with Californians for Homeownership, which sues cities in Southern California for failing to plan or zone for enough housing. “If some smaller cities can get away with it, it’s going to be something that is employed by more cities.”
In evaluating each city’s proposed changes, the state housing department is tasked with distinguishing proposed amendments that fix legitimate flubs or that make reasonable alterations to existing plans from those made in bad faith in order to delay or quash proposed developments.
The developers behind the Twin Oaks Court site clearly see Los Altos Hills’ new plan as the latter. 
“I don’t think that is what the housing element amendment process is supposed to be for,” said Brian O’Neill, a lawyer representing the group of developers operating under the business name Twin Oaks Court LLC. “It is supposed to be for looking at and strengthening your housing policies, not as a method to kill housing projects.”
Los Altos Hills’ Mayor Kavita Tankha forwarded an emailed request for an interview to city manager Peter Pirnejad. Pirnejad said he and town staff did not have time to respond to a list of questions by the time this story was published.
How much is enough?
Local governments across California are on the hook under state law to plan for more than 2.5 million new homes before the end of the decade. Los Altos Hills’ share is 489. 
In trying to hit that target, the town leaned heavily on Twin Oaks. The site had a “realistic capacity” of 92 units, the plan noted. But the town’s specific proposal to rezone the parcels allowed for considerably denser development: Upwards of 250. 
Meanwhile, the other two sites identified as possible multifamily developments — campuses of the Saint Nicholas Catholic School and Foothill College — never looked especially promising.
“They shouldn’t get to weasel out of what they promised on the basis that they just noticed steep land is steep.”Anne Paulson, member, Los Altos Affordable Housing Alliance
The Diocese of San José, owner of the catholic school site, has “no intention of developing or selling” any part of the school, said spokesperson Cynthia Shaw. “Legal counsel clearly conveyed the Diocese’s opposition to the Town’s submission of the housing plan in 2022.” 
The Foothill College district initially expressed interest in building on-site housing for faculty and staff, but recently opted to purchase an apartment complex in nearby Mountain View instead.
Earlier this year, Twin Oaks Court LLC took the town up on its state-certified plan. The group filed a preliminary development application that maxed out the development capacity of the site — and then some. Making use of a series of state laws that let developers pack in more units if a certain share are for lower-income tenants, the project proposed building 598 homes. 
Density-averse town residents panicked. 
“This is exactly what we’ve been asking you to protect us from,” local resident Martha Bowden said, excoriating the town council after details of the proposal emerged in February. “This would be a disaster.”
“This is illustrative of exactly why I’ve been saying for over a year and a half that the housing element as drafted is a time bomb,” said Grady, the petition organizer. 
Not every spectator agreed. 
“After the housing element was accepted, residents and the council were wailing, ‘but it’s steep at Twin Oaks,’” said Anne Paulson, who has attended town hall meetings as a member of the Los Altos Affordable Housing Alliance. “They nevertheless chose those sites, instead of flatter sites down the hill. They shouldn’t get to weasel out of what they promised on the basis that they just noticed steep land is steep.”
The Twin Oaks developers have since reined in their plans. Their latest proposal includes a cluster of 334 single-family modular homes, including 56 set aside for lower-income residents. But that proposal is still bigger and denser than what would be allowed under the town’s proposed housing plan. The amended housing element cuts the number of allowable units to 92, the “realistic capacity” figure included in the original housing plan. 
That makes the new plan squarely consistent with state law, said Grady. The remaining housing capacity needed to hit the state’s target of 489 can still be met through a combination of the two school sites and less clustered development, like accessory dwelling units, he said.
“We only need 92 units” at Twin Oaks Court, he said. “I still think it’s inappropriate, but I could live with 92 units.” 
Pro-development advocates disagree. Housing regulators signed off on the town’s housing plan two years ago. Since then, the two proposed school sites have not been developed and more evidence has emerged to suggest that they won’t be anytime soon. 
Cities are “going to have to demonstrate, with substantial evidence, that these sites are likely to be developed…(despite) years of history demonstrating that there hasn’t been very much development,” said Gelfand with Californians for Homeownership. Municipal governments are “fantasizing” that they “can just take some sites off of our sites inventory and then just assume that the remaining sites are still valid just as they were a couple years ago. But that’s not how it works.”
Whether that is or isn’t how it works will ultimately depend on what housing regulators decide.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/100125-Los-Altos-Hills-GETTY-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C641&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-08 19:58:18.006526

(Courtesy of 1X2 Architecture)OMAHA — Under names such as Czech Village, Silver Bull and Old Town Village, Tom McLeay has been buying up properties for more than a decade in the Little Bohemia neighborhood south of Nebraska’s largest downtown business district.
As head of Clarity Development, he helped lead efforts to get that former Czech immigrant enclave designated as both blighted and historically significant — opening the door for public financing sources to boost redevelopment along the commercial spine leading toward Omaha’s world-class zoo.
McLeay also led construction of the 107-unit Little Bo Bungalows and Flats, ushering in one of the first new rental complexes to an aging area that’s seen trendy redevelopment emerge amidst structures dating back to the 1880s.
On deck now for the neighborhood, however, is McLeay’s largest swing yet.

Little Bo Village, a multifaceted Clarity project moving through the steps toward city government approval, would dramatically change the look of one square city block and parts of two others with 10 new or revamped buildings that contain a total of about 160 new residential dwellings, along with retail and recreational venues.
When done, the roughly $40 million investment, buttressed by $8.2 million in often controversial public tax-increment financing, would bring a swimming pool, pickleball courts and “country club” amenities to an area McLeay believes would otherwise attract more storage units and unkempt properties.
Also expected is an estimated 110 full- and part-time jobs, not counting some 100 temporary construction posts. The developer sees the hub as adding allure to a city seeking to recruit talent and improving job growth.
“I think it’s transformational,” McLeay said of the proposed village centered along the South 13th Street corridor south of William Street. “It’s the bridge connecting downtown to the zoo and starts the process of extending downtown Omaha farther south.”
‘Not rocket science’ 
He envisions the changing artery — home also to several other new retail and residential ventures from developers beyond Clarity, as well as long-established industrial businesses — as a new “front door” for visitors exiting Interstate 80 headed north toward Omaha’s downtown.
However, not all merchants and neighbors are rolling out the welcome mat. Key to their concern is lack of parking to accommodate the influx of people.
The village project comes with a request to change zoning to a “neighborhood business district,” a designation city planners say has no minimum parking space requirements. The anchor apartment complex near 14th and Briggs Streets, for example, is to contain 58 parking stalls for 113 residences and 4,250 square feet of retail space.

Guests to the area would rely on street and neighborhood area parking, said McLeay, who said many drawn to the area walk, carpool and use Uber service and scooters to get around. He said redevelopment of such urban pockets of housing and retail would not be financially feasible if parking ratios were as stringent as they are for the suburbs. 
Dave Hempel, whose family sheet metal business has been on the corridor for some 75 years, is among existing merchants who fear inadequate parking will create safety woes for pedestrians and residents.
Hempel said his business alone has 10 semi trucks delivering goods daily, and he questions how traffic flow would mix with the new projects’ customer-facing retailers.
“It’s not rocket science,” Hempel said. “You’re trying to highly populate an area not cut out for it. The idea of bringing all these multiresidential apartment buildings into an area like this is trying to make a silk purse out of a sow’s ear and it’s really hard to do.”
Hempel said he welcomes progress, but he believes the high-density project was not coordinated well enough with area businesses and could hurt existing commerce. He said a recent restaurant across 13th Street from Hempel Sheet Metal Works already has moved, and another retailer has taken its place.
McLeay said parking gripes have surfaced in other near-downtown projects he’s worked on, including the popular midtown Omaha entertainment-focused Blackstone District. “It works itself out.”
To that, Hempel said: “They’re trying to compare this to a city like Chicago or New York. Well, this is Omaha, Nebraska. People are not taking Ubers and the bus lines and trams and public transportation, they never will. They’re going to want cars to get from point A to point B.”
 Zoning change hurdle

While the City Council already has approved the TIF public incentive for two related Little Bo Village proposals, the zoning changes still must be approved to green-light the venture.

Assistant City Planning Director Eric Englund expects those requests to come before the City Council in November or December. He said Omaha’s master plan supports rezoning the project area to the “neighborhood business district,” a designation that lifts any parking space minimum. Such zoning, he said, aims to encourage urban revitalization and preservation of historic commercial cores often developed along old streetcar routes.
Based on similar past cases, Englund said, it would be unusual for city officials to deny Clarity’s zoning request.
Neighborhood challenges often arise with a large influx of housing and commercial units, Englund said, noting the importance of adding more residential dwellings and strengthening the city’s core.
Shirley McNally, who has lived in the Little Bohemia area for 34 years, said she has not heard opposition from “real residents of our neighborhood” and does not believe the venture should be held up due to “real or imagined concerns” over parking in a neighborhood dotted with underutilized lots.
In a statement to City Council members, McNally said the opposition reminded her of small towns where a few opposed new ideas, “so a project died and so eventually did the town.” 
“It is exciting to see Little Bo revitalize and grow into a prosperous, interesting place to live,” she wrote.
 It’s personal 

For McLeay, who is working on the redevelopment with his wife and business partner, Colleen, the village has been years in the making. COVID-19, rising interest rates and construction costs delayed progress, he said.

He said his goal was to maintain the character of the enclave — including a plan to restore the 1890 tin-ceiling corner building once home to a dry goods store and later the Golden Goose bar and restaurant.  Two dilapidated wood-framed buildings on the same block would be returned to an original western-style facade. Among other structures headed for rehabilitation is the former neighborhood institution Donut Stop which, according to the National Register of Historic Places, was once occupied by the landmark Bohemian Café that later moved a few doors to the south.
An easier route, McLeay said, would be to scrape and build bigger. 
“We think we’ve found a creative way to that middle ground, to stay within the context of the neighborhood,” he said.
Retail tenants have yet to be secured, McLeay said, and they’ll likely bring their own brand names. He said he has had discussions with national and local restaurateurs.

Several storefronts not owned by Clarity would remain in the village mix, including stalwart O’Dowd’s vacuum shop along 13th Street, and Watie White’s art studio along William Street. White was among the earliest creatives in the area, turning an old 1890 storefront into his workspace.
McLeay said redevelopment efforts in the Little Bohemia area are personal, as his family roots in South Omaha harken to 1854 when his great-great-grandparents settled there from Europe. 
He said he’s sad to see disinvestment in South Omaha’s historic ethnic pockets, is worried about opposition to Little Bo Village but is hopeful his venture will be approved and completed as planned by summer 2027.
“That family history, knowing we’ve been here all this time — it’s meaningful,” he said.



 A Village 

Clarity Development presented its Little Bohemia vision to Omaha officials as two components: the Little Bo historic project and the Little Bo Village mixed-use project. 
Among proposed elements:
Former Golden Goose building, 1270 S 13th St., would be rehabbed with help of historic tax credits; 1,300 square feet of commercial space, an outdoor patio space and two second-floor market-rate apartments would be added.
The Donut Shop, 1256 S. 13th St., would be rehabbed also and used as a restaurant with outdoor dining.
Two historic buildings, 1316 and 1318 William St., to be rehabbed for a total of 4,100 square feet of main floor commercial space and two second-floor market-rate apartments.
New U-shaped apartment structure, 14th and Briggs Streets, would bring 113 market-rate dwellings and 4,250 square feet of first-floor commercial space. Five stories at its tallest point, it will include a 58-stall parking garage. 
New rowhouse structure, at the southern end of the “U” shape fronting 14th Street, would bring eight market-rate, stacked rental dwellings.
New two-story commercial structure, corner northeast of 14th and William Streets, to bring 2,400 square feet of bar and dining space on first floor, two market-rate apartment units on second level.
New three-story “slip-in” apartment structure, north side of William Street between 14th and 13th, to bring 20 market-rate apartments. 
New three-story, 10-unit “missing middle” apartment building, 1323 S. 12 St., would rise a bit farther from the village hub and nearer the previously-built Little Bo apartments east of 13th and north of William Streets. 
Little Bo Village “Country Club,” west of 14th Street and south of Briggs Street, would bring pickleball, a pool and bar with rooftop seating to a half-acre site.

O’Toole argues sports prediction markets are a significant threat to the state’s framework for gaming.,"Officials celebrated the launch of Maryland’s legal sports betting market at MGM National Harbor in December 2021 in Oxon Hill, Md. As many states legalize sports betting, officials are increasingly eyeing a certain type of wager known as a prop bet for increased regulation. (Photo by Shannon Finney/Getty Images for MGM National Harbor)In a letter written to the state’s congressional delegation on Wednesday, Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board (PGCB) Executive Director Kevin F. O’Toole says he’s concerned about the growing presence of sports prediction markets and the “significant threat” it poses on the state’s regulatory framework for gaming.
O’Toole is calling on Pennsylvania’s 17 U.S. House members and two U.S. Senators to urge the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to consider what he views as problems caused by a “dual-track system of state regulated legal sports wagering and purported futures trading on sporting events under the facade of federal regulation.”
“Sports prediction markets operate under the assertion that they are financial derivatives, or swaps, and therefore claim to not be gambling under state law,” O’Toole writes. “These markets effectively create a backdoor to legalized sports betting, operating parallel to, but outside of, the state-regulated system, and without strict oversight.”
The 2018 Supreme Court decision in Murphy v. National Collegiate Athletic Association recognized a state’s right to authorize and regulate sports wagering within its boundaries Following the ruling, Pennsylvania began to authorize intrastate sports wagering.
O’Toole argued the commonwealth’s system is designed to ensure consumer protections, responsible gaming, and the integrity of sporting events. He added that state-regulated sports betting operators in the state face significant requirements, including thorough background investigations, licensing fees, state taxation on gross gaming revenue, mandatory compliance with detailed rules providing consumer protections, responsible gaming provisions, and integrity monitoring.
“Perhaps most troubling, the CFTC regulates a system that also allows wagers on events that a single person can control — something the PGCB would never allow for fear of manipulation of the market and a cascading loss of confidence in the integrity of the betting system,” O’Toole wrote.
It would take the CFTC years to create the regulatory system and oversight needed for this, O’Toole argued.
The PGCB has the ability to penalize the operators if they don’t follow the statutory and regulatory requirements. O’Toole noted that is something an operator who “self-certifies” their contracts/wagers would never face.
“Even worse,” O’Toole concludes, “the parallel tracks risk confusing patrons who engage in these markets by utilizing the veneer of a highly regulated market when, in reality, their markets are more akin to the ‘wild west.’”
The Gaming Control Board  oversees all aspects of gambling in Pennsylvania involving 17 casinos, online casino games, retail and online sports wagering, and Video Gaming Terminals (VGTs) at qualified truck stops. It also regulates online fantasy sports contests. Casinos and other types of board-regulated gaming generated $2.8 billion in tax revenue and fees in the 2024-25 fiscal year.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/sports-betting-Md.jpg,,,2025-10-08 19:58:18.006526

The North Dakota Industrial Commission approved the Furloughed Federal Employee Relief Program, which leverages the state-owned Bank of North Dakota to offer low-interest loans to cover lost wages. The short-term loans can be repaid after the federal government reopens and employees receive back pay.
Gov. Kelly Armstrong, who recently served in Congress, said the idea for the relief program started in his head in 2018 when he was flying to Washington, D.C., during a shutdown and was “read the riot act” by a Transportation Security Administration agent who was working without pay.
“And rightfully so. We ask those guys to go to work every single day in the middle of these shutdowns, regardless if they’re getting paid or not,” said Armstrong, a Republican who chairs the three-member Industrial Commission.
Shutdown day eight: Congress standoff unchanged as first missed federal payday nears

Federal employees who aren’t getting paid will be able to apply for 2% loans through a North Dakota bank or credit union for up to three months of their take-home pay. Applications will be accepted starting Friday. Information on how to apply is available at the Bank of North Dakota’s website. Borrowers will have five months to repay the loans.
Industrial Commission officials estimate the total number of eligible North Dakota federal employees, including those stationed on two Air Force bases, is about 9,200 people. 
“The ones that are going to work every day protecting our country, the ones that go to work every day making sure we get on airplanes, are actually the people most likely to be living paycheck to paycheck,” Armstrong said.

(Photo by Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)
Grand Forks Mayor Brandon Bochenski, who participated in the announcement of the program, said his city is home to a lot of federal workers in addition to those at the Grand Forks Air Force Base.
“This is really going to help the rank and file,” Bochenski said. “Grand Forks is so grateful, and this is truly North Dakota at its finest.”
Rick Clayburgh, president of the North Dakota Bankers Association, encouraged federal employees to reach out to their local banks. The program is also available to new customers of North Dakota banks.
Don Morgan, president and CEO of the Bank of North Dakota, said the program is modeled after disaster relief programs the bank has done in the past. The Bank of North Dakota will buy the loans and pay each lender a service fee of $250.
The federal government shutdown entered its eighth day on Wednesday with neither Republican or Democrat funding plans receiving the 60 votes necessary to advance. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projected 750,000 federal workers would be furloughed during the shutdown.
Phil Davis, Workforce Services director for North Dakota Job Service, said as of Friday, 10 federal employees had filed for unemployment since the start of the shutdown.  
Trump floats plan to deny back pay to furloughed federal workers after shutdown

He said federal employees may be holding back on filing because the unemployment benefits would have to be repaid if the workers are awarded back pay. 
President Donald Trump floated the idea this week that furloughed employees would not be entitled to receive back pay after the government shutdown ends. 
The North Dakota loans do not require collateral, but are guaranteed by the back pay owed to federal workers.
Armstrong said there is a law that guarantees the back pay of furloughed federal employees, noting he voted to support it in 2019 as a member of Congress.
“The law says they get it,” he said. “There will be a tremendous amount of bipartisan support to protect the law that passed.”

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)The families of two Utah teenagers have dropped their lawsuit challenging the state’s ban on transgender players in girls’ sports. 
The families and the Utah High School Activities Association agreed to the dismissal of the case with prejudice, meaning it can’t be refiled later on, according to a Monday court filing.
The end to the case comes after more than three years of legal wrangling and after the U.S. Supreme Court agreed over the summer to hear similar cases from Idaho and West Virginia. In those cases, lower courts sided with transgender athletes seeking to compete, and the states appealed. 
After state lawmakers passed Utah’s ban in 2022, the families of the two transgender athletes sued in Salt Lake City’s 3rd District Court. A judge placed the prohibition on hold while the case played out, triggering the start of a state commission fielding requests from transgender girls seeking to compete in high school sports. 
Utah House Speaker Mike Schultz said on social media that with the lawsuit over, Utah’s ban is law and the commission will be dissolved. 
“This is a major win for fairness, safety, and the preservation of women’s sports in Utah,” Schultz, R-Hooper, said in a post on X. 
The families of the Utah teens had argued the ban singled them out for being transgender, violating their rights to due process and equal treatment under Utah’s constitution. 
“Our plaintiffs — young, courageous girls — showed remarkable strength under scrutiny,” said Aaron Welcher with the ACLU of Utah, which represented the families. “Our commitment to transgender youth continues, because protecting one group’s rights protects everyone’s.”
Attorneys for the families and the state wrote in this week’s court filing that “the parties will bear their own respective costs, expenses, and fees.”

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) A survey of the commercial horticulture food crops industry in Iowa showed direct specialty crop sales of more than $79 million in 2022 and even higher figures of economic output attributable to the industry. 
Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship announced the results of the 2023 survey  Wednesday and said it shows the local produce industry is “diverse, growing, and making a significant contribution to Iowa’s economy and agricultural identity.” 
The survey was sent to Iowa specialty crop producers who grow edible crops like vegetables, fruits, berries, nuts, honey, maple syrup, herbs, mushrooms and pumpkins.

According to a news release from IDALS, this is the first “comprehensive look” at the industry since 2015. 
More than 850 specialty farmers participated in the survey, which found that a total of 11,650 acres of specialty crops were grown in 2023. 
Sales from these farms had a statewide economic output of $66.5 million in 2023 and supported $29.9 million in labor. 
Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig said the survey “confirms the economic strength of specialty crop producers.” 
“Iowa’s horticulture food crops sector is an important part of our agricultural economy and a defining feature of the diversity and vibrancy of Iowa agriculture,” Naig said. 
Most of these farms are small, grow multiple products and sell directly to consumers. These farmers skew young with nearly 50% of respondents below the age of 35. 
The survey found the average age of Iowa specialty crop producers was 57.2 years, which is lower than the national average, 58.1 years, of producers in the U.S. according to the latest Census of Agriculture.  
The majority of specialty farm producers responded that they also work-off farm jobs and 37% responded they work full-time jobs off the farm in addition to running the farm. 
The average farm size for these edible crops was 7.8 acres, though many farms are quite a bit smaller considering the median farm size was just 2.8 acres. The survey also found that just 4% of farms had crop insurance. 
From 1989 to 2000, the number of specialty farms in Iowa declined from 1,400 farms to 938 farms, according to the survey results. The industry has since rebounded, with 1,680 farms counted in 2023. 
The results show the total number of sales of edible specialty crops increased by 73% from 2012 to 2022, with inflation-adjusted figures. The survey results show direct edible specialty crop sales amounted to $79 million in 2022. 
In addition to growing on average 3.8 distinct specialty crops, farmers also diversify their operations with on-farm activities. Nearly 60% of surveyed farms participate in some form of agritourism, which they reported generated $6.6 million in income.
Farmers also increase their sales with value-added products, or products that have been processed in some way, like canned vegetables or wine. The survey results show edible specialty crop farms sold an estimated $11.3 million in value-added products in 2023. 
Naig said he believes the Iowa edible specialty crop industry will continue to grow, especially with the expansion of the department’s marketing service, Choose Iowa. Naig said these farmers also help connect Iowans to their food sources. 
“With the continued expansion of the Choose Iowa program, I believe this sector is well-positioned for even greater growth in the years ahead,” Naig said. “Horticulture food crops bring opportunities not just for established farms but also for beginning farmers who are shaping the future of our industry.” 
Honey, peppers, apples, tomatoes and lettuce were the top edible specialty crops grown in Iowa. According to survey results, the number of honey producers in the state has “dramatically increased” as there were fewer than 200 producers in 1997 and there were 1,229 in 2022. 
The other top crops had between 400 and 550 producers each in 2022. Producers who sold through Community Supported Agriculture programs or at farmers markets were more likely to grow a higher variety of crops. 
According to the release from IDALS, the report, which was produced primarily by the department and staff from Iowa State University Extension and Outreach, will help lawmakers and department leaders to “better support specialty crop farmers and help them overcome challenges, seize new opportunities, and sustain growth.”

For many of those boys, that magical summer planted seeds of determination, commitment, and resilience – qualities that have served them well long after the cheers faded.
The experience, as members of the ’89 team recently recalled, transcended baseball, Trumbull, and the key lessons of sport. Ken Martin, now a successful business owner nationwide, recalled how quickly 12-year-olds had to grow up when suddenly faced with media attention, community expectations, and national visibility. Jason Hairston remembered the “crash course” in maturity, knowing how to act around presidents, professional athletes, and TV cameras.
Fast-forward 35 years, and while the core lessons of teamwork, perseverance, and hard work remain timeless, the context is dramatically different. ​​​​Today’s young athletes grow up under a brighter spotlight – offering greater opportunity, but also greater exposure and pressure. They now look ahead to a collegiate landscape where student-athletes are not only praised but also paid. and the ripple effects of that shift are cascading downward to younger and younger levels of play.
Consider last year’s LLWS champions from Lake Mary, Florida. After Disney World celebrations, major league first pitches, and hometown parades, they returned to middle school, but their visibility didn’t end there. It extended online, where likes, followers, and viral moments can create a brand before a child is even a teenager. One player has more than 3,000 Instagram followers, and the team account drew thousands more.
The new reality for parents and athletes
This new reality has only intensified since the NCAA’s 2021 adoption of its name, image and likeness policy (NIL) and the 2025 NCAA v. House settlement. College athletics has become a marketplace not just of performance, but of marketability. Opportunities once reserved for professionals now extend to college and even high school athletes, with the pressure filtering further down. Parents of young athletes are left asking: What if my child is next? How do we safeguard their growth amid this commercial rush?
I remain a strong believer that youth sports should be about fun, development, and community. But families also cannot ignore the evolving pressures of a system where money, branding, and influence play an increasingly central role in shaping an athlete’s future.
Considerations for student-athletes pursuing high school or college athletics:
Know your rights. The rules of NIL are shifting and unsettled (and hopefully will be in a more stable place by the time today’s young athletes reach college). Institutions and conferences are often driven by power and profit, so it’s important to understand and protect your rights as an athlete.
Beware eligibility risks. For athletes and parents of athletes entering high school, beware of eligibility risks. High school and college athletic associations may impose penalties if an athlete accepts compensation that violates their rules. What looks like a small deal today could jeopardize scholarship opportunities tomorrow. 
The landscape is especially confusing as rules continue to shift. Just recently, the NCAA proposed that incoming Division I athletes report all NIL deals dating back to their junior year of high school or junior college through NIL Go, despite existing state laws and high school association regulations.
Uneven playing field. The current structure favors high-revenue sports. Dominant sports capture most money and exposure; women’s and non-revenue sports face uncertain paths. Families in women’s and non-revenue sports must be especially proactive in protecting and planning for their athlete’s path. For women athletes, knowing what protections Title IX provides is critical. 
Protect the whole athlete. Financial education, mental health support, and legal guidance are vital early. Building this ecosystem helps young athletes manage pressures and real-world challenges that come with visibility and money.
Above all, remind young athletes that passion for the game, love of competition, and commitment to teamwork are the foundations for lasting success. The commercial elements can be navigated without losing sight of these core values.
Fairfield’s magical run will always belong to them, their teammates, and their community. But their story also highlights a new reality: talent and opportunity arrive earlier than ever, and families must be ready to balance that promise with protection.

Kim Reynolds signed an executive order Wednesday requiring state government departments to verify immigration and citizenship status through the federal E-Verify and SAVE systems when granting occupational and professional licenses.
The executive order comes following the U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement arrest Sept. 26 of former Des Moines Public Schools Superintendent Ian Roberts, who had been given an order of removal by an immigration judge in May 2024. DMPS officials said Roberts completed the the I-9 employment eligibility verification form and submitted other required documentation confirming his ability to legally work in the U.S. when he was hired in 2023.
But the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, responding to a request for more information on the Roberts’ case from U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley, said Roberts’ immigration status would have been flagged if DMPS had used E-Verify, the federal web-based system checking job applicants’ ability to work legally in the U.S. using federal documentation. The school district had never been enrolled in the E-Verify system, according to DHS.

Reynolds’ Wednesday order requires all state government departments to use E-Verify, as well as the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements database, known as SAVE, to verify the employment eligibility of people seeking to become state employees, as well as for applicants seeking state-issued occupational and professional licenses.
Roberts was granted an administrator license by the Iowa Board of Educational Examiners in July 2023, which was revoked in September following his arrest.
“While it’s the responsibility of employers to ensure those they hire are eligible to work in the United States, in light of recent events with the former superintendent of Des Moines Public Schools, I am issuing Executive Order 15, putting safeguards in place that will verify the legal immigration or citizenship status for anyone requesting a state-issued professional license before they provide services for Iowans or are entrusted with the health, safety or education of our communities,” Reynolds said in a statement. “Additionally, as an employer, the state takes seriously its responsibility to verify work eligibility. While some agencies voluntarily use E-Verify as part of the hiring process, my executive action now makes it a requirement.”
The executive order requires each state agency, as well as the Board of Regents, to use use E-Verify to confirm the employment eligibility of newly hired employees, in addition to requiring state agencies to verify the U.S. citizenship and immigration status of people who apply for professional licenses from the state.
The order also establishes a “SAVE Program Clearinghouse” in order to access the SAVE database and establish legal authority to verify citizenship and immigration status. The SAVE database is also what the Iowa Secretary of State’s office has accessed to confirm the citizenship status of people registered to vote in Iowa.
While Reynolds’ order applies to state agencies and the licensing process, state lawmakers may consider adding E-Verify requirements for other employers in the 2026 legislative session. Senate Majority Leader Mike Klimesh said in a statement Tuesday that he expects “E-Verify and other issues to address illegal immigration will continue to be a topic of conversation amongst Senate Republicans over the coming weeks and months heading into the legislative session.”
In recent years, Senate Republicans have passed legislation requiring employers use E-Verify and prohibiting businesses from knowingly employing an “unauthorized alien employee” — measures that have failed to advance in the Iowa House.

Robin Lundstrum, R-Elm Springs, and Sen. Jim Petty, R-Van Buren, conduct the committee's meeting on Friday, Sept. 12, 2025. (Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)The only way lawmakers can restore funds that have been withheld from 43 municipalities is to expunge a vote they took in July to prevent the state treasurer from releasing the money, the attorney general’s office opined this week.
The Legislative Joint Auditing Committee last month directed Arkansas State Treasurer John Thurston to restore so-called turnback funds that had been withheld because the affected towns and cities had failed to file required audits of their water and sewer systems by July 1, 2024.
Arkansas lawmakers agree to return withheld funds to 40 municipalities after two-hour debate

That vote had no legal authority, according to the attorney general’s opinion, issued Monday and authored by Assistant Attorney General William R. Olson. Thurston’s office requested the opinion after the Joint Auditing Committee’s vote in September.
According to the opinion, Act 453 of 2023 requires municipalities to submit water and sewer system audits to the auditing committee within 18 months of the end of the audit’s fiscal year. If those audits are not submitted, the committee may — but is not required to — direct the state treasurer to withhold turnback funds until the reports are submitted.
However, once the treasurer is directed to withhold the funds, it is required to do so, and it can only release them if it receives notice from Joint Auditing that “a municipality has submitted all applicable reports concerning water and sewer systems,” according to the opinion.
When the committee voted last month to return the funds, it was with the requirement that each municipality submit the missing audits by Dec. 31 or provide a letter from a certified public accountant that the audit would be submitted by that date.
“An engagement letter from a municipality promising to complete an audit and submit reports in the future does not satisfy the statutory condition for the release of funds,” the AG’s opinion said.
However, Olson said that if the committee expunged the initial vote to withhold the funds, then the “expunged notice would be treated as though it were never sent.”
“It is my opinion that a successful motion to expunge would authorize the Treasurer to release the withheld funds from the date of the July 2025 notices to the date of expungement because it is as if the original notice never existed,” Olson wrote.
Last month, Sen. Dave Wallace, R-Leachville and sponsor of Act 453, proposed restoring the funds with a grace period, arguing that the loss of the funds would harm small towns without the resources to get the audits done. Some lawmakers raised concerns that the vote was not legal.
“If we can’t come down here and make decisions that affect our state, we might as well go ahead and stay home and play dominoes,” Wallace said at the time.
Local governments receive two types of “turnback funds” from the state. General revenue turnback funds support basic local services such as emergency response. Turnback funds from state highway revenue go to municipalities and are required to be spent on maintaining roads that are continuations of state highways or former state highways.
Committee Co-Chair Rep. Robin Lundstrum, R-Elm Springs, said she did not believe lawmakers could expunge the vote this week during Legislative Joint Auditing’s monthly meeting because it wasn’t on the agenda. However, she said she was meeting with the House parliamentarian on Thursday to determine next steps and how an expungement vote might be done.
“This is completely new territory,” Lundstrum said in an interview. “Audit is considered Switzerland — it’s neutral, it’s not political, it’s not anything but numbers. It’s kind of the cold, hard facts type of deal. This is uncharted territory, it’s never been done. So we have to be real careful about what we’re doing.”

(Photo: Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)UNC Chapel Hill professor Dwayne Dixon returned to campus Wednesday to teach his first class after a suspension for alleged ties to an anti-racist, anti-fascist group was lifted last week.
In a news conference on campus, Dixon condemned the university’s actions as “glaring violations on my constitutional rights,” criticizing UNC Chancellor Lee Roberts for placing him on leave and barring him from university grounds.
“Chancellor Roberts, rather than pausing to reflect, think deeply — all the things we want our students to do in classrooms — was easily led through the nose through foolish online conjecture and inference into a very regrettable, embarrassing decision,” he said. “The actions by the chancellor against me reveal again just how imperiled our right to free and unfettered speech is.”

A spokesperson for the university declined to comment on Dixon’s remarks or on the remarks of others who spoke at the event.
Dixon’s suspension came after Fox News published a story alleging he was a member of a group related to another organization that posted fliers on Georgetown University’s campus making light of the death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. That story prompted a Turning Point USA spokesperson to demand Dixon be “immediately fired.”
He was reinstated five days later after student and faculty protests, petitions, and a letter threatening legal action from the ACLU of North Carolina. A UNC spokesperson wrote that a threat assessment “found no basis to conclude that he poses a threat to University students, staff, and faculty, or has engaged in conduct that violates University policy.”
Roberts said in a faculty council meeting on Friday that he was also motivated by a 2018 video of Dixon that came to his attention over the weekend where he was “loading a semiautomatic weapon and then firing that weapon” while “talking about the need for confrontation.”
A former member of Redneck Revolt, an anti-fascist “community defense formation” that encouraged bearing arms for self-defense, Dixon was arrested in 2017 for bringing a rifle to an anti-Ku Klux Klan rally in Durham. The charges were dismissed, as was a 2018 assault charge from a protest where UNC’s confederate statue was taken down.
“What I’m doing in that video is something that millions of Americans do every day, which is plinking targets, plinking cans, right?” Dixon said Wednesday. “The use of my Second Amendment [rights] is hardly reason or justification for such a severe draconian action on his part.”
Dixon added that at the Durham protest, he carried his rifle at “the very early stages” of the protest to deter violence in case KKK members showed up for a confrontation. “Once there was enough people to ensure wider safety, I unloaded and put away my rifle.”
Dixon and his supporters warned Wednesday that his swift removal from the campus is part of a larger troubling crackdown on speech on university campuses.

“This is not an isolated incident, but a pattern of misconduct by our administration,” said Pragya Upreti, a public policy student who helps lead TransparUNCy, a student accountability initiative. “We have watched the administration relentlessly intimidate faculty, students, surveil classrooms, monitor syllabi and emails and brutally crack down on student protest.”
Cultural studies professor Michael Palm, president of the UNC Chapel Hill chapter of the American Association of University Professors, praised student groups and civil rights organizations that stood up for Dixon for “fighting to retain our basic rights to free speech, to free assembly, and to academic freedom.”
“All of these groups have also been working to keep nonresident students, faculty, and staff safe and to ensure their same rights in the face of ICE raids on campus and the threat of being deported for speaking in support of Palestinians,” Palm said. “All UNC administrators have said is that they’ll follow the law.”
Dan Siegel, deputy legal director of the NC ACLU, said the tactics used against Dixon are the same that have deprived students demonstrating against the war in Gaza of their rights.
“Last year, right here in Polk Place, there was a peaceful demonstration where people were demonstrating about the war in Gaza. In response, the university indefinitely banned many of these peaceful demonstrators,” he said. “Even though the university has never even suggested they posed some kind of threat to campus safety, they remain banned today.”
Dixon made the same comparison, concluding his remarks by exclaiming, “Free Palestine!” He said that right now, it just feels “amazing” to be back in the classroom.
“I’m so excited to see them. I’ve graded a bunch of papers that I wasn’t able to access last week, so I feel finally caught up on work, and we have really important things to cover this week in both of my classes,” he said. “I’m just going to be overjoyed to see them.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Dwayne-Dixon-News-Conference-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-08 19:58:18.006526

Research shows that the large felines are resilient to human disturbance and return to finish off carcasses.
The post What happens when you come upon a feasting mountain lion? A Wyoming study tells the story. appeared first on WyoFile .","Justin Clapp’s introspection about his own impact on mountain lions is partly what sparked a scientific examination of how the big cats respond to being bumped off carcasses mid-feast.
The Wyoming Game and Fish Department’s large carnivore biologist, along with colleagues and fellow researchers, repeatedly displaced feeding cats — 26 individual research animals — while trying to answer questions about how, or if, lions selectively prey upon vulnerable, chronic wasting disease-stricken ungulates in the Laramie Mountains. 
“From an ethical standpoint, when we collar animals, we are asking a lot of them,” said Clapp, who’s also a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Wyoming. “We don’t take that lightly. We recognized that, if we were going to get to kill sites quick enough to get a CWD sample, then we were probably going to be at a lot of these sites while those animals are still feeding.” 
Those inevitable displacements could have cascading effects. Perhaps lions, once bumped off carcasses, moved on to kill their next meal quicker, which in turn could theoretically impact prey species like elk and mule deer. 
But Wyoming researchers tracking 16 toms and 10 adult females from 2019 to 2023 discovered just the opposite. Clapp, along with Wyoming Game and Fish’s Justin Binfet, Idaho Fish and Game’s Cade Bowlin and University of Wyoming ecologist Joe Holbrook, recently published their findings in a peer-reviewed study. Its title hints at the results: “Large carnivore feeding is resilient to human disturbance.” 
“We really did not see carcass abandonment,” Holbrook said. “And even more interesting, as a lion experienced [more] encounters with humans, the probability of them returning back to the carcass increased. So there was some evidence of habituation and learning.”

The kill rates of feeding mountain lions actually decreased, the researchers found, because the displacements extended their time at any one carcass. 
By and large, the findings buck conventional scientific thinking. Humans have long been regarded as “superpredators,” and people, primarily houndsmen, pose a lethal risk to the cats in a state where they’re heavily hunted. And so it wouldn’t have been especially surprising if lions were easily disturbed and abandoned carcasses when confronted by teams of biologists.
Mountain lions, to be clear, did move off of their venison meals. 
“We did not encounter one instance of cats defending the carcass,” Clapp said. The only behavior that could be categorized as aggression was encountered when the biologists went to examine a cluster of GPS points that was suspected to be a carcass, but instead ended up being a den full of kittens. 
This study area map shows field investigations of mountain lion feeding sites that resulted in human disturbance (red) and undisturbed feeding events (black) in central Wyoming between 2019−2023. (Proc. R. Soc.)
Over the course of the study, biologists and technicians identified feeding activity at 745 sites. Clapp, Holbrook and the other researchers parsed the data in a way that identified 106 instances of human disturbance. 
Of those, 25% of the time there were “direct encounters,” when the scientists either saw or heard the cats. The remainder were identified via GPS data and were labeled “proximity encounters.” 
Disturbed cats did flee and leave the area more than 70% of the time, the research showed. But 72% of the time, those cats returned. In total, lions either never left the immediate area or returned to their kill site after a disturbance 80% of the time. On average, they moved off by two-thirds of a mile, and they were gone for about 13 hours. 
The data amassed in the Laramie Mountains also showed just how quickly disturbed cats smartened up. Every time they got bumped off a carcass, there was a corresponding 22% increase in the odds that the mountain lion returned. 
Clapp emphasized that the study results are not intended to downplay the effect that human activity can have on mountain lions, or any species. But the findings exemplify the impressive resilience and intelligence of apex predator species like mountain lions, he said. 
“We need to make sure that we’re giving them credit for their adaptability and for the way that they can continue to persist, reoccupy, expand, despite the things that humans do,” Clapp said. “While I’m not saying that human disruption is good for any type of wildlife, we need to make sure that we’re acknowledging the fact that these animals are pretty incredible and they’re very smart.”

They want another day in court.,"Gun owners last month lost their constitutional challenge of a New Jersey law banning guns in sensitive places. They want another day in court. (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)Gun owners who last month lost their fight to topple a 2022 state law banning guns in sensitive places are asking the full 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals to hear the case again, saying a three-judge appellate panel erred in upholding carry restrictions on “nearly every inch of public space in New Jersey.”
Attorneys representing Ronald Koons, Aaron Siegel, and other unnamed gun owners argued Wednesday that the panel’s Sept. 10 precedential split decision conflicts with a 2022 U.S. Supreme Court decision that declared gun carry a constitutional right. In a ruling known as Bruen, the nation’s top court barred states from requiring carry permit applicants to prove a need to take their gun outside their home or business.
“By the (3rd Circuit) panel’s admission, the issues this case presents carry ‘immense public importance.’ Yet the panel got several of these exceptionally important issues exceptionally wrong,” the attorneys wrote.
They added: “The panel opinion transforms a fundamental constitutional right into a mere privilege that states can withhold at will.”
Bruen required policymakers to root any gun restrictions in the history and tradition that existed when the nation’s forefathers drafted the Second Amendment, the attorneys noted. In their petition, they quote liberally from a fiery dissent penned by Judge David J. Porter, a Trump appointee who accused the other two jurists on his panel — both appointed by Democrats — of various errors and an “anachronistic disdain for public carry.”
“The panel here refused to treat ‘the Second Amendment’s meaning as fixed at the Founding or at the Fourteenth Amendment’s ratification,’ and instead relied on ‘late-blooming regulations unconnected to early-American tradition,’” the attorneys wrote, citing Porter’s dissent.
Spokespeople for the state attorney general’s office, which has fought to uphold the law, did not respond to a request for comment.
The majority decision by Judges Cheryl Ann Krause and Cindy K. Chung was “premised on the assumption that bearing arms for self-defense is a public nuisance rather than a constitutional right,” the attorneys argued.
The ruling allows states to violate people’s right to bear arms in public for self-defense by banning guns at parks, beaches, playgrounds, zoos, casinos, public transit, healthcare facilities, public film sets, youth sports events, public libraries and museums, concert arenas and other entertainment facilities, bars and restaurants that serve alcohol, and other public gathering places, they wrote.
“The panel’s decision rubber-stamping New Jersey’s effort to deem nearly everything a ‘sensitive place’ renders Bruen a dead letter,” they wrote.
They added: “The issues at stake are far too important to let that decision be the last word on the constitutionality of New Jersey’s outlier regime.”
Beyond the ban on guns in sensitive places, the gun owners’ attorneys also disputed the constitutionality of the law’s requirement — which Krause and Chung let stand — that carry applicants get four “reputable,” non-family people to vouch for them.
“Bruen was emphatic: ‘[G]ranting licensing officials discretion to deny licenses based on a perceived lack of need or suitability’ violates the Second Amendment,” the attorneys wrote.
If the full court agrees to rehear the case, both sides will present their arguments in Philadelphia to a cadre of 23 appellate judges, 13 of whom were appointed by Republican presidents and 10, by Democratic presidents.

(Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)The gambling company that exclusively supplies the state’s lottery equipment and technology confirmed it was hit with a data breach last year that exposed the personal information of over 6,300 Rhode Islanders.
Brightstar Lottery Group, formerly International Game Technology (IGT) PLC, alerted Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha via a letter on Oct. 3 that “an unauthorized third party” gained access to parts of its internal corporate system on Nov. 17, 2024.
Upon discovery of the breach, the company “took immediate action” to secure its internal systems and investigate the depth of the impact, wrote Associate General Counsel Macaire Piscione
Brightstar’s review concluded on Aug. 21 and found 103,879 people were impacted — including 6,354 Rhode Island residents. The company’s website notes that it serves “over 90 global customers in more than 100 jurisdictions” including licensing agreements in Connecticut and Maine.
Under state law, a data breach must be reported no later than 45 calendar days after its confirmation. If at least 500 people are impacted, the attorney general’s office must be notified.
Information that was available through the Brightstar systems that were accessed included names, contact information, dates of birth, drivers licenses, Social Security numbers, and financial account details.
Most of those affected by the breach were current and former employees, Brightstar spokesperson Mike DeAngelis said in an email to Rhode Island Current Wednesday. He added that the company is not aware of any misuse of personal information.
“The privacy and security of personal information is of utmost importance to us,” he said in the emailed statement.
As a precaution, he said Brighstar is offering anyone impacted by the breach 24 months of credit monitoring, fraud detection, or dark web monitoring. Anyone affected will receive a written notice from the company.
The company rebranded its global lottery division to Brightstar in June as part of its July 2024 acquisition by New York-based Apollo Global Management Inc. to gain IGT’s name, slot machine, digital gaming and sports betting operations while taking them private. 
IGT in 2021 had signed a 20-year agreement to supply the state’s lottery and scratch tickets, video lottery and slot machine technology. Brightstar, the publicly-traded lottery company that remains, continues to fulfill its obligations to the Rhode Island Lottery.
The Rhode Island Lottery did not immediately respond to request for comment.

(Photo by Lori Kersey/West Virginia Watch)Beckley, W.Va. — A judge overseeing two consolidated lawsuits in a legal battle over West Virginia’s school vaccine law and religious freedom will consider every family that has asked for a nonmedical exemption to the law together as a party to the lawsuit, and he expects to issue a statewide ruling, he said Wednesday. 
Raleigh County Circuit Judge Michael Froble granted a motion certifying class action in the case of Miranda Guzman and other Raleigh County families suing the West Virginia and Raleigh County boards of education to make them recognize religious exemptions to the shots. 
Ruling from the bench Wednesday, Froble said he believes the case before him is about the state Board of Education’s uniform policy not to accept nonmedical exemptions.
“One of the issues, I guess, to address is the parties have argued back and forth as to whether this court can do anything outside of Raleigh County, and the court believes it can and will, depending upon the evidence in the case,” Froble said. “It does have the jurisdiction to issue a statewide injunction and or declaratory judgment against the state Board of Education.”
Froble ruled in July that students who are party to the case may attend school with a religious exemption. That ruling applied only to those students. Wednesday’s hearing was a continuation of a hearing on permanent injunction the court began in September. 
A state health official testified Wednesday that the health department has fielded about 575 requests for nonmedical exemptions to the vaccine law, all of which have been approved. 
One of the reasons a class action lawsuit makes sense, the judge said, is to prevent potentially all of those cases being brought individually against school officials all over the state. 
“That would be a nightmare, because, not only the possibility of inconsistent decisions, but it’d be difficult, because the plaintiffs in a lot of these cases would have to probably go pro se,” he said. “[They w]ould not have the benefit of counsel, even though the [Equal Protection for Religion Act] does allow awarding of attorney fees.”
Froble further ruled that everyone who has asked the state for a religious, philosophical or conscientious objection exemption to the state’s vaccination requirements should be considered parties to the case. There should be no difference between religious and philosophical exemptions, he said. During the September hearing, the judge asked parties to submit briefs on their opinions of how the religious freedom bill should apply to philosophical objections.  
All states require students to be vaccinated against a number of infectious diseases, like measles, chickenpox and polio. West Virginia has been one of only five states in the country that have not allowed nonmedical exemptions to the requirements. 
Gov. Patrick Morrisey seeks to change that. In January he issued an executive order requiring the state to allow religious exemptions. His order is based on a 2023 religious freedom law. Morrisey has not rescinded the order, even though state lawmakers earlier this year voted down a bill that would have inscribed the exemption in law. 
The state board of education earlier this year directed county boards not to accept nonmedical exemptions. 
During testimony Wednesday, state Board of Education President Paul Hardesty told the court, among other things, the state’s Equal Protection for Religion Act is not part of the laws that govern schools in the state. 
It also heard from state epidemiologist Shannon McBee. McBee said she and her staff developed the nonmedical exemption procedures following Morrisey’s executive order in January. 
McBee said that though the state’s religious freedom law was passed in 2023, the health department did not establish a process for nonmedical exemptions prior to Morrisey’s executive order because “the government has a compelling interest in public health.”
McBee acknowledged that other states and branches of the military have mechanisms to determine if a person seeking a religious exemption has sincerely held religious beliefs. With the governor’s guidance, she said, the state department did not include such a mechanism. The families just have to attest to having a religious objection to vaccines.
The Guzman lawsuit has also been consolidated with one filed against the state health department by two families with school children at higher risk of complications caused by vaccine-preventable illnesses. Plaintiffs in that case are represented by the American Civil Liberties Union of West Virginia and Mountain State Justice. 
The hearing is expected to continue Thursday in Beckley with testimony from Dr. Mark McDaniel, the state’s acting health officer.

For more […],"A spring 2020 view of a sinkhole in Black Hawk that opened near homes built atop a former gypsum mine. (Courtesy of Dan Austin)Landowners forced from their homes five years ago by a sinkhole asked the South Dakota Supreme Court on Wednesday to hold the state accountable.
The Hideaway Hills development in Black Hawk was built atop a former gypsum mine first used more than a century ago on the eastern edge of the Black Hills. For more than 50 years, that work involved a network of underground tunnels. The mine was dormant until the mid-1980s, when the state purchased it to mine gypsum on the land’s surface for use in a Rapid City cement plant the state owned at the time. 
The state reclaimed about 16 acres of mined land, then reseeded it for use as rangeland before selling it in 1994. The man who bought it later sold it to the developers who turned it into Hideaway Hills in the early 2000s. The state maintained subsurface mineral rights to the land in the sale.
South Dakota Supreme Court rules against neighbors in now-moot prison site dispute

Homeowners first reported cracking in their homes’ foundations in 2008, about three years after the Meade County development welcomed its first residents. Twelve years later, a sinkhole yawned open near a cluster of homes, forcing evacuations and spawning a lawsuit.
The plaintiffs, representing 164 properties, say the state put them at risk when it failed to properly backfill the land. They also claim the state reopened tunnels in search of more gypsum, a claim the state denies.
A lower court ruled against the families. The judge agreed with the state, which argued it has immunity from “tort” lawsuits that seek to assign liability and collect monetary damages.
The landowners appealed to the state Supreme Court. They say their claim is not a “tort,” but is rather about a “taking” of their land that was akin to eminent domain. Their “inverse condemnation” claim says the state robbed them of their full property rights by failing to backfill the mine correctly and using the mined material in a cement plant whose proceeds were used for a public purpose. 
Proceeds from the 2001 sale of the cement plant were used to establish a trust whose returns now help fund state government.
Landowners: State stole property rights
Arguments in the case took place Wednesday morning at the University of South Dakota Knudson School of Law in Vermillion.
High court rules in favor of victim, but says Marsy’s Law is not absolute

Matthew Hughes, one of the landowners’ lawyers, said the state had a duty to reclaim and backfill its mined areas with material that would hold up as time passed, rather than with gypsum. That material sank in over time, he said.
“That backfill is under every place that the state mined,” Hughes said, and “all the problems” the homeowners have are related to the reclamation. 
What the homebuilders or real estate agents may or may not have said to homebuyers about the land is immaterial, he argued, because “the sole cause of the subsidence and the collapse is the state’s use of problematic backfill.”
Because the surface land was sold in the public interest, he said, and because the state retained the mining rights to the area beneath it, the state owes the homeowners for their losses.
“That reclamation was undertaken for the purpose of selling the surface for money,” Hughes said.
State: Buyer responsible for issues
Terra Larson, an attorney representing the state, disputed that the state’s actions caused the sinkhole to appear. But she also said it doesn’t matter. 
The landowners have a tort claim, she said, and the state’s immune to those. 
The claim of “taking” by inverse condemnation doesn’t fit, she said. The state constitution says that private land can’t be taken for a public purpose without “just compensation.”
No one took land from the current landowners without just compensation, Larson said. 
“All of the damage that occurred here occurred when the state owned this property,” Larson said, referring to the reclamation. 
“Then, when it sold that property, it sold it for approximately $50,000 less than it had purchased the property for, to people who absolutely knew that the state had mined it for gypsum,” Larson said.
Justice Mark Salter wanted to know about the “contemporaneous” aspect of the landowners’ claim. Does the state have a duty to landowners because it kept the mineral rights to the area below the surface?
“There’s a present day resonance to this,” Salter said.
The land’s 1994 buyers knew about the underground tunnels, Larson said, and the agents who later sold the land “fraudulently concealed” the issue. When a new owner discovers a danger on a property and doesn’t disclose it, Larson said, “the responsibility has shifted to that third party” for lawsuits by subsequent property owners.
Matthew Leerberg, another attorney for the homeowners, said in his rebuttal the state can’t both maintain the right to mine the land far beneath the homes and escape its responsibility to those who built them.
“At some point, hopefully we will be before a jury, and we will get to show that these clients are suffering, that they can’t live in their homes anymore, and that it’s the state’s actions, both in the past and the present, that have caused that,” Leerberg said. 
The court will issue a ruling on the Hideaway Hills case at a later date.

If his nomination is confirmed by the U.S. Senate, Hewes would join the commission’s acting chairman, Peter Feldman, who’s currently the lone member of the commission after Trump removed three commissioners appointed during the Joe Biden administration and a fourth commissioner, Republican-appointed, resigned.
The commission is a regulatory agency created by Congress in 1972 “to protect the public against unreasonable risks of injuries and deaths associated with consumer products.” It has jurisdiction over thousands of consumer products “from coffee makers to toys to lawn mowers,” according to its website, although it does not have authority over automobiles, foods, drugs and cosmetics.
Hewes’ nomination came as a surprise to some Washington observers, as Trump in his fiscal 2026 budget proposal had called for eliminating the commission and placing its functions under the Department of Health and Human Services. The proposal called for one person serving as an assistant secretary for consumer product safety. This would require congressional action, but Trump’s firing of three commissioners and the resignation of Republican Douglas Dziak appeared to be a move toward elimination or consolidation without congressional action.
In July, the U.S. Supreme Court stayed the reinstatement of the fired Democratic commissioners pending lower court litigation.
If his nomination is approved, Hewes would serve a term through 2031. It remains unclear how the commission would operate without a quorum of three. By statute, the commission can have up to five members, appointed by the president and subject to Senate approval for seven-year terms, with no more than three being of the same political party.
Hewes, in a text message responding to a request for comment on Wednesday, said he was on an airplane and could not immediately talk.
Hewes is a longtime Gulfport real estate and insurance business owner and a songwriter and musician whose songs have appeared in movie soundtracks. He was first elected to the state Senate in 1992 and served until 2012, reaching the second-highest leadership spot in the chamber as president pro tempore in 2008. He ran unsuccessfully for lieutenant governor in 2011, losing the Republican primary to now-Gov. Tate Reeves.
Hewes was elected Gulfport mayor and served from 2013 to June of 2025, declining to seek another term.

(Photo by Ariana Figueroa/States Newsroom)The federal government will seek to exempt itself from more than two dozen federal laws in an effort to build border barriers faster along more than 100 miles of New Mexico’s border with Mexico.
In a Wednesday announcement published in the Federal Register, Department of Homeland Security Director Kristi Noem said the effort to build between Sunland Park to the eastern edge of the state’s bootheel, near Antelope Wells is in effect as of Oct. 8.
“There is presently an acute and immediate need to construct additional physical barriers and roads in the vicinity of the border of the United States in order to prevent unlawful entries,” the order stated.
The order further waives requirements for the construction to follow 27 federal laws, including the Endangered Species Act, Clean Water Act and National Environmental Policy Act. This is similar to other waivers to speed up border wall construction projects in Arizona and New Mexico, including Mount Cristo Rey.
Noem recently visited the border at Santa Teresa to deliver news that the administration would paint the barriers black to burn people’s skin and deter crossing. At that event, officials noted that border crossings were down 98% from a high in 2023 of 2,400 people crossing the border to only an average of 39 people apprehended crossing the border region in 2025.
In a statement provided to Source NM, U.S. Rep. Gabe Vasquez (D-NM) whose district encompasses the state’s southern border, called “securing our border” a top priority. However, he said, “as [Defense] Secretary [Pete] Hegseth acknowledged when I questioned him at a recent committee hearing, a wall simply doesn’t make sense or promote public safety in every case. In those areas, I support utilizing technology like towers, sensors, and aerial systems that are better for the natural environment, wildlife corridors, and public land access; are a better use of taxpayer dollars; and are better for our national security.”
Advocates: Mount Cristo Rey wall will worsen migrant deaths, erosion, habitat loss

Environmental groups said the order would devastate fragile ecosystems, fragment habitat and cut the public out from the process.
Laiken Jordahl, Southwest conservation advocate based in Tucson at the Center for Biological Diversity, told Source NM that for bighorn sheep, cougars and other animals living in the area the habitat fragmentation will be “devestating.”
“I mean, basically, they could show up tomorrow with bulldozers and break ground without consulting any wildlife experts, historical experts, or any of the tribes that have resources in these areas,’ he said. “The waiver gives them just an unbelievable amount of power to inflict as much damage as possible as zero accountability.”

Monte Shaw, the executive director of Iowa Renewable Fuels Association, said now that Nebraska has a functioning CO2 pipeline, ethanol plants in the state can take advantage of lucrative tax credits from the federal government and sell into the ultra-low carbon ethanol market. 
“Iowa has worn the crown,” Shaw said at a new conference Wednesday. “We have been the world’s best place to turn corn into ethanol, and we’ve held that crown for 25 years. Last week, we got knocked off.”

Trailblazer and 45z 
Tallgrass’ Trailblazer pipeline, which is slated to stretch several hundred miles and transport CO2 from ethanol plants in Nebraska, Colorado and Wyoming to an underground storage site in Wyoming, had its first CO2 shipment Oct. 3. 
The Trailblazer pipeline formerly carried natural gas, but the company was able to convert the pipeline to instead sequester liquified carbon dioxide. By sequestering the carbon dioxide created in the process of turning corn into ethanol, the plants are able to lower the “lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions” of the fuel below a certain level, set by the U.S. Department of Energy, that makes the fuel eligible for a per-gallon tax credit. 
These credits, known as 45z, were initiated under the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act. While the IRA was mostly dismantled by the Trump administration, 45z credits were extended under the Republican led tax cut law, known as the “one big beautiful bill.” 
Shaw said the credits can add about 66 cents per gallon of ethanol, which is a lot for an industry that “usually tries to make a penny or two.” 
Impacts to Iowa
According to IRFA, Iowa produces about 4.7 billion gallons of ethanol annually. Shaw said if each of those gallons could take advantage of the credits and add 66 cents per gallon, it would equate to more than $3 billion in added value to the industry annually.

“If Iowa wants to maintain low taxes, if we want to do further property tax reform and things of that nature, then the state needs a strong ag economy,” Shaw said. “Ethanol producers need access to the tools in this state to remain competitive with the plants around us that are moving forward.” 
Steve Kuiper, vice president of Iowa Corn Growers Association, said the boost to Iowa ethanol would directly impact corn farmers by increasing demand and potential price for corn, but would also “trickle down” to the state’s economy. 
Farmers have faced several years in a row of high interest rates, high input costs, and low market prices for their crops. Trade wars between the U.S. and the countries where it sells ag commodities and purchases inputs have also added stress to farmers. According to a September survey from the National Corn Growers Association, nearly 50% of U.S. farmers believe the nation is on the brink of a farm crisis. 
“The Iowa agriculture economy is in tough shape,” Kuiper said. “Farmers are farming at a loss. Lenders are very, very anxious right now.”
Dave Miller, the chief economist with Decision Innovation Solutions, said as corn yields continue to grow, farmers need a market that accounts for an extra 150 million bushels a year through 2050. 
Miller said the low-carbon ethanol market facilitated by carbon sequestration could create the potential for an additional 12 million gallons of ethanol, which he said could be fulfilled by the current farming yield increases. 
“The Nebraska plants that are on the pipeline, that door has now been opened,” Miller said. “So there’s a real competitive advantage that’s going to open up for Nebraska farmers compared to Iowa farmers.” 
Seth Harder, CEO of two ethanol plants in Nebraska and one in Iowa, said he has seen the things in the industry that Iowa does “really great” but he also sees that the states he operates in are on the edge of a “paradigm shift.”
“As Nebraska sees this influx of funds, we hear plants are talking about not only expanding, but doubling,” Harder said. 
Harder said the demand for ethanol appears to be on the rise with the recent decision from California allowing the sale of a higher blend of ethanol fuel, E-15, and the prospect of more states joining in on the trend. 
Challenges
Shaw said he believes Iowa is on the cusp of a “fairly substantial farm crisis.”
“Nothing will solve this problem until we grow demand or reduce production, and reducing production would be devastating to the economy of Iowa in the Midwest,” he said.
Carbon sequestration projects have faced challenges in Iowa, largely because of landowner opposition to CO2 pipeline projects, including the Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline. Debate on the topic caused splits among GOP lawmakers during the legislative session and has continued to be a divisive issue in the party.
The Trailblazer pipeline had fewer roadblocks than those that have popped up in Iowa. This is in part because Nebraska does not require state approval for CO2 pipelines, and because much of the pipeline was already built as the natural gas line.
Landowners and environmental groups, including the Sierra Club Iowa Chapter, that are opposed to CO2 sequestration pipelines call the Summit project a “boondoggle.” Opponents worry about property values and the safety of carbon sequestration pipelines. They have also said sequestering carbon should not qualify as a public use, which a project must have in order to use eminent domain. 
Shaw said it doesn’t matter what someone thinks about carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and why it should or shouldn’t be sequestered, because for renewable fuel members, this is a “business decision.”
The Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline is the most well known carbon sequestration project in Iowa, but Shaw said there are other companies and facilities looking for places in Iowa to sequester carbon, or to otherwise build carbon sequestration pipelines. 
On the nearest horizon, Southwest Iowa Renewable Energy, or SIRE located near Council Bluffs, is slated to connect to the Trailblazer pipeline and potentially begin sequestering carbon at the plant in late 2026. 
The Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline cannot begin construction in Iowa until it secures permits for storage in North Dakota and for passage through South Dakota, which has become challenging due to the enactment of a restricting law in South Dakota. The company filed to change its permit with the Iowa Utilities Commission to remove the Dakota-specific language, in the event it is able to secure a “​​better solution” for storage and passage. 
Shaw said the “economic consequences” of the development in Nebraska could be a “bump in the road” for Iowa if the state adapts and brings its own carbon sequestration practices online, or it could lead to “production and demand flow from places like Iowa to places like Nebraska.” 
“We’re asking the Iowa Legislature to support President Trump’s energy leadership and to help avert what I personally feel is a pending farm crisis, and to help put Iowa’s economy back on stable ground,” Shaw said.

DemasIn a move that shows the government budget cycle is never truly over, appropriators in the Michigan Senate on Wednesday took their first steps toward instituting the House’s earmark transparency rules into state law.
Members of the Senate Appropriations Committee held a hearing for Senate Bill 596, which would amend Michigan’s Management and Budget Act to set conditions under which earmarks are considered before they are placed in a final budget proposal in either chamber of the Legislature.
The conditions under SB 596 would include the name of the lawmaker introducing the earmark, the total amount requested, the name of the intended recipient and the purpose of the earmark. The request must also include an attestation that no conflict of interest existed between the legislator or the state and the recipient, and that the recipient is not a for-profit entity.
All earmarks in the new regime, if passed, must also not be distributed to a state agency or department, and is only a one-time appropriation in any future budget bill. Any program or request put forward in the governor’s budget recommendations would not qualify for a legislatively directed spending request.
State Sen. Sarah Anthony (D-Lansing), chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee and sponsor of the bill, said the new rules continue Michigan lawmakers’ commitment to open government and responsible budgeting.
“Since taking office in 2023 we have taken some pretty important steps to ensure legislators had to put their name next to each and every earmark that they championed on behalf of their communities, establishing a clear, transparent process for the first time,” Anthony said. “This bill builds upon that good work, ensuring that those commitments are made in the light of day, and building an additional time for public review.”

Creating a process to identify which lawmakers introduced what earmarks, and how much they might cost taxpayers, was a key House Republican priority in the 2025-26 budget fight that just wrapped this week with Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s signing of the spending bills. The House instituted rules this year under Republican control for earmark reform in its chamber, and also built a website to catalogue all earmark requests. The requests were scrutinized before they made the House’s final spending proposal.
Republicans in the lower chamber were adamant that their Senate colleagues do the same before any deal could be negotiated or finalized. The Senate eventually caved, but the disclosure of the Senate’s earmarks did not occur until Thursday, Oct. 2, one day after lawmakers passed a continuation budget because they could not finalize a deal before the beginning of the new fiscal year. 
The Senate Appropriations Committee held a meeting that evening where it finally detailed all of its earmarks and what would appear in the budget – a win for Republicans who were pushing for the reforms.
On Wednesday, Anthony opened up the bill to discussion to see what improvements could be made on the Senate’s version, which aimed to slate those rules into state law.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Sen. Rosemary Bayer (D-West Bloomfield) said given the fight the Legislature just went through, one issue she saw in the process occurring on the House side dealt with the public identification of lawmakers’ requests.
“There were times where legislators were harassed because they didn’t put things on the list, or because they did,” Bayer said. “They had a hard time from folks. Sometimes you need a little protection as you talk to people, when they request things. We get way more requests than we’re ever going to be able to fulfill.”
Bayer added that maybe not publishing everything, except for items that will definitely be in the final budget, was a good idea.
Anthony said that was certainly something to consider.
“I know that in my Senate district, we get lots of local requests. We have a mix of urban, rural, suburban requests,” Anthony said. “And because of the limited state funds that we have, there’s a lot of folks who are disappointed, and oftentimes, they want to see me as their senator fighting for everything. So, I do think it’s a balance, but it’s something that we can contemplate throughout this process.”
State Sen. Mallory McMorrow (D-Royal Oak), said that some early version of the proposed process played out on the final day of the chambers’ budget action, and wanted to know what lawmakers could expect.
Anthony said their colleagues in the House, which jumpstarted the process, and the executive office are all interested in finding out how they can share a more transparent earmarks process with additional rules and conditions, and that the Senate’s version might even include more disclosures in a final version.
“The House may have its own spin, so ideally, we would have a shared set of disclosure that we would all make sure are contemplated and then how we do it, the flavor that the Senate does it versus the House, I think ultimately it’s up to this body,” Anthony said. “But I think the goal stays the same … making sure that the public, the press, anyone who is interested in knowing where their dollars are going, that we’re doing that earlier, and there’s a structured process, and it is accessible to the public.”
The committee did not move the bill forward and will likely be subject to further discussion at a future meeting.

A recently retired, longtime FAA inspector who has worked the Fiesta for 29 years said an ongoing federal government shutdown will likely result in fewer government safety inspectors. (Patrick Lohmann/Source NM)The ongoing federal government shutdown means half the typical number of federal safety inspectors are on the field during the world’s biggest hot air balloon rally taking place in Albuquerque this week, according to a Fiesta spokesperson and a retired federal aviation official. 
James Malarsie retired earlier this year in Albuquerque after nearly 30 years as an inspector for the Federal Aviation Administration, and worked the Fiesta with the FAA every year since 1995. That meant approving balloonist applications, doing equipment spot checks and roaming the launchfield with a team to search for blatant safety violations, among other duties.
He’s experienced several threatened, partial or full shutdowns during his long career, he told Source New Mexico on Wednesday. If this year’s ongoing federal government shutdown is anything like the one in 2013, the FAA will scrap certain tasks like in-depth crash investigations, last-minute pilot certifications and safety inspections outside the launchfield. 
Trump floats plan to deny back pay to furloughed federal workers after shutdown

In years when the federal government is functional, 12 FAA inspectors are on the ground at the Fiesta each day, according to Malarsie and Tom Garrity, a Fiesta spokesperson. Six inspectors are on the ground during the Fiesta this year, Garrity told Source on Wednesday afternoon. 
One typical duty for the inspectors is to divide the launchpad each day into a grid, Malarsie said. Inspectors then claim a square on the grid and fan out to see balloon crews are making safety errors. Some of the hazards FAA inspectors key in on are whether balloons are tethered to trucks during static displays; if a person is safely manning the dangerous inflation fans; and ensuring no one is smoking cigarettes at an event that runs on highly explosive propane. 
“This year, it’s going to be pretty sparsened,” he said of the FAA inspections. “They’re going to look at it as, ‘What is the minimum we can get away with?’”
Still, Malarsie emphasized that Fiesta-goers should be confident about safety this year, despite the shutdown and mass furloughs of federal aviation employees. He said the Fiesta administrators and pilots themselves take safety seriously, and he described the FAA’s role as important but not the first line of defense in keeping the public and passengers safe.

“It’s not like the FAA is the magic component to make it work. We’re like a speed camera on the side of the road. We do our best to catch the flagrant,” he said. “For the most part, the balloonists are willing and able” to keep themselves, their passengers and the public safe. 
The FAA did not respond to Source’s request for comment about the potential impacts of the shutdown on the Fiesta. According to an auto-reply email, administration is unable to respond to news media requests due to the shutdown,  and the FAA office in Albuquerque is unstaffed, according to a pre-recorded voicemail message.
Tom Garrity also told Source the decreased number of inspectors won’t influence  the event’s safety.
The biggest impact of the reduction is on “ramp checks,” Garrity said, which the FAA inspectors and Fiesta officials conduct each year to ensure pilots have the necessary documents to fly, such as safety inspections, federal airworthiness certificates, medical clearances and other necessary approvals.
“If you and I were going to a checkpoint, they would be asking for a driver’s license. Can I see your insurance?” he said. “That would be the equivalent.”
Fiesta officials have all the necessary training to do the checks without the FAA, Garrity said. So he thinks they’re still being conducted sufficiently to ensure pilots are safe to fly.

“Safety is the first and foremost priority for Balloon Fiesta,” he said. 
Because the Fiesta occurs each year in early October, it sometimes coincides with threatened or real shutdowns, Malarsie said. The federal fiscal year begins Oct. 1 and carries a deadline for Congress to pass a spending package to fund the government.
In 2013, the last time the government fully shut down in October, no FAA inspectors were on the field, he said. While Malarsie recalls that the event went off without a hitch, he said the federal Transportation Department in subsequent years developed a better plan to ensure the most vital FAA functions remain unaltered if a shutdown and the Fiesta coincide. 
“As time progressed and the agency got more used to dealing with the politics of a shutdown, it kind of made a determination of what was ‘essential,’” he said. 
That means, in 2025, a “small cadre of inspectors” flew in from another FAA field offices, likely from Lubbock, Texas, he said, based on a recent conversation with a current FAA official. They’re here to shore up a short-staffed local field office and will be dedicated solely to “safety oversight.”
“All they’re doing is direct surveillance of the event,” he said. 
Also, in typical years, the FAA is sometimes the first on the scene to investigate hot air balloon crashes, because the National Transportation Safety Board delegates some investigatory steps to the FAA. But during other shutdowns, Malarsie recalls investigations being delayed because the FAA could not immediately start examining the causes of crashes. 
Two hot air balloons have struck powerlines during the Fiesta this year, according to media reports, though no one was injured. 
Malarsie abruptly retired early this year just shy of his 30th Fiesta, he said, due to a conflict over whether he’d be granted time to go on a “once-in-a-lifetime” oryx hunt in White Sands. But he said he misses being at what would have been his 30th Fiesta. He’s quoted in an FAA article about the Fiesta last year:

(Photo by Dana Wormald/New Hampshire Bulletin)If we were a village of 100 instead of a nation of 340 million, I wonder if the perceptions would be different.
Would there be wide support for a village economy in which one person (or 1%) possessed more resources and materials than the 50 villagers with the least, combined?
Would it seem fair that 10 “elite” villagers, living high on their hill, held two-thirds of all of the village’s wealth — the total stores of food, building materials, textiles, etc. — while the other 90 battled and scraped among each other for the remaining third?
Would it make any sense that a majority of those lower 90, rather than questioning why the 10 at the top had so much, instead became angry that the 10 at the bottom were asking for anything at all?
What would we make of a village council chosen to serve the best interests of all 100 but whose members consistently, albeit quietly, made decisions favoring the 10 at the top because that is who paid their way?
And, would we be skeptical of the motivations of the nine elites and one super-elite, and the village council they bought, if they made it clear that they would rather watch the village destroy itself than allow even a little bit more to be provided for the many?
In our village of New Hampshire, the biggest challenge we face is not whatever the current ruling party targets as “woke” on a given day. It is our system for funding public education, which is too reliant on property taxes. Because neither Democrats nor Republicans have done anything to fix the actual problem, all that’s left politically is to engage in skirmishes around the periphery of that fundamental problem.
So instead of solutions we get: Teachers are overpaid. There’s administrative bloat. Vouchers will solve everything. They’re brainwashing our kids. There’s smut in the libraries. On and on, as if any of it went within a million miles of the heart of the matter.
New Hampshire needs an income tax in which 100% of the revenue it collects is dedicated to educating our kids and providing universal child care, with a correlating reduction in property taxes. Not a heavier tax burden, but a different one. A fairer one, at long last. No more rich towns, no more poor towns when it comes to giving our kids a future. There would still be haves and have nots — a Bedford would still be able to provide more public services than a Claremont as a property-rich community — but no longer would kids be penalized for the ZIP code in which they were born and raised.
And no longer would school district meetings play out like “Lord of the Flies.”
I know, I know. Fat chance. New Hampshire has built its very identity on the idea that our aversion to progressive taxation is what makes us special. And we, the 90 villagers, have been taught to believe it — even as we lose our homes and watch our community schools disintegrate before our eyes.
Meanwhile, the top challenge for the nation is not, despite the claims of our leaders, the “leftist” political rallies in Portland, Oregon, but health care costs. In fact, it’s the reason why the federal government has shut down and seems likely to stay that way for a while. 
What we need is Medicare for All, a system in which the multiple payers of our current system (health insurers, employers, and the government) are replaced by a single payer (the government). It’s exactly the kind of thing a Department of Government Efficiency would propose if that department was truly interested in efficiency and/or the well-being of the people for whom the government works.
“On average, other large, wealthy countries spend about half as much per person on health as the U.S.,” according to the Peterson-KFF Health System Tracker.
If such high per-person spending on health was actually serving the people, you would expect that the United States would be at the top of the list when it comes to “life expectancy at birth” but we aren’t even in the top 40, the World Health Organization reports. The global ranking for “healthy” life expectancy — or the average number of years someone can expect to live in good health — is even worse for the U.S., which is outside of the top 70 nations in that statistic.
All the while, more than 25 million people are without health insurance, the majority citing the expense of it, and another 17 million are expected to join them in the wake of the Trump administration’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act.
So where is the $4.9 trillion a year (as of 2023) in “national health expenditures” going if not to better health outcomes and access? Follow the money to the Fortune 500 — always follow the money.
I’ve heard all of the arguments against an income tax here in New Hampshire and Medicare for All in the United States, year after year after year. I’ve seen their statistics and listened to their catastrophizing. I’ve been told how the ultra-wealthy already pay more than their fair share, despite the fact that economic inequality continues to rise at an alarming rate. I’m aware that “taxation is theft” is something that a lot of people in this state — especially that squad of new arrivals — actually believe.
But this is what I really hear from those who make such arguments: “I want all of the benefits of living in society — from paved roads to public education to just being around other people — but none of the personal investment.” It is selfishness created in part by the inequity of the system itself, in which the masses are competing for a too-small piece of the overall pie.
We live in a land where a handful of villagers have so much more than they could ever need, and yet our laws are designed to make sure they have every advantage when it comes to maintaining that wealth and growing it, for themselves and their heirs. That is the point of the tax cuts that translate into reductions in services for the rest, and why the elites and their surrogates on the village council spend so much time savaging the poor and the powerless.
What will it take, I wonder, for the 90 to stop fighting among themselves long enough to start asking the right questions of the 10 and their council?",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/domevillage-1024x718.jpg,,,2025-10-08 17:58:08.081933

(United States District Court)A Salt Lake City man faces federal charges of attempted arson and possession of a destructive device after investigators say he placed a gas can underneath a FOX 13 news vehicle and lit a fuse that ran into it.
Christopher Solomon Proctor, 45, was indicted Sept. 30 in Salt Lake City’s U.S. District Court, with the complaint unsealed earlier this month, court records show. Proctor is in custody in Salt Lake County Jail; his attorney did not respond to a request for comment.
According to the indictment, security footage captured a person dressed in dark clothing and possibly a mask setting the gas can under the rear bumper of the parked news vehicle at about 4:10 a.m. on Sept. 12, trailing out a long fuse, and lighting it before hurrying away. The fuse burned for almost five minutes before going out without igniting the gas can. 
Of the three DNA profiles found on the gas can, DNA on the can’s ring was matched to Proctor through Utah’s State DNA Index System database, according to the indictment. Court documents do not say who the additional profiles belong to or whether they were identified.
An acquaintance of Proctor told investigators that Proctor told him he had set a destructive device and lit the fuse under a “fox news” vehicle but that it didn’t detonate, the indictment states. 
The security footage showed that the person who left the gas can wore distinctive split-toe boots, investigators wrote. Online purchase records showed Proctor purchased “Ace Martial Arts Supply Ninja Tabi Boots, Black Jikatabi (Outdoor Tabi)” online in August, along with flame-resistant gloves, the indictment says.
Those boots and gloves were found when investigators searched Proctor’s home, according to the indictment, along with a small gas can with a hole drilled in the lid and a multicolored fuse similar to the one found at the scene.

Law enforcement last month announced they had arrested two other men, Adeeb Nasir, 58, and Adil Justice Ahmed Nasir, 31, in connection with a search warrant served at their Magna home as part of the investigation into the explosive device left under the news vehicle. They are not mentioned in the federal charges against Proctor.
Adeeb Nasir and Adil Nasir each face two counts in Utah’s 3rd District Court of manufacturing, possessing, selling or using a weapon of mass destruction, second-degree felonies, after investigators said they found fake dynamite while searching their home, and the men allegedly told them it was real.

This story by Clare Shanahan was first published in the Valley News on Oct. 6, 2025.
HANOVER — High fire danger in the Upper Valley has prompted Dartmouth College to alter its plans for the annual homecoming bonfire while fire crews remain on high alert.
The college announced Friday that instead of a homecoming weekend bonfire, there will be an “interactive light and laser show set to a soundtrack performed by Dartmouth student DJs.”
First-year students will also be given light-up wristbands that are aligned with the soundtrack, according to the announcement.
“While the bonfire itself cannot take place, the essence of the tradition — community, class unity, and celebration — remains central to our planning,” EJ Kiefer, executive director of conferences and events at Dartmouth and a member of the homecoming bonfire committee, said in a news release.
The massive Friday night bonfire is traditionally a highlight of Dartmouth’s homecoming weekend, but this year, outdoor fires big and small are prohibited in New Hampshire and Vermont amid extreme drought and unusually high fire danger.
Both states have banned all outdoor burning until further notice.
Fire crews were on especially high alert Monday as dry air and breezy conditions further elevated the fire danger, according to a special weather statement from the National Weather Service office that covers all of New Hampshire. The risk was expected to lessen as humidity rose and winds died down Monday evening.
In the Upper Valley, fire crews in Grafton and Springfield, N.H., responded to a report of smoke Saturday and found an illegal bonfire in Grafton, according to a post from the Springfield Fire Department.
Outside of the Upper Valley, brush fires took a more dangerous route.
A firefighting helicopter stationed at the Lebanon Municipal Airport was dispatched Saturday to assist crews battling a fire on Brownell Mountain in Williston throughout the weekend. The fire covered about one acre when a crew from Williston Fire Department responded Saturday afternoon, according to a Facebook post from the department.
Crews sought the assistance of the helicopter because steep terrain and “waning daylight” made the fire difficult to access on foot.
The drought continues to have other impacts as well.
Due to unusually low lake levels, the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services, which manages dams across the state, has been drawing water down from Grafton Pond in Grafton through Crystal Lake in Enfield, and into Mascoma Lake, which serves as the drinking water supply for Lebanon.
As of last week, the department had to stop drawing water out of Grafton Pond because “there really wasn’t much more water to give,” while Crystal Lake and Mascoma Lake have returned to near-normal levels, NH DES Dam Bureau Chief Engineer Corey Clark said Monday.
“Our hope is that we have a normal winter and we can refill those lakes back to the normal recreational levels next spring,” Clark said.

Feds postpone Wyoming coal sale despite promise to ""revitalize"" the industry. Critics say even the coal industry isn't betting big on its future.
The post Trump’s major coal sales flop in Wyoming and Montana appeared first on WyoFile .","Federal officials indefinitely postponed a Wyoming coal lease sale scheduled for Wednesday, apparently in response to what many observers consider a lowball bid on another federal coal lease on Monday in Montana.
Navajo Transitional Energy Company, the only bidder, stunned coal market watchers with an offer of $186,000 for 167 million tons of federal coal associated with its Spring Creek mine in southeast Montana — a fraction of a penny per ton and woefully low compared to past federal coal lease sales in the region. The last such major sale in the region, in 2012, netted $793 million for 721 million tons, or about $1.10 per ton, according to federal data.
Navajo Transitional was also in the queue to bid on the 441 million-ton West Antelope III federal coal lease associated with its Antelope coal mine spanning Campbell and Converse counties in Wyoming. 
Bureau of Land Management and Interior Department officials are still reviewing the Spring Creek bid, and those close to the process expect that another date will be set for the West Antelope III coal lease sale.

“While we would have liked to see stronger participation, this sale reflects the lingering impact from Obama and Biden’s decades long war on coal which aggressively sought to end all domestic coal production and erode confidence in the U.S. coal industry,” the Interior wrote in an email responding to a WyoFile inquiry. “Fortunately, President [Donald] Trump and his administration are rebuilding trust between industry and government as part of our broader effort to restore American Energy Dominance.”
But others say market forces — including cheap natural gas and increasingly efficient wind and solar energy — are bigger factors. 
Others note that the coal industry itself sees the writing on the wall. If a fraction-of-a-penny bid is any indication, some critics say, the thermal coal industry — which relies on U.S. coal-burning power plants — isn’t yet confident that Trump’s policies will turn around years of market decline.
“It tells you that there’s no competition for that coal in the ground, and it’s not worth very much money,” Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis Energy Data Analyst Seth Feaster told WyoFile on Wednesday. “It points to the fundamental, structural decline the coal industry is facing — for thermal coal — and that story hasn’t been reversed, despite all the things that they’re talking about.”

The postponement in Wyoming and lackluster offer in Montana come just days after the Trump administration touted sweeping regulatory rollbacks and $625 million in federal spending to revitalize “clean, beautiful coal.” 
Navajo Transitional tried to set expectations regarding Powder River Basin coal’s market value back in September, urging the U.S. Bureau of Land Management to set its minimum bid requirement for the West Antelope III coal lease much lower than comparable leases in the past. Neighboring Powder River Basin coal operator, CORE Natural Resources, echoed that sentiment and told BLM officials, “the fair-market value of coal in the Powder River Basin will remain soft for the next number of years.”
Gov. Mark Gordon has said recently that Trump’s efforts to revive the coal industry will take some time to bear fruit. He has also underscored the administration’s notion that expanding the coal industry is necessary to meet increasing electricity demand, mostly driven by artificial intelligence and other computational facilities.
The Wyoming Mining Association declined to comment on Navajo Transitional’s Spring Creek coal lease bid, but acknowledged the industry still must reckon with 15 years of drastic market and policy shifts.
“It tells you that there’s no competition for that coal in the ground, and it’s not worth very much money.”Seth Feaster, energy industry analyst
“As we’ve not seen a lease sale in over a decade, there may be a bit of a learning curve between the agency and industry to determine value given the current market conditions, projected demand and the shift in public policy,” Mining Association Executive Director Travis Deti said.
Regardless of what coal bidders and federal officials ultimately decide is the “fair market value” for Powder River Basin coal, Deti said, it’s vital to resume leasing new tracts of coal.
“If you don’t have the coal leased, you can’t mine it and you don’t have the jobs,” Deti said.
Conservation groups have noted that existing coal leases allow mining in the region to continue at pace through 2041. 
There’s a danger in the Trump administration’s narrative around coal making a comeback, particularly for coal-reliant communities, according to Mijin Cha, who grew up in Laramie and studies energy transition and social justice strategies. 
“It creates false hope and increased distrust between community members and government officials — you know, the folks that actually could help them,” said Cha, an assistant professor of environmental studies at the University of California, Santa Cruz. “It delays help for energy communities, and I think that what they’re doing [selling more federal coal] is so much more detrimental.”
Though the industry has seen slight upticks in demand recently, Wyoming coal production — primarily in the Powder River Basin — has shrunk by more than half since its heyday in the mid-2000s. The state scooped about 191 million tons of coal last year, according to federal data.

In 2024, four separate theft charges against Ronald Pagliai were resolved through a plea agreement, in which Pagliai pleaded guilty in two cases while the court dismissed the other two. In addition to being sentenced to serve 41 days, Pagliai was also ordered by the district court to pay victim restitution and court costs associated with all four cases.
Pagliai’s case before the state Supreme Court challenges the order to pay for court costs for the two cases that were dismissed, arguing Iowa Code asserts defendants who receive legal assistance are only required to pay court costs in cases of convictions or acquittals.
The case is a way for organizations like the American Civil Liberties Union of Iowa, Fines and Fees Justice Center, and Public Justice to challenge the state’s ability to steeply charge Iowans, who are given indigent legal defense because they cannot afford their own lawyer, as required by the Constitution.
While the right to counsel is guaranteed by the Constitution, states are still allowed to attempt to recoup costs by charging court fees in these cases, and a majority of states do so. But according to reporting from the Marshall Project, Iowa imposes higher fees than most other states — and these debts are rarely paid.
Iowa’s practice of charging low-income people for public defenders in cases that are dropped or where they are acquitted is also unlike many other states. This is the practice being challenged in Pagliai’s case, Alex Kornya, cooperating attorney with the ACLU of Iowa said. Kornya told reporters Wednesday the “lion’s share” of court debt in Iowa comes from costs assessed against low-income people to repay the state for their legal defense.
Iowa also stands out for charging “actual cost” of an attorney to the defendant, Kornya said, while other states often have statutes limiting how much the state can recoup on the cost of court-appointed defense.
Kornya said it was also “unusual” that Iowa assesses these debts against people even if they win their case. He also referenced the 2020 case State of Iowa vs. Lori Mathes, a similar situation where prosecutors dismissed a marijuana possession charge against Mathes in Monona County, with an order that she pay county sheriff fees, court-appointed attorney fees, and restitution. Mathes said she understood the bill to be $500 for court costs, but the amount she was expected to reimburse was nearly $3,000.
The Iowa Supreme Court ruled 4-4 in the Mathes case in 2020, with Justice Matthew McDermott recusing himself from the ruling. This stalemate declared the case “affirmed by operation of law,” meaning the state law allowing district courts to impose debt in criminal cases when charges were dismissed was allowed to remain in place.
Kornya said Iowa’s system of imposing these fees in cases where charges are dismissed is also more costly to low-income people than in cases where they are convicted of a crime.
“One of the things that we found to be, I think, particularly perverse about the assessment of these debts in dismissed cases is that — at least for convictions and acquittal — that people have a right to reduce the amount they owe based on their ability to pay,” Kornya siad. “When someone has a dismissed case, they bypass that ability to pay determination. So it’s not even as simple as saying that people who have dismissed cases are in the same position as someone who is convicted. They’re actually in a worse position, and often end up owing more for their case than they would have if they had been convicted, which makes no sense.”
The Pagliai case brought this subject before the Iowa Supreme Court again. Assistant Attorney General David Banta, who represented the state of Iowa in the case, argued that because Pagliai had agreed to pay for the costs of the dismissed charges through a plea agreement, he had waived his ability to challenge the district court’s authority on setting these costs.
But the state conceded in its Appellee Brief, “while the State maintains the district court had jurisdiction over Pagliai’s criminal cases, it agrees that it did not have statutory authority to order Pagalia to pay costs for dismissed charges,” but that Pagliai had allowed this authority to be put in place through the plea agreement.
Allowing Pagliai’s challenge to move forward would “affect how plea deals are made in the future,” Banta said.

“We have a runway with our current federal funding for all of October, probably early November,” Edney said. “And the shutdown better be over by then.”
This comes a day after state Health Department spokesperson Greg Flynn said if benefits for the Women, Infants and Children program (WIC) program dried up this month, the department would have to look at ways to “shore things up” with state funds. 
These funds make vital services possible for tens of thousands of households statewide, offering breastfeeding support and monthly vouchers for healthy foods to women who are pregnant, breastfeeding or postpartum, as well as infants and children under the age of five. Roughly 300 WIC-approved grocery stores and pharmacies allow members to use their benefits. 
To stretch federal dollars further, the state Health Department will limit new applicants, Edney said. He added that this could help keep the program afloat for a few weeks. He also said he hopes the use of state funds will not be necessary. 
During the government shutdown, new applicants will only be approved if they fall under “Priority 1” designation, which includes pregnant and breastfeeding women and high-risk infants. However, according to Flynn on Tuesday, officials will not require proof of pregnancy, breastfeeding or a high-risk infant to determine priority status, allowing people to get the help they need while it lasts. 
“Priority 1” applicants will still need to follow the guidelines for approval, including bringing proof of income, residence and identification to their initial WIC appointment. More information about the application process can be found on the state Health Department’s website. 
Leadership at the state Health Department is encouraging WIC applicants and enrollees to direct any questions to an agent at 1-800-338-6747.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/01135248/3X0A5127.jpg,,,2025-10-08 17:58:08.081933

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Deborah Yetter)LOUISVILLE — Just three months into the job, Brian Yearwood, the new superintendent of Jefferson County Public Schools, met a receptive audience at the Louisville Forum where he outlined his plans to improve Kentucky’s largest school system.
During an hour-long luncheon of the nonpartisan public interest group, Yearwood touched on a wide range of issues facing JCPS — a looming budget deficit, charter schools, safety and a controversial proposal to split up the district.
But he returned repeatedly to his primary theme: improving student academic achievement in a district of more than 94,000 students where low performance is of ongoing concern.
His goal?

“To make sure that every child in our district is reading at or above grade level when they graduate from our schools,” Yearwood said to a burst of applause.
He acknowledged the current projected budget shortfall of $180 million is a major concern, blaming it largely on the loss of extra federal funds during the COVID-19 pandemic.
“The one thing we did not plan for is when the funds ended,” he said.
“That’s very serious and we are taking it seriously,” Yearwood added. “I promise we will fix it.”
But the district will address the shortfall by reducing spending in administration and other savings — not by cutting salaries of teachers or instructional aides in the classroom, he said.
“We will not balance the budget by shortchanging our children,” he said. “Our children deserve a safe learning environment, and we will protect that.”
That promise drew applause from Maddie Shepard, president of the Jefferson County Teachers Association, who said Yearwood has made that pledge repeatedly.
“He says that every chance he gets in public,” she said.
A survey obtained by Louisville Public Media earlier this year showed Yearwood was not the first choice among teachers and the community to replace outgoing Superintendent Marty Pollio. But Shepard said the teachers’ union has been impressed by Yearwood’s accessibility and willingness to listen.
“We have a very collaborative relationship so far,” Shephard said.
In opening comments, Yearwood introduced himself as a native of Trinidad who left the West Indies island at 17 to further his education in the United States.
“By the way, I am legal,” he said, prompting laughter over the apparent reference to  the recent arrest of the Des Moines, Iowa, school superintendent by immigration officials who said he is not authorized to work in the United States.
“I have papers,” Yearwood added.
Yearwood holds a doctorate, a master’s degree and a bachelor’s degree in educational studies from Texas Tech University. Most recently, he served as superintendent of Columbia Public Schools in Missouri, where he was credited with overseeing substantial academic improvement.
Among questions he addressed Wednesday at the Louisville Forum:
Splitting up JCPS 
Critics including Rep. Jason Nemes, a Louisville Republican, have proposed splitting JCPS into smaller districts.
“What does that mean when you talk about splitting JCPS up?” Yearwood asked. “I believe that under my leadership, we can show them JCPS can be successful without an intervention.”
As for potential legislative action, Yearwood said he has met with Nemes and said the lawmaker “has promised me a grace period for the upcoming session. I appreciate that.”
Audit
“I look forward to that,” Yearwood said of a pending audit of the school system by Republican state Auditor Allison Ball. “I’m sure they’ll find some positives and I’m sure they’ll find some negatives.” An audit, he added, would identify areas to improve.
Charter schools
Whether a charter school law  enacted by the legislature is allowed under Kentucky’s Constitution is currently before the state Supreme Court.
“My hope is that charter schools, if allowed, will be under the same rules and regulations as public schools,” Yearwood said. “In public schools we have to accept all students, have to have certified teachers in the classrooms. If that were to come to fruition, I hope we would all be playing on the same fields.”
 Behavior and discipline

Yearwood said JCPS can’t solve such problems by simply expelling students. Rather, it needs to find a way to reach them and help them learn through alternative schools or other means.
“We can’t just put them out,” he said. “We cannot stop a child’s education because of the behavior. We need to keep educating them.”
Moral instruction
Giving students an optional hour each week of public school time for Bible study at an off-campus site is under consideration in school districts across the state after the legislature changed a law earlier this year. An Ohio Christian education group, LifeWise Academy, is organizing across the state. Residents of other districts, including JCPS, have also shown an interest in introducing the program, according to the Courier Journal.
“I’m a man of faith and I believe we need to respect individuals within our schools,” Yearwood said. “We should respect individual beliefs within our schools.”
Student achievement
Yearwood concluded his remarks by returning to his goal of improving student achievement scores, a goal he said he will try to reach by studying data and better understanding where students need improvement.
“That is the plan,” he said.
JCPS Board chairman Corrie Shull, who attended the forum, said he believes Yearwood can handle the many challenges facing him.
“He certainly has a tremendous task,” Shull said. “I think he’s definitely up for the task.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Yearwood-2-scaled-e1759960101232-1024x712.jpg,,,2025-10-08 17:58:08.081933

Gabe Vasquez leads letter to Republican U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson urging action to pay military during shutdown,"NM Democratic U.S. Rep. Gabe Vasquez lead an Oct. 8, 2025 to Republican U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson urging action to pay military during shutdown. (Leah Romero for Source NM)On the eighth day of the federal government shutdown, U.S. Rep. Gabe Vasquez, a New Mexico Democrat representing the state’s southern 2nd Congressional District, led a letter to Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) highlighting the looming threat of missed paychecks for military personnel.
The letter, co-led by U.S. Rep. Derek Tran (D-CA) and co-signed by 75 other House Democrats, notes that if Congress doesn’t act by Oct. 15, “nearly three million military families will miss their next paycheck. That’s unacceptable — our military families and troops deserve better.” That includes 22,000 active duty and reserve personnel in New Mexico, according to a news release from Vasquez’s office.
In a statement, Vasquez said that the country’s “troops selflessly serve and defend our country every single day, and they deserve to be paid on time for their work. I’m calling on Speaker Johnson to do what’s right for our military families and get Republicans back to Washington to vote to pay our servicemen and women. There’s no excuse for inaction, because when it comes to paying our troops, there is no room for partisan politics.”
The bipartisan Pay Our Troops Act would ensure services members, along with civilian employees and contractors, receive pay during the shutdown. Vasquez’s letter notes that that Congress passed a similar bill during the 2013 shutdown. Doing so, the letter says, shows “Congress can come together for the benefit of our service members even while disagreeing on other matters.”
Johnson, however, on Wednesday rejected voting on a stand-alone bill to provide paychecks to active duty military members during the shutdown, and said if Democrats want to ensure salaries for federal workers, they should vote to advance the stopgap spending bill. 
“They live with that vote. They made that decision. The House is done,” Johnson said at a morning press conference. “The ball is now in the Senate’s court. It does us no good to be here dithering on show votes. We did it. We sent the product over.”
President Donald Trump, however, in comments from the White House later in the day, indicated he supported a stand-alone bill to provide pay for military members during the shutdown, saying: “Yeah, that probably will happen.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/vasquez-1024x683.png,,,2025-10-08 17:58:08.081933

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)EDMOND — Leaders of the state’s third-largest university have engaged in “egregiously anti-free speech conduct” in an effort to control media coverage by ending print operations of the student newspaper, according to a letter a journalism legal group sent to school administrators this week.
The University of Central Oklahoma’s decision to stop printing the school’s student newspaper, The Vista, for the first time in 122 years amounts to a clear act of retaliation in response to “rigorous news coverage of university affairs,” according to the letter sent by Leslie Briggs, an attorney with Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press. The group said it is representing six current or former UCO students.
In August, a UCO student media advisory board voted to end printing physical copies of The Vista, and said it would continue publishing digitally like many campuses and other newspapers have in recent years.
While not constitutionally required to fund a print publication, the decision to stop printing The Vista comes after UCO administrators “repeatedly expressed dissatisfaction with editorial decisions” made by The Vista, including coverage that “may reflect poorly” on the university and President Todd Lamb’s administration, according to the letter. 
Briggs wrote that despite claims from the UCO administration that the decision to stop printing The Vista was made to cut costs, university leadership has subsequently refused to accept private donations that would pay for the estimated $12,000 annual cost to print the newspaper for another year.
“Any possible notion that UCO’s decision was animated even slightly by concerns over budget is firmly negated by the fact that UCO refused to allow The Vista to accept outside funding to allow continued publication,” according to the letter. “That is not cost-saving – it’s censorship.”
Briggs’ letter was addressed to five university employees, including Lamb and Elizabeth Maier, dean of the College of Arts and Sciences. Lamb and Maier deferred comment to Adrienne Nobles, a spokesperson for the university. 
Nobles said in an email to Oklahoma Voice that officials had received the letter and will respond to Briggs in the coming days.
“The Vista remains an independent publication in its new digital format with editorial agency over their content,” Nobles said in a statement, adding that the publication’s student editor is among those who support the transition to digital-only.
She said many college newspapers have made the shift to fully digital prior to The Vista, including The Maneater at the University of Missouri, The Daily Gamecock at the University of South Carolina and the OU Daily at the University of Oklahoma. Nobles also cited The Daily Illini at The University of Illinois as having made the shift to fully digital, though the publication’s website says it is still distributed in print.
Briggs’ clients are demanding that the university restore editorial independence to the paper, allow it to resume printing, return The Vista’s newspaper distribution racks to campus, cease all efforts to retaliate against students for exercising their First Amendment rights and discontinue efforts to “censor content the University deems objectionable.”
In an interview with Oklahoma Voice, Briggs said that her hope is that the letter will open a dialogue with the university “so that they can actually sit down and hear concerns of these journalists and come to a mutually agreeable solution.”
“The current status of what’s going on with The Vista is unacceptable,” she said.

Sept. 5, 2023. (Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)With Maine Gov. Janet Mills set to term out after eight years, the field for the November 2026 gubernatorial election is packed with candidates with a spectrum of experience and views. 
Those running as either Democrats or Republicans will first face off against each other in the June 9, 2026 primaries in an effort to win over their base and secure their party’s nomination.
Open to all Maine voters, the primaries will be a ranked-choice ballot, though the general election in November will not. With at least one political heavyweight, Maine Sen. Rick Bennett of Oxford, opting out of either major political party, it remains to be seen how that could influence Maine’s historically independent electorate.
The field is already crowded with several well known names vying for the Democratic Party nomination, including Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, former Senate President Troy Jackson, former speaker of the Maine House of Representatives and daughter of a U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree, Hannah Pingree, and Angus King III, son of Maine’s independent U.S. senator.
Whoever becomes Maine’s next governor will take the helm for the remaining two years of President Donald Trump’s second term, and will have to navigate massive cuts in funding, the dismantling of federal agencies and programs, and greater pressure on states to conform with his agenda amid increased economic uncertainty.
Here’s the latest on the race for Maine governor.

Republican Jonathan Bush launches bid for governor


By: Lauren McCauley - Wednesday October 8, 2025 4:49 pm





Jonathan Bush, nephew of the late President George H.W. Bush, officially launched his campaign for governor on Wednesday, running as a Republican to replace outgoing Gov. Janet Mills in the 2026 election.
Branding himself as a “disruptor, a job creator and a fanatic Maine optimist,” the health care entrepreneur launched his campaign at the Belfast headquarters of athenahealth, a company he founded in 1997 but was eventually ousted from.
In a launch video, Bush outlined some of the changes he hopes to make as governor, including auditing the government, investing in trade schools and jumpstarting the economy “by getting rid of silly regulations.”

State Rep. Ed Crockett enters Maine governor’s race as independent


By: Emma Davis - Thursday September 25, 2025 5:07 pm





Rep. Ed Crockett of Portland has entered the race for Maine’s next governor. And, he’s the second sitting legislator who has unaffiliated from a political party to run as an independent.
Crockett, who until recently had been a Democrat, announced his intention to run for higher office in an op-ed earlier this summer, in which he condemned what he described as a Legislature “stuck in a morass of partisanship.” Crockett is approaching his eighth and final year serving in the Maine House of Representatives before he’ll be termed out.
That critique echoes why Sen. Rick Bennett of Oxford, formerly a Republican, similarly said he decided to run as an independent for governor earlier this year
With Crockett in the running, there are now 17 candidates in the open race to replace Gov. Janet Mills, who terms out in 2026. Crockett is the third independent, along with Bennett and John Glowa, a retired environmental specialist.

Jackson rallies with Sanders and Platner on Labor Day


By: Lauren McCauley - Wednesday September 3, 2025 10:02 am





Gubernatorial candidate Troy Jackson joined U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and U.S. Senate candidate Graham Platner at a packed rally at the Cross Insurance Arena in Portland on Labor Day.
Addressing the crowd of 6,500, Jackson used his speech to differentiate himself from other Democratic candidates.
“We have tried it their way and it doesn’t work,” said Jackson, a fifth-generation logger from Allagash. “It’s time for regular folks to take the wheel. Hell, we built the wheel.”
Sanders, an independent who ran twice for the Democratic nomination for president, endorsed both Jackson and Platner in their respective races.

Former Maine CDC head Dr. Nirav Shah considering bid for governor


By: Lauren McCauley - Friday August 15, 2025 2:53 pm





Another popular figure in Maine is considering a run for governor. 
Dr. Nirav Shah told the Portland Press Herald in an interview Friday that he’s considering entering the race as a Democrat, which would have him joining a field already crowded with well-known players in Maine politics.  
Shah became a household figure as head of the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention during the COVID-19 pandemic, holding daily briefings during which he would answer questions and provide updates on the public health crisis. He often appeared alongside Maine officials, including Gov. Janet Mills. 
He told the paper that experience gave him an appreciation for the impact state government can make on people’s lives.
“What attracted me in particular to the governor’s office is the impact you can have in the executive branch,” Shah said.
In January 2023, he was appointed as the principal deputy director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention under former President Joe Biden. Recently, he returned to Maine to launch a public health education program at Colby College, where he is a visiting professor.









Retired DEP employee is third independent to join the race for governor


By: Eesha Pendharkar - Thursday August 7, 2025 5:44 pm





A former longtime state government employee is running for governor as an independent.
John Glowa of South China is the most recent candidate to add his name to the growing list of gubernatorial candidates. So far, 16 people have entered the race, including three independents.
The most prominent of those is State Sen. Rick Bennett of Oxford, who left the Republican Party earlier this year to announce his run, in addition to Dover-Foxcroft resident Alexander Murchison, according to the Maine Ethics Commission website.
Glowa worked for the Maine Department of Environmental Protection as an environmental specialist from 1987 until 2016, according to his campaign website. He then retired and ran for state representative as a member of the Democratic Party, and then for a seat in the Maine Senate.
He also founded the Maine Wolf Coalition, which advocates for wolf recovery in the northeast, and has accused state wildlife officials of deliberately downplaying evidence of wolves’ presence in the state.

Here are the Republicans vying to replace Gov. Janet Mills next November


By: Eesha Pendharkar - Wednesday August 6, 2025 8:04 am





Ben Midgley, a fitness executive from Kennebunkport, on Tuesday officially became the seventh Republican candidate in a crowded race for Gov. Janet Mills’ seat.
Midgley is the latest of 17 officially registered candidates vying to replace Mills, a Democrat who terms out next year. Both the Republican and Democratic primaries, slated for June 9, 2026, are open to all Maine voters. The primaries will be a ranked-choice ballot though the general election for governor in November will not.
Most of the Republican candidates listed on the Maine Ethics Commission website have not held public office at the state level, with the exception of state Sen. Jim Libby (R-Standish). Bobby Charles, a lawyer who served under former Republican presidents, and former Paris selectman Robert Wessels have also been involved in politics in different capacities.
In contrast, the Democratic field is stacked with party leaders, including Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, former Senate President Troy Jackson, and former Speaker of the Maine House of Representative and Mills administration official Hannah Pingree, among others.
Other GOP candidates, including University of Maine System trustee Owen McCarthy, tout their financial credentials while framing themselves as political outsiders. All seven appear to have varying stances on issues including the economy, education and immigration, but almost all have expressed concern about the increasing cost of living in Maine, which according to a Pan Atlantic Research poll conducted this year was the biggest concern expressed by voters.

Republican Sen. Rick Bennett announces independent bid for Maine governor


By: Emma Davis - Tuesday June 24, 2025 12:03 pm





After decades of public service as a Republican, state Sen. Rick Bennett of Oxford announced on Tuesday that he is running for governor as an independent.
“My candidacy is not an indictment of either party,” Bennett told Maine Morning Star in an interview. “It’s an indictment of the party structure and parties as the solution to solving our problems.”
Calling his independent bid liberating, Bennett said he intends to take his message — one of fiscal responsibility — directly to Maine people and not a subset of the electorate, an approach he sees as a return to Maine’s independent tradition.
“I see politics beginning to slide more towards the politics of Washington,” Bennett said, “and I think we have the opportunity as Maine people to say no to that.”

Hannah Pingree officially launches bid for governor


By: Eesha Pendharkar - Tuesday June 10, 2025 7:02 am





Hannah Pingree officially launched her campaign for governor after months of speculation about the candidacy of the former Mills administration official and speaker of the Maine House of Representatives.
She kicked off the campaign with several planned stops around the state on Tuesday, starting with a rally in Rockland, scheduled meetings with local leaders in Lewiston and Biddeford before capping off the day with a celebration in Portland.
Pingree left her role as head of Gov. Janet Mills’ Office of Policy Innovation and the Future, also known as GOPIF, which she held since 2019. The office was created to recommend policy solutions for some of the state’s biggest issues including climate change, housing, workforce development, the opioid crisis and more.

Republican state senator enters race for governor


By: AnnMarie Hilton - Thursday May 22, 2025 12:01 pm





State Sen. James Libby is running in the 2026 gubernatorial race.
Libby, who represents parts of Cumberland, Oxford and York counties, is one of five Republican candidates contending for the Blaine House, according to filings with the Maine Ethics Commission.
The race is already starting to get crowded, with the Democratic ticket drawing notable names including Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, who announced her bid in late March, as well as Angus King III, the son of independent U.S. senator and former governor Angus King Jr., who announced his run earlier this month.
Libby is in the middle of his second consecutive term in the Senate, but he has also spent time as a state representative after being first elected to the Legislature in 1992. He also ran in the 2002 Republican gubernatorial primary.

Former Maine Senate President Troy Jackson is running for governor in the 2026 election.
The fifth-generation logger announced Monday that he will join the Democratic primary, saying in a news release from his campaign that “too many Democrats have lost touch with working people or shown they’re not up to the fight.”
“I know what it’s like to punch a clock, live paycheck to paycheck, be treated like I didn’t matter while some billionaire got rich off my back – and how to turn that feeling of powerlessness into action,” he added.

Amid rumors of gubernatorial bid, Hannah Pingree to leave Mills administration


By: AnnMarie Hilton - Thursday May 15, 2025 5:58 pm





Hannah Pingree, who has led efforts on climate and housing policy for the state, will leave her position Friday.
“I’m so grateful to Governor Mills for the tremendous opportunity she gave me to dive into Maine’s biggest challenges and lead work across her administration to chart a path to solutions,” Pingree said in a news release from the governor’s office Thursday.
Though the release didn’t specify what Pingree plans to do next, she said she will “remain relentlessly focused on the future of the state we all love.” The Bangor Daily News has reported that Pingree is expected to throw her hat in the ring for the Democratic gubernatorial primary next year.

Secretary of State Shenna Bellows announced her run for governor in 2026, becoming the first major Democratic candidate to throw her hat in the ring.
During her address early Wednesday at the official launch event at the Hancock Community Center, Bellows said “we need leaders who will meet the moment.”
“Because while we’re paying our taxes or helping our parents measure out their medication, our country is being demolished by a greedy, unelected billionaire who thinks his dollars are more powerful than our voices…Who thinks the value of his stock portfolio matters more than the values of our community.”

Janet Mills. (Screenshot via campaign launch video)Jonathan Bush, nephew of the late President George H.W. Bush, officially launched his campaign for governor on Wednesday, running as a Republican to replace outgoing Gov. Janet Mills in the 2026 election. 
Branding himself as a “disruptor, a job creator and a fanatic Maine optimist,” the health care entrepreneur launched his campaign at the Belfast headquarters of athenahealth, a company he founded in 1997 but was eventually ousted from.
In a launch video, Bush outlined some of the changes he hopes to make as governor, including auditing the government, investing in trade schools and jumpstarting the economy “by getting rid of silly regulations.” 
“To change things, I’m going to have to break a few eggs along the way,” he said in the video.
Bush moved to Cape Elizabeth in recent years, though he grew up spending his summers on North Haven.
This summer, Bush launched Maine for Keeps, a podcast and advocacy group that he has described as a “solutions factory” aimed at improving the state’s business environment.

“Mainers want a leader who will shake up the status quo in Augusta. They want a proven job creator who will make sure our kids don’t have to leave the state to achieve the American Dream,” Bush said in a statement ahead of the announcement. 
Bush started his business career with the founding of health care billing and software company athenahealth in 1997. Just over 20 years later, Bush was ousted amid the company’s sale to a private hedge fund after reports of physical altercations with his ex-wife were made public. Bush later founded Boston-based health data platform company Zus, where he currently serves as CEO.
Bush is entering an already crowded race with more than a half dozen Republican candidates who will compete in the June 6 primary, which will determine who will be nominated for the November 2026 ballot. 
The Republican primary has so far not drawn any candidate who can match the political experience or name recognition as the Democratic side, which includes former legislative leaders and children of two of Maine’s sitting members of Congress. 
In a statement Wednesday, Maine Democratic Party Chair Charlie Dingman said, “We don’t need a governor who thinks that taking care of business is more important than taking care of families or making sure that the economy and the government both treat ordinary people fairly and protect their dignity and freedom.”

The case, brought on behalf of a North Carolina resident identified only as John Doe, marks what advocates say is the first settlement in the country requiring nursing homes to stop automatically rejecting patients with substance use disorders or recent drug use.
According to the complaint, Sunnybrook Rehabilitation Center in Raleigh and Treyburn Rehabilitation Center in Durham denied the man admission because of his drug use. He had been hospitalized several times between 2023 and 2025 and needed follow-up care, but after being turned away, his health deteriorated and he ended up back in the hospital.
Neither facility immediately responded to a request for comment.
“I just want to be able to get the care that everyone else gets. I want to be treated with dignity,” Doe said in a statement. “I was sick and needed help after being in the hospital, but the nursing homes said no. It was really hard for me, and it didn’t feel fair. I’m very glad this case is settled and that the nursing homes are changing their rules. Now, other people like me won’t have to go through what I did.”
Under the settlement, both facilities must adopt a substance use disorder non-discrimination policy that bars blanket denials of admission based solely on past or present substance use. Instead, they must evaluate each case individually, train staff on non-discrimination laws, and report any denials made under the new policy for one year.
The new policy must cover people currently using illegal drugs and those taking treatment medications like methadone or buprenorphine, although a Disability Rights NC spokesperson clarified that the settlement would not require facilities to allow illegal drug use on their premises.
The facilities must also establish a grievance process for alleged violations and agree to reconsider any future application for admission from the man who was denied care.
“Unfortunately, SUD-based discrimination in healthcare is far too common, and people who use or used drugs frequently do not receive care for serious, sometimes life-threatening, needs,” said Rebekah Joab, Deputy Director of Litigation and Legal Services at the Legal Action Center.
“We applaud Sunnybrook and Treyburn for making important changes to admission policies that will help protect the rights of vulnerable patients with substance use disorder to get the care they need,” Sara Harrington, an attorney at Disability Rights NC said in a statement.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Nursing-care-Getty-Images.jpg,,,2025-10-08 16:58:41.689492

Chuck Collins, the heir to the Oscar Mayer fortune, gave away his millions to progressive political causes when he was in his twenties. Ever since, the resident of Guilford has fought to expose how the rich make themselves richer at everyone else’s expense.
In his new book, “Burned by Billionaires: How Concentrated Wealth and Power are Ruining Our Lives and Planet,” Collins shows how the actions of the top .01% have dire consequences for everyone else. He argues that when the system is rigged to favor to rich, working people pay the price in higher taxes, fewer affordable houses and a health care system stripped of both health and care. 
Collins is a senior scholar at the Institute for Policy Studies where he co-edits Inequality.org. He writes the Oligarch Watch column for The Nation. He is the author of a number of books, including “Born on Third Base: A One Percenter Makes the Case for Tackling Inequality, Bringing Wealth Home, and Committing to the Common Good“; and with Bill Gates Sr., “Wealth and Our Commonwealth,” a case for taxing inherited fortunes. 
Collins says we are living through a new Gilded Age. In the first Gilded Age, which lasted from about the end of the Civil War to 1900, “there were 400 wealthy families that by some estimates may have had 40 to 50% of all the wealth in the country,” Collins told the Vermont Conversation. But from 2020 to 2022, “the flow of billionaire wealth, not just to the 1% but the top one tenth of 1% in the billionaire class, is dizzying.” He said that the combined wealth of US billionaires went from under $3 trillion at the beginning of the pandemic to $7.8 trillion by the end.
“Pretty much everything you care about is undermined by that concentration of wealth and power: your health, your housing, the quality of your environment.”
Collins warned of the danger of “billionaire capture.”
“You have the billionaires lining up behind one particular presidential candidate who has totally delivered for the billionaire class to the point where our political system is captured. … They are using that government shutdown as a way to shrink government and lay off workers. And we’re not even going to publish unemployment rates and the data necessary for us to understand what’s happening in the economy.”
Collins believes that change will come from both the grassroots and from “cracks within the billionaire elites that we should be paying attention to,” such as those who want to address climate change.
“As people start to see how their pockets are getting picked, they will wake up and want to push back on this oligarchic capture of our society.”
Collins says that change begins by taxing enormous wealth, reinvesting in social programs, and in grassroots mobilizations such as “No Kings Day” that represent “an awakening that we have never seen.”
“We have to say, Look, we’re not going to vote for people who are going to be lapdogs of the billionaires. … We’re going to see people run for Congress and win and run for higher office saying, I want an economy that works for everybody, not just the billionaires.”

(Danielle Prokop / Source NM)New leadership for the troubled New Mexico Children Youth and Families Department said on Tuesday the agency is in the process of overhauling the system that reviews fatalities and critical incidents for children in its care, after failing to meet the deadline to deliver data to independent reviewers.
CYFD was supposed to provide information about deaths and near-deaths in state custody to independent child welfare experts who are overseeing the agency’s reform efforts during a hearing held Tuesday, according to a July order by the arbiter in the ongoing issues in treatment of foster children.
Those reforms trace back to a 2018 class-action lawsuit, informally called Kevin S., which alleged that children neither received adequate treatment nor were placed in appropriate foster homes. The agency and advocates settled the lawsuit in 2020, but CYFD has failed multiple times to meet the deadlines set in the landmark settlement agreement, and was brought into arbitration to address issues including staff turnover, treatment of children in the state’s care and foster parent shortages.
A Sept. 27 letter from the independent child welfare experts overseeing the reforms noted that CYFD had identified “seven fatalities and eight near-fatalities” since Jan. 1, but said that the agency had only provided the children’s initials and “limited information.”
During Tuesday’s status hearing before Charles Peifer, an Albuquerque attorney appointed as arbiter in the case, CYFD leadership acknowledged the agency did not send the data to the independent child welfare experts, who are called co-neutrals.
“The reason it wasn’t delivered timely was that it does have to come from various sources I have to run around, as does my team, to identify it,” Kathy Kunkel, a deputy secretary for the department, said. “We appreciate that this is not a system, and that’s where we are today.”
Kunkel promised the information would be released on Friday, and said a new policy for incidents and a review will be presented by the end of the month.
The nearly three-hour long meeting touched on additional concerns that the agency is not ensuring that children entering the state’s custody see a doctor, and that high staff turnover and burnout are contributing to foster parent attrition.
The agency is one month into new leadership following former CYFD Secretary Teresa Casados’ retirement on Sept. 5. Her departure followed criticism about the state’s reform progress, as well as high-profile suicides of children in the agency’s care this year that sparked investigations by state authorities.
The co-neutrals said the communication with new leadership at CYFD has been “proactive,” but noted that the agency is still slow in releasing data and struggling to meet goals, such as certifying 265 new non-kin foster homes. Instead, they said, between January and August, the agency only licensed 61 homes, less than a quarter of the target. Moreover, they said,
CYFD “has not consistently implemented a coordinated plan or effective strategies” for foster family recruitment and retention.
Kunkel, Acting CYFD Secretary Valerie Sandoval and Chief Operating Officer Brenda Donald all appeared at Tuesday’s hearing.
Donald disputed the co-neutrals’ figures, and said CYFD has 72 new foster homes as of October, and has also added 230 new relatives caring for children in custody.
“We consider that a value and want to continue doing as much as we can to support those placements,” Donald said.
Kunkel also said the state implemented additional payments of $400 per month for foster families willing to take children with higher behavioral and mental health needs.
In closing remarks, Sandoval acknowledged the agency remains far from being in compliance with the requirements of the settlement agreement, but highlighted what she characterized as improvements that have been made: increased pay in the Foster Care plus program; shortened hiring times; and added fixes for pay for multiple types of workers.
“I know that we have a lot of work ahead and we still are a ways away from meeting all of our obligations,” Sandoval said. “But I just want to say that I am committed as the acting cabinet secretary, as well as this team sitting in this room, is very committed and we’re ready to excel and push forward on the obligations.”
Peifer complimented Sandoval’s efforts and commended the team she has put together, but concluded the hearing that more needed to be done for children in state care.
“There have been no shortage of plans and no shortage of well-intentioned people in your position or in the position that your colleagues hold,” he said. “I take for granted that everybody is going to do their best, but success is not based on intentions or statements or expressions of a desire to do better; it’s going to be measured for the purposes of the settlement agreement, compliance for the remedial orders and measurable success for the kids.”

(Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — An eastern Kansas school district was the only one in the state that banned a book during the 2024-2025 school year, according to an annual report cataloguing bans and restrictions across the country.
The Gardner Edgerton School District, which has schools in Johnson and Miami counties, in December removed “Lily and Dunkin,” by Donna Gephart, from the school library. The book, which details the friendship of two Florida eighth graders, one navigating her transgender identity and the other grappling with his mental health, was not required reading.
The book was one of more than 3,700 titles banned in 87 public school districts across 23 states during the last school year, according to PEN America, an organization that tracks book banning, disinformation and educational censorship.
In total, the organization found 6,870 instances of book banning in the U.S. during the most recent school year, according to the report released Oct. 1. That number is down from the previous school year, when the organization clocked more than 10,000 book bans, according to data from the organization’s four years of reports.
“In 2022, we cautioned that book bans and related threats to free expression and the First Amendment should not be ignored; that this assault on students’ freedom to read is a slippery slope; and that state censorship of this nature, once unleashed, would snowball,” the 2025 report said. “Today, that escalation is no longer hypothetical. For many students, families, educators, librarians, and school districts, book banning is a new normal.”
PEN America defines a book ban as “any action taken against a book based on its content and as a result of parent or community challenges, administrative decisions, or in response to direct or threatened action by governmental officials, that leads to a book being either completely removed from availability to students, or where access to a book is restricted or diminished.”
The report relies on three types of bans. “Banned” refers to outright prohibition. “Banned pending investigation” requires further evaluation, and “banned by restriction” can include grade-level restrictions or books that require parental permission. “Lily and Dunkin” is outright banned in the Gardner Edgerton School District.
Ben Boothe, the assistant superintendent of educational services for the district, declined to comment when reached by email Tuesday.
However, the district school board members discussed “Lily and Dunkin” during a December meeting, when the majority of members voted to remove the book from school shelves.
Tom Reddin, the school board president, said the book contained good pieces.
“But for me, I couldn’t get over the repetitive pushing of puberty blockers,” he said.
Katie Williams, one of two board members who voted to keep the book on shelves, said she appreciated how the book encouraged youths to seek medical attention for gender-affirming care and mental health care.
She said kids in their district are undergoing the same things as the book’s characters, and it could be a useful resource.
Greg Chapman said he was a “no” vote from the beginning, favoring the removal of the book from shelves.
“There’s no good qualities of the book, to me, and it shocked me that so many staff members were on board with this book and praising it so heavily,” he said.
He also said he thought “it was a terrible book for men and for fathers,” because of character developments leading to the father “caving,” in Chapman’s words.
One person filed a petition for the district’s book review committee to evaluate “Lily and Dunkin.” One person on the committee objected to keeping the book on school library shelves. Board member Heath Freeman said the committee’s support carried weight in his decision to vote against removing the book.
“One of the keys in my perspective as a school board member is that we should promote acceptance, and when we pull things from the shelf that either try to hide or try to — and I’m not accusing anyone of doing so, it’s just a perspective for those that might see this decision — either dismiss someone’s experience, hide their experience or not provide them access to things that they could find comfort in by shared experiences, then I think we’re doing a disservice to those kids who absolutely are in this world,” he said.
Last school year was not the first time the Gardner Edgerton School District garnered attention for book banning. In 2022, two parents led the charge to ban “The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian” from being used in the district’s English class curricula. The semi-autobiographical 2007 book follows the life of a Native American teenager throughout one school year. Goddard Public Schools and Derby Public Schools banned the book a year earlier.
The Gardner Edgerton district also in 2022 approved a policy targeting trans students, forbidding them from using their preferred restroom or playing on a sports team that doesn’t align with their sex assigned at birth, which can differ from gender identity.
The new PEN America report indicated that actions from the federal government have influenced book banning in the U.S. — from President Donald Trump’s executive orders that reference “radical indoctrination in K-12 schools,” “gender ideology extremism,” and “radical and wasteful DEI programs and preferencing,” to the U.S. Department of Education declaring book bans a hoax. 
Plus, the report said, ​​“persistent attacks conflate LGBTQ+ identities as ‘sexually explicit’ and erase LGBTQ+ representation from schools” since book banning ballooned in 2021. The report forecasts greater censorship of LGBTQ+ content nationwide.
“Rather than offering histories, stories, and books that reflect all students and families, LGBTQ+ stories will be omitted from classrooms,” the report said. “LGBTQ+ students and their families will effectively be denied the freedom to read about themselves and those around them.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Gardner-Edgerton-school-office-1-1-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-10-08 16:58:41.689492

(Jordan Hansen/Daily Montanan)BOZEMAN – In what felt at times like a solemn church service and others a rock concert celebrating conservatism, Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte and Ohio gubernatorial candidate Vivek Ramaswamy took the stage Tuesday night at Turning Point USA’s event on Montana State’s campus in Bozeman.
The organization’s founder, Charlie Kirk, was killed last month during a Turning Point event in Utah. Both Gianforte and Ramaswamy shared stories and lessons they took from the late right-wing influencer. Both men also used the event as a call to action for conservatives, giving those in attendance ideas on ways to uphold their version of Kirk’s legacy. Ramaswamy also took questions from the crowd for about an hour.
Around 3,000 people attended the event, held at Brick Breeden Fieldhouse and scheduled prior to Kirk’s death. Finance CEO Laine Schoneberger, of Yrefy, also spoke during the event.

There was no loud music and the security presence was noticeable – prior to the event, even Montana State athletes looking to enter the fieldhouse had to empty their pockets and step through a metal detector. 
Not everyone in attendance followed Kirk prior to his death, including Paul Colella, 59, from Manhattan. Colella decided to come, he said, to support the overall cause and said the conservative movement in the country has never been stronger.
“Trying to awaken a silenced group that, we think, has been silenced for a long time, and now, I think this whole event and the past few months has awakened that flame,” Colella said.
Many, including Colella, said they respected how Kirk interacted with people who did not share his views. One of Turning Point USA’s goals is to engage college students, which Kirk often did.
“I always appreciated that he would take the folks that did not agree with him and put him to the front of the line and say, let’s have a conversation,” Colella said. “And to me, I don’t see as much on the other side. I wish I did, but I don’t.”
Some figures in Montana state politics, including Flathead Rep. Braxton Mitchell, joined the event. Mitchell caught the attention of Turning Point in his youth, he told the Flathead Beacon last month.
“It was a great event and I was extremely encouraged to see so many other young people show up and express their beliefs and opinions,” Mitchell said in an email to the Daily Montanan on Wednesday. “This is truly a ‘Turning Point’ in our state and country. The Left has no idea what beast they’ve awakened after murdering our generations top political voice.”
Videos, including clips of Kirk speaking, played prior to Gianforte and Ramaswamy taking the stage, highlighted this idea. 
“They’re deciding, even though it might jeopardize their job, their career or their reputation, to put their country over themselves,” Kirk said in a video speaking about college students involved with Turning Point USA.
Following Kirk’s death, conservative influencers targeted individuals — including some people in Montana — for social media comments made following his death. There was some celebration over Kirk’s murder which caused anger in conservative circles, though many progressive politicians were quick to renounce his killing.
Kirk was a controversial figure, generating backlash because of his views on race, sexuality and even COVID.

Though Kirk had gained fame through the use of social media, Gianforte’s message to the crowd of younger-skewing audience members was similar to that of his fellow Western-state governor Spencer Cox, a Republican from Utah, where Kirk was slain. 
Gianforte told the crowd to spend less time online and more time “touching grass,” a phrase Cox used to describe needing to disconnect after spending a long time on screens. 
“We cannot and should not retreat into the dark corners of social media,” Gianforte said. “Seek out people with different views, engage them in respectful in person dialog, go get a coffee.”
Gianforte —  an unabashedly conservative Christian — also told the audience the first way they could honor Kirk was “to pursue faith in God.”
Gianforte spoke for about 15 minutes and shared his memories of Kirk. The governor was one of Turning Point’s original donors, he said, and also spoke about a three-day hike he took with Kirk. Gianforte began and ended with a prayer, in what felt more like a sermon than a politician’s speech.
“God’s plan for the world is to overcome evil with good. Charlie did that. The Bible says the light shines in the darkness, but the darkness did not overcome it,” Gianforte said. “What is that light? The Bible tells us it’s Jesus. Charlie did not know his assassin, but I have no doubt that he loved him.”

Christianity became a central theme of the evening, with Ramaswamy — who is Hindu — asked several questions regarding his faith, which led to discussion of the Christian Holy Trinity and monotheism.
One person asked how Ramaswamy was able to mix his personal beliefs with those of Turning Point, a Christian organization.
“In my faith, I believe there’s one true God,” Ramaswamy said. “He resides in all of us, and He appears in different forms, but it’s one true God. So I’m an ethical monotheist. That’s the way I would describe my faith.”
He also said conservatives have an “obligation” to stand up for the “truth God is real.” Other questions he got included the topics of abortion, Israel and the job market.
Time is also running short to implement changes conservatives want to see, he added.
“If we don’t utilize the levers of power now, if we don’t stamp out toxic dissent, now if we don’t rectify the country now, then we never will,” Ramaswamy said. “We have a short window to act right now, and we got to step up and seize the moment.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/TPUSA1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-08 16:58:41.689492

(Photo courtesy of DMACC)Des Moines Area Community College has postponed on-campus interviews for presidential search finalists due to candidates dropping out as President Rob Denson’s last days with the college grow closer.
Two of the three finalists set to head to campus for interviews “suddenly withdrew their names from consideration” to be chosen as DMACC’s next president, according to a Wednesday news release. DMACC Board President and presidential search committee chair Kevin Halterman said in an interview both candidates pulled out for personal reasons — “nothing that was alarming, just unfortunate for us.”
Halterman said in the release he feels good about the third candidate’s quality, but bringing only one finalist to campus wouldn’t allow the college community to consider different leadership styles and approaches when it comes to DMACC and their vision for the future. Candidates were supposed to come to campus in mid-October for interviews, he said.

“While this is a disappointing development for our search, we are committed to getting the right candidate, even if it takes longer than we’d originally planned,” Halterman said in the release.
Denson, DMACC’s current and longest-serving president, announced his retirement in January and set his last day for Dec. 30. The college board of directors will hold a special meeting online at 2 p.m. Friday to discuss the possibility of appointing an interim president after Denson’s departure if a new president hasn’t been selected, Halterman said in the interview.
Larry Ebbers, the search consultant hired by DMACC to help with the presidential search, will join the board at its Oct. 13 meeting to sketch out a plan going forward.
“Despite this temporary setback, we remain confident in the search process and the attractiveness of this job,” Halterman said in the release. “DMACC is a strong institution with outstanding students, faculty, and staff. They deserve another equally great president.”

In his order, […]","Photo illustration by Getty Images.A Butte-Silver Bow County District Court judge has ruled a lawsuit alleging the state has violated its constitutional duty to equalize taxes fairly so that the burden doesn’t fall disproportionately to residential taxpayers can continue, even though attorneys for the Montana Department of Revenue had asked for the case to be dismissed.
In his order, judge Robert J. Whelan said that residents Thomas and Cindra Lord-Powers and Ryan and Elizabeth Swenson have made a prima facia case that would seem to suggest that the Gianforte administration and the Montana Department of Revenue made no attempt to equalize the taxes, as required by the Montana Constitution. Article VIII of the constitution says that property taxes can’t be shifted unfairly or disproportionately onto residential property owners.
Previously, attorneys for the state had told the court that the exclusive remedy allowed in state law was to challenge a county assessment of property taxes. Meanwhile, attorneys for the residents said that they weren’t contesting the actual valuations assigned to their property, rather that the administration had failed to equitably equalize property taxes, especially for larger businesses, and instead shifted that burden to residential property tax owners.
“At this pleading stage, (the property owners) have unquestionably pled a failure of (the state) to perform any equalization to account for the shifting of tax burden from commercial to residential property owners which arose from the alleged use of different appraisal methodologies during a period of rapid inflation,” Whelan said in his order.
The judge also determined that Montana law cannot stop residents from seeking justice in court, and that the Legislature couldn’t provide only an administrative remedy for a constitutional right.
“Section 15-1-406 does not provide a remedy for the equalization failure pled in this case, nor does any other statute in Montana’s tax code,” the order said. “The constitutionally mandated balancing between and among different classes of taxpayers must be addressable with a remedy adequate to resolve the unavoidable constitutional duty to achieve such balancing.”
Whelan also said that residential property owners in this case weren’t disputing their own assessments, rather challenging the “principle” which the state used to determine all taxes.
“While an erroneous outcome for an individual taxpayer can be remedied individually, an erroneous outcome for whole classes of similarly situated or affected taxpayers — including taxpayers who benefit by not paying their fair, equalized share — requires exceptional relief,” the order said.
The lawsuit was filed in 2024, before the 2025 Legislature made several changes to the state’s tax code, including the way Montana will classify second homes or vacation property. Still, the lawsuit raises questions about whether Montana’s assessment of taxes makes sure businesses and “centrally assessed” properties — those are businesses that have multiple properties throughout the state — are paying their fair share.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/GettyImages-1410759881-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-08 16:58:41.689492

But on Wednesday, Diamantis’ defense attorney, Norm Pattis, sought to shift the narrative to show that it was Diamantis who was being taken advantage of.  
Pattis used the cross examination of Antonietta DiBenedetto Roy, the owner of Construction Advocacy Professionals, to argue that she willingly hired Diamantis’ daughter in order to gain favor with him.
Roy told the jurors on Tuesday that she selected Diamantis’ daughter for a $40 per hour job at her firm and that she later secured several lucrative contracts overseeing local school projects in Tolland, Hartford and New Britain, as a result.
Pattis argued on Tuesday, however, that Diamantis never forced Roy to hire his daughter or to award her additional bonuses. 
“Mr. Diamantis never told you to hire his daughter, correct?” Pattis asked.
“Not directly,” Roy replied.
Roy also acknowledged after further questioning that Diamantis never directly threatened to harm her company if she refused to keep paying his daughter.
[The Kosta Diamantis Timeline: What you need to know]
Pattis suggested to the jury that Roy’s statements were evidence that she undertook those actions on her own to gain influence with Diamantis and to profit off the work on Connecticut school projects.
“I did need to keep him happy,” Roy told Pattis during the exchange.
“But that was on you,” Pattis said, adding that Diamantis never made a direct threat to harm Roy’s company.
“Mr. Diamantis created an atmosphere of fear,” Roy said, adding that he had immense influence over who worked on school projects.
“It was his demeanor within the industry,” she added. “You didn’t want to be on his bad side.” 
Pattis did not try to directly refute any of the hard evidence that prosecutors shared with the jury the day before, including the existence of several checks that Roy made out to Diamantis.
But he used Roy’s testimony to argue that that money was intended as political contributions that were needed to get construction projects accomplished in places like Hartford.
Pattis openly acknowledged on several occasions that Diamantis held a large amount of “power” and “clout” as the head of the Connecticut Office of School Construction Grants and Review, but Pattis argued it was that prominent position that prompted construction contractors to try to cozy up to Diamantis.  
Pattis’ defense strategy focused on showing that Diamantis never extorted any school construction contractors, as the prosecutors have claimed.
The two assistant U.S. Attorneys leading the prosecution allowed Pattis to question Roy with nearly no interruptions or objections. And when she was done testifying, they quickly moved ahead with other parts of their case.
During his opening statement, Assistant U.S. Attorney Jonathan Francis said the case against Diamantis could be summarized in two parts: “bribes” and “influence.”
The first two witnesses to testify in the trial — Roy and John Duffy, the vice president of Acranom Masonry — told jurors that they bribed Diamantis by hiring his daughter and paying him tens of thousands of dollars.
The witnesses who took the stand on Wednesday afternoon, however, were meant to highlight the vast influence Diamantis exerted on behalf of those contractors. 
First, the jury heard from Brian Ouelette, the president of Newfield Construction.
Ouelette, who worked as a construction manager on the Weaver High School project in Hartford, told the jury how Diamantis helped to resolve a billing dispute between the city and Acranom Masonry, which resulted in the company earning an additional $300,000.
And he described how Diamantis stepped in to make sure Acranom won another contract worth more than $3 million for that same high school, despite concerns about the company’s reportedly “subpar” workmanship on the project. 
Ouelette told the jury that Diamantis directly intervened on Acranom’s behalf to make sure they were paid. During the billing dispute, Ouelette said, Diamantis called him and other construction officials into his office in Hartford and took Acranom’s side.
Prosecutors also showed the jury an email in which members of Ouelette’s team said they had no choice but to hire Acranom on another phase of the project because Diamantis controlled the “power of the purse” and said the state would not pay for the masonry work unless Acranom got the job.
“The project has no financial choice but to award to Acranom,” the email said.
During that testimony, Diamantis rocked slowly in his chair at the defense table. 
Pattis portrayed Diamantis’ actions as those of someone who was trying to save the state money and to avoid a costly lawsuit with Acranom.
“Kosta was a hands-on director, and that rubbed people the wrong way, right?” Pattis asked Ouelette.
“Is that a question?” Ouelette asked.
After Ouelette was done testifying, prosecutors called Sal Salafia, another experienced construction official, to the witness stand to testify about how Roy’s company was picked to be a project manager on the Bulkeley High School project in Hartford.
Salafia, who worked for O&G Industries for more than 30 years, said his company was already representing the city of Hartford on that project as a project manager. 
But he told the jury that Diamantis issued a directive for the city to hire another company to perform the same type of work. That company ended up being Construction Advocacy Professionals.

(Photo by Sarahbeth Maney/ProPublica)Oil producer Chevron is laying off more than 100 workers in North Dakota after acquiring Hess Corp., a greater impact than initially expected. 
Chevron notified Job Service North Dakota that it would lay off 111 workers — 63 in Minot and 48 at Tioga — beginning Sept. 26. 
Chevron completed its merger with Hess July 18, driving the layoffs. The company initially told the state there would be 70 layoffs, but revised that number higher this week. 
“We understand the impact this news may have on employees, their families and the communities where we operate,” Chevron said in a statement. “Our priority is to support our employees through this transition. We are offering severance benefits and outplacement support.”
A Chevron spokesperson said the cuts included a variety of positions. 
Growth of AI creates new markets for North Dakota natural gas, governor says

Ron Ness, president of the North Dakota Petroleum Council, said Chevron’s takeover of Hess is one of several mergers in the oil and gas industry as companies seek to be more efficient in the face of lower oil prices. 
“Consolidation is part of the industry trend to try to lower your per barrel costs,” Ness said. 
Reuters reported last month that cutbacks in the U.S. oil and gas industry have been widespread.
Phil Davis, Workforce Services director for North Dakota Job Service, said the agency has not seen an increase in traffic at its Workforce Centers in Minot and Williston, which may be an indication that laid off workers have already found employment. 
A state report on North Dakota’s oil and gas economy shows 1,013 job openings in North Dakota’s four core oil and gas producing counties in August, down more than 2% from August and down more than 13% from a year ago. 
The report notes that the price of North Dakota oil is about 16% below last year’s levels. 
“The price of oil still has a major influence on the amount of activity, the amount of work out there,” Ness said. “We’ve probably seen a little bit of a dip.” 
North Dakota has 32 active drilling rigs this week, compared to 39 one year ago, according to the North Dakota Department of Mineral Resources. 
North Dakota is the nation’s No. 3 oil producing state.
At the North Dakota Petroleum Council’s annual meeting last month in Watford City, Chevron Vice President Kim McHugh said the company is committed to developing in shale oil formations like North Dakota’s Bakken. 
“The Bakken fits nicely into our portfolio,” she said. 
North Dakota’s unemployment rate remains low at about 2.5%.

Jon Ossoff is boasting a major fundraising haul as he heads into 2026 and the election that will determine whether he gets six more years in office.,"Sen. Jon Ossoff announce he raised $12 million in the last three months to fund his re-election campaign. Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderU.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff is boasting a major fundraising haul as he heads into 2026 and the election that will determine whether he gets six more years in office.
Ossoff’s camp said Wednesday that the Democratic senator’s quarterly financial disclosure, which is due to the Federal Election Commission by Oct. 15, will show he raised $12 million in the last three months and enters the final quarter of the year with $21 million on hand.
As of Wednesday afternoon, Ossoff’s report has not yet been made public on the FEC’s website, but his campaign says the $12 million came from more than 223,000 donors, 93% of whom made contributions of $100 or less.
“Republicans are already spending millions of dollars targeting Senator Ossoff yet our campaign continues to build an unstoppable grassroots coalition to win next November. We remain grateful for small-dollar donors who are powering us to victory,” Ossoff campaign manager Ellen Foster said in a statement.
Ossoff, who flipped his seat for Democrats in early 2021 after a tight runoff election, is the only Democratic senator running for re-election in a state won by Republican President Donald Trump in 2024. National Republicans have made Ossoff’s seat a top target for next year. Three high-profile GOP candidates have signed up to challenge him.
The Republican challengers
Republican Congressman Buddy Carter also touted his fundraising efforts on Wednesday, posting to social media that he raised nearly $900,000 in the previous quarter.
Carter says his campaign has raised nearly $4 million since he announced his run in May and leads the GOP field in cash on hand with $3.8 million. Carter’s previous FEC filing shows he loaned his campaign $2 million.
“We didn’t inherit anything from daddy. We‘re earning it — every dime, every vote,” Carter said on social media. “The others can keep fighting for second. We’re focused on winning for Georgia.”
The daddy line was likely a dig at his GOP opponents, Georgia Congressman Mike Collins and  former University of Tennessee football coach Derek Dooley. Collins’ father was Mac Collins, a successful businessman and member of Congress, and Dooley, who entered the race with the endorsement of Gov. Brian Kemp, is the son of celebrated University of Georgia football coach Vince Dooley.
Both Collins and Dooley have claimed multi-million dollar war chests of their own to take on Ossoff.
The FEC has not yet published any of the three Republicans’ filings as of Wednesday afternoon, but earlier this week Collins and Dooley each said they raised nearly $2 million since declaring their candidacies over the summer.
Collins’ campaign is also emphasizing the role of small donors in his fundraising, claiming an average contribution of $47.31 from more than 40,000 people.
“Ossoff will be formidable and Collins is the only candidate who’s shown he’s got the small dollar, grassroots fundraising prowess that can compete for Republicans,” said Collins spokesman Corbin Keown.
Dooley’s campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The fundraising gap will likely shrink once Georgia GOP voters decide on their candidate. The primary election is scheduled for May 19, and Election Day is set for Nov. 3. The race is expected to be hard-fought and expensive for both sides.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-08 20:15:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Trump threatens Blumenthal with investigation after Bondi dustup,Lisa Hagen,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/08/trump-blumenthal-military-investigation-pam-bondi-dustup/,Clashes between CT's U.S. senators and the Trump administration intensified as battle lines hardened with no movement on the federal shutdown.,"Shortly after U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal pressed a top Trump administration official over concerns of politically motivated prosecutions and investigations, the Connecticut Democrat got a threat of an investigation from the president himself.
President Donald Trump called for an investigation into Blumenthal Tuesday night, re-litigating a 2008 comment in which the senator said he “served in Vietnam.” It wasn’t the first time Trump went after Blumenthal, who acknowledged he misspoke, over this matter. 
But it reflected a longstanding feud that was reignited as Democrats questioned the administration on what they see as the weaponization of the government and the U.S. Department of Justice against political opponents.
“This guy shouldn’t even be in the U.S. Senate. It should be investigated, and Justice should be sought. Right now there is a Congressman sitting in prison for lying about his past during a campaign,” Trump posted on his preferred social media platform Truth Social. “Well, those lies were nothing compared to those of Richard ‘Da Nang Dick’ Blumenthal, perhaps the greatest phony in the history of the United States Senate. He should be allowed to speak no longer!”
Blumenthal brushed aside what he called an “unhinged rant” that is nothing new to him. And he argued it’s an example of the president deflecting attention as a way to not answer questions about the targeting of political foes or giving preference to those close to him. 
“I must have really gotten under Donald Trump’s skin. He seems to be lashing out with personal attacks because he doesn’t want to answer questions about why he’s covering up the Epstein files or selectively prosecuting his political adversaries or dropping antitrust cases against his corrupt cronies or a lot of other issues where he is distracting from the truth,” Blumenthal told reporters Wednesday at the U.S. Capitol.
Clashes between Connecticut’s U.S. senators and the Trump administration intensified this week as the battle lines hardened with no movement on a government shutdown.
Both Blumenthal and U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy have repeatedly raised concerns over actions taken by Trump and his allies inside and outside of the White House. They have issues repeated warnings about threats to democracy and free speech. And while they sought to keep the heat on, the administration also fiercely defended its approach and came out swinging against specific Democratic lawmakers, including Blumenthal.
Blumenthal said he wouldn’t be “silenced or intimidated by [Trump’s] bullying.”
Trump’s post about Blumenthal stemmed from a contentious exchange at a Tuesday hearing between the senator and U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi that at one point turned personal.
Blumenthal used his time during the hearing to ask about conversations Bondi may have had with the president regarding the indictment of former FBI Director James Comey as well as any contact with someone tied to her former workplace. He brought signs to the hearing that showed Trump’s social media post directed toward Bondi about several Trump critics and saying that “justice should be served.” On Wednesday, Comey pleaded not guilty, and his lawyers will seek to dismiss the case as a “vindictive prosecution.”
“In fact, five days before the indictment of James Comey, he put this post up as instructions to you. He didn’t mince words. He was very open and public that you should indict James Comey and others because they are ‘Guilty as hell. No more delay. Now.’ Five days before you indicted — or a grand jury at your instructions indicted James Comey,” Blumenthal said. 
He repeatedly pressed Bondi and asked whether she had any conversations with Trump about prosecuting Comey before the DOJ’s indictment.
Bondi declined to publicly detail any conversations she had with the president 
“You are an attorney. You have a law degree, and you know that I’m not going to do that,” Bondi said, reading a quote from him in 2017 when Blumenthal said that no one is above the law and “the judicial process move forward without political interference.”
During their testy back-and-forth, Bondi made a dig at Blumenthal and his past characterizations of his military service.
It came up as Blumenthal questioned Bondi over mergers and any conversations she had with Brian Ballard, the head of the law firm where she formerly worked. He asked about Ballard’s lobbying the Justice Department on antitrust issues. 
“Sen. Blumenthal, I cannot believe that you would accuse me of impropriety when you lied about your military service. You lied — you admitted you lied — to be elected a U.S. senator. You lied. How dare you. I’m a career prosecutor. Don’t you ever challenge my integrity,” Bondi said.
Blumenthal said he wasn’t questioning her integrity and asked her again about conversations with Ballard, which went unanswered. His five minutes of questioning during the hearing ended with her saying she’s “abided by every ethics standard.”
At a press conference in 2010, Blumenthal, who was a stateside U.S. Marine Corps reservist during the Vietnam War, denied he lied about his military service and acknowledged that he “misspoke” in 2008. At that time, he told an audience in Norwalk, “We have learned something important since the days that I served in Vietnam.”
“I fully addressed the issue of my military service 15 years ago, and the voters of Connecticut had rejected it in three separate elections when they overwhelmingly voted in favor of me,” Blumenthal said Wednesday. “I’m proud of my military service, having been in the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve for six years and honorably discharged as a sergeant.”
Meanwhile, hours after Blumenthal and Bondi’s clash, Murphy continued his grim warnings about how democracy in the U.S. could slip into authoritarianism through various efforts like National Guard troop deployments to certain cities and the threats to broadcast licenses of media groups.

He went step-by-step to explain that democracies don’t always fall victim to seminal moments like a coup or violence. Instead, Murphy argued, a democracy typically erodes more slowly over time because “the party in power just contracts the space for dissent, for speech, for political opposition.”
“You can’t see the indictment of Comey, the cancellation of [Jimmy] Kimmel, the troops in Chicago as different events. They are all part of the same story. They are all part of a plan, a well-thought out plan to try to destroy American democracy and create a new set of rules that will allow Trump and his allies to rule forever,” Murphy said in a floor speech Tuesday as a few other senators spoke about the shutdown.
“I know this sounds extreme. It is,” he continued. “But if you connect the dots, if you allow yourself to see the whole story, the totality of this story, you will see the grave danger that we are in.”
Murphy, who has been lauded on the left as an emerging leader of the party and criticized by the right as a Trump antagonist, has been persistent in his argument that democracy is on the line. He acknowledged Tuesday that his Republican colleagues dismiss his persistent warnings as an exaggeration. And the White House and Trump himself have taken issue with Murphy’s rhetoric that they have described as inflammatory.
But for Murphy, it’s a sentiment he believes must be deliberately spelled out before it’s too late.
“We are on the verge of an authoritarian takeover. We are in the middle of it,” Murphy said. “It’s not certain to be successful, but if we aren’t clear-eyed about what’s happening, then we have no chance to arrest it.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-08-at-10.58.45-AM-1024x571.png,,,2025-10-08 16:58:41.689492

(Photo illustration by Getty Images.)The Montana Legislature grappled with a lot of technological innovation during the 2025 session including determining how to regulate the growing digital economy and this month has seen the launch of new laws and committees focused on the digital space. 
One new law, the Financial Freedom and Innovation Act, took effect in October, paving the way for companies that issue network tokens to do business in Montana, and ensuring the State Auditor’s office has authority to regulate the burgeoning industry and prosecute bad actors. 
The bill, Senate Bill 265, carried by Sen. Daniel Zolnikov, R-Billings, defines a number of buzzwords in the digital asset space — such as network token, blockchain, and decentralized network — in state law. It also provides the framework for uses of network tokens and what boxes businesses must check off to do business in Montana. 
Under the new Innovation Act in Montana, companies that issue digital tokens — used to power decentralized services like computing, data storage and media streaming, among other things — can register with the Commissioner’s office as non-securities assets, making Montana among the first states to do so.  
Zolnikov said network tokens have the ability to decentralize so many parts of industry, essentially cutting out middle man companies, which he said fits a Montanan ethos. 
“If you have a new technology that’s an exception to the rule, but you want to play by the rules, what do you do?” he said. “We finally gave them a regulatory path forward.”
In a press release, Commissioner of Securities and Insurance Jim Brown said the new law charts the course for “responsible innovation.”
“This law gives entrepreneurs the certainty they need while ensuring Montanans are protected. SB 265 strengthens both our business climate and our national reputation as a state that embraces innovation while striking the right balance,” Brown said. 
Speaking to the Daily Montanan this week, Brown said that one of his office’s main roles is to protect Montana consumers from “fraudsters and bad actors.”
“Not only in the insurance area, but in financial institutions, which includes digital currencies and anything related to the blockchain,” Brown said. “…At this point in the world of digital currency, there isn’t a whole lot on the books in Montana about giving either my office or the attorney general’s office the authority to either regulate companies or persons who engage in this.”
On the consumer protection front, Brown has been advocating on a national level to strengthen laws in the digital space. He recently joined with securities regulators from across the nation in urging the federal government to move forward with regulating aspects of the digital economy, including giving states prosecutorial authority in the digital space. 
In a letter sent last month, Brown and his counterparts with the North American Securities Administrators Association asked for changes to a proposed federal market structure legislation that he said “is a gift to fraudsters,” by limited actions states can take to investigate and charge crypto scammers. 
The Association is also behind legislation called the Support Anti-Fraud Enforcement (SAFE) Act which would cement state authority to prosecute fraud involving digital assets. 
“We believe we have the authority to go after these bad actors,” Brown said. “I take the authority of this office to prosecute bad actors very seriously to protect consumers. … and we don’t want to create a system where smaller bad actors fall through the cracks.”
Brown said with the explosion of digital assets in recent years, his office has seen a parallel increase in fraudulent claims within the digital space. 
Last year, his office received nine complaints of digital asset fraud, totaling more than a million dollars. Through September of this year, his office has already received 20 complaints — to the tune of $3.1 million. 
On Tuesday, Brown’s office issued a press release about an individual charged in Missoula County for defrauding investors, including several elderly Montanans, through a fraudulent cryptocurrency scheme. 
According to the release, an Idaho resident and two uncharged co-conspirators set up a “fund” of more than one million dollars from investors purportedly invested in cryptocurrency. 
The defendant is charged with six felony counts of elder exploitation, securities fraud, operating a pyramid promotional scheme and operating as a securities dealer without a license. 
“By the end of the century, (blockchain technology and digital assets) are going to be so integrated in our economy and our way of life that people won’t even recognize how we operated financially in 2025,” Brown told the Daily Montanan. “While that’s exciting and I want to be on the forefront as a regulator and help support that, we have to keep our ability to prosecute bad actors. We can’t have it be the wild west out here.”
  Blockchain and Digital Innovation Task Force holds first meeting 

On Monday, members of the newly formed Blockchain and Digital Innovation Task Force met for the first time to discuss the state of cryptocurrency and digital asset regulation in Montana and how to remain competitive in the digital economy. 
The task force, created during the 2025 Legislature, is comprised of legislators, representatives from the State Auditor and Attorney General’s offices, and public members with experience in the financial or digital technology sectors. 
Co-chair Sen. Gayle Lammars, R-Hardin, said he envisions the task force as “a big brainstorming operation.”
“So many people think about crypto when they think about blockchain, but it’s so much more than that, so much more than the financial end of it,” Lammars told the task force. “But, it has implications in agriculture, fraud, chain of custody, record keeping — all kinds of things we could apply this baby to.”
One area of discussion on Monday revolved around Wyoming’s approach to digital assets, which has included launching their own state-backed cryptocurrency. 
“They’ve certainly laid the baseline for this,” Brown, a member of the task force, told the Daily Montanan. “We might not be looking at having Montana be the issuer of a stablecoin, but we will look at a model of what’s made Wyoming a leader in blockchain technology … we’ll look at how Montana can be an innovator like Wyoming is, maybe even going beyond what they’ve done.”
In upcoming meetings, the task force will focus on educational sessions to understand the scope of the digital economy and identify specific topics to tackle, as well as examine how the other states are currently regulating blockchain and other digital technologies. 
“I think we’re going to be able to come up with some real great stuff here to make our lives easier, and to protect the people in Montana,” Lammars said.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/crypto-currency-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-10-08 16:58:41.689492

Hillary Cassel poses in front of the Holocaust memorial outside the Florida Capitol on March 25, 2025. (Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)A Florida lawmaker who suddenly switched parties last year filed a state version of a federal bill Wednesday that would ban courts and agencies from using Shari’a Law.
Rep. Hillary Cassel, a Broward Republican who served in the state House as a Democrat for two years, issued HB 119 banning Florida courts, panels, tribunals, or agencies from basing decisions on the Islamic Shari’a code or other foreign legal systems.
Cassel’s measure comes a month after U.S. Rep. Randy Fine, also a Florida Republican, filed a nearly identical bill outlawing enforcement of Sharia law.
Shari’a is Islam’s legal system derived from the Quran. Its interpretations vary depending on five schools of thought and local culture, guiding ethical conduct and suggesting criminal punishments.
When asked for an interview inside the Capitol by a Phoenix reporter, Cassel said, “Not today,” and referred the reporter to her office, which did not respond to a text message. When asked later why she filed the measure, Cassel asked, “Did you read the bill?” and walked off when asked whether she based it on Fine’s bill.
Entitled the “No Shari’a Act,” the bill recognizes that although state entities may “freely contract,” that right is nullified when it comes to a foreign legal code — like Shari’a — that would “violate the fundamental liberties, rights, and privileges guaranteed by the United States Constitution and the State Constitution.”
Rulings or decisions of a state court, arbitration panel, tribunal, or administrative agency based on “Shari’a or any foreign law, legal code, or system,” or any contract providing for “the choice of Shari’a or any foreign law, legal code, or system,” would be declared null and void.
Heightened religious tensions spark legislation
The measure comes amid religious tensions heightened by the war in Gaza. Israel launched a no-holds-barred counter-offensive in Gaza to root out Hamas, a Palestinian designated-terrorist organization funded by Iran, after the militia massacred Israelis at a music festival on Oct. 7, 2023.
The Israeli response has left tens of thousands of Palestinians dead, splitting U.S. politicians over whether to keep backing Israel or support Palestinians in their quest for statehood. President Donald Trump is engaging in peace talks between Palestinian authorities and Israeli politicos.
The Middle Eastern war has had political ramifications felt throughout the United States. Both antisemitism and Islamophobia spiked following Oct. 7 while politicians nationwide either heartily backed Israel — as most did in Florida — or urged an immediate end to hostilities. Liberal college students set up university encampments demanding a divestment of funds from Israel while the right urged continued war in Gaza.
Fine, a former state senator who was the Legislature’s sole Jewish Republican, was the staunchest pro-Israel member and frequently made inflammatory social media comments such as urging “Bombs Away” in Gaza. Now a member of Congress, he filed his “No Shari’a Act” in September, Newsweek reported.
State Rep. Chase Tramont, a Port Orange Republican, filed a bill last month similarly arising from the Gaza war that would ban state agencies from mentioning the West Bank, the Israeli-occupied Palestinian territory, and enforce “Judea and Samaria” as its official name.
The 2026 session begins on Jan. 13.

Photo: Adobe StockFood assistance programs threatened by the federal government shutdown will continue in North Carolina through October, the state Department of Health and Human Services said Wednesday, despite earlier concerns that at least one might run out of money.
The nutrition program for women, infants, and children, or WIC, helps low-income pregnant, recently pregnant and breastfeeding women, and babies and children up to age 5. 
Benefits are used for “WIC approved” items such as infant cereal, baby foods, fruits and vegetables, dairy products, peas and beans. WIC also offers breastfeeding support, nutrition education and medical referrals. About 262,000 women, babies, and children use WIC in North Carolina, according to DHHS.
When the shutdown began on Oct. 1, the National WIC Association estimated that funding could run out in a week or two. However, the White House said Tuesday it will use tariff revenue to keep WIC afloat. 
The federal supplemental nutritional assistance program, or SNAP, is an even larger program.
About 1.4 million people in the state use SNAP to buy food, according to a DHHS press release. Beneficiaries must meet income limits and benefit amounts are based on household size. 
The federal government provided October benefits for SNAP in September before the shutdown started, according to the nonprofit Federal Research and Action Center. 
“Food and nutrition are foundational to good health and people should not have to worry about their families and communities going hungry,” state Health and Human Services Secretary Dev Sangvai said in a statement. “NCDHHS hopes for a quick resolution to the federal shutdown to ensure people in North Carolina are not at risk of losing critical food benefits.”
Congress failed to agree on a budget to fund the federal government after Sept. 30.

Those tax credits are set to expire at the end of 2025, resulting in dramatically higher premiums.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/AdobeStock_FoodPantry-1024x685.jpg,,,2025-10-08 16:58:41.689492

Its former rep in Congress writes that Nashville provides a cautionary tale against splitting the state’s largest city into multiple districts. (Getty Images)The ugly specter of mid-term gerrymandering may be rearing its head in Kentucky, and the potential disruption to our state’s federal representation is impossible to overstate.
It started in Texas when President Donald Trump urged lawmakers there to redraw their congressional district boundaries in order to create more Republican seats and help protect the GOP’s slim majority in the U.S. House of Representatives. Predictably, Texas Republicans, supported by Trump acolyte Gov. Greg Abbott, complied. In response, California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom has initiated a process designed to do the same thing in his state, which could balance any Republican gains in Texas.
Historically, redistricting is done every 10 years following the decennial census. This makes sense because House seats are allocated based on population, which can change significantly over 10 years.
It is highly unusual for states to redraw district lines between censuses unless they are ordered to do so by the courts. In fact, since 1970, only Texas (twice) and Georgia have redistricted for partisan advantage. But now a redistricting battle is underway, and every state with one-party control and seats held by the minority party is under pressure to enter the fray. Kentucky is in that category.
My former seat, Kentucky’s 3rd Congressional District, the one now occupied by Morgan McGarvey, is one of the most “logical” districts anywhere. It currently includes all but roughly 20,000 people who live in Louisville Metro, and none outside the city lines. There is no confusion as to what member of Congress represents the interests of the Louisville community, including, for example, the University of Louisville. The mayor and the U.S. representative for the 3rd District have essentially the same constituencies, making coordination of multi-governmental efforts very effective and efficient.
Now there is discussion among some Republicans in Frankfort about splitting the Louisville community into three different congressional districts, presumably making it almost impossible, in the current environment, for a Democrat to be elected. This strategy was discussed briefly after the 2020 census, but the five Republican members of the Kentucky House delegation, along with Sen. Mitch McConnell, convinced Republicans in the General Assembly that it was a bad idea.
Under the concept under discussion back then, for example, a portion of Louisville would have become part of a district that extended south to the Tennessee border. Understandably, the Republican members of the federal delegation were happy with their “safe” districts and didn’t want a bunch of Louisville Democratic voters in their jurisdictions.
I don’t believe McConnell ever made any public comments about the idea, but I’m sure he understood the political risk of doing something so damaging to his hometown, and also the University of Louisville, to which he has always been fiercely loyal.
Now the idea apparently has resurfaced, as some Republican members of the Kentucky legislature somehow think they haven’t done enough to disenfranchise many Kentuckians, especially Louisvillians.
Federal court upholds Tennessee’s U.S. House map, rules it’s gerrymandered but not racially

Wiser heads must prevail. Tennessee offers a vivid lesson as to the damage such a move would do. Legislators there split Nashville into three districts during their decennial process. Now the state’s capital has three people representing it in the U.S. House, and this is one case in which more is not better.
The math is simple. Each congressional district across the country includes roughly 750,000 people. If you divide a district by three, that means in Nashville, 250,000 people are placed in a new district with 500,000 other Tennesseans, most of whom have little in common with them. If you are their representative, whose interests will have your priority? Clearly it is the 500,000, who will most likely have given you your victory margin.
Right now, Nashville has a Democratic mayor. He must work with three Republican representatives on any federal initiative. I recently spoke with a political scientist at Vanderbilt University who outlined the problems with such a setup. Vanderbilt, for example, has had to reorient its government relations efforts to deal with multiple Washington offices rather than one. I won’t go into all the problems caused in Nashville by this strategy, but suffice to say, Nashville has not benefitted from the redistricting, and neither has anyone else in Tennessee, except Republican candidates.
Missouri is about to do the same thing to Kansas City, breaking up its largest city and economic engine for strictly partisan electoral advantage, and in that case, essentially disenfranchising a large Black population from federal representation.
Hopefully, this idea will be nipped in the bud. No one should want the University of Louisville to have three representatives, none of whom would consider that institution a priority if they also represented Western Kentucky University or Morehead. It’s true that Louisville’s critical airport has only one representative, but how much interest would someone have in that critical facility if they also represented Bowling Green or Owensboro? Similar examples are numerous.
Louisville has never had a Black representative in Congress, but Black voters have a decisive impact on who represents them in Congress. That would not be the case if the district is sliced apart. It is a certainty that such a plan would be challenged in court on racial discrimination grounds.
Most Americans don’t like gerrymandering, which serves nothing but partisan electoral ambitions. They believe, as I do, that voters should choose their politicians; politicians should not choose their voters. I am less and less optimistic that today’s Kentucky Republican officials will consider the public interest, but hope springs eternal.

Lisa Boscola (D-Northampton) and Marty Flynn (D-Lackawanna), joined every Republican in supporting the measure.","The Pennsylvania Capitol (Peter Hall/Capital-Star)It’s been 100 days since the deadline for Pennsylvania lawmakers to pass a budget. In that time, counties, school districts and the organizations contracted to provide safety net services have been unable to receive state funds.
Last month, Treasurer Stacy Garrity, who is the leading candidate in the Republican gubernatorial primary, offered a stopgap solution in the form of low-interest loans to county governments and head start programs. It has since been expanded to domestic violence prevention and rape survivor support groups.
On Wednesday, the Senate passed a bill that would allow her department to forgive the interest on those loans.
Two Democrats, Sens. Lisa Boscola (D-Northampton) and Marty Flynn (D-Lackawanna), joined every Republican in supporting the measure.
Democrats argued that the treasurer’s office does not have the authority to loan money, and can  only make investments. They also said that the program, as instituted, has selectively helped some affected by the shutdown, like Head Start programs and county governments, at the expense of others, like school districts.
Sen. Vincent Hughes (D-Philadelphia), minority chair of the Appropriations Chair, said instead of authorizing no-interest loans, the Senate should instead pass a compromise budget negotiated with the Democrat-controlled House.
House Democrats have lined up votes on yet another proposed budget bill Wednesday afternoon, which will kick it back to the Senate. The latest proposal is expected to have a smaller total spend number than their previous proposal in an effort to compromise with Republicans.
“The treasury’s essentially illegal program does not have to be addressed, does not have to be considered, if we just adopt the budget that will be coming over,” Hughes said.
Republicans, however, defended the measure as a way to ensure the treasury has that authority and alleviate the impacts of the budget impasse on county governments and social service providers.
“If we had a budget, they’d have the money,” said Sen. President Pro Tempore Kim Ward (R-Westmoreland). “So I don’t know how we ask them to pay interest on something they should already have in their coffers. It just seems pretty common sense.”
As it stands, the 4.5% interest rates on loans from Garrity’s office has meant some eligible providers were unable to take advantage of the loans. The Pennsylvania Coalition Against Domestic Violence last week that the $5.8 million loan they were authorized for would result in $260,000 in interest, making it untenable.
In a statement, the group called on lawmakers to pass legislation allowing interest-free loans during the budget impasse.
The bill would have to be passed by the House and signed by Gov. Josh Shapiro to take effect.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_4184-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-08 15:58:01.105250

(Scott Olson/Getty Images)LINCOLN — Former President Joe Biden is coming to Nebraska next month for the Democratic state party’s top annual fundraising event. 
It will be one of the few public appearances for Biden since he dropped out of the 2024 presidential election amid concerns from party leaders over his electability following a debate performance against then-former President Donald Trump.
While Biden visited the state in 2017 and 2019, he never visited Nebraska during his 2020 campaign or presidency, breaking a streak of presidents making appearances in the state. Second gentleman Doug Emhoff went to Omaha for Biden before he dropped out. 
Presidential hopeful Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear earlier this year announced a visit to Nebraska in November. This continues the trend of prominent Democratic figures making their way to the heartland – particularly Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District, where it is likely the open seat will decide which party controls the U.S. House for the next two years.

Independent U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders launched his “Fighting Oligarchy” nationwide tour in Omaha. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz hosted a Democratic town hall earlier this year, and former Texas U.S. Rep. Beto O’Rourke had a similar town hall in August. 
The 2nd District’s single presidential electoral vote has swung from Republican to Democratic in recent years, most recently to former Vice President Kamala Harris in 2024.  Nebraska could regain the national spotlight in 2026 with the open seat and Dan Osborn’s nonpartisan Senate bid against Republican U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts. 
The midterms are emerging as crucial for the state Democratic party as it tries to find an opening. The events with prominent Democratic figures appear aimed at energizing the Nebraska Democratic base for the midterms, and come when two federal races could be competitive.  
The party has had some recent successes, including Democrat John Ewing Jr.’s defeat of three-term GOP incumbent Omaha Mayor Jean Stothert earlier this year. The party is looking to win a congressional seat for the first time since former U.S. Rep. Brad Ashford in 2017 and make gains in the Nebraska  Legislature, where Republicans have gained a legislative supermajority.

After nearly two weeks of picketing, unionized workers at the Dairy Farmers of America plant in St. Albans City came to a new contract agreement with their employer Tuesday. The length of their strike, and difficulties with negotiations, shed light on how federal cuts may result in drawn out labor negotiations. 
Members of the Teamsters Local 597 union left their work posts and took to the picket line Sept. 25 after attempting to negotiate with the dairy giant since June. Their cause drew the support of Lt. Gov. John Rodgers, who visited the picket line and offered to personally get involved in negotiations. 
Before the strike headed into its second week, union organizer Curtis Clough estimated the facility was running at about 10% capacity. He also said transport trucks were dumping thousands of gallons of milk because the facility couldn’t accept the product.

After Rodgers expressed support for the teamsters and the facility went shorthanded for almost two full weeks, the dairy company leveled with the union. 
“This new contract supports our employees and their families with competitive wages and benefits,” the company wrote in a Tuesday statement Tuesday. 
Employees will return to work, the company said in its statement. Clough sees the agreement as a win. 
“I really view it as a very solid contract full of benefits and language enhancements for the members,” he said.

Under the new contract, employees will see a 14.5% increase in wages within the next 22 months and some will see higher increases in pay depending on seniority. The new contract also prevents management from forcing overtime on employees and requires the employer to contribute more toward workers’ health care and pension plans. 
“One of the big sticking points in negotiations was always the 12-hour days in the lab,” Clough said. Now those are no more. 
Though both sides reached a resolution, Clough said it’s likely the strike would have been completely averted if federal labor mediators were involved.
In the union’s past negotiations with the dairy company, a federal mediator from Albany or Boston would get involved in the conversation and help everyone come to an agreement, Clough said. In three different instances, a strike was averted because mediators helped both sides find common ground, he said. 
But those mediators were fired this spring in a round of cuts by the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. 
DOGE, notorious for exaggerating its savings, slashed positions across the Federal Labor Mediation and Conciliation Service earlier this year. Those cuts are estimated to make up 0.0014% of the federal budget, according to The Guardian. 
Teamsters felt the effects. 
“This time, with the mediators being eliminated as part of the DOGE cuts, that option (of mediation) wasn’t there,” Clough said. 
Even though the picket carried on for longer, teamsters held out. 
“They stood up to a big titan and won,” Clough said.

After that, it would go for approval to Gov. Bob Ferguson, who has indicated a desire to see it proceed. 
In August, Ferguson rejected a recommendation to approve the Carriger Solar project from the Energy Facility Site Evaluation Council.
While he found the project “consistent with state policies,” he wanted the council to talk further with Yakama Nation leaders about their concerns for protecting cultural resources on and around the proposed location.
Ferguson gave the council 60 days to report back, but did not direct any specific changes to a site certification agreement between the developer and the state. This resulted in a revised agreement that the council will consider in a special meeting Oct. 21. If it is approved, it will go to the governor.
There’s one substantive change. Cypress Creek Renewables, the firm behind the energy project, will provide $100,000 in grant funding to the Yakama Nation Cultural Resources Program for continued documentation of the archaeological and historical properties “in the vicinity” of the project. The money must be paid within the first 10 years of the project’s operation.
The company supports the revised agreement and providing the grant funds, said Angeli Chandler, the firm’s director of communications.
She said there’d been “years of careful planning and siting to avoid impacts to environmental or cultural resources.” 
Yakama Nation officials who’ve opposed the project could not be immediately reached Tuesday.
Cypress Creek Renewables, based in Santa Monica, California, wants to build the solar farm north of State Route 142 along Knight Road, about two miles west of Goldendale in unincorporated Klickitat County. 
As envisioned, it will have 160 megawatts of solar generating potential, enough to power up to 32,500 homes, according to the company website. The project, which also includes a 63 megawatt battery energy storage system, will tie into the Bonneville Power Administration transmission system.
It would occupy 1,326 acres within a 2,108-acre development site that is mostly agricultural and rural residential lands. That footprint includes all solar arrays, battery storage facilities, operations and maintenance building, employee parking, and access roads.
The revised agreement requires fencing and solar panels be pushed farther from the state route, Knight Road and parcels managed by the state Department of Natural Resources adjacent to the project. There also must be additional natural screening, such as earthen berms, rock piles, or native vegetation, on the north side of those state-owned parcels.
It also requires that tribal access to traditional and cultural properties is maintained during construction.
In conversations since late August, Yakama Nation leaders reiterated their concerns about the project and sought significant changes in mitigation measures that did not get included in the proposed revised agreement.
For example, the tribe said the council should not allow installation of solar panels in the northern portion of the project area, rather than rely on setbacks and natural screening to minimize the visibility of the panels. If the council allowed panels in that area, it should first conduct a full environmental impact study, the tribe said.
Tribal leaders also insist there will be disruptions to traditional cultural properties.
Ferguson, in August, found little fault with much of the siting council’s handiwork and stressed the importance of acting rapidly enough for project developers to secure federal clean energy tax credits before they are ended by the Trump administration. Solar and wind projects must begin construction by July 4, 2026, to fully qualify for the credits, he wrote.
“These tax credits are critical to ensure not only that the project remains financially viable, but that the energy it generates will remain affordable for Washingtonians,” he wrote the council in August.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/solar-panel-2.jpg,,,2025-10-08 15:58:01.105250

(Photo of Creston High School courtesy of the Union County Assessor's Office; social-media posts are sourced from exhibits in U.S. District Court files)A high school English teacher from Creston, facing termination for a social-media comment regarding the killing of Charlie Kirk, is fighting back, citing a series of pro-Republican posts by the superintendent.
Teacher Melissa Crook has filed a lawsuit against the Creston Community School District, its superintendent and the school board, claiming her First Amendment rights are being violated and seeking an injunction blocking her dismissal.
As part of her lawsuit, Crook is citing numerous political and religious social-media posts allegedly made by Creston Community School District Superintendent Deron Stender over the past five years and by school board president Don Gee.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
In some of the posts, the superintendent has allegedly questioned the rights of immigrants; voiced support for Republicans including President Donald Trump, Elon Musk, and U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa; referred to former Rep. Liz Cheney, a Republican critic of Trump, as a “snake;” and called backers of former President Joe Biden, a Democrat, “snowflakes.”
Stender said Wednesday he cannot comment on his social-media posts, calling them a “personnel matter” that was handled by the school board. He also declined to comment on Crook’s lawsuit, calling it a separate personnel matter. Gee also declined to comment on either his posts or the lawsuit.
In her lawsuit, filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa, Crook, who has taught English for the Creston district since 2022, alleges she has been “subjected to retaliation, and is now threatened with the termination of her continuing-teaching contract, because of a private, off-duty comment on Facebook.”
Her Sept. 10, 2025, comment was made in response to a family member’s Facebook post about the shooting death of Kirk, a controversial, conservative political activist. The lawsuit states that “at her home, on her personal time, and using her personal Facebook account, Crook wrote, ‘He is a terrible human being … terrible. I do not wish death on anyone, but him not being here is a blessing.’”
Within a few hours, the lawsuit alleges, a conservative blog, the Iowa Standard, reported on Crook’s comment, identifying her by name and by her status as a public-school teacher working for the Creston district. The next morning, after seeing how others had perceived her original comment, Crook wrote on Facebook that she did “not wish anyone death” and apologized.
Later that morning, she issued a more extensive apology on her own Facebook page, stating: “I want to clarify a statement I made yesterday. I do NOT condone violence or the killing of people you disagree with politically or otherwise. That was never my intent. That is not who I am, nor what I believe. I believe strongly in the freedom of speech which also means I can disagree. I do not treat others poorly or wish them any harm because we do not agree … I am sorry I have offended people in this community believing that I condone killing others. I did not think he should be killed. After further review, I should have thought more about how I chose to post my thoughts, how it would sound. I take responsibility for the poor wording of my post.”
Also that day, Iowa House Speaker Pat Grassley, a Republican, took to Facebook to post his thoughts on the matter, writing, “I have been made aware of social-media posts by teachers in Iowa praising the assassination of Charlie Kirk. This hate has no place in our state and certainly does not belong in our schools. My expectation is that each school district will follow the proper protocol to investigate these posts and reprimand the posters appropriately. Individuals with this depravity cannot continue to hold a position with any level of influence over our children. If appropriate action is not taken, you can trust that the Iowa House Government Oversight Committee will address this issue and take action to root out this hate from our schools.”
School district launches investigation of Crook
Two hours after Grassley commented, the lawsuit alleges, Stender, Creston’s superintendent, called Crook into a meeting and asked her multiple times about her meaning and intent in the use of the word “blessing.” At the conclusion of the meeting, the superintendent placed Crook on administrative leave pending the outcome of a district investigation.
Four days after the shooting, on Sept. 14, Stender allegedly issued a public statement that said, “I want to be clear: Personal views have no place in the instruction of our children,” adding that there was a law enforcement presence in the schools as a “precautionary measure.”
One day later, on Sept. 15, Stender allegedly called Crook into a meeting to report that the district’s investigation had concluded. Stender reported the district had received more than 111 emails and 140 telephone calls, with the vast majority of them asking for Crook’s firing or asking that their children be removed from her classroom.
According to the lawsuit, the report also alleged that Crook’s comment “resulted in the need to increase law enforcement presence out of fear for our students, staff, and school safety.”
On Sept. 25, Stender delivered to Crook a formal notice of his recommendation to terminate her teaching contract. The lawsuit alleges the notice claimed that her Facebook comment had “resulted in threats to safety of students and staff, causing a significant and adverse impact on district operations and the educational process.”
Crook then requested a hearing on the matter before the school board. According to the lawsuit, that hearing is now scheduled for Oct. 21, 2025.
Lawsuit cites posts by superintendent, board president
In one exhibit attached to her lawsuit, Crook includes a 43-page document displaying social-media posts allegedly written by Stender over the past several years, and notes that he “has made at least one Facebook post agreeing with Charlie Kirk.” The lawsuit also claims Stender and Gee, the school board president, have each “made at least one Facebook post or comment agreeing with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis asserting that in Florida, individuals have the right to hit other people with their cars” — a reference to DeSantis saying people, if they feel threatened, could drive over protesters.
The exhibit suggests Stender has made and shared political posts on a Twitter account he also used for school purposes, including content supporting Trump, Ernst and other Republicans; content condemning the “liberal media;” comments about “riots in liberal cities;” a post about supporters of former President Biden being “snowflakes;” and one comment stating, “if you don’t like America, leave with Bruce Springsteen and the other elites.”
Two separate posts attributed to Stender also called on Iowans to “vote for Ernst” and to “vote Ernst on November 3.”
In one of his alleged posts, Stender reminded district employees of an upcoming election and asked them to be “mindful of the boundaries of political expression during contract hours.”
The posts also include one from November 2020, allegedly from Stender to the district staff, in which he says, “I apologize if my personal tweets offended you, our students or the community.”
Crook’s lawsuit also includes as an exhibit social-media posts and shares by Gee, the school board president, that question “liberal” positions on free speech and contrasting the response to Kirk’s death, depicted by people in embraced in prayer, with the response to the death of George Floyd, depicted by burning buildings, looters and a person holding a “Black Lives Matter” sign. Floyd, who was Black, was killed by a white police officer in Minnesota who knelt on Floyd’s neck for several minutes while Floyd lay face down in the street. The officer was later convicted of murder.
Gee also is alleged to have posted an immigration-related comment condemning what he called “bull— left-wing judges,” and to have reposted a meme circulated by conservative musician Ted Nugent. The meme shows a smiling school student with the caption, “My teacher told me guns kill people … I told her my pencil failed my math exam.”
Lawsuit: Rumors of a threat not substantiated
The same day Stender notified Crook of his recommendation that she be fired, the lawsuit alleges, Crook’s union representative went to the Creston Police Department and Union County Sheriff’s Office to obtain copies of any law enforcement reports related to the district since Sept. 11, 2025.
According to the lawsuit, police officials were unable to find any reports related to the district and a representative of the sheriff’s office said that office received only one call related to a comment by a teacher and that call related to the East Union Community School District.
The sheriff also indicated that Stender had called his office to report rumors of possible violence that were investigated by the district and were determined to lack credibility, the lawsuit alleges.
“More than one employee noted that any disruption (in the schools) was caused by a lack of coverage for the work of the English department, and students asking when Ms. Crook would return,” the lawsuit claims. “Several employees noted the presence of law enforcement on campus as the only event akin to disruption and questioned the need for such presence given they were informed there was no actual threat.”
Crook’s lawsuit seeks punitive damages for violations of her First Amendment rights, as well as an injunction that would restrain the board from further action related to her placement on leave and pending termination.
The school district has yet to file a response to the lawsuit.

,CommonWealth Beacon,2025-10-08 19:27:45+00:00,CommonWealth Beacon,DiZoglio misfires in attack on attorney general,Jerold Duquette and Lawrence Friedman,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/opinion/dizoglio-misfires-in-attack-on-attorney-general/,MASSACHUSETTS STATE AUDITOR Diana DiZoglio recently called in to Boston Public Radio and accused Attorney General Andrea Campbell of “working with the legislative leaders to block the audit that the […],"MASSACHUSETTS STATE AUDITOR Diana DiZoglio recently called in to Boston Public Radio and accused Attorney General Andrea Campbell of “working with the legislative leaders to block the audit that the Commonwealth voted for to the tune of 72 percent.” She further claimed that the 12 percent increase to Campbell’s fiscal year 2026 budget is a bid by the Legislature to reward her for declining to represent the auditor in litigation to compel legislative cooperation with her efforts to audit the House and Senate pursuant to last fall’s ballot question. 
For her part, Attorney General Campbell maintains that the budget increase reflects the anticipated costs of litigation over the reach of Trump administration policies, a view supported by both House Speaker Ron Mariano, who said the additional funding will allow Campbell “to push back against any unilateral, unconstitutional actions from the Trump administration,” and Senate President Karen Spilka, who in May argued that the AG should be armed “with every dollar she needs to fight the lawlessness of the Trump administration.”  
Given the patent threats to the Commonwealth posed by any number of the Trump administration’s policies, the need to supply the Office of the Attorney General with additional resources to address these threats seems almost too obvious to doubt.  
In fact, there is no evidence that the AG is colluding with legislative leaders to prevent implementation of the will of the voters who approved Question 1, the ballot question that DiZoglio championed. Campbell has consistently stated that her office continues to wait on more detailed information from the auditor regarding the specific extent of the audit she has in mind. Campbell’s position is no makeweight: The scope and reach of the audit that DiZoglio has publicly claimed the power to pursue raises serious constitutional issues.  
Indeed, the auditor responded to the attorney general’s deliberative approach to the exercise of her own powers by suggesting that Campbell sue her office “if she needs to get access to documents.”  
Perhaps needless to say, that is not how the relationship between the attorney general’s office and the other executive branch entities works: It is the attorney general who possesses the statutory discretion to determine when a lawsuit on behalf of another part of the executive branch is appropriate, and the responsibility of the part seeking representation to supply the factual details necessary to inform the attorney general’s decision.   
By simply reporting publicly that her decision cannot be made until she receives more information from the auditor, the AG is appropriately exercising her discretion, unbowed by the unsubstantiated aspersions the auditor has cast on her, her office, and anyone who has requested that she be clear about how she views the limits of her new statutory authority.  
The auditor’s accusations ignore the fact that the attorney general is not just an independent constitutional officer, but the only officer empowered to bring suit on behalf of the Commonwealth and its departments. In other words, the AG operates under a distinct constitutional mandate: The obligation to put before a court only those assertions of state authority that she plausibly can defend.  
A request of a department that seeks representation for the information necessary to make this determination is the least we should expect before an attorney general initiates litigation—particularly when that litigation implicates critical questions about the structure of government in the Commonwealth. 
Unlike Auditor DiZoglio, the AG is not at liberty to ignore the considerable evidence provided by multiple experts in two separate legislative hearings on Beacon Hill, that the legislative audit authority granted by Question 1 is unconstitutional.  
At the first hearing, conducted by the Special Joint Committee on Initiative Petitions on March 26, 2024, every expert witness testified against the constitutionality of granting the auditor’s office legislative audit authority.  
DiZoglio dismissed the views of these experts, claiming that they had been “cherry picked” by legislative leaders, and that, as the auditor, she was the most credible source of the relevant expertise. At the same time, she did not cite or produce any experts who agreed with her, and she apparently was not aware that her immediate predecessor, Suzanne Bump, opposed giving legislative audit authority to the state auditor’s office. 
DiZoglio declined even to appear at the second hearing, held on April 2, 2025, before a Senate subcommittee tasked with exploring the constitutional implications of a legislative audit. Among the issues covered was, for example, the extent to which an audit could interfere with the separation of powers and the constitutional authority of each chamber of the Legislature to set its own rules.  
Expert witnesses pointed out that the constitution expressly grants each chamber the power to make rules and control its own proceedings, and that the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court has held that this authority “is a continuous power absolute and beyond the challenge of any other tribunal.” The testimony made clear that an audit into any aspect of the ways in which either chamber of the Legislature chooses to conduct itself could in multiple ways intrude upon the settled constitutional authority of each to manage its own affairs.  
At the end of the day, Campbell’s reluctance to run to court in support of the auditor makes sense: As she herself noted, based upon the limited details DiZoglio has shared about the audit she has planned, a judge likely “would laugh [her] out of court.”  
The auditor is trapped in a legal box of her own making. This is, at least in part, because her goals and claims have from the start been more politically compelling than legally persuasive. She has consistently downplayed the legal and constitutional implication of the authority she sought. 
Now, by insisting that the real barrier to implementing the people’s will is political deal-making and collusion among the AG, legislative leaders, and the latter’s “cherry picked” experts, DiZoglio can soldier on with her crusade against Beacon Hill’s power brokers in the court of public opinion without having to confront the looming reality of judicial review and what will likely be a disappointing end to the fight in which she has invested so much.

President Donald Trump on July 22 declared a presidential disaster in Lincoln County, a couple of weeks after storms, floods and landslides devastated the area in and around Ruidoso. Then FEMA in mid-August announced that Doña Ana County residents could also qualify for aid. The damage must have occurred between June 23 and Aug. 5. 
The declaration empowers FEMA to provide various types of emergency assistance to individuals and families, including funding for housing, lost essentials and more. The deadline to apply for that funding is Oct. 15.

FEMA individual assistance is typically limited only to those who don’t have adequate or any insurance to cover their losses, and it is typically limited to, at most, about $40,000 under the federal Stafford Act. 
According to FEMA data, 500 individuals or households have been approved for at least some FEMA help totaling about $6.7 million. That includes about $4.35 million for housing assistance.
Oct. 15 is also the deadline to apply for companies affected in the disasters to apply for special loans the Small Business Administration offers. 
The state’s emergency management department issued a reminder to affected families Wednesday about the upcoming deadline. 
In addition to the funding for individuals, public entities like local governments in Lincoln, Doña Ana and Otero counties, along with the Mescalero Apache Tribe, are eligible for FEMA reimbursement for most of the costs of responding to the disaster. So far, FEMA has approved about $3.3 million for those entities, according to FEMA data. 
The post-fire flooding in Lincoln County on July 9 caused the deaths of three people — a father and his two children — and caused other chaos in a mountain village still recovering from the South Fork and Salt fires in summer 2024. 
The floods required the rescues of dozens of people and swept away homes and cars. On July 22, monsoon rains in the deserts of Doña Ana flooded the colonias of Vado around the Rio Grande, flooding at least 110 homes and wrecking infrastructure.
FEMA officials recommend applying for assistance online in English or Spanish, or using the agency’s mobile app. The agency can also be reached on its helpline at (800)621-3362. 
The agency also operates two offices that people can visit in both counties. Both centers will be open Monday, which is Indigenous Peoples’ Day, with regular hours.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-25-at-8.39.51 AM-1024x499.png,,,2025-10-08 15:58:01.105250

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)For the sixth consecutive year, Rhode Island T.F. Green International Airport has been ranked among the top 10 airports in the nation by Condé Nast Traveler.
The Warwick airport tied for ninth place with Salt Lake City International Airport in Utah in the London-based magazine’s annual Readers’ Choice Awards. Last year, T.F. Green ranked seventh in the nation.
Rankings were based on reader surveys submitted between April and June, evaluating criteria such as amenities and convenience, according to the magazine.
Savannah/Hilton Head International Airport in Georgia won the top honor, followed by Portland International Airport in Oregon and Tampa International Airport in Florida.
T.F. Green was the only New England airport to appear in Condé Nast’s Top 10 rankings.
Condé Nast Traveler called T.F. Green a “great little airport” that’s easy to reach and to navigate, with more than two-thirds of New England’s population living within a 75-minute drive to the airport. 
“Long favored by budget carriers as a less expensive alternative to Boston Logan, the airport has been growing steadily in recent years and is well-positioned to benefit from a resurgence in domestic air travel,” the magazine notes.
Airport officials flaunted their status as the “fastest-growing major U.S. airport,” citing 2024 federal data ranking T.F. Green above Philadelphia International Airport and Washington-Dulles International Airport for passenger and seat growth.
Between 2023 and 2024, T.F. Green saw a 10% increase in flights coming in and out of the airport, according to data compiled by the Federal Aviation Administration. 
In all, T.F. Green reported 64,972 flight operations for 2023. The following year saw 71,992 flights.
As of Oct. 8, the FAA recorded 50,502 in and out of Warwick for 2025.
The airport has also undergone major modernization updates in recent years funded by federal grants, passenger fees and airport funds. That includes the installation of automated coffee machines, new restaurants, colossal welcome signs off Interstate 95, and $10 million toward marble-lined bathrooms.
Officials are planning an additional $64 million overhaul to the terminal — though it also comes with the potential loss of its iconic decorative sailboat near the baggage claim.
In a statement Tuesday, airport spokesperson Bill Fischer said T.F. Green’s consistent placement on Condé Nast’s list “further highlights the airport’s commitment to providing exceptional service and a seamless travel experience for passengers.”
“With an expanding network of airlines and destinations, Rhode Island T. F. Green International Airport continues to strengthen its reputation as a key hub in the region,” Fischer said.
Earlier this year, Travel + Leisure Magazine readers named T.F. Green the No. 1 airport in America during its 2025 World’s Best Awards.

Cowen, a professor of education policy at Michigan State University, endorsed Democratic candidate Bridget Brink on his way out the door.
“I’ve made the tough decision to suspend my congressional campaign for Michigan’s 7th District,” Cowen said in a Facebook reel. “We raised more than $200,000 from 1,600 donors in just three months. We picked up endorsements from unions, local leaders and statewide officials, and I’m so proud of that and grateful to all of you. But if you know me, you know I believe in data and in facts, and the facts are that we won’t be able to compete the way we need to, to stay in this time.”

Cowen said he wanted to serve as the congressman representing Michigan families in the Capitol area, and that his campaign was never about him. One of his main goals was to also help Democrats take back the U.S. House in 2026, and he said his best way to help make that happen was by pulling out of the race.
The Democratic nominee will eventually face incumbent U.S. Rep. Tom Barrett (R-Charlotte).
That said, Cowen told his supporters that he was now endorsing Brink, the former ambassador to Ukraine. The Brink campaign also circulated an endorsement email on Wednesday notifying voters of the news.
“Bridget has an extraordinary record of public service for our country. She was a public school graduate, and the daughter of a public school teacher and MEA member,” Cowen said in a statement from the Brink campaign. “She has made a commitment to protect public schools throughout her campaign – and when she gets to Congress. Maybe most importantly, I think she has the best chance of beating Tom Barrett, which is exactly why I am supporting her today.”
Brink said she was honored to have Cowen’s support.

“Josh ran a principled campaign focusing on what matters most for mid-Michigan families – a bright future for our kids with great public schools and lower costs for families,” Brink said in a statement. “I know what a champion he is for public education and ensuring opportunity for all of our kids. I’m excited to have Josh on our side in the fight to tackle the high cost of living, invest in public education, protect Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, and fight like hell for our Democratic values.

,DC,2025-10-08 18:32:16+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"Air traffic control staffing steady, but stress during shutdown worries DOT",Jacob Fischler,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/air-traffic-control-staffing-steady-stress-during-shutdown-worries-dot,,"The Federal Aviation Administration reported no travel delays due to staffing levels at U.S. air traffic control facilities Wednesday, following a day of some delays related to above-average absences at a handful of facilities.An FAA operational plan posted about noon Eastern Time on Wednesday, the eighth day of the federal government shutdown, showed no facilities impacted by “staffing triggers.” A day earlier, the same memo showed staffing levels affected operations at major hub airports in Phoenix and Denver, as well as a smaller airport in Burbank, California.Air traffic controllers are essential to the functioning of the nation’s air transportation system and must continue to work during a shutdown, though they are not paid while it is ongoing.The group has not yet missed a paycheck during the current lapse in federal funding. The first impact most federal employees will see on their pay will be Friday, when electronic funding transfers are made for the pay period from Sept. 24 to Oct. 7. Because Congress has no appropriated money beyond Sept. 30, they would only receive a partial paycheck. Future paychecks would not be allocated until the government reopens.‘How am I going to pay my mortgage?’ The possibility of working without pay is stressful for air traffic controllers, possibly leading to worsening performance or motivating some to call in sick to work on-demand jobs such as driving for ridesharing services, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said at a Monday press conference in Newark, New Jersey.“Now what they think about as they’re patrolling our airspace is, ‘How am I going to pay my mortgage? How do I make my car payment? I have a couple kids at home, how do I put food on the table? I’m working six days a week, do I have to take a second job and drive Uber?’” Duffy said.Duffy said there was a slight uptick in controllers calling in sick, but that it had not been widespread. Extensive “sick-outs” among air traffic controllers were a major factor in ending the last partial government shutdown, which occurred during President Donald Trump’s first presidency in 2018. “Absenteeism as a concern: We've had a few airports and we're tracking it,” Duffy responded to a reporter who asked about the issue. “We don't have one facility that has had long-term issues with sick leave, but that is concerning to me. And if someone has to take sick leave to drive Uber to make the difference … of course that's concerning for us.”Union chief calls for reopening governmentNick Daniels, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, said on a CBS Evening News interview Tuesday the union is not coordinating absenteeism and is encouraging members to stay on the job during the shutdown. Air traffic controllers are prohibited by law from striking or taking other actions to disrupt the air transportation system.Daniels also called on Congress to reopen the government as soon as possible to ease the strain on the workforce.“There is no concerted effort for air traffic controllers to go in and somehow impede this system,” Daniels said. “But what it shouldn’t be is waiting to see how long air traffic controllers can last.”",,,,2025-10-08 14:56:38.203609
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-08 18:26:29+00:00,CT Mirror,Museum dedicated to Black equestrian history opens in Hartford,Mariana Navarrete Villegas,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/08/black-equestrian-history-museum-hartford-ct/,"The museum, named after the first African American woman to work for the USPS, honors the ties that bind Black communities to horse culture.","On a sunny Friday morning, horses’ nickerings and children’s laughter could be heard at the opening of The Mary Fields Horse and Heritage Museum in Hartford’s North End.
“It’s a community museum, and heavy on the ‘community’, and so that means it belongs to you,” Heather R. Lawson, chairwoman of the Ebony Horsewomen, Inc. board of directors, said through the microphone as she faced the group of adults and Martin Luther King Jr. Middle School students sitting in chairs on the lawn.
The museum commemorates the first African American woman to work for the U.S. Postal Service, as well as the history of the Black equestrian, horsewomen and men across the country. It serves as a cultural landmark and archival center in the city’s North End.

Historians and anthropologists have studied the exclusion of African Americans in the Wild West cowboy and rodeo history. Lawson said the museum aims to fill the gap of this erasure.
“A lot of people made up the fabric of America, and there’s a lot of history to be told. Some of it is more mainstream, and many of us know about it, and some is a little bit more hidden, but it’s worth seeking out the knowledge so that you can see yourself as part of America’s story,” Lawson said.
During the ceremony, organizers acknowledged everyone who took part in building the museum since Patricia E. Kelly, president of Ebony Horsewomen, wrote a grant request in 2017 seeking financing for the project.
Founded by Kelly in 1984, Ebony Horsewomen, Inc. has spent over 40 years serving youth, families, and veterans with equine therapy and cultural programs, through the bond of humans and horses.
“Mary Fields was a woman of extreme courage, extreme resilience, and who had a lot of grit, and that kind of embodies everything that we do here at Ebony Horsewomen,” Lawson said.
After Fields’ monologue “Mary Speaks” was performed, attendees toured the inside of the museum and the horse stables.

Curated by Levi Robinson, the 1,400-square-foot museum presents the triumphs, losses and ties that bind Black communities to horse culture. In the center of a large room with walls covered in old western artifacts, interactive digital screens, paintings and photos is a life-sized statue of Fields standing beside a horse and carriage.
Fields’ history is curated through the first few walls, but further into the museum are  photos of the Buffalo Soldiers, African American soldiers who served in the U.S. Army in the late 19th and early 20th century. There are also contemporary important Black equestrian figures like national champion Mikhail Proctor, and Shariah Harris, the first Black woman to compete in a U.S. Open women’s polo championship. 
As the museum reclaims the presence of African American experience, history and impact during pioneer times, on the range and stables, it is also home to Ebony’s own history in Hartford and across the country. Along the walls hang photos of Ebony horsewomen tournaments, with community members hoping to keep adding more local stories.
“Being a resident of Hartford, I think having history, especially Black history, is really important to teach to our young ones, and I think having something like this museum in our community is very special,” Javan Campbell, a member of the Martin Luther King Jr. Middle School staff, said.

Many of his students were curious and intrigued about what Ebony is and what the museum entails. Some knew about the organization through their summer programs, but others did not. What was common among all of them, was their amazed gazes when walking through the entrance of the ceremony while six horses ridden by Keney Park’s Mounted Patrols saluted them.
Quamel Smith was one of those on mounted patrols at the entrance. He has been a park ranger for 20 years, taking care of the park, of the horses and now being a mentor for younger kids of the neighborhood.
“Ebony Horsewomen and the museum are a safe place for the inner city kids that grow up around here like me,” Smith said.

Nydin Maldonado used to ride at Ebony when she was a teenager, but stopped right after graduating high school. Now, as a 32-year-old woman, she began to ride again at Ebony as a birthday present, and became an advisory board member.
“Ebony is right in the city, and I think that’s one thing that makes it more special, you see barns and this kind of community and other cities that aren’t built like the North End of Hartford, but because of Ms. Kelly, like, we all have access to beautiful horses and now to the history with the museum,” Maldonado said.

This is about protecting access to health care for our families, friends, colleagues and neighbors — but it’s also about the health of Vermont’s workforce and economy.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Connie Beal: Let’s focus on solutions — 45,000 Vermonters don’t have to lose health insurance  .","This commentary is by Connie Beal, of St. Albans. Beal is the director of United Way’s Working Bridges program, which helps working individuals and families reach stability and thrive. Working Bridges is a partnership between United Way and employers focused on helping employees access the resources they need to gain, keep and grow stable employment by bringing services and support directly to employees onsite at the workplace.


Many in our community have expressed understandable fear and dismay at the reported estimate that 45,000 Vermonters will lose their health insurance because of the federal bill signed into law on July 4. However, this outcome is far from inevitable. 
While some Vermonters might lose health coverage under the new law due to being ineligible, many more could lose coverage simply because they cannot complete the process of recertification or navigate available health insurance options.
Many of us know from our own experience how overwhelming and confusing it can be to navigate health insurance options, and this law will only make it harder. For example, the law imposes new requirements for people on Medicaid to prove they are working to receive coverage, and their eligibility will need to be recertified every six months instead of once a year. The law also adds hurdles for people who purchase coverage on the commercial marketplace by making it harder to sign up, shrinking enrollment periods and decreasing financial assistance available through advanced premium tax credits.

United Way’s Working Bridges program is uniquely positioned to meet this moment. Working Bridges is a partnership between United Way and employers whereby trained resource coordinators meet with employees in their workplace to help them navigate and access the resources they need to keep and grow stable employment. Working Bridges Resource Coordinators are certified health assisters and already work with employees at 30 workplaces in Northern Vermont. 
Working Bridges health assisters can support employees as they navigate this new landscape and help employers understand and respond to new requirements. We can help employees stay healthy and support employers to not have to shoulder this burden alone.  
This is about protecting access to health care for our families, friends, colleagues and neighbors — but it’s also about the health of Vermont’s workforce and economy. People will not stop getting sick or needing care if they do not have health coverage. They will either end up getting care in a more expensive setting (driving up health care costs for all of us) or they will get sicker and be unable to work and support their families.  
Let’s devise a solutions-focused strategy to ensure Vermonters who are eligible for Medicaid maintain their health coverage, and Vermonters get good information about health insurance options and have trusted, accessible resources to rely on as these changes are put in place. This includes organizations and programs that already provide health assistance and health care navigation, such as Working Bridges, the Vermont Healthcare Advocate’s Office, the federally qualified health centers and others who will be on the frontlines of this health care crisis. We must collaborate to adequately resource solutions we know work in Vermont. 
For our economy to be secure and prosperous for all, I’m reminded of Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s Economic Bill of Rights from 1944 (often called a second Bill of Rights) as a challenge that demands our immediate attention. Especially now, as we see social safety nets as well as worker resources and protections weaken. Economic security for all includes “the right to adequate medical care and the opportunity to achieve and enjoy good health.”

William Barber (L) (Photo: Rob Schofield)GREENVILLE — A 2024 lawsuit filed by former North Carolina NAACP leader Rev. William Barber II against AMC Theaters can proceed, U.S. District Judge Terrence Boyle ruled this week, denying a motion by the movie chain to dismiss the case.
The movie chain did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Filed under the Americans with Disabilities Act, the lawsuit stems from an incident in December 2023. Barber and his elderly mother went to the AMC Fire Tower 12 theater in Greenville, NC, to see a screening of “The Color Purple.”
Barber has a disability called ankylosing spondylitis, a debilitating condition that does not allow him to sit in normal seats. For years, he has brought a taller chair with him to public and private events.
According to the lawsuit, Barber had confirmed in advance that handicapped seating was available in the theater, and had set up his chair in that area in a way that would not obstruct anyone’s view.
However, the lawsuit says, the theater employees refused to allow him the accommodation, requiring him to produce a doctor’s note to verify his condition.
When Barber refused to leave, the employees called the police. The police escorted Barber out, leaving his 90-year-old mother behind, the lawsuit says. A video of the incident, taken by an onlooker, shows Barber using two canes to leave the theater with the officer.
The lawsuit claims the movie chain’s employees violated the ADA. It says Barber was embarrassed, defamed, and discriminated against because of his disability, and seeks damages of more than $50,000.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps/Utah News Dispatch)Florida’s agriculture commissioner said he is dedicated to addressing students’ “diet of ultra-processed foods,” particularly in Florida school lunches.
Following a report from President Donald Trump’s Make America Healthy Again Commission, Commissioner Wilton Simpson said, pending federal action, that he “is committed to defining and addressing ultra-processed foods during Florida’s upcoming legislative session.”
“I applaud President Trump’s leadership through the Make America Healthy Again Commission to address childhood nutrition and growing concerns related to ultra-processed foods,” Simpson said in a news release. “If bureaucratic games and barriers prevent federal action, we are prepared to take decisive measures here in Florida to define ultra-processed foods and protect our children’s health.”
Simpson went on to say that his office would continue to prioritize “Florida farmers’ fresh, nutritious products on school menus.”
Last session, Sen. Jon Martin, R-Fort Myers, introduced SB 1826, which would’ve defined the term “ultra-processed food” and prohibited schools from serving or selling it.
That bill was heard in the Agriculture Committee, but amid concerns from lobbyists in the food and beverage industry it died.
Martin has not yet introduced the measure, or similar language, for the legislative session beginning in January. The senator told the Phoenix on Wednesday that since initiatives in other states have gained traction, before he introduces a language he will align it with patchwork legislation in those states.
“I’m happy that after I filed the bills last year, presented two different bills on food safety and health along the lines of the MAHA movement, that many states as well as the federal government stepped up and put some restrictions in place on basically what you could call food,” Martin told the Phoenix. 
The Food and Drug Administration and U.S. Department of Agriculture are in a rulemaking process to define ultra-processed food. That rule is in a public comment period.
His pitch to lawmakers last year was that Florida had an opportunity to lead in passing such legislation, considering the arrival of Trump’s new administration and its focus on healthier food.
“I don’t want to regulate personal choices and I don’t want to tell companies that they have to do something or that individuals have to do something, but it felt like something was broken because the choices were gone,” Martin said, sympathizing especially with those in food deserts.
What MAHA says
The MAHA assessment included research that found consuming ultra-processed foods leads to nutrient depletion and increased caloric intake, and warned against food additives.
“UPFs have allowed us to save money and to ‘eat on the run,’ but today’s over-reliance on UPFs is damaging the health of American children,” the report says.
The Trump administration cites research concluding that about 70% of 300,000 branded food products at grocery stores are ultra-processed.
The assessment focused particularly ultra-processed food’s implications for young people.
“Schools that receive federal lunch subsidies are required to follow a meal pattern that limits added sugars, sodium, and carbohydrates, but do not set limits on UPF consumption, leading to excessive intake of sugar, processed carbohydrates, processed fats, and sodium among children,” the report states.
In Congress, Rep. Mike Kennedy, R-Utah, introduced a bill that would ban schools receiving federal funding for lunches from serving ultra-processed foods.
In California, lawmakers approved a bill that would ban ultra-processed foods starting in 2035. The bill has not yet been signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom. The bill also would establish a definition of ultra-processed.

Jackson County Circuit Judge Sarah Castle determined that the nonprofit that filed the litigation, Right By You, did not have the standing to sue. The lawsuit targeted a requirement that minors get parental consent before an abortion and a ban on anyone aiding or assisting minors who are seeking an abortion. 
Castle didn’t draw any conclusions in her Tuesday decision about whether the reproductive rights amendment approved by voters last year renders either law unconstitutional. 
Missouri’s parental consent law requires a minor attempting to access abortion receive at least one parent’s consent. The other parent must also be notified. If that’s not possible, they can also ask a judge to bypass the requirement.
“Today’s victory ensures that Missouri’s parental consent laws will continue to safeguard young girls, hold abortion providers accountable and uphold the values of Missouri families for generations to come,” Missouri Attorney General Catherine Hanaway said in a statement Wednesday.  
Right By You is a nonprofit that helps young people navigate pregnancy decisions, including by increasing access to and awareness around contraceptives, prenatal care, abortion, parenting and adoption. In its lawsuit, the nonprofit also asked the court to allow the group to begin funding and arranging logistics for minors seeking abortions, including transportation, hotel and child care costs. 
But Castle on Tuesday determined Right By You, which has one employee in Illinois and some volunteers who live in Missouri,  didn’t have the ability to sue because it’s “fiscally sponsored” by a nonprofit incorporated in California. She dismissed the lawsuit without prejudice, leaving the door open for the suit to be filed again.
“Young Missourians will continue to be coerced, isolated, and stigmatized for simply choosing to end a pregnancy until the abortion restrictions targeting them are lifted,” Stephanie Kraft Sheley, Right By You’s founder and director, said in a statement Wednesday. “Missouri’s youth deserve better than being left on their own just to access basic health care.”
Stephanie Kraft Sheley, founder and director of Right By You, poses for a portrait in April (Anna Spoerre/Missouri Independent).
Kraft Sheley said attorneys may re-file the lawsuit. In the meantime, she said, Right By You will continue providing young people with information on abortion and contraception through the nonprofit’s text line.
Castle heard arguments in early September after the attorney general’s office asked the court to dismiss the case.
Peter Donohue, an assistant attorney general involved in the lawsuit, told Castle that the judicial bypass measures in place are sufficient. 
“It’s kind of wild the plaintiffs think that in cases where judicial bypass is insufficient, that they want basically no circumstance in which parents would be notified of their minor children having an abortion, essentially,” Donohue said.
Allison Zimmer, with the Lawyering Project, argued on behalf of Right By You that the lawsuit was part of a larger effort to broadly protect reproductive rights. 
“Just to go back to what is at stake here again, this is about the threat to the right to reproductive freedom,” Zimmer said. “A constitutional right for people in Missouri after the November election … “
Thirty-eight states, including Missouri, require at least some parental involvement for minors seeking abortions, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive rights research group. 
“It makes sense that folks that are in healthy relationships with their children have this instinct that they would want their children to come to them, but a law that forces that to happen in every case is not the solution to that problem,” Kraft Sheley previously told The Independent. “Because it’s not possible for a law to legislate a healthy family dynamic.”
Kraft Sheley is also a co-founder of What’s Next, a reproductive justice group made up of organizers and activists who previously called for a constitutional amendment to appear on the Missouri ballot with no restrictions on abortion. 
Last year, the coalition called on the state’s major reproductive rights groups to challenge Missouri’s parental consent law. 
After getting no response, Kraft Sheley filed her own lawsuit, noting that current policy does not clearly state how or if minors in state custody or in the foster care system can access abortion through the current parental consent law.
Missouri attorney general subpoenas Planned Parenthood for patient abortion records

An answer to the question of constitutionality may instead come from a separate lawsuit filed in February 2024 in Cole County by the attorney general’s office alleging Planned Parenthood Great Plains, which oversees clinics in Kansas City and Columbia, illegally transported minors out of state for abortions. 
The lawsuit relied on a staged video filmed and edited by Project Veritas, a conservative news organization. In the footage, a man working with Project Veritas goes to a Kansas City area Planned Parenthood and pretends to have a 13-year-old niece who he says needs an abortion. The employee tells the man that Planned Parenthood can help the girl get an abortion in Kansas.
Planned Parenthood has said the lawsuit should be dropped because the video was based on a hypothetical situation and because abortion is now legal. 
“I find that the right to reproductive freedom initiative does not address the issue of parental consent,” Boone County Judge J. Hasbrouck Jacobs said in April. “And because of that, I’m going to deny the motion to dismiss.”
The next hearing date has not yet been set.
Missourians in November narrowly voted to enshrine the right to reproductive health care in the state constitution. This amendment includes a provision that prohibits the government from discriminating “against persons providing or obtaining reproductive health care or assisting another person in doing so.” 
The amendment does allow the government to legislate abortion access if compelling governmental interest exists. 
A new amendment proposed by the Republican legislature is set to appear on the November 2026 ballot. If passed, it will repeal the reproductive rights amendment and ban nearly all abortions, with limited exceptions for survivors and for medical emergencies.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/meridian-clinic-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-08 14:56:38.203609
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-08 17:58:38+00:00,CT Mirror,CT will continue to fund WIC food program amid government shutdown,Laura Tillman and Lisa Hagen,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/08/ct-wic-government-shutdown/,"WIC, which costs about $200,000 a day to run in Connecticut and serves around 52,000 people, will continue thanks to an infusion of state funds.","Connecticut will temporarily fund a federal program to ensure that young children, along with pregnant and nursing mothers, continue to receive nutrition benefits during the government shutdown, officials said Wednesday.
The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, known as WIC, costs about $200,000 a day to run for Connecticut alone and provides food for women who are nursing or pregnant, as well as young children, serving around 52,000 people across the state and almost half of infants born in the United States.
At a press conference at a WIC enrollment site in Hartford, officials including Gov. Ned Lamont announced that the program would continue without interruption thanks to an infusion of state funds from the “common cash pool” of state operational dollars. 
“I wanted to make sure that Connecticut is one of the, sadly, very few states in the country stepping up making sure that if you’re a new mom, if you’ve got kids under the age of 5, an infant, we’re taking care of you,” Lamont said. “We’ll make sure it continues until the federal government gets its act together.”
WIC provides funding for healthy food, but the program also includes support for pregnant women and nursing, including prenatal care, and counselors to help new mothers breastfeed. WIC provides whole grains, fruit, vegetables, milk, formula, eggs and beans, among other nutritious foods.
The press conference came a day after the Trump administration announced that it will use tariff revenue to fund WIC during the shutdown. 
“The WIC program works really well,” Lamont said. “Stop injecting all this uncertainty. Look, you’re making a lot of people really nervous, starting with young moms with new infants. Get it together. You wrote ‘The Art of the Deal.’ Make a deal. Let’s end this shutdown.” 
Officials said the state expects to be repaid for WIC spending once the shutdown ends.
Lt. Gov. Susan Bysiewicz praised Lamont for ensuring that the state has funds to draw on in such a crisis.
“I think we are very lucky to live in a state that has had fiscally responsible leadership from our governor, Ned Lamont. We are able to continue funding this program even during a federal shutdown because we’ve been fiscally responsible. We have a very large rainy day fund, and we are not going to let women and babies and children go hungry in our state.” 
SNAP benefits, formerly known as food stamps, are expected to remain unaffected through the end of October, officials said. But the uncertainty around the duration of the shutdown has advocates in Connecticut worried about the future of these benefits that support low-income families as well as mothers and infants — and the stress it would place on their own services that are already seeing higher-than-usual demand.
The potential loss or reductions in WIC and SNAP in the next month or so would put significant stress on food banks and mobile pantries. On top of looming cuts to SNAP and Medicaid in the coming years, Jason Jakubowski of Connecticut Foodshare sees it as a “real nightmare scenario” for the hundreds of partners his group works with on food distribution throughout the state.
The demand at food banks is already high, and the lines are similar to the peak during the pandemic, even in the early days of the shutdown. Over the last two weeks, Jakubowski said, the 600 pantries his organization partners with have seen an increased demand in food, and he expects that to grow over the next week.
“There’s a sense of panic in many communities out there, not just in Connecticut but across the country. And we’re prepared for that. We’ve already seen that play out — more people coming to our mobile lines, more people going to our pantries, more people looking for more food at a time in which either the food supply has either stayed stagnant or has even decreased a little bit,” Jakubowski said in an interview.
As a proactive measure, the board of directors for Connecticut Foodshare authorized $1 million in emergency funding at its Monday meeting. The group has already started to dip into that money, but the funds will be used primarily during a prolonged shutdown.
“I think we’re all kind of scrambling right now and trying to make sure our ducks are in a row when this really does start affecting people’s pocketbooks,” Jakubowski said.
Jakubowski sees similarities with the last government shutdown that began in late 2018 and lasted more than a month into January 2019. But he said the federal funding cuts plus the coming ramifications of the “big beautiful bill” add an extra layer of uncertainty and panic in this iteration.
During the last shutdown, Connecticut Foodshare set up pop-up food distributions and pop-up mobile trucks that were stationed around the U.S. Coast Guard Academy in New London as well as around Bradley International Airport. TSA agents and military are considered essential during a shutdown but don’t get paid. They receive back pay once a shutdown ends.
A week into this shutdown, the nonprofit has already started to purchase additional food. And Jakubowski said he expects to deploy the same kind of interventions and services during the week of Oct. 20 if a shutdown continues through the next couple of weeks, because federal workers could start to miss their first paycheck in the next week or so.
Jakubowski said he’s already started discussions with Gemma Morgan Food Center, which is prepared to launch four mobile truck sites in southeastern Connecticut to help families with a federal employee or contractor who is furloughed or not receiving pay while working. He said the group is also preparing to work with Bradley airport again.
“Our baseline is increased demand right now. The shutdown is literally throwing fuel onto the fire,” he said.
Food aid has already taken a hit this year because of federal cutbacks. Connecticut was hit by cuts earlier this year to The Emergency Food Assistance Program, or TEFAP.
About 30% of the food for food banks and pantries comes from the federal government via the TEFAP program. Because of those cuts in the spring, they lost about 35 trailer loads of food, which amounts to about 1.6 million pounds.
“We’re already dealing in an environment in which there is less food to provide people. That’s a marked difference between 2025 and in 2019,” Jakubowski said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_6950-3-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-10-08 14:56:38.203609

(Robert Zullo/States Newsroom)Xcel Energy is requesting a rate increase that would cause electric bills for the company’s average South Dakota residential customer to go up by 19%, which equates to $21 per month.
If approved by state regulators, it would be Xcel’s second increase in two years. The company attempted to raise rates by 18% in 2023, but regulators reduced that to 6%, which equated to a roughly $5 monthly increase for the average residential customer. 
Regulators reduce Xcel’s 18% electric rate hike to 6%

The company filed its latest request with the South Dakota Public Utilities Commission on June 30. Xcel said it needs the increase to cover inflationary costs, upgrade infrastructure, and recover costs from investments in wind turbines, natural gas facilities and transmission lines. The rate hike would raise $43.6 million in additional annual revenue for the company.
The commission’s staff is reviewing the request and will make a recommendation later this year. If approved, the new rates would take effect no earlier than Jan. 1.
Xcel has a total of 107,000 South Dakota electrical customers in Hanson, Lake, Lincoln, McCook, Minnehaha, Moody, Sanborn and Turner counties in the southeast part of the state. Most of the customers are located in the Sioux Falls area.

Free.,Shutdown day eight: Congress standoff unchanged as first missed federal payday nears,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/shutdown-day-eight-congress-standoff-unchanged-first-missed-federal-payday-nears,,"WASHINGTON — Congress has just one week to break the stalemate and fund the government before active duty military members miss their first paycheck of the shutdown. That would be followed later in the month by absent wages for federal civilian employees and the staffers who work for lawmakers — benchmarks that would traditionally increase pressure on Democrats and Republicans to negotiate a deal.But both sides remained dug in Wednesday, as the Senate failed to pass Republicans’ short-term government funding bill for the sixth time and Democrats were unable to get the support needed to advance their counterproposal. The 54-45 vote on the GOP bill and the 47-52 vote on Democrats’ legislation didn’t reach the 60 votes needed to advance under Senate rules.Nevada Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto and Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman, both Democrats, as well as Maine independent Sen. Angus King voted with Republicans to advance their multi-week funding bill. Kentucky GOP Sen. Rand Paul voted no.The shutdown began on Oct. 1, the start of the federal government’s 2026 fiscal year.Johnson says no separate vote on military paySpeaker Mike Johnson, R-La., rejected the idea of voting on a stand-alone bill to provide paychecks to active duty military members during the shutdown, saying that if Democrats wanted to ensure salaries for federal workers, they should vote to advance the stopgap spending bill. “They live with that vote. They made that decision. The House is done,” Johnson said at a morning press conference. “The ball is now in the Senate’s court. It does us no good to be here dithering on show votes. We did it. We sent the product over.”Johnson also appeared to fully reject an idea floated by the Trump administration not to provide back pay for furloughed federal employees, which is required by a 2019 law. “It’s my understanding that the law is that they would be paid. There is some other legal analysis that’s floating around. I haven’t yet had time to dig into and read that,” Johnson said. “But it has always been the case, it is tradition and I think it is statutory law that federal employees be paid. And that’s my position. I think they should be.”

The shutdown will likely only end after congressional leaders begin talking with each other about core policy issues, including how to address enhanced tax credits for people who buy their own health insurance from the Affordable Care Act Marketplace. The credits are set to expire at the end of the year, spurring huge increases in health insurance costs.Democrats say a deal must be reached before they’ll vote to advance the GOP stopgap spending bill that would fund the government through Nov. 21. Republican leaders maintain they won’t negotiate until after Democrats vote to open the government.‘You can’t take the federal government hostage’Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said he and other GOP lawmakers are willing to talk with Democrats about the tax credits, but only after the government reopens. “They have other issues that they want to bring up, which I said before we’re happy to discuss, and yes, there are some things that I think there’s interest on both sides in trying to address when it comes to health care in this country,” Thune said. “But you can’t take the federal government hostage and expect to have a reasonable conversation on those issues.”Thune said the stopgap funding bill is needed to give both chambers more time to work out a final agreement on the dozen full-year government funding bills, which were supposed to become law by the start of the fiscal year.“What this does is provide a short-term extension in order for all that to happen,” he said. “That’s all that we’re talking about.”Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Republicans are divided on health care issues and want to avoid a public debate over the Affordable Care Act tax credits. Schumer then read part of a social media post by Georgia Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene in which she said she was “absolutely disgusted” that health premiums will double by the end of the year without action.“More Republicans should listen to her because, on this issue, she’s right on the money,” Schumer said. “Meanwhile, Democrats’ position hasn’t changed. We urge our Republican colleagues to join us in a serious negotiation to reopen the government and extend ACA premiums.”Trump threatsThe shutdown’s ramifications will continue to get worse the longer lawmakers remain intransigent, especially given President Donald Trump’s efforts to differentiate this funding lapse from those in the past.Trump has said he’ll lay off federal workers by the thousands, cancel funding approved by Congress for projects in Democratic regions of the country and may not provide back pay for the hundreds of thousands of furloughed federal employees.Trump and administration officials have been vague about when and how they’d implement layoffs, but a federal judge hearing arguments in a suit brought by a federal employee labor union has ordered government attorneys to file a brief later this week detailing its plans and its timeline.  Northern District of California Judge Susan Illston has given the Trump administration until the end of Friday to share details of any planned or in-progress Reduction in Force plans, “including the earliest date that those RIF notices will go out.”Illston, who was nominated by former President Bill Clinton, also told the Trump administration to detail what agencies anticipate implementing layoffs and how many employees that would impact. Illston set Oct. 16 for oral arguments between the American Federation of Government Employees and federal government attorneys over AFGE’s request for a temporary restraining order to block the Trump administration from implementing layoffs during the shutdown.Murkowski reports informal talksAlaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski, part of a bipartisan group that has begun informal talks, said during a brief interview Wednesday that the government must reopen before real steps can be taken on the ACA tax credits. “I think the leadership has made very, very clear that the way to open up the government is, let's pass a bill that will allow us to open up the government, and then there's a lot of good conversations that can go on,” Murkowski said. “It doesn't mean that we wait until then to start conversations, and that's what we're doing. We're talking but we’re talking outside of the range of your microphones.”She said, “There are not a lot of guarantees around this place, are there?” when asked by a reporter whether Republicans could provide Democrats with assurances on floor votes on ACA tax credit extensions if they vote for the stopgap spending bill. North Carolina GOP Sen. Thom Tillis said he expects the shutdown to last for at least a couple more weeks and urged Democratic senators to vote to reopen the government. “Go take a look at the list of Democrats who are either not running for reelection or not up until ‘28 or ‘30,” Tillis said. “There are plenty of them to walk the plank like I have multiple times to get the government funded and then the discussions start.”Oklahoma Republican Sen. Markwayne Mullin said that talks between Democrats and Republicans are “stalled” but “we’re having conversations with everybody.” South Dakota GOP Sen. Mike Rounds said that lawmakers have had bipartisan “visits” though no real conversations. “There’s no framework,” Rounds said. “There's just a matter of a clarification about how important it is to get the shutdown over with. And once we get that shutdown over with, we'll go back to bipartisan work in the Senate.”Ariana Figueroa contributed to this report.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/themes/custom/sn/images/icons/No_image.svg,,,2025-10-08 13:57:59.369606

(Photo via Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)More than 43,000 children were disenrolled from the Florida KidCare program for nonpayment of premiums — more than double the number the state previously provided to the Florida Phoenix, a state report shows.
A report obtained by the Florida Phoenix shows 17,430 children were disenrolled from the program between Sept. 1, 2024, and Aug. 31, 2025, for failing to pay the premium. Those children never re-enrolled and may have become uninsured. 
But another 25,806 children also were briefly disenrolled from the Florida KidCare program after their family didn’t pay the required premium. Those children were re-enrolled during a 12-month period after premiums were eventually paid.
That means tens of thousands of children were removed from the health insurance program for children while the administration of Gov. Ron DeSantis has tussled with U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services over a requirement that children enrolled in federally funded programs must retain eligibility for one year.
The skirmish has prevented the state from implementing a 2023 Florida law (HB 121) that increased eligibility for the program by boosting the maximum qualifying income from 200% to 300% of the federal poverty level. That’s a difference between earning $64,300 for a family of four versus $96,450.
The Florida Phoenix reported Tuesday that Florida Medicaid Director Brian Meyer did not know the number of children who had been disenrolled from the program for nonpayment of premiums.
“I don’t have that information handy, but I’d be certainly happy to work with our Florida Healthy Kids Corp. partners on that information,” Myers told members of the Senate Health Policy Committee during his presentation on the program.
Following publication of our story, Florida Healthy Kids spokesperson Ashley Carr told the Phoenix that 17,5101 children had been removed from the subsidized program during the period in question for failing to pay premiums. Another 8,614 children who weren’t receiving subsidies but were enrolled in the program lost coverage for nonpayment of premiums. Those children live in families that earn too much to qualify for subsidies but are willing to pay full costs of the health insurance plan.
The report obtained by the Florida Phoenix shows 8,511 full-pay children were disenrolled during the 12 month span and never signed back up for the program. Another 4,281 children were disenrolled for nonpayment but later signed back up and paid the full premium.

The continuous eligibility requirement doesn’t apply to children in those families because they earn too much to qualify. But they most likely would have qualified  for subsidized coverage had the DeSantis administration implemented HB 121. 
 Meyer can’t “verify” data

During a Wednesday morning meeting of the House Health Care Facilities & Systems Subcommittee meeting, Westin Democrat Robin Bartleman pressed Meyer about the number of children who have been disenrolled. And for the second time in as many days, Meyer said he didn’t know.
“I want to verify the number of families that are off KidCare currently. I know you were asked this question and you didn’t have the data,” Bartleman said, asking him to verify removal of 17,510 children with subsidized coverage and another 8,614 full-pay children. “Can you verify those numbers?”
Meyer replied: “I’m not able to verify those numbers at this time; I don’t have those in front of me.” He added that he would be happy to follow up.

Josh Schriver of Oxford, including accounts on adult entertainment, hookup sex and webcam sites.
The connection was first reported in a story published by The Detroit Metro Times.
When Michigan Advance reached out to Schriver’s office for comment, he vehemently denied the allegation and accusations that the accounts or email address implicated in the information ever belonged to him.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“I have never used or accessed any of the sites mentioned, and I had no clue they even existed until reached out about it,” he said in a statement sent by his staff via email. “The Metro Times article relies on unverified data from old internet breaches and attempts to connect me to something I have absolutely nothing to do with. Anyone familiar with how these databases work knows they are often inaccurate, manipulated, or misattributed, and it is irresponsible for a publication to present them as fact.”
Schriver similarly told Detroit Metro Times that he believed the information to have been forged.
The representative is among the most far-right legislators in the Michigan Legislature. He introduced a resolution to make same sex marriage be illegal again, was stripped of his staff and committee assignments by House Democratic leadership after sharing views related to the racist Great Replacement Theory, wrote legislation to ban all pornography in the state and voted against bills banning child marriage and closing the marital rape loophole.
As a Michigan Republican made his case to ban same-sex marriage, a gay Democrat stole the show

The Detroit Metro Times reported Tuesday that it had reviewed information on two different websites that track data breaches, and found that emails appearing to be connected to Schriver were associated with an account on Fling.com, a website that advertises adult hookups, swinger meet ups and collection of webcams.
Fling.com was the victim of a data breach in 2016, which the company has acknowledged since.
According to the Metro Times article, the website also has authenticated information leaked during the breach, much of which was sold on the seedier parts of the internet, known as the dark web. Detroit Metro Times claimed that the email address matched Schriver’s first, middle and last name and the account was tagged with an IP address in East Lansing. The publication claims the dates of use on the account coincide with Schriver’s time as a student at Michigan State University.
Still, Schriver was adamant that the story was nothing more than “a needless attack on my character and a distraction from the real work our office is doing for the people of Michigan.”
“My focus remains on protecting families, restoring accountability in Lansing, and defending our values. I will not be intimidated or silenced by falsehoods and cheap political attacks,” Schriver told the Advance. “We are currently reviewing all available options for a formal retraction and will continue to stand firm against misinformation that seeks to undermine honest public service.”
The story on Schriver follows the 2024 arrest, with no charges filed, of former state Rep. Neil Friske, a Republican, who was taken into police custody after police were called to the scene of his former Lansing dwelling on a report of shots fired. His arrest was based on allegations of sexual assault and and a weapons offense. No legal consequences ever came of it and the story died out quickly.
The investigation into the Friske matter was initially handled by the Ingham County Prosecutor’s Office, but was later referred to Attorney General Dana Nessel’s office. As of July, the office was still investigating the matter and had not filed charges against Friske.
While there was no legal consequence for Friske, he did lose his primary election that year to the current state Rep. Parker Fairbairn (R-Harbor Springs).

That could change with a faster turn-around under a new state law.","In summary
California is known for taking weeks to tally its ballots, causing uncertainty and frustration among voters. That could change with a faster turn-around under a new state law.


California’s famously slow vote-counting process could see slight improvements next year after Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill that gives counties an earlier deadline to tally voters’ ballots.
The law, Assembly Bill 5, requires county election offices to count ballots no later than 13 days after election day, but does not change the 30-day deadline for local officials to certify results. Counties unable to meet the new deadline must give a reason for an extension to the secretary of state’s office.
“California has one of the most accessible and secure voting systems in the country,” said the bill’s author, Assemblymember Marc Berman, a Menlo Park Democrat, in a statement. “One opportunity for improvement was to speed up how quickly we count ballots and create a system that gave greater certainty to the public for when results would be available.”
Voter fraud is rare, typically occurs in isolated instances and is generally detected. However, local election officials have received greater scrutiny across the country after President Donald Trump and his allies disputed false claims of election fraud after the 2020 election. 
Local officials in California have since launched social media campaigns to explain and show voters how their ballots are processed. 
Lawmakers suggest the new law, which received bipartisan support in the state Legislature, will help clamp down on misinformation as some Republicans have grown increasingly distrustful of mail ballots.
Proponents such as the nonprofit California Voter Foundation have said it will increase the public’s trust in elections and avoid officials being sworn in before their races have been certified, which was the case for a number of state lawmakers last year.
Secretary of State Shirley Weber’s office opposed the bill. 
Timothy Cromartie, a spokesperson for Weber, said at a Senate Elections and Constitutional Amendments Committee earlier this year that there was a concern that 13 days would not be enough time for counties, which currently have 30 days to complete the count. The secretary of state’s office proposed a deadline of 15 days instead, but that was not adopted.
“As always, we will do our best to uphold the laws as passed by the Legislature and signed by the governor,” Weber said in a written statement.
More mail-in ballots slow down counting
It is increasingly common for counties to take weeks to count ballots due to the growing popularity of mail-in ballots, particularly after the coronavirus pandemic. More than 80% of California voters voted by mail in the 2024 November election, according to the secretary of state’s office. That trend has accelerated since a 2021 law required each registered voter to receive a mail ballot. 
Mail ballots take longer for officials to process than votes at a polling place because of the required steps for officials to verify signatures and confirm that voters have not already cast a ballot somewhere else. The state also allows ballots postmarked by election day to be counted even if they arrive up to a week later. Those ballots will not be subject to the 13-day deadline, nor will provisional ballots or ballots missing voter signatures.
It is not possible to know how long it took counties to count all their ballots in the last election because of a state law that prohibited them from certifying results any earlier than 28 days after election day, Kim Alexander, president of the California Voter Foundation, said in an email.
“Historically, some counties count faster than others. This has to do with a number of factors – space, equipment, staffing,” Alexander said. 
Some California counties, such as Los Angeles, can take close to a month to count election results, as was the case last year in the 22nd Congressional District in Southern California, which was eventually won by Democratic Rep. Derek Tran. Experts largely attribute California’s size and widespread use of mail-in ballots as the reason for this.
Los Angeles County officials say the new law will change little about how they process ballots.
“We’ve always processed ballots much earlier than the date signed into the law. We’re not particularly concerned with that 13-day requirement,” said Mike Sanchez, a spokesperson for the Los Angeles County Clerk. “It may seem more ceremonial than anything else.”
Election workers have said that public messaging urging voters to drop or mail off their ballots sooner could speed up the process.
Newsom also signed a bill that bans voters from being paid to register to vote in response to the millions of dollars that billionaire Elon Musk gave away to registered voters in swing states during the 2024 election. Another piece of legislation he signed would schedule a ballot measure for the 2026 election to allow voters to decide if taxpayer funds can be used for political campaigns.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/110524_Sacramento-General-Election_MG_CM_46.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-08 13:57:59.369606

Property Tax Reassessment Committee Hears From County Administrators and National Experts as Review Continues
By Brent Burdge, Contributing Journalist
DOVER, Del., Oct. 7, 2025 (AP) — Delaware lawmakers gathered Wednesday for the second hearing of the Special Property Reassessment Committee, moving the state’s review of its controversial property reassessment forward with new testimony from county officials and national experts.
During the session, Sussex County Administrator Todd Lawson and Kent County Administrator Kevin Sipple delivered detailed presentations outlining their counties’ experiences and challenges with the reassessment process. They highlighted the importance of accuracy, transparency, and public engagement to ensure a fair outcome for all Delaware property owners.
The committee also heard from two subject matter experts: Justin Eimers, Assessment Advisor for the International Association of Assessing Officers (IAAO), and Ron Rakow, a Fellow at the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy. Both provided insight on best practices from other states and answered lawmakers’ questions about reassessment methodology, fair taxation, and public communication.
The experts emphasized the value of standardized assessment processes, clear public messaging, and ongoing review to build trust in the system. Lawmakers questioned Eimers and Rakow about the potential for varying tax rates based on property types and the ability of counties to adapt to new categories or approaches.
Both experts advised a move toward “annual reassessment”, although not a full revaluation, as was just completed.  Other states have mechanisms in place to adjust values more frequently (annually) to keep values more in line with “market value”.  These adjustments are done based on recent sales, permits and other data that influences neighborhoods, subdivisions, zip codes, etc…
Legislator questions included focus on possible and preferred methods for providing relief for various classes of property owners.

Assessment/Valuation caps – both experts advised against this approach, as it tends to perpetuate the problems that were experienced by a lack of revaluation and reassessment. High value property owners are most protected and the disparity in taxation of properties is maintained.
Circuit Breakers – This was a preferred approach, where taxation is limited based upon a % of income (e.g. 5% of income, max). It would require annual application, but some states incorporate the application with the state income tax filing.
Homestead Exemptions – Also a “progressive” solution, where homeowners receive a flat dollar amount of reduction (like the current $500 for Delaware seniors) or a percentage reduction in the property value. An issue with this solution is that it may miss low-income renters versus homeowners.
Property Tax Deferral – This provides the option of deferring the tax due (with interest) until the property is next sold. This is essentially creating a “home equity loan” until the accrued tax can be paid upon sale of the property.  This avoids the displacement of long-time owners due to the expense of the tax burden.  However, in the experience of other states, this is not widely used and doesn’t appear to provide a comprehensive solution.

As in previous meetings, the committee addressed updates on the implementation of recent legislation and reaffirmed its commitment to transparency and public involvement. All committee hearings remain open to the public and are available for viewing via livestream on the General Assembly’s website.
The committee is expected to continue examining reassessment structures in future sessions, aiming to give clarity and guidance for Delaware’s property tax system moving forward. Residents are encouraged to participate as the process advances throughout the fall.
Upcoming meetings are scheduled:

Hearing #3: Week of October 20, 2025 (Expect Oct. 21, but exact date TBD) – Delawareans and Their Property Taxes: Impacts on residents, comparisons to other states’ programs, and updates to exemptions post-reassessment.
Hearing #4: Week of November 3, 2025 (Expect Nov. 4, but exact date TBD) – Property Reassessment and Education Funding: How reassessments affect school revenues, the 10% windfall rule, and balancing equity in funding without overburdening taxpayers.

The committee hearings will be open to public attendance at Legislative Hall and streamed on the General Assembly website, www.legis.delaware.gov. Post-hearing, the committees will compile findings and propose legislation for the January 2026 session.

The Ethics Commission has not disclosed specifics of what it is investigating — only that the inquiry centers on conflict of interest rules — and is not required to make public the complaints it has received.
However, Rep. Ellen Pogemiller, D-Oklahoma City, filed an ethics complaint against Walters on March 25 over his use of state resources to endorse the Teacher Freedom Alliance, alleging he violated rules governing state officers and private economic interests. She renewed her complaint after Walters announced he would resign to join the organization.
Walters issued a news release March 10 on the Oklahoma State Department of Education letterhead, touting the Teacher Freedom Alliance as an “alternative to woke teachers’ unions.”

Pogemiller alleged this violated rules that prohibit public officeholders from using state resources to endorse or give preferential treatment to a private entity.
“Superintendent Walters’ endorsement is intended to result in increased membership and financial benefits for (the Teacher Freedom Alliance) at the expense of competing labor organizations, which is a blatant misuse of official position,” her complaint states.
Pogemiller worked for the state’s largest teacher union, the Oklahoma Education Association, until she took office as a House lawmaker.
She said she is grateful the Ethics Commission is investigating Walters.
“Oklahomans deserve accountability when taxpayer dollars are used for personal gain,” Pogemiller said.
Walters already has paid $23,300 to settle other ethics complaints over contributions to his 2022 campaign for state superintendent and regarding his social media activity while in office.

Andy Beshear speaks attends an event at Great North Aleworks brewery during his visit to New Hampshire. (Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)Asked whether he’s mulling a presidential campaign in 2028, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear told the Bulletin during a visit to New Hampshire Tuesday that “I’ll sit down with my family and we’ll see.”
During an event held by Manchester City Democrats at a local brewery, Beshear said he’ll start thinking about a presidential campaign after he finishes his term leading the Democratic Governors Association. Beshear is currently vice chairman of the organization and chair-elect. He’s set to lead the group through 2026.
“We’re going to win in some places that nobody’s expecting,” he said.
Throughout the evening, Beshear repeated one phrase: “We’ve gotta spend 80% of our time focusing on issues that matter to 100% of Americans.”
“The Democratic Party needs to be a common-sense, common-ground, get things done type of party,” he said. “We need to put the American people first, and our policies need to get results.”
He said that includes creating jobs, making health care accessible, building safe infrastructure, investing in public education, and ensuring public safety.
Beshear insisted his visit to New Hampshire, an electorally important state in the presidential election, was about helping Democrats in the Granite State.
He also responded to Democratic voters’ demands that elected leaders be more forceful in their responses to the Trump administration.
“I think what you see from me is someone that’s not afraid to criticize this president, and I do it in a state that voted for him by 30 points,” Beshear said. “But at the same time, if we’re going to have credibility, when the president does something that’s positive for our states, we need to make sure we’re admitting that too.”
He cited the president’s response to flooding in Kentucky in February as an example of something positive, but criticized his tariff campaigns and cuts to health care in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.
“You can be forceful in standing up to this president, while also creating a vision for a better country,” Beshear said. “The Democratic Party has to be more than just against someone, we’ve got to be for something.”
While Beshear saw a warm welcome among Manchester Democrats, a pro-Palestine group protested his visit to the state with a TV ad campaign. The Institute for Middle East Understanding put out ads showing the devastation in Gaza wrought by Israeli air strikes and military campaigns. The ad criticized him for previously declining to answer questions about whether he’d stop sending weapons to Israel saying, “If you won’t stand against genocide, you can’t be our next president.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/beshearmanch-1024x706.jpg,,,2025-10-08 13:57:59.369606

PASCAGOULA – Strings of papel picado and flags representing Latin American countries hung above the crowd at the Festival Hispano de Pascagoula, their bright colors and patterns flashing in the September sun. Families from across the Gulf Coast gathered at Beach Park in Pascagoula Sept. 20 to celebrate food, music and cultural pride in the open air. At the festival, vendors offered tamales, fresh tortillas, empanadas and other dishes. Zona Libre played Latin music as the crowd danced and immersed themselves in the sounds with pride and excitement on their faces. Members of the Studio of Dance and Gymnastics wore colorful cultural outfits as they spun in circles, while older eventgoers spoke about heritage and roots in their native countries.

“It feels good to celebrate my culture,” said Nancy Morosky, a Gulf Coast resident originally from Puerto Rico. “I like to be reminded of where we come from, and I want to pass it down to the next generation.”Pascagoula has one of the largest Hispanic communities on the Gulf Coast. According to the 2020 Census, nearly 15% of its 22,000 residents identify as Hispanic or Latino. In Jackson County, the share is closer to 7 percent.

Main Street Pascagoula and the city organized the event, now in its fourth year.“We think it is important because we have a large Hispanic community that is all along the Coast of Mississippi, and we just love to bring people together to celebrate that with good food, fellowship and good fun,” said Susannah Northrop, executive director of Main Street Pascagoula.

The event highlighted more than food, music or cultural outfits. It showed how Hispanic families have built a growing and connected community on the Gulf Coast.As the day neared its end, drums and maracas kept the rhythms in play. The crowd danced, laughed and celebrated their rich culture and heritage under the southern Mississippi night sky.

Mario Lanzarotti, TEDxWilmington speaker in 2022, said,  “Stop Doubting Yourself and Go After What You Really, Really Want,”  and it went viral. 
By Jamie Kleman, Contributing Journalist
WILMINGTON – Sometimes the simplest ideas have the biggest impact. For millions of people around the world, that moment of clarity came from a stage in Delaware. At TEDxWilmington in 2022, Mario Lanzarotti stepped up to talk about something universal – self-doubt. His message, “Stop Doubting Yourself and Go After What You Really, Really Want,” didn’t promise instant confidence or a perfect life. Instead, it offered a small but powerful shift in perspective: don’t bury your doubts, share them.
“Self-doubt is not something you need to eliminate,” Lanzarotti told the Wilmington audience. “It’s a voice inside you that deserves to be heard. When you bring it into the open, when you share it, it loses its power to control you.”
That idea, born on a Delaware stage, has now reached more than 2.7 million people online. Viewers from around the globe continue to return to Lanzarotti’s talk because it blends honesty with action – encouraging people to forgive themselves, talk about their doubts, and see them as guideposts instead of obstacles.
A Global Coach Rooted in Authenticity
Lanzarotti, who is half Italian and half German, now lives in Cape Town, South Africa, where he works as a leadership and performance coach and serves as the founder of Aligned Founders – a growing community and training hub helping male entrepreneurs scale without burnout, chaos, or self-doubt.
After exiting his first New York startup, he discovered what many high-performing men face but rarely admit: success stops feeling like success when it constantly depends on you.
“I had the money and freedom I wanted,” he said, “but underneath it all, I was anxious, exhausted, and quietly asking, why doesn’t this feel better?”
That question led him to uncover what he calls the real bottleneck – not strategy, but the way many men lead themselves and others. Through his coaching and community programs, Lanzarotti helps founders shift from operator mode to leader mode, breaking the mental, emotional, and behavioral patterns that lead to overthinking, inconsistency, and burnout.
So far, more than 2,000 founders across 15+ countries have used his frameworks to scale faster—with less force, more focus, and true freedom.
Expanding a Movement of Mindful Leadership
Now, Lanzarotti is expanding Aligned Founders throughout South Africa, creating monthly founder dinners and full-day growth experiences that bring entrepreneurs together to connect, reflect, and grow without sacrificing their well-being.
His favorite quote – “The most important journey in life is the one you take from your head into your heart” – captures both his coaching philosophy and the essence of his TEDx message.
A Delaware Idea with Global Impact
TEDxWilmington has long prided itself on being more than a speaking series. It’s a launchpad where ideas introduced in an intimate theater can ripple out to the world. Lanzarotti’s viral success underscores just how far those ripples can go.
After his talk went live, Mario was flooded with messages from around the world – new clients, podcasts and speaking invitations, and hundreds of personal notes from people who said his words changed the way they viewed themselves.
“After my TEDx went viral,” he shared, “people from all walks of life reached out to thank me. It’s been incredible to see how one honest message could touch so many hearts.”
Making Life a Little Better
The success of Lanzarotti’s message highlights the power of one idea to make life just a little better – whether that means a student finding the courage to pursue a dream, an entrepreneur pushing through fear, or a parent giving themselves grace.
Delaware may not be the first place people think of when it comes to global ideas, but TEDxWilmington continues to prove that the First State can inspire millions.
And as Mario Lanzarotti’s 2.7-million-view milestone shows, sometimes all it takes is a stage, a speaker, and one simple idea – to change the way the world sees itself.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-08-124014.jpg,,,2025-10-08 13:01:18.316909

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier received a big boost in his bid for a full four-year term next year when President Donald Trump announced Wednesday that he was endorsing him in 2026.
“James Uthmeier is a Strong Conservative Fighter and Prosecutor, and has my Complete and Total Endorsement — HE WILL NOT LET YOU DOWN!” Trump posted on his Truth Social page.
“James is an America First Warrior, who is a true champion for ‘MAGA,’” the president added. “He is THE MAN behind ALLIGATOR ALCATRAZ, and argued strongly at the United States Supreme Court in defense of my Executive Power to fire Deep State bureaucrats. Under James’ fearless leadership, over 1,000 CRIMINAL PEDOPHILES have been arrested, missing children have been SAVED, and our Great Members of Law Enforcement have been empowered to do their jobs and, KEEP FLORIDA SAFE. In his next term, James will continue to work tirelessly to Ensure Law and Order, Uphold our Constitutional Rights, and Protect our always under siege Second Amendment.”
The endorsement came a month after reports surfaced that the president was considering backing Florida Speaker of the House Daniel Perez for AG.
Uthemier, 37, is a close ally of Gov. Ron DeSantis.
The governor appointed him in February to serve as attorney general, after the office fell vacant when DeSantis appointed Ashley Moody to replace Marco Rubio in the U.S. Senate. Next year’s election will be the first time he has ever run for political office.
Earlier, Uthmeier served for more than three years as chief of staff to DeSantis. He also served for several months as campaign manager in the governor’s unsuccessful candidacy for president in 2023-2024, replacing Generra Peck in August 2023.
While the Trump endorsement is big, it doesn’t mean it’s all clear sailing for Uthmeier. That’s because of his involvement in the controversy surrounding Hope Florida, the state program First Lady Casey DeSantis created to move Floridians off government services and into private charity.
That story revolves around a $10 million from a Medicaid over-billing settlement the DeSantis administration steered to the Hope Florida Foundation in 2024. That money was ultimately diverted to a political committee created to fight a proposed constitutional amendment legalizing marijuana that Uthmeier headed.
Florida Rep. Alex Andrade, R-Pensacola, chaired a committee in the Florida House during the 2025 legislative session that investigated the story. He has accused the attorney general of money laundering and wire fraud, and has called on him to resign.
Uthmeier has denied any wrongdoing.
The story resurfaced last week after the Tampa Bay Times and Miami Herald reported that the state’s attorney in Tallahassee has convened a grand jury relating to the Hope Florida Foundation.
‘America-first’
During his swearing-in ceremony in February, Uthmeier promised to champion an “America-first” agenda. “We will not stand idly by as the left tries to infiltrate our institutions and use the court system to indoctrinate our kids,” Uthmeier said. “We will fight the activists that try to weaken our duly enacted laws, that try to challenge the constitutional order, and that try to harm the unborn.”
Uthmeier has raised nearly $600,000 in his regular campaign account, and more than $2 million through his political committee, Friends of James Uthmeier.
Among the Democrats running for the nomination for attorney general next year, the best-known candidate is former South Florida state Sen. José Javier Rodríguez.

The Cedar Falls university announced in a news release it has received a three-year, $1.22 million American History and Civics Education – Seminars grant from the U.S. Department of Education to form the Iowa Civic Educators Institute. The institute is an initiative to prepare educators and material to teach on American politics, history, government and founding principles.
“The Iowa Civic Educators Institute is an opportunity to provide content-rich professional development to Iowa’s current and future teachers that will strengthen civic learning for students across Iowa,” said Allison Rank, director of UNI’s Center for Civic Education, in the release. “Money and time are two significant barriers for teachers interested in this kind of extensive professional development.

According to the release, the Iowa Civic Educators Institute will focus on providing future and current teachers with additional education on “American political tradition and the ideas, traditions, institutions and texts essential to American Constitutional government and our American history and heritage.” The institute will also work to develop course materials on these topics, as well as Iowa history and politics.
Seminars for educators will also be available, split between pre-service and in-service teachers and those focused on elementary education, the release stated. These events will touch on civic values and experience, the relationship between individual rights and community membership and “Iowa as a constitutional subject.”
UNI received approval from the Iowa Board of Regents for the center for civic education in September 2024, after the board directed each state university to explore such initiatives. University President Mark Nook said in the release the grant “affirms the national importance” of training and educating people to be “informed and engaged citizens.”
“The Iowa Civic Educators Institute will empower teachers across our state with the knowledge and tools to strengthen civic learning for generations of students,” Nook said in the release. “We are deeply grateful to Governor Reynolds for her support of our grant application, and to the U.S. Department of Education for investing in this vision. Together, we are ensuring that civic education remains a cornerstone of Iowa’s schools and communities.”

(Max McCoy/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — University of Kansas indigenous studies director Alex Red Corn said a $1.5 million grant would allow a five-year collaboration with tribal nations and school districts in three states to broaden the pipeline of K-12 teachers working in schools serving Native American students.
The difficulty of attracting and retaining teachers to serve Native American students has been fueled from insufficient funding, isolation of rural communities and lack of job-market recruiting.
 KU was awarded the grant from the Office of Indian Education in the U.S. Department of Education. The program involves the Southern Plains American Indian Teaching Pathways Project, which is a partnership that included Haskell Indian Nations University, or HINU, in Lawrence.
The goal is to work with Native Nations and school districts in Kansas, Nebraska and Oklahoma to prepare and mentor 15 teachers in elementary or secondary education.
“We look forward to getting started recruiting folks from Native communities and offer them a funded pathway to full teacher licensure through KU and Haskell and continuing to grow our longstanding partnership with Haskell in new and exciting ways,” said Red Corn, an Osage member, the lead principal investigator on the project and a KU associate professor.
Under the program, researchers plan to recruit individuals who earned or were approaching completion of an associate’s degree and want to pursue teaching certification by earning a bachelor’s degree at HINU or KU.
Upon graduation, these certified teachers would be required to work in Native-serving schools, where they would receive career mentorship from experienced teachers and cultural leaders.
KU officials said students involved in the program would be eligible for financial support in the form of tuition and fees, monthly living stipends, books, laptops and academic conference travel.
“We’re very appreciative of this opportunity from the Office of Indian Education, which is such a critical resource for tribal nations looking to advance sovereignty in education,” Red Corn said.
He said tribe and school partners in the region were eager to participate in work on a sustained program to bolster the teacher-development pipeline.
Project partners on the grant application included HINU, Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation, Osage Nation, Quapaw Nation, and the Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes.
Other partners in the teacher development effort would be Royal Valley Schools and South Brown County Schools as well as Daposka Ahnkodapi (Osage Nation School), Darlington Public Schools, Umoⁿhoⁿ Nation Public School and the Tribal Education Departments National Assembly.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Haskellstatue-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-08 13:01:18.316909

The suit, filed with the Michigan Court of Claims Tuesday, argues that the new law, and the steps leading up to its enactment, violates several sections of the Michigan Constitution, including requirements for amending the law that legalized marijuana in the state. 
Voters in 2018 approved Proposal 1, creating the Michigan Regulation and Taxation of Marihuana Act, which legalized marijuana for recreational use by individuals 21 and older. The law also levies a 10% excise tax on the commercial sale of marijuana. 
In its complaint, the Michigan Cannabis Industry Association argues this law is the exclusive means for imposing an excise tax on the sale of marijuana, and that in order to modify the voter-initiated statute, the matter would either need to be approved by voters or achieve a three-fourths vote in the Legislature. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The 24% tax was approved by the Michigan House in a 78-21 vote, with 11 members not voting, while the matter passed the Senate in a tight 19-17 vote with one member not voting and one seat vacant. 
Because the 24% was enacted through a separate law, and did not achieve three-fourths support from the 138 member Legislature, the association argues the attempt to levy a new tax is invalid.

The association also argued the original title of the bill was misleading and that the policy underwent an unlawful change of purpose leading up to the final version approved by the Legislature, shifting from a policy creating a fund for road funding and revenue replacement without establishing any tax, to one imposing a 24% excise tax on marijuana wholesale prices. 
The new law also violates the state constitution’s contracts clause, the group alleges. 
The Michigan Cannabis Industry Association has requested a declaratory judgment deeming the new tax law invalid and unenforceable, alongside injunctive relief preventing the state government from enforcing the act. 
In an email Wednesday morning, Department of Treasury spokesperson Ron Leix said the department had not been served the lawsuit and does not have any comment.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-08 16:31:53+00:00,CT Mirror,Fairfield finishes strengthened storm infrastructure nearly 13 years after Superstorm Sandy,Abigail Brone | Connecticut Public,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/08/fairfield-storm-infrastructure-finished/,"Federal funds provided flood control structures, a storm water pump station and backup grid services for extended power outages.","October marks 13 years since Superstorm Sandy ravaged Connecticut. The town of Fairfield is now reflecting on how the storm and the damage it caused shaped the town’s storm preparedness strategies.
In 2012, Sandy damaged more than 1,000 homes in Fairfield and required the evacuation of more than 5,000 residents, according to Connecticut Department of Housing’s Mia Delaire.
“This was not simply a weather event, it was a wake up call to strengthen our infrastructure and planning for the future,” Delaire said. “Moving beyond recovery and moving towards resilience by coupling immediate need with forward looking solutions, Fairfield has strengthened its capacity to withstand future storm events and protect its critical services.”
Statewide, the storm damaged about 3,000 homes and knocked out power to more than 600,000 families. It cost Connecticut more than $350 million in damage and exposed the state’s infrastructure weaknesses.
Following the storm, the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) gave Connecticut more than $150 million to work on repairs, about $7 million of which went to Fairfield.
The funds provided flood control structures, a storm water pump station and backup grid services in case the power goes out for an extended period.
Two projects in Fairfield helped the town recover from Sandy. One project updated flood controls, while the second established a microgrid, or “a core generation and backup” for town facilities. This grid helps ensure power and services stay in place should there be an extended power outage, Delaire said.
The backup grid was finished recently, according to Fairfield Public Works General Manager John Cottell.
“The microgrid project actually started with a contract back in 2015 as they were applying for the HUD grants,” Cottell said. “We had a few delays with it, but we finally completed this past year.”
Fairfield’s improvements on the wastewater system were used to highlight Connecticut’s response and adaptation to climate change during the state’s second annual sustainability and resiliency week.
Aspects of Fairfield’s work to repair and strengthen its storm protections took years due to the complexity of the project and delays.
Repairing and adding to the town’s storm management system was complicated, according to Bill Hurley, Engineering Manager for the town of Fairfield.
“They had to be constructed without disrupting operations of the treatment plant, but the critical infrastructure also included the animal shelter and a composting facility as well,” Hurley said. “One of the things that I would suggest to people is to realize that there’s always going to be unexpected situations that occur.”
Despite the projects’ complexities, both parts of the infrastructure upgrades are complete.
“Fairfield has strengthened its capacity to withstand future storm events and protect its critical services,” Delaire said.

The Target along Middletown Warwick Road in Middletown, Delaware, held a celebratory event in honor of the store opening a year ago.
 
MIDDLETOWN — Customers looking to grab Taylor Swift’s new album or just regular household items were welcomed into the Northside Shopping Center Target with balloons and posters on Friday, October 3, as the store celebrated its first year in the Middletown community.
Customers walking into Target early in the day entered the store underneath a red and white balloon arch right into a large celebratory backdrop filled with balloons and a number one statue. Alongside the photo backdrop was a table with a couple of gift baskets, raffle tickets and a pumpkin for patrons to sign all as a way to celebrate Target’s inclusion in the Middletown community a year ago.

“We wanted to build a community as soon as we opened here … and now we’re looking at it live a year later, how beautiful this store has come to life, and how we impacted the community here,” said store director Lauren DiRenzo.

Since its opening in October 2024, DiRenzo said the store has generated over 100 jobs for the surrounding community. In addition, Target staff have made a presence in community events like the Blackbird State Forest cleanup and volunteering at local food banks, according to a Target spokesperson.  
“My team is super excited about giving back and they want to volunteer,” said DiRenzo. “I think it’s just the care that goes into all that and why we’re here and why we’re serving our guests here at Target. It’s one team, one community.”
Since its inclusion in the Middletown community, Target employees donated over 3,000 hours of their time for local causes. The store itself donated over $500,000 of product and money to causes throughout the state, said a Target spokesperson. 
Patrons of Target told Delaware Live that there was some hesitation and skepticism about Target coming to the shopping center, because of a perceived increase in traffic. After a year in the community, those concerns haven’t been much of an issue.
“Overall I was really skeptical at first, but I think it’s been a really good addition to not just the community, but our neighborhood as well,” said community member Mariah Czyszczon.
Czyszczon said she shops at the Target about twice a week because of its proximity and convenience.  
DiRenzo said the store and staff try to generate togetherness with the community it serves by staying true to the Target motto of  “care, grow and win”. One of the ways the store is accomplishing that feat is by a newer layout that includes a larger food and beverage section that DiRenzo said is driving “a lot of business” for the store. It’s one of two locations throughout the United States with this upgraded design, said the spokesperson.
Another is Target’s relationship with national and local vendors like Poppi and Page Street Beauty, both of whom set up booths throughout the store for customers to visit. The Poppi booth handed out free samples of a few of its flavors.

Later in the day, customers visiting the store got to enjoy live music and food trucks culminating a day for Target to celebrate the community it serves and a community that supports them. 
“What we are super excited about is when we have guests come in here, building relationships with our guests, seeing what they’re coming in here for,” said DiRenzo. “They are coming in to serve us. We are doing it vice versa.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-08 16:14:38+00:00,CT Mirror,Bipartisan US governors’ group divided over Trump’s deployment of troops to states,Associated Press,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/08/trump-troops-national-governors-association-ned-lamont/,CT Gov. Ned Lamont said in a statement that he's opposed to the mobilization but isn't ready give up on the governors' organization over it.,"The Democratic governors of California and Illinois are threatening to leave the National Governors Association because of its silence on President Donald Trump’s deployment of National Guard troops across state lines despite objections from the receiving states’ leaders.
“If we cannot come together, on a bipartisan basis, on this basic principle of state sovereignty, what purpose does the National Governors Association serve?” California Gov. Gavin Newsom asked in a letter to the nation’s other governors.
The bipartisan governors’ group, founded in 1908, advocates for issues on which governors find common ground and hosts meetings where they can exchange ideas. Separate Democratic and Republican governors’ associations take more partisan positions and help finance campaigns.
Newsom and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, both potential 2028 presidential candidates, contend Trump’s troop deployments should be a matter of concern for all governors. But some Republican governors have supported Trump’s actions, and the national governors’ group has not taken a position.
“I’m not sure the policy issue of whether the Constitution allows for federal involvement in the state and the National Guard is something that the NGA would want to tackle,” said Republican Missouri Gov. Mike Kehoe, who co-chairs the organization’s task force on emergency management and public health.
The Democratic governors of Kansas, Michigan and Minnesota already have left the NGA this year. Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly said she didn’t think the roughly $100,000 annual dues paid by the state were a good investment and encouraged the group to push back against canceled federal grants.
Some Democrats see Guard action diminishing states’ role
The bipartisan governors’ organization is far from the first institution to face division and doubts over how it should respond to sweeping changes in Trump’s second term. Since returning to office, Trump has been using executive power in ways that presidents usually don’t.
This week, he has attempted to deploy Texas National Guard members to Chicago and California Guard members to Portland, Oregon, to protect federal immigration facilities and personnel amid what Trump describes as out-of-control crime. Democratic officials in those states have sued over the efforts, as has California. So far, judges have blocked the deployment in Oregon but haven’t stopped it in Illinois.
Newsom and Pritzker have argued the National Guard deployments are not just a policy difference but an infringement on state sovereignty that must be condemned.
“The credibility of the National Governors Association — and our integrity as state executives — rests on our willingness to apply our principles consistently, regardless of which administration attacks them,” Pritzker said in a letter Monday to Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, the chair of the National Governors Association.
Stitt did not immediately respond Tuesday to a request for comment from The Associated Press. But he said in a news conference last month that the group should steer clear of areas where there’s not a consensus and leave those to the Democratic Governors Association and Republican Governors Association.
Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who authorized the call-up of 400 Texas National Guard members, did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday. On Monday, he posted a cartoon on his X account showing the Democratic governors of California, Illinois and New York telling Trump, “LEAVE OUR CRIME ALONE.”
Bipartisan group doesn’t always weigh in
The National Governors Association bills itself as a beacon of bipartisanship, which means it stays out of a lot of the thorniest battles. Some topics where governors have found common ground include disaster preparedness, workforce development and expanding broadband access.
Last week, Stitt and NGA vice chair Wes Moore, the Democratic governor of Maryland and a possible 2028 presidential candidate, condemned the then-looming federal government shutdown, calling for dialogue but not a specific policy solution: “We urge federal leaders from both sides to work to set aside political games and pass a budget that reflects the values and promises states commit to every day.”
But no unity has emerged on Trump’s immigration and crime-fighting policies.
Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont, a Democrat, said in a statement that he’s opposed to the mobilization but isn’t ready give up on the governors’ organization over it. “My hope is that the NGA will continue to advocate for the best interest of the states,” he said.
Kehoe said no one has asked him to sign onto a statement denouncing Trump’s deployment of National Guard troops to states against a governor’s will. Earlier this year, Kehoe successfully pushed for a state makeover of the St. Louis Police Department oversight board despite the objections of the Democratic mayor, citing crime as justification.
“Certainly Chicago could use some help,” Kehoe said. “I would hope that Governor Pritzker would welcome help to keep his citizens safe.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AP25280594497993-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-08 13:01:18.316909

(Photo by Kyle Phillips/For Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Oklahoma’s Legislature acted unconstitutionally when it passed a new law creating business courts, the state’s highest court ruled.
The Oklahoma Supreme Court ruled 6-2 on Tuesday that the Legislature “exceeded the boundaries” of the state Constitution in part because lawmakers lack the authority to create a court system beyond the eight that already exist. The justices found that legislators attempted to create a special type of judge who is paid differently, has different terms and is exempt from voter scrutiny, an oversight power guaranteed to Oklahomans by the state Constitution.
Senate Bill 632 had sought to create business courts in Oklahoma City and Tulsa, but attorneys Joe E. White Jr. and Jason Waddell sued, questioning the constitutionality. They asked that the law be tossed out because business court judges would have been accountable only to the Legislature and the governor rather than to voters, which they contended was unconstitutional.
Supporters, including Gov. Kevin Stitt, had argued that the courts would help attract businesses to Oklahoma.
Stitt said in a statement that while the outcome was disappointing, it will not deter from his mission to make Oklahoma top 10.
“The Supreme Court’s decision to block the business courts law passed by a bipartisan super majority mandate of the Legislature stands in stark contrast to our reputation as the most business-friendly state,” he said. “There is still a need and overwhelming bipartisan support for specialized business courts, and as was acknowledged in the decision, a path forward to establishing such courts in Oklahoma.” 
House Speaker Kyle Hilbert, R-Bristow, and Senate President Pro Tem Lonnie Paxton, R-Tuttle, who authored the legislation, did not immediately comment on Wednesday.
The Supreme Court ruled that adding a new court system would require a constitutional amendment. Judicial power is currently vested only in eight state courts — the Supreme Court, the Court of Criminal Appeals, the Court on the Judiciary, the State Industrial Court, the Court of Bank Review, the Court of Tax Review and district courts.
At one time the state Constitution allowed lawmakers the authority to create courts, but that power was abolished in 1967 as part of broader judicial reform effort, and the Legislature’s power was intentionally limited, according to the ruling, which was penned by Justice Noma Gurich.
The Constitution does not give lawmakers any authority to create new courts outside of “immediate appellate” and municipal courts, the justices found.
Gurich wrote that the “business court division” is part of the district court system, which means under the state Constitution those business court judges are essentially district court judges, who must be elected by voters in nonpartisan elections. SB 632 does not require the election of business court judges. 
Under SB 632, business court judges would have been selected by the governor from a list of three candidates compiled by the House speaker. They would then be confirmed by the state Senate. A business court judge would be guaranteed an eight-year term with the possibility of being reappointed.
The law would circumvent the Judicial Nominating Commission, which currently recommends candidates to fill judicial vacancies. The commission submits judicial recommendations to the governor, who makes a selection from the list. Senate confirmation isn’t required, but voters later decide whether to retain those judges at the ballot box.
SB 632 also attempted to establish more stringent qualifications for business court judges, different pay and longer terms than the Oklahoma Constitution allows, the justices found. 
Justices James Winchester, James Edmondson, Douglas Combs and Richard Darby concurred with the opinion. Chief Justice Dustin Rowe concurred, but dissented in part while Vice Chief Justice Dana Kuehn and Justice Travis Jett dissented.

Vance is making a return trip to Indiana to speak with state lawmakers about mid-cycle redistricting. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)Vice President JD Vance is slated to return to the Hoosier State on Friday to meet with Indiana’s Senate Republican caucus as redistricting deliberations appear to be at an impasse.
Multiple sources, including two Republican state senators, confirmed to the Indiana Capital Chronicle that Vance will meet with lawmakers in Indianapolis. The visit comes as state GOP legislators weigh a special session for mid-cycle redistricting — a move that has split some members of the party.
Sen. Sue Glick, R-LaGrange, told the Capital Chronicle most lawmakers she’s spoken with aren’t eager to reopen the maps.
“I think everybody wants to keep an open mind,” she said. “But, you know, the general attitude all along has been that nobody has much of an appetite for redistricting. I mean, we thought the maps we did before were fair.”

President Donald Trump is pushing GOP-led states like Indiana to redraw maps ahead of the 2026 midterm elections to ensure a Republican majority in the U.S. House for the rest of his second term. Redistricting is typically only done after the decennial census.
Indiana’s current map is 7-2 Republicans, with Democrats holding seats in northwest and central Indiana. 
Glick also questioned the cost and optics of calling lawmakers back to Indianapolis.
“Why spend the money?” she asked. “We’re in a financial time when we’re telling every level of government to reduce spending. And then we’re thinking about spending six figures to bring us all back down there for a special session that nobody wants. It doesn’t sell well; it doesn’t feel right to do it. It doesn’t feel right to do it in terms of fairness, but it surely doesn’t feel right in terms of the financial — because there’s nothing to be gained and there’s a lot to be lost.”
The Indiana Senate Republican caucus has been largely silent about redistricting. Both House and Senate Republicans have held closed-door meetings on the topic.
The vice president’s visit will mark his second trip to Indiana in about two months. In August, Vance met with Gov. Mike Braun, Senate President Pro Tem Rodric Bray and House Speaker Todd Huston at the Statehouse to rally support for redistricting. Braun described the meeting as “pretty good,” but neither the governor nor legislative leadership signaled any firm commitment to the proposal.
Later that month, dozens of GOP lawmakers from Indiana’s House and Senate traveled to Washington, D.C., to meet with Vance and other federal officials about a variety of topics, including redistricting. Bray and Huston met in person with Trump during that visit.
Some Hoosier legislators said those conversations played a role in their decision to change their stance.
“I want to hear him again,” said Sen. Andy Zay, R-Huntington, referring to the vice president. “There’s a lot to consider there, and as with these roles, a lot of it’s policy and a little bit political. And this kind of slant of things is political. And, you know, those games have been played throughout history and certainly been played by our counterparts, and it’s something that maybe we haven’t done as good a job at. And I think that’s really driving the conversation.”
Sen. Andy Zay listens in committee on Thursday, March 27, 2025. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
For most members, Glick said, the push for mid-cycle redistricting feels unnecessary.
“I don’t think there’s an appetite amongst the members of the General Assembly that I’ve talked to,” she said. “If you’re an aspiring politician and you want to go to Congress, maybe you think, well, here’s my chance. But, to be honest, for most of us — is this a fair thing to do? Is this the right thing to do?”
Braun has said repeatedly that he wants legislative leaders to reach a consensus before he would consider calling lawmakers back to the Statehouse. 
In recent interviews, the governor emphasized that his role is to support — not drive — the process.
“I want it to be where it wasn’t forced upon our legislature, have our leaders talk to their own caucus members,” he told Fort Wayne’s WOWO radio last month. He added that lawmakers needed time to “weigh what good comes from it” before committing to any redistricting effort. 
And he suggested Indiana’s relationship with the Trump administration might suffer if lawmakers don’t move forward. 
Still, the governor has floated the idea of a November special session, saying he’s been “talking to leadership in both chambers” and would consider calling lawmakers back if Republicans have the necessary votes.
Glick said lawmakers tried to balance representation across districts when the maps were last redrawn in 2021.
“Obviously, we didn’t draw them to make sure that there was a 50/50 split across the state — that’s not what you do — but you try and be fair,” Glick said. “You try and make sure that every voter is represented.”

This will be Parsons’ second stint as the top federal prosecutor in the state. He previously served in the job during the first Trump administration.
Thune congratulated Parsons in a post to X (formerly Twitter) on Tuesday.
“Ron has already proved he has what it takes to be a great U.S. attorney, and I know he’ll continue to work hard for the people of South Dakota,” Thune said.
Parsons has degrees from the University of Minnesota and the University of South Dakota’s Knudson School of Law. He succeeds Alison Ramsdell, who was appointed during the Biden administration.
Parsons’ confirmation came after a Senate rule change, spearheaded by Thune, that allows the chamber to confirm some of the president’s appointees in large batches instead of one at a time. The change followed weeks of frustration from President Donald Trump and numerous Republican senators, who were exasperated by Democrats slowing down the confirmation process for lower-ranking nominees.

Education Secretary Linda McMahon has been clear about her desire to shut down the agency she runs. She’s laid off half the staff and joked about padlocking the door.
She calls it “the final mission.”
But the department is not behaving like an agency that is simply winding down. Even as McMahon has shrunk the Department of Education, she’s operated in what she calls “a parallel universe” to radically shift how children will learn for years to come. The department’s actions and policies reflect a disdain for public schools and a desire to dismantle that system in favor of a range of other options — private, Christian and virtual schools or homeschooling.
Over just eight months, department officials have opened a $500 million tap for charter schools, a huge outlay for an option that often draws children from traditional public schools. They have repeatedly urged states to spend federal money for poor and at-risk students at private schools and businesses. And they have threatened penalties for public schools that offer programs to address historic inequities for Black or Hispanic students.

McMahon has described her agency moving “at lightning rocket speed,” and the department’s actions in just one week in September reflect that urgency.
The agency publicly blasted four school districts it views as insubordinate for refusing to adopt anti-trans policies and for not eliminating special programs for Black students. It created a pot of funding dedicated to what it calls “patriotic education,” which has been criticized for downplaying some of the country’s most troubling episodes, including slavery. And it formed a coalition with Turning Point USA, Hillsdale College, PragerU and dozens of other conservative groups to disseminate patriotic programming.
Officials at the Education Department declined to comment or answer questions from ProPublica for this story.
At times, McMahon has voiced support for public schools. But more often and more emphatically she has portrayed public schools as unsuccessful and unsafe — and has said she is determined to give parents other options.
To carry out her vision, McMahon has brought on at least 20 political appointees from ultraconservative think tanks and advocacy groups eager to de-emphasize public schools, which have educated students for roughly 200 years.
Among them is top adviser Lindsey Burke, a longtime policy director at The Heritage Foundation and the lead author of the education section in Project 2025’s controversial agenda for the Trump administration.
In analyzing dozens of hours of audio and video footage of public and private speaking events for McMahon’s appointees, as well as their writings, ProPublica found that a recurring theme is the desire to enable more families to leave public schools. This includes expanding programs that provide payment — in the form of debit cards, which Burke has likened to an “Amazon gift card” — to parents to cobble together customized educational plans for their children. Instead of relying on public schools, parents would use their allotted tax dollars on a range of costs: private school tuition, online learning, tutors, transportation and music lessons.
More than 8 in 10 elementary and secondary students in the U.S. go to a traditional public school. But Burke expects that public schools will see dramatic enrollment declines fueled by both demographic and policy changes.
Addressing an interviewer in an April podcast, she noted: “We’re going to have a lot of empty school buildings.”
In a 2024 podcast, Noah Pollak, now a senior adviser in the Education Department, bemoaned what he sees as progressive control of schools, which he said has led to lessons he finds unacceptable, such as teaching fourth graders about systemic racism.
“And so the work that I do is trying to come up with creative policy ideas to stop that, to turn back the tide, to figure out ways that conservatives can protect these institutions or build new institutions,” said Pollak, who has been an adviser to conservative groups.
As tax dollars are reallocated from public school districts and families abandon those schools to learn at home or in private settings, the new department officials see little need for oversight. Instead, they would let the marketplace determine what’s working using tools such as Yelp-like reviews from parents. Burke has said she is against “any sort of regulation.”
President Donald Trump himself said in July that the federal government needs only to provide “a little tiny bit of supervision but very little, almost nothing,” over the nation’s education system except to make sure students speak English.
Advocates for public schools consider them fundamental to American democracy. Providing public schools is a requirement in every state constitution.
Families in small and rural communities tend to rely more heavily on public education. They are less likely than families in cities to have private and charter schools nearby. And unlike private schools, public school districts don’t charge tuition. Public schools enroll local students regardless of academic or physical ability, race, gender or family income; private schools can selectively admit students.
Karma Quick-Panwala, a leader at the Disability Rights Education and Defense Fund, which advocates for disabled students, said she wants to be optimistic. “But,” she added, “I’m very fearful that we are headed towards a less inclusive, less diverse and more segregated public school setting.”
Allison Rose Socol, a policy expert at EdTrust, an organization focusing on civil rights in schools, decried what she called the “demo crew” in McMahon’s office. Socol described McMahon’s push to help grow private school enrollment through taxpayer-funded vouchers and other means as a “great American heist” that will funnel money away from the public system.
“It’s a strategic theft of the future of our country, our kids and our democracy,” she said.

Attention on McMahon often focuses on her former role as CEO of World Wrestling Entertainment. It was no different on the day of her Senate confirmation hearing, when journalists and social media delighted in noting that seated behind her was her son-in-law, the retired wrestler known as Triple H.
Little attention was paid to the conservative education activists in the front row from Moms for Liberty, which has protested school curricula and orchestrated book bans nationwide; Defending Education (formerly Parents Defending Education), which has sued districts to fight what it calls liberal indoctrination; and the America First Policy Institute, co-founded by McMahon after the first Trump administration.
Now two people who once served at Defending Education have been named to posts in the Education Department, and leaders from Moms for Liberty have joined McMahon for roundtables and other official events. In addition, at least nine people from the America First Policy Institute have been hired in the department.
AFPI’s sweeping education priorities include advocating for school vouchers and embedding biblical principles in schools. It released a policy paper in 2023, titled “Biblical Foundations,” that sets out the organization’s objective to end the separation of church and state and “plant Jesus in every space.”
The paper rejects the idea that society has a collective responsibility to educate all children equally and argues that “the Bible makes it clear that it is parents alone who shoulder the responsibility for their children.” It frames public schooling as failing, with low test scores and “far-left social experiments, such as gender fluidity.”
The first AFPI leader pictured in that report is McMahon.
AFPI and the other two nonprofit groups sprang up only after the 2020 election. Together they drew in tens of millions of dollars through a well-coordinated right-wing network that had spent decades advocating for school choice and injecting Christianity into schools.
Ultrawealthy supporters include right-wing billionaire Richard Uihlein, who, through a super PAC, gave $336,000 to Moms for Liberty’s super PAC from October 2023 through July 2024.
Defending Education and AFPI received backing from some of the same prominent conservative foundations and trusts, including ones linked to libertarian-minded billionaire Charles Koch and to conservative legal activist Leonard Leo, an architect of the effort to strip liberal influence from the courts, politics and schools.
Maurice T. Cunningham, a now-retired associate professor of political science at the University of Massachusetts, studied the origins and connections of parents’ rights groups, finding in 2023 that the funders — a small set of billionaires and Christian nationalists — had similar goals.
The groups want “to undermine teachers unions, protect their wealthy donors from having to contribute their fair share in taxes to strengthen public schools, and provide profit opportunities through school privatization,” he concluded. The groups say they are merely trying to advocate for parents and for school choice. They didn’t discuss their relationship with donors when contacted by ProPublica.
These groups and their supporters now have access to the top levers of government, either through official roles in the agency or through the administration’s adoption of their views.
When the department created an “End DEI” portal to collect tips about diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives in schools, it quoted Moms for Liberty co-founder Tiffany Justice in the press release. She encouraged parents to “share the receipts of the betrayal that has happened in our public schools.” Moms for Liberty referred to the portal as the “culmination” of Justice’s work. (Federal judges ruled against some of the administration’s anti-DEI actions and the department took the controversial portal down in May.)
Asked what percentage of children she imagines should be in public schools going forward, Justice, who is now with The Heritage Foundation’s political advocacy arm, told ProPublica: “I hope zero. I hope to get to zero.”
She and others say most public schools don’t teach students to read, are dividing children over race and are secretly helping students to change genders — familiar claims that have been widely challenged by educators.
When Trump signed an executive order in March to dismantle the Education Department, Justice sat in the first row, as she had at McMahon’s confirmation hearing. The president praised her, along with various governors and lawmakers. “She’s been a hard worker,” he said.
Defending Education’s Nicole Neily, who was also at McMahon’s confirmation, stood next to McMahon when the secretary announced an investigation into the Maine Department of Education for keeping records from parents about student gender identity plans. Defending Education has filed civil rights complaints against colleges and school districts and has been successful in having its causes taken up by the Trump administration.
In an email, Neily told ProPublica she is proud of the work that Defending Education has done to challenge schools that have supported DEI in their curricula and have allowed students to hide their gender identity from parents. She singled out teacher unions and “radical education activists” while blaming drops in student achievement on “the education-industrial complex.”
“The sooner this stranglehold is broken, the better,” she wrote.
McMahon’s tenure also has been marked by an embrace of religion in schools. She signaled that priority when she appointed Meg Kilgannon to a top post in her office.
Kilgannon had worked in the department as director of a faith initiative during the first Trump term and once was part of the Family Research Council, an evangelical think tank that opposes abortion and LGBTQ+ rights.
She has encouraged conservative Christians to become involved in what she’s described as “a spiritual war” over children and what they’re being taught in public schools.
Reached by phone, Kilgannon told ProPublica, “I have no comment,” and hung up.

Betsy DeVos, the Michigan billionaire who was education secretary in Trump’s first term, cheered on July 4 this year when Congress instituted America’s first federal voucher program. It came in the form of a generous tax credit program to encourage voucher expansion at the state level. Families can start accessing the aid beginning Jan. 1, 2027.
DeVos once said she wanted “to advance God’s kingdom” through vouchers for religious schools and has funneled vast amounts of her family fortune into advocating for school choice. She called the passage of the federal measure “the turning point in ending the one-size-fits-all government school monopoly.”
An article in The Federalist, a conservative publication, boiled down the implications into one headline: “How Trump’s Big, Beautiful Bill Will Help Kids Escape Failing Government Schools.”
But school choice isn’t the only tool that Trump’s education leaders are using to target public schools. McMahon has gutted the Education Department’s civil rights division, where lawyers and other federal employees work to ensure all students can access public school, free from discrimination.
The administration rolled back protections for LGBTQ+ students and students of color, prioritized investigating discrimination against white and Jewish students, and launched aggressive investigations of states and districts that it says refused to stop accommodating transgender students.
It has rescinded official guidance that said schools had to provide language help and other services for students who are learning English, contradicting long-established federal law.
And Trump officials have repeatedly cast public schools as dangerous even as the agency canceled about $1 billion in training grants for more school mental health professionals — money that had been authorized by Congress to help prevent school shootings. The administration now says it plans to resume paying out a fraction of that funding, which would be used for school psychologists.
Over and over, the department has used the threat of pulling federal funding to force compliance with new directives and rapid shifts in policy. The department, for instance, threatened to withhold money from schools that did not verify they were ending diversity initiatives, which were designed to address inequitable treatment of Black, Native and Latino students.
In August, the department announced it was withholding millions of dollars in grants from five northern Virginia school districts that had refused the department’s demands to bar transgender students from using restrooms and locker rooms that aligned with their gender identity. The districts argued that complying would mean defying Virginia law and a 2020 federal appeals court ruling.
Nevertheless, the Education Department told the districts that until they acquiesced to the agency’s bathroom rules they would have to pay expenses up front and request reimbursement. McMahon wrote to districts that “Lindsey Burke is available to answer any questions.”
The Fairfax County Public Schools sued and in a legal filing said it faced losing $167 million this school year, money that it was relying on to provide meals to students, support programs for children with disabilities, help English-language learners and enhance teacher training. The federal department has argued that it has discretion to withhold funding and admonished the district for taking the agency to court.
In this atmosphere, public school advocates are particularly concerned about what will happen to funding for Title I grants, which is the federal government’s largest program for schools and is aimed at helping students from low-income families. In early September, House Republicans proposed slashing more than $5 billion from the $18.4 billion earmarked for Title I, putting at risk reading and math teachers, tutors and classroom technology.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
At the same time, under McMahon, the Education Department is trying to redefine how states and districts can spend the money.
In three guidance letters so far this year, the agency encouraged states to divert some Title I money away from public school districts. One suggested paying for outside services, such as privatized tutoring. Another urged states to use Title I money to benefit low-achieving students who live within the boundaries of a high-poverty public school but attend private schools.
McMahon is prepared to loosen even more rules on the money. The federal dollars currently are distributed to districts using a formula. Project 2025 calls for Title I to be delivered to states as block grants, or chunks of money with few restrictions. McMahon has encouraged states to ask her to waive rules on spending the money.
Critics of this approach fear that Title I money could eventually be used in ways that undermine public schools — on private school vouchers, for example.
Public school advocates like William Phillis, a former official at the Ohio Department of Education, fear the change would devastate public schools.
“I just know any block grant or any funding that would be left up to state officials on Title I money would be misappropriated in terms of the intent,” Phillis said. “Block grants to Ohio would go to the private sector.”
A spokesperson for the Ohio Department of Education and Workforce did not respond to requests for comment.
Rainey Briggs, chief of operations for Des Moines Public Schools in Iowa, said he supports parental choice but worries that public schools will suffer financially and will not have the resources to stay up to date.
And he fears that right-wing narratives around public schools, the distrust and lack of support for highly trained district leaders — whether from some parents or politicians — could lead accomplished educators to walk away.
“Public education is irreplaceable,” he said, citing its commitment to serve every child regardless of their background or circumstance.
Those influencing Trump’s education agenda disagree.
“If America’s public schools cease to exist tomorrow, America would be a better place,” Justice told ProPublica.

,California,2025-10-08 15:13:43+00:00,CalMatters,Newsom signs bill to prevent sex abuse in schools,Carolyn Jones,,,,,https://calmatters.org/education/k-12-education/2025/10/school-sex-abuse-california/,"The law requires a database intended to stop teachers facing credible accusations of abuse from quitting and getting rehired at another school, potentially abusing more children.","In summary
The law requires a database intended to stop teachers facing credible accusations of abuse from quitting and getting rehired at another school, potentially abusing more children. 


California’s K-12 schools will take far-ranging steps to prevent sexual abuse on campus — including building a database of teachers under investigation for misconduct — under a new law signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom.
 Senate Bill 848, sponsored by state Sen. Sasha Renée Pérez, a Democrat from Alhambra, stems from a slew of recent lawsuits over sexual abuse in California schools, as well as a news report on decades of sexual abuse by at least a dozen teachers at a high school in her district.
“I’m proud to see this bill move forward. It’s been really personal for me,” said Pérez, who recently told CalMatters that she was the victim of a teacher’s inappropriate interest while she was in high school. “For survivors, this is an important step toward justice.”
The law goes into effect Jan. 1, and applies to all K-12 schools in California, including private schools. 
Among other things, the law requires schools to train teachers, coaches and other school staff on how to prevent and report sexual misconduct; broadens the number of staff who are required to report abuse allegations; and requires schools to write comprehensive policies on appropriate behavior. 
But the database is perhaps the most significant change. Administered by the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing, the database is intended to stop teachers facing credible accusations of abuse from quitting and getting rehired at another school, potentially abusing more children. The database will be available to schools as part of their employee screening process, and would be updated if allegations against a teacher prove to be unfounded.
Although sexual abuse has long occurred in schools, the extent of the problem came to light in 2020 after the passage of AB 218, which made it easier for victims to sue school districts and other government agencies over sexual abuse. The law opened a floodgate of lawsuits that have so far cost California schools more than $3 billion and brought some districts to the brink of insolvency. 
Another bill’s failure
The large payouts inspired another bill this year, which would have provided some relief for school districts faced with lawsuits over decades-old abuse claims while still allowing victims to be compensated. Senate bill SB 577, sponsored by State Sen. John Laird, a Democrat from Santa Cruz, stalled in the Assembly. 
The bill didn’t cap settlements or attorney fees, but it called for a statute of limitations on older incidents and would have made it easier for school districts to issue bonds to pay settlements, which in California have mostly ranged from $5 million to $10 million.
“I am disappointed that SB 577 will not be advancing this year,” Laird said in an email. “I had hoped to protect survivors’ access to justice while finding some fiscal relief to local governments. Despite these months of hard work, it was just impossible to balance these interests to get to a successful outcome this year.”
Laird said he hopes to resurrect the bill next year.
Financial hardships for districts
School districts were devastated by SB 577’s failure. Some had canceled preschool programs and field trips, frozen salaries or laid off staff and taken other steps to pay legal settlements. The expenses come at a difficult time for schools, as pandemic relief grants have recently expired and enrollment continues to decline in many parts of the state. 
Montecito Union School District, a 350-student district near Santa Barbara, last month settled an abuse lawsuit for $7.5 million — nearly half its annual budget — for alleged sexual abuse by a former staff member between 1972 and 1978. 
Nearby Carpinteria Unified has also been affected.
“We are very frustrated that legislators failed to assist California school districts who have been forced to defend themselves against decades-old claims, spending millions of dollars that impact current students and families,” said Diana Rigby, superintendent of Carpinteria Unified. “Our district has been severely impacted by the financial burden of defending four lawsuits from the 1970s.”
Advocates for SB 577 said that trial attorneys were behind the bill’s failure. Attorneys earn up to 30% to 40% on legal settlements, and have been advertising around California in search of people who were abused in schools. 
In the final days of the legislative session, ads circulated on social media featuring a photo of Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas with the words, “Stop the Predator Protection Law” and “Stand with child victims.” The ads were paid for by the law firm Manly, Stewart & Finaldi, a national firm with offices in Irvine and Riverside, which specializes in sex abuse claims.
John Manly, a partner in the firm, said he bought the ads to pressure Rivas to reject the bill.
“If I have to spend every last dime to protect a child from being abused, I will do that,” Manly said. “I’ve spent my career doing this, and I’m not going to stop.”
Manly, the lead attorney in the lawsuit against former Olympic team doctor Larry Nassar, said he’d fight any legislation that curbs abuse lawsuits. He also said Pérez’s bill doesn’t go far enough: it should include felony charges for mandated reporters who fail to report suspected abuse, and it should require school districts to publish the names of staff who’ve been “credibly accused” of sexual misconduct.  
He expects the fight to continue next year and beyond.
Consumer Attorneys of California, a lobbying group, was neutral on Laird’s bill.
“Although CAOC had no official position on the bill, we thought it struck the right balance between protecting survivors’ rights and addressing issues relating to public entities,” said Jonathan Underland, spokesperson for Consumer Attorneys of California. “We were disappointed to see that it did not cross the finish line.”
Eventually, state political leaders will have to take action on abuse lawsuits because too many schools and government agencies are facing insolvency, endangering programs that millions of people rely on, said Ben Adler, public affairs director for the California State Association of Counties.
“God bless Senator Laird for taking this on. It was a thankless task,” Adler said. “Moving forward, there has to be a way to ensure justice for survivors without bankrupting schools and counties, which provide a social safety net. The governor and the Legislature will have to get everyone in a room to figure this thing out.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/051122_St-Hope-Charter-School_MG_CM-11.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-08 11:59:10.544113

(Photo by Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)The Bank of North Dakota announced Wednesday plans to launch the Roughrider coin, the state’s first stablecoin.
Stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency that can facilitate instant money transfers, streamline bank-to-bank transactions and, potentially, be used by North Dakotans in daily life down the road. Unlike bitcoin, stablecoin is not subject to volatile price swings because it’s backed by conventional financial assets, overwhelmingly the U.S. dollar.
North Dakota’s state-owned bank is partnering with Fiserv, a Fortune 500 financial technology company, to introduce stablecoin into the state’s banking system, officials announced at a conference in Bismarck. 
Bank of North Dakota President and CEO Don Morgan said the move aims to ensure “the continued health, resilience and relevancy” of North Dakota banks and credit unions.
“We have a 106-year history of commitment to North Dakota agriculture, commerce, and industry through our financial institution partnerships,” Morgan said in a statement. “The development of the Roughrider coin reflects that commitment.”
The first test of the stablecoin in North Dakota banks and credit unions is expected to occur in 2026. It will require the approval of the North Dakota Industrial Commission, which oversees the Bank of North Dakota.
“As one of the first states to issue our own stablecoin backed by real money, North Dakota is taking a cutting-edge approach to creating a secure and efficient financial ecosystem for our citizens,” Gov. Kelly Armstrong, who chairs the Industrial Commission, said in a statement. 
What is stablecoin?
Stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency that uses blockchain technology, similar to bitcoin.
Most stablecoins, like the Roughrider coin being proposed in North Dakota, are tied to the value of the U.S. dollar. Federal law requires each stablecoin in circulation to be matched by a U.S. dollar or equivalent, such as a short-term U.S. Treasury note, held in reserve by a financial institution. That’s why stablecoin is not subject to the volatile price swings of bitcoin and other popular digital assets.
This digital currency is issued, or minted, on demand as the need arises. When the owner of the stablecoin wants to redeem it, the currency is dissolved, or burned, and taken out of circulation. 
The Bank of North Dakota is envisioning stablecoins to primarily be used in bank-to-bank transactions, said Rick Geloff, the bank’s executive vice president. Money transfers that used to take days will be able to take place within minutes, he said. 
“That’s what we’re trying to make sure that our financial institutions in North Dakota can do is move that money quicker and more efficiently,” Geloff said.
The name Roughrider honors the volunteer military unit led by President Theodore Roosevelt. 
Will banking customers see a difference?
Customers are unlikely to notice any significant differences in their banking experience as a result of the Roughrider coin’s implementation, Geloff said, because most of the changes will take place behind the scenes.
While stablecoins are used elsewhere in the world in daily transactions with a merchant or retailer, that’s not the goal of North Dakota’s Roughrider coin initially. 
“This would be more of the back end, helping banks facilitate payments to each other,” Geloff said. 
That could change in the future if retailers and other businesses begin accepting stablecoin as a form of payment. 
Dan McGonegle, senior manager of the digital assets team at accounting and consulting firm Crowe, said one advantage to stablecoin from a merchant’s perspective may be significantly lower transaction fees. Merchants have to pay fees to process payments made with credit or debit cards. Stablecoin potentially offers a cheaper alternative, he said. If merchants choose to encourage customers to use the digital currency as a way to lower their costs, that could speed up widespread adoption. 
“If I’m a large merchant, then I may have real incentive to encourage my customers to transact in stablecoins,” McGonegle said. “I think it still remains to be seen how that could all play out.”
Earlier this year, Wyoming took a different approach and launched its own stablecoin known as the Frontier Stable Token. Geloff said this is an example of stablecoins being marketed for use by the public. 
Stablecoin has been more widely adopted in countries where the traditional currency is volatile, such as Venezuela and Argentina, Geloff said. 
Why now?
The Bank of North Dakota began exploring stablecoin after federal legislation, called the Genius Act, was signed into law by President Donald Trump in July. 
This law created 80% of the federal regulatory framework for stablecoin, Geloff said, providing certainty and safeguards that have made it possible for mainstream financial institutions to begin considering using it.
It’s a new financial tool that offers a lot of potential, but can be daunting to begin using, said Kelvin Hullet, the bank’s chief business development officer. So the bank, like it did when the internet was introduced to the banking world, is doing the legwork on behalf of its local banking partners to ensure they can take advantage, he said.
The Bank of North Dakota is working with Fiserv to create the Roughrider coin, hosted on Fiserv’s digital asset platform, for use in bank-to-bank money transfers. 
The bank will present an analysis to the North Dakota Industrial Commission about how banks will use the new tool, a risk assessment to ensure the appropriate safeguards are in place, and cost projections. 
If the plan is approved, the Bank of North Dakota will roll out a pilot project with a handful of local financial institutions as partners. 
The federal Genius Act was a signal that the bank needed to consider adopting the technology or get left behind, Hullet said.
“Congress has now put a framework around this. The train is leaving the station, and we need to be not only on the train, but we need to bring our local financial institutions along with us, so that they are able to utilize this new technology as it moves forward,” Hullet said.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Alleging that it violates multiple provisions of the Florida Constitution, an environmental group and an Orange County resident have filed a lawsuit to block enforcement of a new state law that restricts local governments from regulating development.
It is the second such lawsuit filed in the past two weeks aimed at Senate Bill 180, a measure sponsored by Pinellas County Republican state Sen. Nick DiCeglie that passed during the 2025 legislative session and was signed by Gov. Ron DeSantis ostensibly to aid in hurricane recovery.
The smart-growth group 1000 Friends of Florida and east Orange County resident Rachel Hildebrand are the plaintiffs, represented by Broward County land-use attorney Richard Grosso. They filed their request for declaratory and injunctive relief on Tuesday in Florida’s Second Judicial Circuit in Leon County.
The measure bans local governments from adopting “more restrictive or burdensome” land-use or zoning rules for three years following the 2024 hurricanes Debby, Helene, and Milton — that is, until October 2027.  The lawsuit notes that the law “also allows ‘any person’ to sue to invalidate a plan, amendment, regulation or development order without needing to show that they are impacted by it in any way, and to receive attorney’s fees and costs if they succeed.”
The complaint alleges that SB 180 violates the single-subject rule by bundling unrelated policy changes into an emergency-management bill; is arbitrary and capricious because its prohibition is triggered by random, unrelated hurricanes; is unconstitutionally vague by broadly prohibiting undefined “more restrictive or burdensome” planning measures; and is inconsistent with the Florida Constitution’s “natural resources” clause by blocking local actions needed to protect air, water, and sensitive lands.
“SB 180 goes far beyond disaster recovery. It undermines communities of the basic ability to plan responsibly for growth, infrastructure, and the environment,” said Paul Owens, president of 1000 Friends. “Voters and local officials across the state are being silenced just when Florida most needs smart, resilient planning.”
Hildebrand lives with her family in the Lake Pickett Rural Settlement of Orange County, within an area identified as rural under the county’s “rural boundary” comprehensive plan provisions, which voters approved as a charter amendment in 2024.
In June 2025, Orange County Commissioners adopted changes to the comprehensive plan including additional protections for certain lands, like Hildebrand’s, within the rural boundary. Pursuant to Florida’s Community Planning Act, Orange County submitted those amendments to the Florida Department of Commerce for its statutorily required review. On July 28, that department declared that the comprehensive plan amendments were “null and void,” citing Senate bill 180.
In a press release announcing the lawsuit, 1000 Friends says that more than a dozen local governments across Florida have received similar letters from the Department of Commerce, declaring their proposed planning or land-use policy changes also “null and void” under SB 180. In many cases, the group alleges that those local updates were designed to strengthen stormwater management, protect natural resources, or prevent urban sprawl.
“We’ve done everything right to protect our rural community, but the state’s actions are stripping away those safeguards,” Hildebrand said in a written statement. “This fight is about ensuring our local voice is heard and that our children can inherit the safe, natural environment we’ve worked so hard to preserve.”
Twenty-five local governments filed a similar lawsuit last week attempting to block provisions of SB 180 from taking effect.
Speaking during an event hosted by the Tampa Bay Beaches Chamber of Commerce last month, Sen. DiCigle acknowledged his law “has been a hot topic.”
“Most of that had to do with planning and recovery efforts,” he said. “We’re going to potentially have to make some adjustments to clarify some of the language in that bill.
The defendants are Florida Secretary of Commerce J. Alex Kelly, Department of Emergency Management Executive Director Kevin Guthrie, Florida Commissioner of Agriculture Wilton Simpson, Florida Department of Revenue Executive Director Jim Zingale, and Florida Chief Financial Officer Blaise Ingoglia.

RUTLAND CITY — Marble City voters signed off on a $3.9 million bond for city infrastructure upgrades, laying the groundwork for a hotel project and other development downtown.
A sweeping 85% of Rutland voters approved the bond during the special vote held Tuesday, with 1,190 ballots cast in favor and 213 against, according to an unofficial tally released by the clerk’s office.
“It’s a really exciting message that the voters recognize how important these types of infrastructure upgrades are to the future development of our city,” said Rutland City Mayor Mike Doenges Wednesday morning.

The bond will go towards funding the repair of aging wastewater pipes, burying power lines and widening sidewalks in the city’s downtown area. The infrastructure upgrade is the first phase in a master plan crafted through the establishment of the city’s Tax Increment Financing, or TIF, district. The TIF district was approved by the city’s Board of Aldermen and the Vermont Economic Progress Council earlier this year, said Doenges. 
For the next 10 years, the TIF district designation allows Rutland to undertake a large-scale revitalization effort. The city will be able to take out debt for infrastructure upgrades, brownfield remediation and other city projects that are tied to private development proposals, but in a way that is intended to keep taxpayers off the hook for the cost.
The infrastructure upgrades will enable private developers to construct a four-story hotel project in a section of downtown Rutland called “the pit,” which has remained a vacant lot since a fire destroyed the townhouse hotel at the corner of Center Street and Wales Street in 1973.
Rutland resident Bradford Morgan said he voted in favor of the TIF bond because he thinks the economic development tool is a sound strategy to make a much-needed fix to the wastewater infrastructure in the city. Morgan added that more than five decades is far too long for “the pit” at the heart of downtown to remain undeveloped.
“I think it’s a smart idea to make a commitment to pay off a bond, but you get the money first,” Morgan said. “The odds are really good that the investment made by it will pay for itself, and it’s time to fill in that hole in the ground since the townhouse fire.”
On the other hand, city resident Steven Rider said that he voted against the TIF bond because he is worried that the financing model will not pan out for future taxpayers. Rider said he thinks that the private developers should take on the costs of the projects necessary to make way for a hotel.
“I didn’t vote (for) it because it’s a tax in the future, and I don’t believe in them burdening the taxes on our future generation,” Rider said. “Right now, the downtown is already set as is.”
Unlike a typical city bond that falls on city property tax payers, the newly approved bond — financed through the Tax Increment Financing model — will be paid back through the additional tax revenue produced by the hotel property over the course of 20 years. A portion of the difference in tax revenue, or tax increment, will also go toward the municipal general fund and the state’s education fund. 
A TIF bond for future projects also must be greenlit by the Vermont Economic Progress Council and the city voters and will be funded by the increased tax revenue of other developments within the district lines, said Doenges. 
While the city will break ground on infrastructure projects next spring, the approval of the bond by Rutland voters means the private developers who have agreed to take on the hotel project have the go ahead to start cleaning up the site even earlier, said Doenges.
Another supportive Rutland resident, Beverly Boston, said she voted in favor of the TIF bond because, if it hadn’t been approved, the cost of replacing the deteriorating wastewater lines would fall on property taxpayers, who have “already been hit so hard.”
Eric Lapp, a resident since 1998, said that he voted in favor of the TIF bond because he said changes are already afoot in Rutland, with the Diamond Run Mall closing nearly six years ago and the proposed Walmart relocation away from the city center. An improved wastewater system will facilitate more development which will, in turn, cultivate more business growth and tourism to Rutland’s downtown in the future, Lapp said.
“If the hotel goes through and is successful, it’s going to be a big boost,” Lapp said. “Rutland needs to grow and change, and there’s a lot of debate on both sides of the coin here, but on balance, I think it’s something we should at least give a try.”
Rutland resident Becky Pell said she voted in favor of the bond because she believes the downtown revitalization effort will help the local economy thrive. 
“I think it’s important that this bond go through. I think it’s going to increase our ability to keep Rutland alive,” Pell said. “It’s been hard for Rutlanders to keep businesses here, and we need that. Plus, we need the infrastructure.”

,CommonWealth Beacon,2025-10-08 14:44:23+00:00,CommonWealth Beacon,Mass. begins 2030 Census prep amid national redistricting fights,Chris Lisinski,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/politics/mass-begins-2030-census-prep-amid-national-redistricting-fights/,"With mid-decade redistricting fights erupting elsewhere, Massachusetts officials are ramping up their preparations for the 2030 Census as they grapple with new housing development and concerns about community trust.","DOOR-KNOCKERS WILL NOT start counting the number of Americans for another four-plus years, but amid an intense redistricting fight in other parts of the country, the 2030 Census in Massachusetts is already in the spotlight. 
The Census process has always carried massive political stakes, but this cycle has become more fraught after Texas Republicans reshaped their political districts in August to add House seats to their majority. Because the Census determines the number of seats each state is allotted in Congress – as well as federal funding for certain programs – officials in Massachusetts are under more pressure this cycle to make sure that every resident is counted. 
“This work never really stops,” Sen. William Brownsberger, who leads the Senate Committee on the Census, said in an interview. 
Democrats who control the political map-drawing process in Massachusetts have no plans to reshape the state’s congressional districts partway through the decade. (California voters will decide in a November 4 special election whether to temporarily redraw their maps to shift five Republican seats to Democrats, a measure Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom pushed for to offset the Texas changes.) 
Yet there’s still plenty of labor ahead for state and municipal leaders, who need to ensure every new housing unit built in the past five years is on the Census Bureau’s radar, convince their constituents to answer questions about themselves during a period of aggressive immigration enforcement, and monitor population trends for a hint at whether Massachusetts might gain or lose a seat in the US House, where all nine of the state’s representatives are Democrats. 
That’s a particular sticking point for President Donald Trump, who took aim at the Bay State this summer, contending that Massachusetts has highly gerrymandered districts and that his vote share (about 36 percent in 2024) should have translated into at least one GOP representative in Congress. 
Most Republicans in the state House and Senate supported the congressional map drawn after the last Census, and GOP Gov. Charlie Baker signed it into law. 
“Massachusetts is a state in which there are a percentage of people who vote for Donald Trump, but those people are distributed across the state in every district, so redrawing the districts wouldn’t really change the balance at all,” Brownsberger said. “There’s very little prospect of cooking the books to elect a Republican.” 
Just past the midpoint in the decade, much of the Census preparation focuses on housing. Brownsberger said the Census Bureau develops a list of “every single housing unit in the country,” which becomes the primary foundation for the actual population count. 
“That list is incredibly important, and getting it right is not easy,” Brownsberger said. “Addresses are constantly being added as new construction happens. Addresses are being taken away as demolitions happen and as buildings are replaced. It’s not easy to know what’s inside any given apartment building.” 
Cities and towns will get a chance in the next few years to influence the Census Bureau’s master address file. 
Susan Strate, senior program manager of the UMass Donahue Institute’s population estimates program, said getting the most accurate housing inventory possible is critical to the population count.  
New York state lost a U.S. House seat and an Electoral College vote after the 2020 Census after falling 89 residents short of the amount needed to keep its delegation at the same size. 
“We know that just a handful of missing addresses has the potential to have a really large impact,” Strate said at a hearing Brownsberger’s committee hosted on September 22. 
Some communities, especially those that are larger and wealthier, are more prepared for this work as they have experienced staff who have been around for multiple Census cycles. Others have limited expertise on hand; Brownsberger described one town that uses “basically a Post-It note system” for tracking new addresses. 
The state’s fiscal year 2026 budget includes nearly $1.3 million for “technical assistance” with Census preparation, but Brownsberger said the Legislature “probably [is] going to need to continue to put money into that, maybe even more money.”  
Another variable is that the state’s housing inventory in 2030 will be different than it was in 2020, especially if the Healey administration’s goal of generating significant new production to drive down prices proves successful. That means more homes need to get properly tracked and added to Census Bureau’s master list. 
Much of the latest housing construction has been multifamily, Brownsberger said, where getting an exact count of new units “is not going to be easy.” 
Since the last decennial Census, Beacon Hill has tried to spur more development with funding and some policy reforms such as allowing accessory dwelling units by right on all single-family properties across the state. 
ADUs, sometimes known as in-law suites, are additional structures built on a homeowner’s property where others can live. In the first six months of 2025, local officials in 170 communities approved construction of at least 550 ADUs, Healey’s office announced last month. 
Because they are added onto existing single-family lots, officials could have a trickier time tracking each of those new units in the latest housing inventory compared to larger, more obvious developments. 
Brownsberger said he expects his committee to host additional hearings in the coming months about several other pressure points, including the accuracy of Census measurements, how the Bay State’s population is trending halfway through the decade, and changes to how the Census asks about race and ethnicity. 
Under changes approved by the Biden administration, the 2030 Census will ask participants a single question about their “race and/or ethnicity” to which they can select multiple replies, including Latino and a new “Middle Eastern or North African” category. That’s a change from past iterations, which asked separately about Hispanic or Latino origin. 
Many local leaders warn that the Trump administration’s ramped-up deportation campaign could instill fear in immigrant communities. If some immigrants are unwilling to participate in the Census, it could leave Massachusetts undercounted and therefore at greater risk of losing a congressional seat or federal funding. 
“Trying to build that trust is always a challenge. It’s going to be an especially difficult challenge in the wake of the current immigration enforcement,” Brownsberger said. “Even if that enforcement stops or changes or is better focused on people with criminal backgrounds, that has done a lot of harm to people’s willingness to talk to government officials.” 
Some activists warn that certain segments of the country, especially Hispanic and Latino communities, could be further discouraged from participating if the Census Bureau adds a question about citizenship status. 
The first Trump administration sought to ask about citizenship during the 2020 Census, but the U.S. Supreme Court blocked the effort. Many Republicans appear to be eyeing another push for the upcoming cycle. 
How the federal government resolves those points of contention will carry massive downstream impacts.

Tate Reeves will submit a proposal for spending federal money to bolster rural healthcare.,"At least $500 million is expected to flow into Mississippi over the next five years as a part of a major federal investment into rural healthcare. 
The funding aims to offset the disproportionate impact already-struggling rural hospitals are expected to bear as a result of Medicaid spending cuts signed into law by President Donald Trump this summer. 
More than half of Mississippi’s rural hospitals are at risk of closing. Republican Gov. Tate Reeves will decide what to include in the state’s one-time application for the funding, which is due in just over a month.
Reeves did not respond to Mississippi Today’s questions about his plans or priorities for the funds. 
Legislators hold the authority to appropriate money through the “power of the purse.” During a state budget hearing Sept. 24, House Speaker Jason White expressed frustration that they have not been more included in the decision-making process. 
This sets the stage for a possible conflict between the governor and legislators over who has the authority to appropriate the funds, echoing disputes that arose during the distribution of federal COVID-19 aid.

“I understand the timeline’s tight,” White said to Mississippi Medicaid Director Cindy Bradshaw. “But I also understand, I think people want to have input on what that looks like if they’re going to be appropriating the money.” 
The state Division of Medicaid and the Department of Health are supporting the governor in crafting the application.
Half of the $50 billion Rural Health Transformation Program will be distributed evenly among all states with approved applications, amounting to $100 million a year for five years per state if all states apply and are accepted. The other half will be allocated to states based on a variety of factors, including the rural population, the proportion of rural health facilities and the condition of hospitals.

Health care leaders told Mississippi Today they expect the discretionary funding allocations to benefit Mississippi, where most people live in rural communities and two out of three hospitals are in rural areas. 
“The key takeaway is Mississippi does do really well with this,” said Ryan Kelly, executive director of the Mississippi Rural Health Association, an organization for health professionals and advocates. 
The funding is focused on strengthening access to health care by investing in lasting improvements to preventive medicine, collaboration between health care facilities, workforce development and innovations in care and technology. 
Hospital leaders have warned that the federal cuts could force some rural hospitals to stop some services or close their doors. 
Bradshaw estimated that cuts to state directed payments, which help hospitals offset low Medicaid payments, will amount to a loss of $160 million a year beginning in 2029.
Rural hospitals may also shoulder rising costs of uninsured care if enhanced premium tax credits, which make marketplace insurance more affordable, expire at the end of this year. Over 100,000 Mississippians are expected to lose health insurance coverage if the credits are not extended.
Some advocates caution that the federal investment in rural health care will be too little to offset the losses Mississippi’s rural hospitals will face. 
“It simply won’t be enough,” said Khaylah Scott, a program manager for the Mississippi Health Advocacy Program, an organization aimed at improving health policies.
She called the program a “Band-Aid,” noting that it is temporary and will cover only about a third of the estimated losses to federal Medicaid funding in rural areas. 
Bradshaw said the new funding alone may not resolve the challenges facing rural hospitals.

“Throwing more money at hospitals I don’t think is necessarily the answer because we’ve done that the last two years and they’re still not thriving,” Bradshaw told legislative budget leaders. 
The application opened in mid-September and states must submit a plan before Nov. 5. The federal government will approve applications by the end of the year. 
“The timing is really tricky and maybe even unfortunate that we have such a short amount of time to be able to submit the application,” Bradshaw said.
Mississippi has moved quickly to solicit input from stakeholders and health leaders.
A survey released at the end of July yielded over 120 responses. Thirteen stakeholders were invited to a closed-door meeting Aug. 28 to present their ideas for the program to representatives from the governor’s office, the Division of Medicaid and the Department of Health. 
The state has not held any public meetings or hearings. Other states, including Louisiana, have held outreach meetings around the state to gain feedback from stakeholders and rural residents. 

The Mississippi Hospital Association was one of 13 organizations chosen to present ideas to the governor. 

“We feel like those funds really need to be focused on the rural hospitals to help them absorb some of the upcoming losses of those supplemental payments that have been so vital in keeping the doors open and keeping access to care alive in those rural areas,” said Richard Roberson, the association’s president and CEO.

The association has proposed using the funding for a grant to help rural hospitals cover costs of uncompensated care, improve infrastructure, create programs to recruit and retain health professionals in rural areas, expand the state’s ability to share information between providers and improve telehealth technology. 
The Mississippi Healthcare Collaborative, which represents other hospitals and health care organizations and was also invited to present at the forum, did not respond to a request for comment from Mississippi Today. 
The program will give Mississippi the opportunity to fund “ready projects” the state has been studying the past two to three years, State Health Officer Dr. Daniel Edney said in an interview with the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials. 
Department of Health spokesperson Greg Flynn declined to say which projects Edney was referencing, citing the governor’s authority to make final decisions about the application.
Kelly, of the Rural Health Association, said it is difficult to determine how to support rural health care with a large amount of funding. 
“Normally we have to find ways to do things without money,” he said. “Now, it’s like we have to flip on its head what we’ve had to do, and now we have to find a way to spend money – a lot of money. And that’s kind of a challenge.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/06140738/3X0A9397-scaled.jpg,,,2025-10-08 10:56:17.698157

How can we move beyond hosting pro forma town halls to more creatively connect communities and government?,"We have all heard the stories about Americans’ low rates of political participation and how disconnected we are from government. In the 2024 presidential election, tens of millions of registered voters chose not to cast their vote. Even fewer participate in other ways, like volunteering for campaigns and writing letters to our elected officials. But in a recent POLITICO-Citrin Center-Possibility Lab poll, we found that 68% of registered California voters said they would like more opportunities to share their experiences and ideas with leaders in state government. 

Read the Brief: California Issues Survey
At the same time, many California voters say that government policies just aren’t working as they are currently designed and implemented. In fact, in the same survey, we find that a majority believe government policies themselves are contributing to, rather than addressing, some of our most fundamental economic challenges. Fully 82% say state policies are driving prices higher and about 81% say the same about federal policies.
To improve government policies and programs, we need to more meaningfully engage communities in the process of helping to solve the problems we face as a state and a nation.
Outside of elections, the current approach to community engagement – in both California and across the country – is usually to ask residents to take time out of their busy days to voice their opinions at public meetings and town halls, and then to hope that elected representatives reflect their input when it comes time to make decisions. This system is outdated, dysfunctional, and only incorporates the views of those who have the time and resources to participate in the policymaking process. Moreover, it does little to ensure real accountability to the diverse perspectives, experiences, and beliefs of our state’s population. 
In the context of increasing political polarization, low levels of trust in government, and increasing income inequality, it is increasingly urgent that everyday residents have better ways to effectively participate in shaping the future for their communities and the future of California. 
It’s time for community engagement efforts to do more than check a box just to be able to say that it happened. If we want true people-centered policymaking, we need to design processes that let us hear the voices of people who won’t, don’t, or can’t show up at town halls, volunteer time to civic efforts, or contribute money to political campaigns.This is especially true when it comes to reaching low-income residents, communities of color, and young people, who generally show lower levels of political engagement and civic participation. 
In new research, we explore innovative examples of how California’s state government is designing civic engagement, participatory policymaking, and community outreach. With a focus on how state departments and agencies are working to connect with and empower communities, we highlight a range of recent state-led civic engagement efforts. Additionally, we identify emerging practices, tools, and strategies – ranging from digital participation platforms to equity-centered outreach models – for how state government entities are trying to create more responsive and collaborative governance. 
Our “State of Engagement” report features case studies that span youth empowerment, land use, wildfire response, and tribal relations. These examples embody three criteria that are potentially key to successful engagement:

Inclusive – Engagement addresses barriers that prevent participation, focus on collaborative governance, and/or works to build long-term trust and relationships with the community.
Intentional – Engagement has a clear purpose, goals, and intended outcomes. It focuses on a community-centered approach. There is follow-through and accountability to the input and perspectives shared by participants.
Innovative – Engagement is designed to surface ideas in new ways: whether through testing new tools and methods, forging unexpected partnerships, or exploring ways to actively include the voices of those who have previously been excluded from the policymaking process.

Read the Report: State of EngagementExplore the State of Engagement Microsite
Whether through digital democracy tools, policy cafés, participatory budgeting, pop-up kiosks, or trusted messenger networks, building new methods and platforms for public input can empower communities to share their ideas, collaborate on solutions, and influence public policies – ultimately enhancing responsiveness and deepening connections between people and their government. But perhaps most importantly, they can help us make public policies that more effectively address the critical issues shaping people’s lives.
Together, the work we highlight in our research aims to show that the voices and experiences of Californians matter. It demonstrates that trust in government is ultimately trust in people, and that systems function more effectively when those directly impacted by public problems are meaningfully involved in shaping the policies that affect their lives, families, and communities.

The order, issued Sept. 26, follows a seven-year legal battle by Emalee Wagoner, who has been diagnosed with gender dysphoria and is seeking gender confirming surgery (GCS) while in the custody of the Alaska Department of Corrections. 
Gender dysphoria is a recognized medical diagnosis for people experiencing distress when their gender identity differs from their sex assigned at birth. 
Magistrate Judge Matthew Scoble wrote that there was evidence that the Department of Corrections had acted with “deliberate indifference” regarding Wagoner’s gender dysphoria, and violated the Eighth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which prohibits cruel and unusual punishment. 
“The record reflects that while DOC’s policies technically left room for GCS to occur, as a practical and functional matter, it was opposed to GCS in every circumstance,” Scoble said in a 47-page analysis, referring to the type of gender-affirming genital surgery sought by Wagoner and a handful of other inmates.
Scoble’s order, which does not take effect immediately, tells the Department of Corrections to halt a policy pertaining to gender dysphoria as long as it “functions as a de facto prohibition on gender affirming surgery.” 
Wagoner originally represented herself in court but later received help from Lambda Legal, a national law firm that advocates for LGBTQ+ rights. Richard Saenz was Wagoner’s attorney.
“It is a significant thing … that Ms. Wagoner should not have to continue to wait for the care that the court and her treating doctor and experts have said is medically necessary for her to receive,” he said.
Saenz said Scoble’s ruling likely will affect relatively few people, but it’s significant for them.
“We’re talking about such a small population … even within the group of people who have gender dysphoria, which is transgender people, not every transgender person with gender dysphoria needs surgical interventions,” he said.
But now, gender dysphoria surgery will be treated at the same level as cancer treatment — if a prisoner needs it, they can get it, Saenz said.
“I think that is so important — that gender dysphoria, which is a medical condition that the department itself recognizes needs treatment, should not be treated in an exceptional way. It should be treated like other medical conditions, and that the treatment that clinical guidelines say are needed, should be followed,” he said.
The U.S. Supreme Court has interpreted the Eighth Amendment as requiring prisons to provide medically necessary health care. In 2019, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which has jurisdiction over Alaska and other U.S. West Coast states, declared that gender-affirming surgery is covered by that interpretation. 
Had Wagoner’s case arisen in a part of the country covered by a different appeals court, the issue might have been decided differently, Scoble said.
“This Court is scrupulous to follow binding case law, and this case presents no exception,” he wrote.
Wagoner, who is serving a 40-year sentence after being convicted of serious sexual abuses. She is incarcerated at Goose Creek Correctional Center, a medium-security men’s prison at Point MacKenzie in the Matanuska-Susitna Borough. Alaska has a policy of housing people based on sex assigned at birth. 
Wagoner has been undergoing hormone therapy since 2022 and was recommended for surgery by her doctor.
The Department of Corrections’ medical advisory committee rejected that request in 2023, saying in part that there was “insufficient evidence to affirm that Ms. Wagoner’s mental health and well-being will decline without surgery.”
Wagoner fought that decision in court, including through a lengthy trial that took place in May in Anchorage.
Afterward, Scoble implied that he was inclined to rule in the state’s favor but that the 9th Circuit precedent decided the issue.
“In the Court’s view, a correctional facility need not necessarily offer GCS if it believes, based upon reasoned review of the ongoing science, that other treatments or therapies for gender dysphoria are effective, or if based on the state of the literature there are good-faith questions as to the ultimate effectiveness of GCS in treating gender dysphoria,” he wrote.
The Alaska Department of Law, which represented the state prison system during the case, said it intends to continue fighting the issue.
“Unfortunately, a federal magistrate judge, sitting at trial without the benefit of a local jury to hear the evidence, decided that failing to provide gender-affirming surgery is a violation of the 8th Amendment, even though there was ample testimony from medical providers and nationally-recognized experts to the contrary,” said Patty Sullivan, a spokeswoman for the Alaska Department of Law wrote by email on Tuesday. 
“The state will appeal the U.S. District Court’s decision to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals,” she said.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Photo-GCCC-in-Fall.jpg,,,2025-10-08 10:56:17.698157

Pearson, a Memphis state representative who rose to national prominence for his protest against gun violence, plans to challenge longtime U.S. Rep. Steve Cohen in the 2026 Democratic primary.
The Tennessee Lookout confirmed from multiple sources that Pearson will announce his campaign Wednesday. The campaign had not made a public announcement at the time of publication. 
Pearson, 30, began his political career as a community organizer, working to oppose the construction of a Byhalia oil pipeline through a historically Black neighborhood in Memphis, and leveraged the work into a successful run for state House in a 2023 special election.
A month after his term started, three adults and three children were killed in a shooting at Nashville’s Covenant School. Pearson and Rep. Justin Jones, a Nashville Democrat, led a series of protests that ultimately resulted in their expulsion from the state House. The duo, along with Knoxville state Rep. Gloria Johnson, were branded as the “Tennessee Three.”
In the weeks after his removal, Pearson significantly expanded his profile with a series of TV appearances and a meeting with then-Vice President Kamala Harris. He was reappointed to the state House by the Shelby County Commission a week after his expulsion and subsequently reelected.
Cohen, 76, began his career in the Tennessee State Senate in the 1980s, serving for over two decades before his successful run for the 9th Congressional District in 2006. He’s considered a consistent Democratic and liberal vote in the U.S. House.
Cohen supports abortion rights, voted for the Affordable Care Act, pushed for the legalization of marijuana and voted to impeach Donald Trump twice during the president’s first term.
Cohen has faced several primary challenges since his election to Congress, dispatching them with ease.
The Cohen-Pearson race will serve as the latest test between older and younger Democrats, as the party looks to reclaim the House majority in the 2026 midterm elections. No matter which man wins the primary, the Memphis U.S. Congressional seat is considered by political rating agencies as solidly Democratic. 
The 9th District, which is composed of most of Shelby County and portions of Tipton County, was designated a majority minority district in 1980 and was held by Black representatives — Harold Ford Sr. and Harold Ford Jr. — until Ford Jr. ran for U.S. Senate in 2006 and Cohen was elected. 
The primary election will be held in August, and the general election will be in November 2026.

Faith was a major theme in Pearson’s campaign announcement, held under a picnic shelter at Alonzo Weaver Park next to Mitchell High School in Memphis, where Pearson challenged the school board to deliver new books when he was a 15-year-old student there.
“It’s not enough to just stop with the votes that you’re casting,” Pearson, 30, said. “You’ve got to be a voice of your constituents and of your people, which is why … you’ll still see me at County Commission, and City Council, and school board meetings, and Memphis Light, Gas and Water meetings, because I’m a resident of this community. I want to see this place that I love improve on every level.”

Cohen has faced several primary challenges since his election to Congress, dispatching them with ease.
Shortly before Pearson’s announcement, Cohen took to Facebook, where he declined to name Pearson as his challenger, instead referring to him as an “ambitious young candidate.”
“We will turn back this challenge in the Democratic Primary and go on to work with the incoming Democratic House Majority to put a stop to this runaway administration,” Cohen said in the post. “With a shutdown, an out-of-control, power-grabbing executive, and ICE and the National Guard on the streets of Memphis, this is a time for the experience and institutional knowledge that I bring to the table.”

(Photo by Skylar Laird/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — When pastor Stewart Rawson first met Sherri Redmond, he thought it was strange that her ex-husband lived with her.
“I soon learned that that was who Sherri is: kind to a fault, generous to her own demise,” Rawson said Tuesday.
Redmond’s ex was sick and had nowhere else to live, the pastor said. So, she let him stay.
But two weeks before Christmas last year, Redmond was found shot to death in her Sumter home. Prosecutors charged her ex-husband with the crime, said Rawson, who leads the congregation at Sumter’s First Presbyterian Church.
The 79-year-old was one of 46 people killed in domestic violence cases across South Carolina in 2024 honored during a Tuesday ceremony.

For more than two decades, South Carolina was among states with the highest rates of women killed by men, including multiple years with the highest rate in the nation. Although the state’s rate has improved, it remained above the national average in 2023, with 1.8 of every 100,000 women killed by a man, according to the most recent report available through the Violence Policy Center.
Attorney General Alan Wilson called the names of each of the 46 victims — 35 women and 11 men — killed in incidents of domestic violence last year, as volunteers, family and friends carried cutouts representing their loved ones to stand behind him.
The Silent Witness Ceremony, which is in its 28th year, is meant to honor those victims and their families, as well as survivors of domestic violence. The ceremony, which drew several hundred people to the Statehouse on Tuesday, also brings attention to an issue that can easily get overlooked because it often happens within a person’s home, Wilson said.
Of the people honored Tuesday, 91% were killed at home. Half were parents who left behind children, Wilson said.
“This is not the future our children deserve,” Wilson said.
Laws to protect people from domestic violence are in place, but local law enforcement departments need officers who are ready to arrest those suspected of committing domestic abuse, prosecutors need to be prepared to support victims, and the General Assembly needs to elect judges who will give convicted abusers strong enough sentences to deter them from reoffending, Wilson said.

Providing resources for people with mental health issues that may affect their relationships and educating the public about how to identify domestic abuse are also important steps, Wilson said.
“At the end of the day, there are always going to be people who are going to break the law and try to skirt the system, and we want people out there who are being victimized to know that there is a way out,” Wilson said.
The ceremony served as a reminder that those killed had full lives that ended too soon, Wilson said.
Redmond, for instance, ran the kitchen at her Sumter church, “which made her a very important person,” Rawson said. She exhibited a classic Southern hospitality, even though she was born in Ohio. She left behind three adult sons, according to her obituary.

“We have a right to life, to our liberty, to our own pursuit of happiness,” Rawson said. “Many like Sherri do not have the opportunity to enjoy such freedoms, and sometimes, it’s the kind, tender, loving, forgiving heart of someone like Sherri that has to endure the unthinkable.”
There are many reasons a person experiencing domestic abuse might not tell anyone, said Niwdayra Tapia, a podcast host and survivor of domestic violence who lives in Columbia. For her, she didn’t want to see her ex-boyfriend go to jail, and she worried about what others might think of her, she said.
“I understand that sometimes it’s not as simple to let go of someone that you love and have devoted your time and energy to,” Tapia said. “However, love is not supposed to hurt, to make you feel depressed, stressed or worthless.”
After all 46 cutouts representing people killed had been placed, organizers brought a 47th out to represent those whose deaths went unrecognized or unreported as domestic violence.
“For all of those names that have been read, there are assuredly countless others that we do not know about,” said Rabbi Erik Uriarte, from Tree of Life Congregation in Columbia. “Because for every physical manifestation of that violence that appears on bodies, there are dozens, if not hundreds, of wounds that afflict us mentally, emotionally, socially, financially.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_4772-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-08 09:56:14.387678

As it turns out, the attorney who crafted most of those contracts also represents the marijuana industry trade group, whose leaders helped create the microbusiness license program to diversify the market and ensure its benefits went to communities most impacted by the war on drugs.
Eric Walter is a St. Louis-based attorney who represents the Missouri Cannabis Trade Association and a significant percentage of the state’s cannabis licensees. He wrote 22 agreements the state believes would take the microbusiness licenses out of the hands of eligible applicants and put them into the hands of well-connected or out-of-state cannabis investors, according to the administrative appeal case documents obtained by The Independent.
Each of those agreements largely led to the state revoking a microbusiness license issued last year for not meeting the constitutional mandate that the licenses be “majority owned and operated” by eligible applicants.  All but one of the license revocations is being appealed to the Missouri Administrative Hearing Commission. 
To be eligible for a microbusiness license, applicants must meet certain criteria, including income below certain thresholds, having past marijuana offenses or being a disabled veteran.
Walter’s law firm and the consulting companies who hired the firm to draw up the agreements have vehemently denied the contracts are predatory, arguing the applicants voluntarily signed them.
“Those documents are all transparent, fair, and compliant with Missouri law, including the Department of Health and Senior Services’ rules,” Jamie Moss, spokeswoman for Walter’s law firm, Armstrong Teasdale, said in an email to The Independent.
Walter’s bio boasts being an “influential advisor to the industry” and a member of the committee responsible for drafting the marijuana legalization amendment that created the microbusiness program.
Cannabis regulators concerned about predatory practices in Missouri’s social equity program

Andrew Mullins, executive director of the Missouri Cannabis Trade Association, or MoCann, praised Walter’s legal acumen on behalf of the industry, though he didn’t respond to questions about the revoked licenses. 
“Eric Walter is unquestionably one of the top cannabis lawyers in the Midwest,” Mullins said in an email to The Independent, “and MoCannTrade benefits greatly from his expert legal counsel.”
But legal experts who reviewed the contracts for The Independent say the agreements are an attempt to establish front companies and manipulate the system. 
Nimrod Chapel — an attorney, president of the Missouri NAACP and former chairman of the Administrative Hearing Commission — called the agreements “a trick” that results in eligible applicants “receiving little to nothing.”
“This system — because that’s what it is — it’s a system to divest people who are truly or could be truly deserving underneath the constitutional amendment,” Chapel said.
The contracts written by Walter gave applicants two years to pay back loans that can total up to $2 million. If they couldn’t, they’d have to pay a “break-up fee” of up to $2.5 million or give up ownership of the license transfers to the loan holder, according to the state’s response in several of the appeals. 
“Therefore, the business would likely be unable to generate revenue to pay back the loan,” the state argues in one of the legal filing responding to a revocation appeal. “This leaves them no option but to convert the debt into ownership.”
In most cases, the same people involved in the consulting company that hired Armstrong Teasdale to draw up the contract are also involved in lending the money.
For the last two years, The Independent has documented a pattern of well-connected groups and individuals flooding the microbusiness lottery by recruiting people to submit applications and then offering them contracts that limit their profit and control of the business. 
A majority of the revoked licenses followed this pattern. 
Walter’s agreements are nearly identical to a contract The Independent obtained last year circulated by John Payne, who led the campaign to legalize recreational cannabis in 2022. Armstrong Teasdale denied having anything to do with Payne’s agreement.
 The consultants who hired the firm

For 16 of the 22 revoked licenses connected to Walter, the contracts were between the applicants and a consulting firm called Goldengrain Ventures LLC. The contracts were signed by Arizona-based cannabis investor Michael Halow, according to exhibits submitted in the licensees’ appeals. 
Four of the revoked licenses involved the consulting companies MO Microbusiness LLC and W2 Industries, with either David Brodsky or Scott Wootton signing as managers. Brodsky and Wootton are MoCann board members and “micro reps,” in addition to being investors in the industry.  
Two involved the consulting firm Great Granny Gertie LLC, where Springfield-based investor Thane Kifer signed as the company’s manager. 
A person can only be the owner of one microbusiness license.
Information on the cannabis microbusiness program posted by the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services on its website.
In an email to The Independent, Halow said he’s confident the Administrative Hearing Commission will reverse the revocation decisions.
“The agreements were designed to create a relationship where these businesses can become operational in a highly competitive, capital-starved industry,” he said. “The marijuana microbusiness program was supposed to open doors and provide social equity and promote diversity within the legal cannabis industry.”
Halow said he can’t control how others “subjectively characterize the agreements,” but he is “focused on our clients’ gratitude and satisfaction with the agreements.”
Brodsky said in an emailed statement the licensees he’s involved with “do not feel exploited. They feel abandoned by the state and targeted for simply trying to raise capital to build a thriving business.” 
None of Brodsky’s clients were willing to speak with The Independent because of the pending appeals, he said. 
Wootton and Kifer did not respond to requests for comment.
Walter wrote letters to the Missouri Division of Cannabis Regulation in November stating that Armstrong Teasdale represented all four of those consultant companies, according to exhibits submitted as part of the appeals process. He argued applicants are allowed to enter into agreements that would transfer ownership in the future.
“Intentions and possibilities are not reality,” Walter states, “and until and unless the company takes any affirmative action that actually violates the rules, no basis for discipline exists.”
The state couldn’t comment on Walter’s argument in his November letter due to active litigation, said Lisa Cox, spokeswoman for the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services, which houses the division.
“However, generally, the department reviewed many circumstances, specific to each licensee, before concluding a license was not awarded to eligible individuals who owned and operated the microbusiness,” Cox said. 
Last year, state cannabis regulators warned that companies were applying for microbusiness licenses “on behalf of qualified individuals with promises of future ownership in the license” but giving them agreements to sign that stated otherwise. 
“Eligible individuals should exercise caution in accepting such arrangements,” the division stated in a press release last year, “as some of the solicitations may be predatory in nature.” 
 How the social equity program came to be 

In 2022, leaders of the campaign to legalize recreational cannabis faced a major hurdle.
Black business owners were largely excluded from the medical marijuana program when licenses to grow and sell cannabis were doled out by the state in 2019. Many feared history was about to repeat itself despite the fact that Black Missourians were 2.6 times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession than white Missourians. 
So to soothe the concerns and win over skeptics, MoCann’s leaders partnered with Black community leaders and cannabis advocates to come up with the microbusiness license program. 
But of the 105 microbusiness licenses issued so far, 35 have been revoked, including the 22 involving contracts drafted by Walter and Armstrong Teasdale.
 Attorneys who reviewed the contract for The Independent concluded they were unfair and potentially predatory. All four agreed state cannabis regulators should reject any license application connected to the contract because it violates the constitutional mandate requiring licenses to be “majority owned and operated” by the eligible applicant. 
Alleged ‘predatory’ contracts continue to surface in Missouri social-equity marijuana program

Mike Wolff, a former chief justice of the Missouri Supreme Court and dean emeritus of the St. Louis University Law School, said the state has a “serious argument” behind its actions.
The cost to apply for a microbusiness license is $1,500, and those applications are entered into a lottery. If picked, a person could come away with a license that’s worth $1 million to $2 million. 
However, in all but two cases, the contract offers to pay the application cost and lend startup money, in exchange for the applicant to walk away with less than 10% of the profits.
The contract requires the eligible applicant to set up an LLC with a three-member board. The applicant has only one vote on the board. And if they ever want to walk away, they are required to pay their consultant a “break-up fee” of up to $2.5 million.
Two years after signing the contract — or around April 2026 — the applicants would have to transfer ownership to the company lending the licensee $1 million or more in startup costs, or pay the break-up fee. Failing to do these steps would be a breach of contract.
“Given the drafted and executed documents, the intent to transfer ownership and operational control to another entity is apparent,” the division stated in a document submitted as part of the appeal. 
There was no indication in any document that an eligible ownership would be maintained, the state said in its filing, or proof of eligibility for “the new owners.”
Halow told The Independent the division is “entitled to its opinion, but it does not reflect the commercial reality or the range of options available to our microbusiness owner clients.” 
Michael Goldberg, managing partner of the Chicago-based firm Goldberg Law Group that specializes in health care, administrative and cannabis law, said the contract “should not get past the state.” 
Joseph von Kaenel, a St. Louis corporate governance attorney, said the state’s reasoning for revoking the licenses is “pretty obvious.” 
“These people are trying to find a disadvantaged person and have them front the deal,” he said. “And the way it’s set up, the disadvantaged people are more likely than not going to be thrown out.”
Von Kaenel worked for Armstrong Teasdale from 1972 until he was required under a firm policy to retire in 2014 after he turned 70. He sued the firm for severance and lost his case. 
Von Kaenel, Wolff and Chapel likened the arrangement to companies “abusing” public contracting dollars meant to empower minority businesses by, as Von Kaenel put it, “finding a woman or minority to front the business.”
But the harshest criticism came from Adolphus Pruitt, president of the St. Louis chapter of the NAACP who served on the committee that helped write the 2022 legalization amendment.
Pruitt compared the contract to “the slave owner giving me some land to work on. It’s their company, they put up the capital, they’re preparing the applications, they’re paying the fees, they’re managing the business. And if at any time me as the slave fails to do something, I owe them.”
 Changing the rules

Armstrong Teasdale didn’t comment on accusations that the contracts are predatory, instead offering a general statement. 
“As lawyers our job is to help our clients attain their business goals within the bounds of the regulatory and legal framework that exists,” Moss said in an email to The Independent. “That is exactly what we did here and what we do every day to assist our clients.” 
However, Walter addressed the accusation in his letter to the division. 
The state regulators’ notice of pending revocation for these licenses, he wrote, reflect their “disapproval” of companies like his clients. 
“But (the Missouri Division of Cannabis Regulation) knew those relationships existed during the first round of microbusiness license applications,”  he said, “and it took no steps to prohibit such relationships or alter the license application to prevent them.”
Walter pointed to the guidance the division published on April 4, 2024, “specifically acknowledging the existence of such relationships and characterizing them as potentially predatory.”
In his clients’ agreements, the applicants had to say they “reviewed and understood” the guidance, he wrote in his letter.
“Absent any other changes to the rules or guidance regarding microbusiness applicants working with consultants, the licensee was entitled to reasonably conclude that (the division) had no broad policy objection to applicants working with a company like consultant,” the letter states.
Walter also argues that his clients invested significant resources assisting applicants in the spring of 2024, “because it reasonably relied on the absence of any rules amendments or DCR guidance prohibiting its business model.”
Amy Moore, director of the Missouri Division of Cannabis Regulation, speaks with a microbusiness owner at the National Cannabis Industry Association’s summit in St. Louis in 2024 (Rebecca Rivas/Missouri Independent).
In an email last week, Cox said the department couldn’t comment on Walter’s letter specifically due to litigation, but said the state ramped up education about the requirements for microbusiness licenses before applicants applied to the program in spring 2024.
“It is up to the applicant to ensure its specific arrangements, agreements, and partnerships follow the law and the department’s guidance,” Cox said.
Walter sent his letter one month before the division announced new proposed rules for its marijuana microbusiness program designed to address the issue.

Those rules are still not officially in effect, as they wind through the normal promulgation process that could take up to eight months.
Chapel said the problem isn’t that people don’t know the rules. The state has rules about “good faith and fair dealing,” he said, but it does not seem to be honored when “working people” seek entry into the cannabis industry.
“It’s tragic, really, because in those rare cases where the state actually shines a light and finds fraud or predatory practices, the industry doesn’t step up to do better,” he said.
It’s not the first time the state has seen “the forces of industry dividing Missouri,” he said, where the working-class pays the cost while someone else reaps the benefit.
“So here we are again, talking about whether we need a regulation for every single abuse, every single loophole, every single trick,” Chapel said. “Missourians deserve a system that is transparent, accountable, and fair — not one that rewards predatory contracts and strips opportunity away from the very communities this program was supposed to lift up.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Eric-Walter-1024x660.jpg,,,2025-10-08 09:56:14.387678

With less than a month until Nov. 4’s special election, billboards, mailers and advertisements in support and opposition of Proposition 50 are reaching a fever pitch. But in California’s 22nd Congressional District — one of the handful of districts that would be most affected if Prop. 50 were to pass — some residents remain unfamiliar with the measure.
As CalMatters’ Maya C. Miller explains, the 22nd District in San Joaquin Valley currently spans parts of Kings, Tulare and Kern counties. Under Prop. 50, it would include the northwest corner of the city of Fresno and smaller towns like Kerman. 
Democrats are eyeing the 22nd as one of the five possible districts to pick up during the 2026 midterms — ousting incumbent U.S. Rep. David Valadao who has represented the region in Congress for 10 of the last 12 years. His challenger, Assemblymember Jasmeet Bains of Bakerfield, is one of the more moderate Democrats in the state Legislature, and was the sole Democrat to vote against the plan to fast-track the special election.
But some locals Maya spoke to haven’t heard much about Prop. 50, and are more concerned with California’s rising cost of living, access to water for their farms and the threat of immigration raids. Others, however, told Maya they see Prop. 50 as a “power grab” that would further limit Republican voters.

Serving a six-year term as sheriff?

A change California made three years ago to one of its election laws has the potential to prolong the term of an embattled county sheriff who is fighting efforts to remove her from office, writes CalMatters’ Nigel Duara.
San Mateo County is currently trying to remove its sheriff, Christina Corpus, from her post after a county investigator found she had violated policies on nepotism and conflicting relationships. Voters overwhelmingly approved a measure in April to grant its board of supervisors the authority to remove the county sheriff, and if they are successful, Corpus would be the state’s first county sheriff to be removed from office.
But if they don’t succeed, Corpus, who was elected in 2022, could stay in office and won’t have to face voters again until 2028. Her unusual six-year term is due to a change in California that places sheriff and district attorney elections in the same years as presidential ones. California Democratic legislators pushed the change in an effort to boost voter turnout for county office elections, which Republicans lawmakers opposed.
As for Corpus, San Mateo’s board of supervisors is expected to hold a hearing to review the recommendations of a retired superior court judge, who on Monday found cause to remove Corpus.

Read the story on VTDigger here:  Your Vermont Giving Guide: You can make a difference where it matters most.","If you’ve lived in Vermont for any length of time, you already know this: giving here doesn’t feel like charity. It feels like showing up for one another and being a part of a community. 
It’s the neighbor with a casserole. The volunteers with shovels after a flood. The quiet “We’ll get through this together” between friends. All of it is a mutual unspoken agreement to care for one another. That spirit is the heartbeat of Vermont. 
Turning urgency into impact  
Shifts in policy and funding are having far-reaching effects on the social sector. If you’re feeling an urgency to act, collaboration and values-aligned giving can make a difference. 
Working together is powerful—it allows us to create jobs, support education and training tied to workforce needs, advance housing affordability, strengthen civic structures like local journalism, and address basic needs. Together, we can do more than any one of us can do alone. 
Our President & CEO, Dan Smith, often reminds us that giving is more than a transaction. It’s how we stay connected to each other and to Vermont. It’s how we say, I see you, and I care about your experience. And in uncertain times, it becomes an act of hope. 
That feels especially true right now. Whether you are supporting your local food shelf, a student you will never meet, or a bold idea just getting started, you are part of a bigger Vermont story. 
A guide to finding your place in Vermont’s story 
Everyone gives in their own way, at different times and for different reasons, shaped by the values they hold, the experiences they have had, and the seasons of life they are in.  
Some of us want to respond in the moment, when the river rises or when a neighbor needs a hand. Others think in decades, about legacy and the kind of Vermont we want our grandchildren to inherit. Many of us are navigating new financial chapters, perhaps after selling a business, receiving an inheritance, or deciding how to put appreciated stock to work. 
Wherever you are on that path, the 2025 Vermont Giving Guide is designed to meet you there. 
It is an opportunity to take a pause and reflect. A moment to ask, “What do I care about most, and how do I show it?”  
This year’s guide is conversational by design. 
You’ll find prompts like “Dear Vermont, I give because…” and a map to mark the places that shaped you. You’ll make a little soundtrack for your generosity. Maybe your playlist includes Stand by Me for solidarity, Fast Car for opportunity, Here Comes the Sun for healing, or Noah Kahan’s The View Between Villages for that unmistakable coming-home feeling. 
Behind the scenes at VCF 
Our role at the Vermont Community Foundation (VCF) is simple: help you give with heart and with impact. 
Felipe Rivera, our Vice President of Strategy, puts it simply: “Philanthropy is about growing something together. A gift keeps working. It grows in trust. It grows in relationships. It grows in impact.” 
Last year, VCF fundholders and donors made over 52 million dollars in grants across Vermont, supporting health and wellbeing, climate resilience, education and training, economic opportunity, the civic glue of local leadership, local news, and more. 
Those are big categories, but the stories are intimate: meals served, roofs fixed, counseling found, businesses launched, and reporters paid to share the truth about our towns. 
Where impact grows 
Many donors ask, “Where can my gift make the biggest impact?” 
One answer we say more often these days is unrestricted giving. As Kate Neubauer, who directs our leadership giving work, puts it: “Leadership donors are the quiet architects of Vermont’s future. Their giving isn’t just generous, it’s generative.” 
Unrestricted gifts are a vote of confidence in local wisdom. They allow organizations to move quickly in a crisis, seed good ideas before they have a name, and stick with long-term work that takes patience to pay off. 
We have seen how that nimbleness matters, from flood response to mission-driven financing that turns empty buildings into homes and Main Streets into gathering places. 
“When we give together, we meet urgent needs while also building lasting solutions,” says Holly Morehouse, our vice president of Community Impact. “Housing. Mental health. Climate resilience. Connection. These are not small issues, but in a place like Vermont, with people who care this deeply, real change is possible.” 
How to begin 
Start small and honest. Name three to five causes you care about most — the issues, places, or communities you most want to support.  
None of this is about perfection. It is about direction. 
And if you want company, we would love to walk beside you. That could mean opening a giving account you will actively recommend grants from. Pooling an unrestricted gift so we can meet the moment together. Or planning a legacy that keeps giving long after the headline fades. 
Wherever you land, the 2025 Vermont Giving Guide is your invitation: start where you are, follow what matters, and let Vermont’s tradition of neighborliness carry you forward.

The term “Proposition 50” doesn’t ring a bell with many residents of the rural San Joaquin Valley. But even some of the most disengaged voters say they’re familiar with Gov. Gavin Newsom’s push to redraw California’s congressional maps in response to Texas. 


Along the highways of California’s San Joaquin Valley, as field workers harvest almonds and pistachios and tractors churn dusty top soil into the already hazy air, drivers can’t miss the giant yellow billboards.
“VOTE NO on PROP 50. STOP Newsom’s Rigged Elections!” 
The signs in English and Spanish, paid for by Republican Assemblymember David Tangipa of Fresno, are one of the only clues in this region that California voters are hurtling toward a statewide special election next month. 
Residents here would be the first to tell you they spend far more time thinking and worrying about the rising cost of living, access to water for their farms, homelessness and the threat of immigration raids than the shape of California’s 52 congressional districts.
Many of them don’t realize that in just a few weeks, they’ll be asked whether they want to temporarily change their districts — and for some, their representation in Congress — in a gerrymander that favors Democrats. And unlike in politically attuned coastal hubs like the San Francisco Bay Area and Los Angeles, traditional online, TV and mail campaign ads are rarely enough to get people to vote. Often they need an in-person push from a friend or family member.
But even those unfamiliar with the term “Proposition 50” proved they could quickly form an opinion as soon as someone — a friend, a relative, a journalist, a politician — explained the  measure.

At the Kern County Fair in Bakersfield, past the Ferris wheel and rows of food stalls hawking corn dogs and Labubu-themed drinks, congressional candidate and educator Randy Villegas shook hands and snapped selfies in the exhibit hall with fairgoers at Democrats’ pamphlet-laden table.
Nearby waited Villegas’s former drumline student Nickolas Orozco, 29, a cafeteria and playground security monitor for a local elementary school. Although he was raised in a Democratic household, Orozco adopted more conservative views post-graduation when he moved to North Carolina. Now, back in Bakersfield, he considers himself a “true neutral” politically. He has supported both Democrats and Republicans in the past, and his top concerns are affordable housing and resources for K-12 schools.
Orozco’s stern expression melted into a grin as his former teacher greeted him with a hearty handshake and slap on the back. He told Villegas he knew “little to nothing” about the upcoming special election and was at the Democrats’ booth to learn more.
“Educate me, like you used to,” Orozco said. 
As Villegas explained how congressional districts are drawn every 10 years after the Census to ensure proportional representation, Orozco interjected.  
“I think I may have lied, I heard about this,” he said excitedly. “This is happening in Texas.”
Randy Villegas, a candidate for the 22nd Congressional District, meets with residents at the Kern County Democratic Party booth during the Kern County Fair in Bakersfield on Sept. 26, 2025
Yes, Villegas said, Texas Republicans redrew their maps this summer, in the middle of the decade, to help their party keep control of the U.S. House. In response, California is asking voters to temporarily suspend its current maps, drawn by an independent citizens commission, and instead adopt gerrymandered districts that favor Democrats for the next five years. Ballots are already going to voters.
“Can I count on you to vote ‘Yes’ on it?” Villegas ultimately asked. 
“I don’t see why not,” Orozco replied. “I mean, we’ve got to stand up to Texas!”
A district Democrats have eyed for a long time
Newsom and his party hope Prop. 50’s new maps will help their challengers oust five congressional Republicans and offset likely GOP pickups from mid-decade gerrymandering in Texas and Missouri. But a pickup in the 22nd Congressional District, which currently spans from the town of Hanford through the San Joaquin Valley to Bakersfield, is far from guaranteed. 
Democrats have long dreamt of ousting Republican Rep. David Valadao, a dairy farmer who fashions himself a political moderate. Yet to their disappointment, Valadao has consistently defied political gravity and Democrats’ voter registration advantage in the district. His only loss in the last 15 years came in 2018 during the first Donald Trump presidency after Valadao alienated voters on both sides of the aisle by voting to repeal the Affordable Care Act and in favor of Trump’s first impeachment.

But two years later, Valadao won his seat back even as former President Joe Biden won the same district by more than 10 percentage points over incumbent Trump.
A campaign spokesperson for Valadao, Andrew Renteria, did not respond to multiple emailed requests for an interview.
Assemblymember Jasmeet Bains, a Bakersfield doctor who specializes in addiction treatment, hopes she can lead Democrats to a repeat of 2018 by punishing Valadao for his vote to pass Trump’s megabill. 
The legislation could in the next 10 years push an estimated 57,000 of Valadao’s most vulnerable constituents off Medi-Cal, the state’s health care program for the poor, according to an estimate from Democrats on the congressional Joint Economic Committee. Another 8,200 would lose access to health care coverage through the Affordable Care Act.  Valadao’s district has the highest Medicaid enrollment rate of any congressional seat, according to an analysis by The New York Times of data from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank. 
Yet Bains, who has often been a thorn in the Democratic Party’s side for her moderate approach in the state Legislature, has distanced herself from Prop. 50. She was the sole legislator to buck her party and vote against the plan to fast-track the special election. Bains declined to be interviewed through her spokesperson, Adam Capper, who said she had no additional comment on Prop. 50. 
“I oppose any effort to circumvent independent redistricting, and the courts should act to stop these political games,” Bains said previously. “We don’t need more ways for politicians to rig the system.”
Farmers and other rural Californians are spooked that the new maps will dilute their votes by drawing them into districts with voters from urban centers. For instance, a new proposed district in Northern California lumps conservative, rural Modoc County with some of the state’s wealthiest communities in uber-liberal Marin County.
“This is not a game. This is our livelihood. This is our representation that you’re playing with.” Kern County farmer Jenny Holterman
In the San Joaquin Valley, Prop. 50 would stretch the compact 22nd Congressional District, which currently includes parts of Kings, Tulare and Kern counties, to include the northwest corner of the city of Fresno and smaller towns like Kerman. 
Jenny Holterman, a fourth-generation farmer in Kern County whose family primarily grows almonds, denounced Democrats’ redistricting plan as a “power grab” that threatens to leave farmers and rural Californians with far fewer voices in Congress. 
“This is not a game. This is our livelihood. This is our representation that you’re playing with,” said Holterman. She called the Democratic effort to oust him “really sad.” 
“He is that boots-on-the-ground that actually understands how an agriculture business works,” Holterman said. “That’s who should represent the valley.”
Voter turnout could decide Prop. 50’s fate
Campaign strategists and election watchers agree there are two big questions whose outcomes could decide the race — who can sell a simpler message, and which side can convince more uninformed voters to turn out. 
Republicans could benefit from energizing conservatives as well as uninformed voters who, with limited information about a complex subject, might be predisposed to vote “no” and keep the status quo.
“If the message is simple enough — ‘Hey, stop Trump,’ or ‘Hey, protect our elections,’ — it’s likelier that they’ll end up turning out more voters in the valley,” said Blake Zante, executive director of nonprofit The Maddy Institute which focuses on public policy affecting the San Joaquin Valley. 
On a recent Friday just after 7:30 a.m., Democrats Doug Hillhouse and John Waddell waved American flags and signs from an overpass on Highway 198, just outside the town of Lemoore. 
Dubbed the “Bridge Brigade,” the two men, along with several others from the Kings County Democrats, alerted the drivers below to the upcoming special election and urged them to vote “Yes.” Lashed to the bridge was a series of poster boards that read, “Worried? Register to vote. Yes on 50,” while another urged drivers to honk their horns.

“We’re out here fighting the demagoguery,” said Hillhouse, a former Republican who became a Democrat after Trump took over the GOP. He argued that Prop. 50 represents a proportional “tit for tat” response to Texas Republicans. 
“If we don’t get that passed, we’re going to be doomed to Republican rule,” said Waddell, who stood next to Hillhouse on the bridge and carried a sign that read, “ICE is gestapo.” 
While the bridge brigades, billboards and television advertisements might raise awareness about Prop. 50, those alone won’t guarantee that voters turn out, said Zante. Instead, person-to-person voter engagement through door-knocking — but especially through conversations with friends and family — is much more effective at getting voters to cast ballots. 
Reno Lanfranco, who owns several businesses in Kerman, about 20 minutes west of Fresno, views Prop. 50 as Newsom’s personal vanity project and a waste of taxpayer money. He blames California Democrats for high taxes — sales, income and gasoline — as well as what he feels is a byzantine regulatory system.



First: Reno Lanfranco, owner of Reno’s Hardware, stands in one of the aisles of his business. Last: Reno’s Hardware in Kerman on Sept. 25, 2025. Photos by Larry Valenzuela, CalMatters/CatchLight Local
“I’m telling everybody — all my employees, if they want to listen to me or not, and all my customers — vote no on it,” said Lanfranco, an imposing figure with his plaid work shirt stretched taut across his muscled frame, as he surveyed his hardware store. 
Prop. 50 would also disenfranchise conservative voters like himself, he argues, which is especially infuriating since Democrats hold a legislative supermajority and control all statewide offices.
“We have very few Republicans in office now and it’ll just squeeze the rest of them out,” he said. “That’s not right.”
One of Lanfranco’s employees credits his boss with helping him understand what’s at stake in the next special election. Shawn Delgado, a 24-year-old clerk at the hardware store, hadn’t heard of Prop. 50 until a CalMatters reporter asked for his opinion on it. After some follow-up research and talking with his boss, he’s leaning toward a “no” vote.

“We already have a bipartisan committee to decide those maps,” said Delgado, who voted for the first time in 2024 and supported Trump. While he acknowledged that redrawing California’s maps might be “more fair as a whole for the country,” he argued California shouldn’t gerrymander and disenfranchise its own Republican voters just because other states are redrawing their maps. 
Fear of immigration raids could keep some voters home
One potential roadblock to voter education in the Valley is the palpable fear of immigration enforcement raids, even among citizens. The Supreme Court’s recent decision to allow law enforcement to racially profile their targets has stoked existing fears and prompted many Latino people to stay home, lock their doors and refuse to answer the door for anyone they don’t know, even if they are U.S. citizens. 
Maria Pacheco, the mayor of Kerman and a frequent leader of local protests against immigration and customs enforcement, said many Hispanic residents are “politically disillusioned” and aren’t paying close attention to Prop. 50 — and she doesn’t blame them.
“How do you get the community to come out and vote when they’re afraid to come and go to the grocery store?” Pacheco said.

She noted that any white vans or SUVs that drive through town immediately trigger her and others who are fearful of ICE. “How do you get the community to want to participate when they’re seeing that their government is against them right now?”
But Pacheco also said she was enraged by the “racist and inhumane” rhetoric that Texas Republicans, specifically Gov. Greg Abbott, have used to justify their detention and deportation of Hispanic people who they claim are violent criminals or entered the country illegally. While ICE has not conducted raids in Kerman or the surrounding area, she’s on edge. It’s not a matter of if, but when, the immigration crackdown will come. 
“Harvest is coming to a close. So, is this when they’re gonna do it? When we’re no longer needed?” she said.

After Texas redrew its congressional maps to give Republicans an edge in five additional districts, Pacheco was proud of Newsom and California for “not just sitting back and allowing it,” but taking a stand and asking the people to weigh in as well. She’s worked to turn that pride into momentum and is encouraging community members to participate in the special election.
In one-on-one and small-group meetings with Hispanic voters, Pacheco emphasizes that voting “Yes” on Prop. 50 with a mail-in ballot from the relative safety of their homes is a small yet crucial act of resistance and a step toward reclaiming the humanity the Trump administration and GOP states have worked to strip away. 
“We can’t just sit and be complacent. We have to be brave,” Pacheco said. “We have to be uncomfortable for just a little while so that we can turn this around and make a difference.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/092525-Redistricting-Day-2-LV-31.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-08 08:56:35.424043

It’s that time. 
This week, county election officials are mailing ballots to registered voters across California in preparation for the special election next month. This is, of course, just one part of getting California ready for an election. 
Election officials take great care to ensure that, at every step, voters are safe and ballots are secure. Californians can count on our elections. That hasn’t changed. 
What has changed is the volume of false claims about elections coming out of the federal government. It’s noise that Californians need to ignore as we near Nov. 4. 
Amid today’s polarized environment and reports of political violence, it’s important for voters to know that federal law protects all voters against voter intimidation. Moreover, voters can be confident in the strong state laws here in California that protect against intimidation, whether at a drop box or in a polling place.
One California law — the Protecting Elections from Armed Coercion and Extremism Act — bans intimidation and threats against voters and election officials. It also gives voters and election workers the ability to sue those who engage in such tactics. And the PEACE Act, which passed last year with support from both sides of the aisle, tells juries weighing those lawsuits to presume that carrying guns where elections are being conducted is intimidation.
Because of these strong laws and the work of local and state election officials, I expect Nov. 4 to be another straightforward, peaceful Election Day. For voters, having a voting plan and knowing who to call in the event any issues arise can make things even smoother. 
When it comes to voting, voters in California have several options. The ballots going out this week by mail are one choice. A voter can return a ballot by mailing it back to the address using the pre-addressed ballot envelope, or by dropping it off at an official drop box location. Drop boxes are frequently placed at county government buildings, schools or libraries. It’s usually a good idea for voters to return a ballot well before the deadline and sign up for ballot tracking to know when a ballot was received and processed.
Or you can cast a ballot in person. For counties where vote centers are available, many centers open as early as Oct. 25 and are available through Election Day. Some counties also allow early voting at the elections office earlier in October, before vote centers open. Counties that don’t have vote centers allow early voting or early ballot drop off at the elections office and additional locations, while providing local polling places on Election Day.
As part of a voting plan, Californians should make sure they have access to the website or phone number for their local election official’s office or the Secretary of State’s office. They are the most reliable sources of information about polling locations and hours, registering to vote and other questions about voting. It’s essential to seek out information from reputable sources so that you get the right guidance and won’t be susceptible to misinformation. 
This helps reduce the spread of false ideas about voting and elections. 
The country is in a moment unlike any other in our history. The federal government is trying to undermine public confidence in our elections and the states’ ability to keep them free and fair. But that effort is unrelated to the reality: Election officials in California and the other 49 states take many steps to conduct safe, secure and accurate elections. 
Thanks to federal law and strong state laws protecting voters and the election process, Californians should make voting plans for the special election in full confidence that their ballots will count.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/110524_Sacramento-General-Election_MG_CM_53.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-08 08:56:35.424043

For the refinery workers being laid off — most of whom lack a college degree — it’s unlikely they’ll find another job that pays as well, despite recent efforts by the state to help.


Wilfredo Cruz went to the doctor in October of last year to have his brain scanned because he was experiencing vertigo — a dangerous condition when you’re a refinery worker like Cruz and your job entails climbing 200-foot towers and fixing heavy machinery. 
While he waited at the doctor’s office, he picked up his phone and felt a moment of panic, seeing 100 unread text messages in the last hour. 
The Phillips 66 refinery complex in Los Angeles had just said that it was going to close, and Cruz learned in that moment that he would eventually lose his job, along with nearly 1,000 other employees and contractors. 
“It was a big shock, a gut punch,” said Cruz, who thinks his last day will be sometime in April. Workers say layoff notices will begin to go out in the next few months. 
It’s just one of a handful of refineries that have closed or that intend to close in the coming months. For the workers — most of whom lack a college degree — it’s unlikely they’ll find another job that pays as well, despite recent efforts by the state to help. Though the Trump administration signed legislation creating billions of dollars in tax cuts for oil and gas companies, it’s not going to save these jobs or offer the workers any money to train for new ones. 
“You have people earning between $80,000 to $200,000 a year, and almost everyone is a high school graduate and that’s it,” said Cruz. “To go out and look for another job that’s even somewhat comparable, it just doesn’t exist.” 
When he isn’t at the refinery, Cruz is wearing a plain black shirt, shorts, and New Balance sneakers — anything that’s easy to clean if his 2-year old son throws food at him, he said. His vertigo is better these days, almost a year after the refinery said it would close, but he now has to find a job so he can support his family and pay his mortgage. The best bet, he said, is to go back to school and start a new career in cybersecurity.
Thousands of jobs lost
California has about 100,000 workers in the fossil fuel industry, according to an August report by the Public Policy Institute of California. That’s about the population of a small city, such as Merced or Redding. As the state continues its transition to renewable energy, many of those jobs may disappear — and some already have.
Refineries have been closing all across the U.S. in recent years, but California has been hit hard, especially in Contra Costa County, Solano County and parts of southern Los Angeles, near Long Beach. First it was the Marathon refinery in Contra Costa County in 2020, which put hundreds of people out of work before the plant converted to renewable fuels with a fraction of the former workforce. Then Phillips 66 began shifting one of its Contra Costa County refineries to renewables and closed an affiliated plant on the Central Coast. A Valero refinery in Solano County is also expected to close in the next few months, leading to more layoffs.
Publicly, oil companies have given vague justifications for the closures, though oil industry advocates, such as the Western States Petroleum Association, blame the state’s increased regulation and its renewable energy transition. Environmental groups point to the decrease in oil demand as more Californians turn to electric vehicles. 
With thousands of jobs at stake, Gov. Gavin Newsom and the Democratic-led state Legislature this summer tried to strike a deal with Valero to avoid the closure of its Solano County refinery. Those conversations are still “ongoing,” said Daniel Villaseñor, the deputy director of communications for the governor. 
What the state has offered so far is a $30 million pot of money, which refinery workers can use to train for new jobs. The money went out to four different workforce organizations last February, and they have until 2027 to distribute it to workers in various ways, such as through scholarships.

The United Steelworkers union, which represents many of the Phillips 66 refinery workers, received about a third of the money and recruited Cruz to help find eligible workers at his job. Some of his colleagues are trying to become truck drivers, emergency medical technicians, or radiologists, but the state money rarely covers all the training expenses, he said. 
In his spare time, Cruz is enrolled in an online, year-long certificate program in cybersecurity at UC San Diego and is using the state money to cover the $4,000 tuition. He said he wants a remote job, something that would allow him to spend more time with his son. 
The steelworkers union has pushed Newsom for much more, ideally “hundreds of millions of dollars per year” to help retrain the refinery workers it represents, said Mike Smith, the national bargaining chair for the union. The governor has yet to make any new promises. 
Six-figure salary, no degree required
The average work day at a refinery might entail crawling into small spaces, withstanding searing heat, or operating heavy machinery with precision. And it can be dangerous: In 2006, the roof of a storage tank collapsed, killing one person and injuring four others at the Phillips 66 refinery complex in Los Angeles, which was then owned by an earlier iteration of the company.  
Twelve-hour shifts are the norm, including many night shifts, and overtime is common. Nearby residents complain that the Phillips 66 facilities have a foul smell and that they pump cancer-causing chemicals into the air, creating health risks for the entire community. Workers are required to wear full-body fire retardant uniforms each day because fires are a constant risk, such as last week, when an explosion rocked a Chevron refinery in El Segundo. There was no major damage.

Though the work can be physically demanding, the rewards are plentiful. Union workers at the Phillips 66 refinery complex make about $115,000 a year, plus a pension and an 8% match on 401k contributions, said Smith. 
Together, the Phillips 66 refineries in Los Angeles and the Valero refinery in Solano County produce about 17% of the state’s gas. Without these facilities, Californians could see higher prices at the pump, according to an independent analysis by the federal government.
Laurie Wallace, a self-described artist, never wanted to work in oil and gas, but the money was a big draw, she said. For years, she was working as many as three different jobs, saving up money for punk and ska concerts while flipping burgers at In-N-Out, helping customers at Ace Hardware, or working shifts at a local cafe. Her husband at the time learned about a training program for refinery workers. He said he was going to apply and when she said she was interested, he told her she would never get in. 
“I took the test and got the better score,” Wallace said. “I don’t do well with people telling me not to do something.”
In the nearly 18 years since that exam, she’s worked at the Phillips 66 refinery complex in Los Angeles, handling the heavy machinery that transports California’s oil and gas. Wallace often earns over $100,000, especially with overtime, allowing her to achieve what many might consider the American Dream: a four-bedroom house in the Long Beach suburbs with an affordable mortgage and family vacations every year, including cruises to Mexico and trips to Las Vegas. 
She’ll likely see a pay cut in any future job. In a 2023 study by the UC Berkeley Labor Center, UC Irvine professor Virginia Parks helped survey those who had been laid off by the Marathon oil refinery in Contra Costa County in 2020. She found that roughly a quarter were unemployed or no longer looking for work over a year after losing their jobs. Some workers found opportunities at other oil refineries, though they made less money because they lacked seniority or a union. Others found jobs at utility companies or chemical treatment plants, and a few started working in health care or retail. 
“I don’t think (refinery workers) need long training programs but they do need some sort of reskilling,” said Parks, who wants the state to provide workers more financial help. She’s especially interested in state grants that give workers income support while they search for a skilled job. “Otherwise they’re just going to find whatever (job) they can.”
Her study found that workers who did find a job after getting laid off made about $38 an hour — $12 less than before. 
Lots of experience but few ways to prove it
Since the layoffs at the Phillips 66 refinery complex will happen slowly over the next few months, Wallace still has a job for now. Her department is responsible for receiving and shipping the oil and gas that arrives at the Port of Los Angeles, work that is so essential that she thinks she’ll be one of the last people laid off, potentially in 2027.
Over the years, she’s driven the trains that transport tons of oil and gas, operated cranes to carry pieces of pipelines and climbed on top of the massive fuel storage tanks that line the 110 Freeway. Often, she said she worked six or even seven days in a row.

In April, she was diagnosed with breast cancer and got a modified schedule. Now she works night shifts and only two or three days in a row. After finishing her radiation therapy around 2 p.m., she changes out of her usual attire, a punk T-shirt and jeans, and gets into her work uniform. She then has to get through Los Angeles traffic, bypass the plant’s two layers of security, and travel across the refinery, which takes up multiple city blocks, or about 650 acres. Her shift begins at 4:30 p.m., where she spends 12 hours in a room, alone, under fluorescent lights, actively monitoring 16 different computer screens for changes in pressure or chemistry. 
After so many years, staying alert during a night shift is second nature, she said with a laugh. “I’m a little high strung. I have no problem staying awake.” 
The stakes are high. If she isn’t paying attention and a machine fails or a tank has the wrong pressure, fuel leaks can occur. In 2014, a hole burst in an underground pipeline near the refinery, pouring 1,200 gallons of oil into a residential street.
Although Wallace has used many cranes over the years, she doesn’t have a crane operator’s license. In fact, all of the training that she’s done happens on-site, and her employer isn’t required to track it or give her any credential, such as a license or certificate, that could transfer to another job. After the Marathon refinery in Contra Costa County closed, former workers struggled to substantiate their skills when looking for new jobs, the UC Berkeley Labor survey found. 
Drawing directly on the study, and with support from the steelworkers union, longtime labor activist and state Sen. María Elena Durazo, a Los Angeles Democrat, proposed a bill this year that would require employers to provide their workers with proof of any on-the-job training or education. The governor has until Oct. 12 to sign or veto the bill.
It’s only “a first step” though, said Parks, a co-author of the study. Long-term, she said refinery workers should have the option to acquire independent certificates or credentials, such as a crane operator license, that prove their skills and don’t rely on an employer at all.
“It’s not ideal but it’s temporary” 
So far, only a fraction of the oil and gas workers who are eligible for state support have actually received it. 
“We just started enrolling members,” said Rosi Romo, who coordinates the grant program on behalf of the steelworkers union.
Though the steelworkers union received the money last March, only about 100 people have participated so far, said Romo, most of them in Southern California. She said the program can fund 650 scholarships, offering up to $15,000 in tuition for each worker 
In Kern County, where the oil industry is a major employer, the local job centers received over $11 million from the state, which they’ve used to help nearly 370 former oil and gas workers retrain in new careers, including trucking and nursing. The job centers have enough money to serve around 750 people, said Danette Williams, who works in marketing for the centers, known as the Employers’ Training Resource.
Unlike the steelworkers union, which is only giving out scholarships, Williams said the Employers’ Training Resource is also offering to reimburse 50% of wages during the first 480 hours of the workers’ new jobs. Romo said she wasn’t aware that was possible under the union’s contract with the state, but if it is, she said she’d try to offer the same benefit.
The other organizations who received the grant money did not respond to CalMatters’ questions.

Romo, along with other representatives from the steelworkers union, said the work schedule at the Phillips 66 refinery complex is one reason why workers have yet to use most of the money. As of August, about a quarter of union employees have already left the facility for other opportunities, said Smith, the national bargaining chair for the union. The remaining employees are left working overtime. 
Once layoffs begin in the coming months, Romo and Smith said they expect an uptick in the number of workers taking advantage of the scholarship money.
Phillips 66 did not respond to multiple requests for comment about its overtime policies or other ways it may be supporting workers’ job transitions. 
Cruz said he’s working six days a week now, 12 hours each day. To make progress on his cybersecurity course at UC San Diego, he tries to listen to lectures and audiobooks during his commute or while eating lunch or dinner during his two, 30-minute breaks. After he puts his son to sleep around 9 p.m., he has a few hours to study, though he has to wake up at 5 a.m. to make it to his shift on time. “It’s not ideal but it’s temporary,” he said.
Wallace has a slight advantage, since she started taking online classes in 2020 to complete her associate degree. She’s still one class short, but she hasn’t had the time to finish it. Between her radiation therapy and the 12-hour night shifts, she said it’s unlikely she’ll be able to study for at least another year while she works with the skeleton crew that’s closing the refinery.
If she had time, she said she would finish her associate degree and use the state training grant to help offset the cost of a bachelor’s degree. But because the state tuition grants expire in 2027, it’s quite possible she won’t be able to use the tuition money at all.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/092925_Refinery-Workers_SK_CM_05.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-08 08:56:35.424043

If she hangs on, she'll benefit from a little-noticed California law that changed the dates of local elections.","In summary
The San Mateo County sheriff is in hot water and facing removal. If she hangs on, she’ll benefit from a little-noticed California law that changed the dates of local elections.


A Bay Area sheriff facing imminent removal will get an extra two years in office if the move to oust her fails because of a little-noticed change in California law that moved the dates for local law enforcement elections. 
San Mateo County Sheriff Christina Corpus has an unusual six-year term because state legislators in 2022 changed the law to put elections for sheriffs and district attorneys in the same years as presidential elections, which meant moving local campaigns originally slated for 2026 to 2028. 
Every sheriff or district attorney who ran in 2022, including Corpus, got those two extra years, unless the official was removed from office in the meantime. That means they get two additional years for voters to forget about a scandal, or ride out other controversies.
San Mateo County moved a step closer to removing Corpus this week when retired Superior Court Judge James Emerson found cause to remove her on Monday night, more than a month after a two-week trial that included a cascade of allegations portraying a chaotic picture of her two-plus years in office. 
Emerson found that Corpus had “a close personal relationship outside the boundaries of a professional working relationship” with a subordinate, unlawfully ordered the arrest of the president of the sheriff’s deputies’ union and retaliated against a captain who refused to conduct the union president’s arrest because he believed it violated state law. 
“Appellant Sheriff Corpus’s purportedly non retaliatory justification for ordering an investigation against (the deputies’ union president) is, at the very least, questionable and, more likely, pretextual,” Emerson wrote in the advisory opinion. 
Emerson’s recommendation will be heard in a separate hearing by the San Mateo County Board of Supervisors, which already voted 5-0 in June to proceed with the process to remove Corpus.
6-year-term once had an appeal 
When former Corpus supporter Jim Lawrence first learned of the proposed change to election dates during Corpus’ 2022 campaign, he was delighted. 
“We were so high on (Corpus), we campaigned for her, it was such a welcome change,” said Lawrence, board chair of the nonpartisan nonprofit Fixin’ San Mateo, which advocates for civilian oversight of the San Mateo Sheriff’s Office.
“We were gonna have someone pushing for visibility, transparency, accountability, and we didn’t have to deal with the (2026) election cycle. We could wait until 2028. There was just almost no downside.”
His feelings about the sheriff have changed. 
“She had an amazing group behind her: house parties, street parties,” Lawrence said. “We got behind her and then she got in the office and made a complete about-face. It’s just, it’s really hard. How can the residents of San Mateo County live with this for another two-and-a-half years? It’s just unbelievable.”
Corpus could not be reached for comment. 
The issue is of particular import to the group of San Mateo County residents who led a recall effort against Corpus this year.
After a county investigator found Corpus violated policies on nepotism and conflicting relationships, voters in April passed a measure empowering the county board of supervisors to remove her. If successful, it would be the first removal of a county sheriff in California history.
In the meantime, unions representing San Mateo County Sheriff’s Office deputies and sergeants have issued no-confidence votes in Corpus. Six cities in San Mateo County called for her ouster. 
Why California moved sheriff elections
The law to change election years came about because California Democratic legislators sought to put elections for county offices on the years where voter turnout is highest, an effort that was opposed by Republicans in the Assembly and Senate. 
“Overall, presidential elections attract significantly more voters than midterm elections,” the League of Women Voters of California wrote in 2022 in support of the bill. “Furthermore, midterm electorates include fewer people from underrepresented populations – including youth, Black, Latino, and Asian American people than do presidential electorates.” 
The move faced opposition from the California State Sheriffs’ Association, which argued that presidential year elections are “no guarantee that voters will examine their choices more carefully.”
“A longer election ballot could result in voter fatigue and fewer votes cast in ‘down-ticket’ races,” the sheriffs’ association wrote in opposition to the bill. 
Fresno County voters went as far as passing a ballot measure last year that would have forced the county to maintain off-year elections for sheriffs and district attorneys. Attorney General Rob Bonta sued, and a Fresno County Superior Court judge sided with Bonta and the state, keeping Fresno’s county elections on the presidential election calendar. 
In Alameda County, the successful 2024 campaign to oust former District Attorney Pamela Price was lent heightened urgency by the prospect that she would serve until 2028 if not recalled. The Alameda County Board of Supervisors picked new District Attorney Ursula Jones Dickson as her replacement. 
As for Corpus, even if the county board of supervisors votes to remove her, the Palo Alto Daily Post reports that a San Mateo Superior Court judge overseeing Corpus’ lawsuit against the county ruled that Corpus won’t be removed right away. 
The judge ruled she should receive some extra time to challenge her removal: not an extra two years, but an extra two weeks.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/012423-Christina-Corpus-REUTERS-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-08 08:56:35.424043

She called Exxon-Mobil’s sponsorship “a greed and greenwashing attempt,” in an interview with Source NM Tuesday.
“Exxon is sponsoring the Balloon Fiesta as a way to essentially distract from the fact that they’re causing so much harm to our communities while behind closed doors, here they are sponsoring this oilland gas conference, essentially,” Craft said. “So we’re here to kind of draw the contrast there.”

The state plans to invest over $700 million to bring broadband to over 200,000 homes and businesses throughout Missouri.
These homes and businesses are considered “unserved or underserved,” meaning that they lack reliable access to high-speed internet. Missouri had the third most locations in the nation with less than ideal access to internet services, according to BJ Tanksley, the director of the Office of Broadband Development.
The final plan hopes to provide 81% of the targeted locations with fiber-based service, all while using less than half of the state’s allocated BEAD funds. The Department of Economic Development said this plan will save nearly $1 billion of the $1.7 billion in allocated federal funds.
“Frankly the $1.7 (billion) was the third largest allocation,” Tanksley said. “It was California and Texas and then Missouri, which means we had a lot of locations without access that we still needed to try to get to, and that’s part of the reason we had such a high allocation in the budget.”
The Office of Broadband Development worked for nearly three years to create the initial proposals for the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, which oversees the federal program. From there, Tanksley and the department targeted the most optimal locations for implementation based on the availability of service before opening applications to provide grants to recipients around those areas.
The final proposal is another step toward completing Missouri’s largest broadband connectivity investment to date.
“Expanding access to reliable, high-speed internet is essential for Missouri’s future,” said Michelle Hataway, director of the Department of Economic Development, in a release. “Our final BEAD proposal represents a major step toward helping Missourians prosper by ensuring every household and business has the tools they need to succeed in today’s economy.”
The plan also proposed investing over $450 million in businesses, while leveraging $400 million in private investment. There were 42 internet service providers selected to aid in implementation, with 29 of them being Missouri-based businesses.
Missouri has more internet service providers engaged in the program compared to other states, and according to Tanksley, that aligns with the Office of Broadband Development’s goal of having a multitude of providers involved.
“We have over 20 subrecipients in this program, meaning different providers that are going to be a part of it, and that’s a huge difference,” Tanksley said. “When you look at some other states, there’s others that are similar, but a lot of states have far less providers involved, and I think that’s a testament to the providers across the state that were willing to take part in the program.”
NTIA will need to approve the final BEAD proposal before the department can begin construction of any projects. Once approved, funded projects will have four years to complete their work, and Tanksley hopes to see physical work begin in early 2026.

(Alixel Cabrera/Utah News Dispatch)An initiative of Congress’ spending package known as the “big, beautiful bill” started becoming a reality last week, leaving environmentalists with deep concerns about the future landscape of national parks. 
The map of 13.1 million acres of federal land now available for coal leasing triples the benchmark set by the law and includes parcels near or directly adjacent to landmarks like Zion, Bryce Canyon and Capitol Reef national parks, an analysis from groups including the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance found.

“The Trump Administration views Southern Utah’s remarkable redrock country as just another place to exploit and plunder as they promote new coal mining. Nothing could be further from the truth. America’s national parks, national monuments, and wild public lands don’t deserve this fate and we’ll work tirelessly to stop it from happening,” Steve Bloch, legal director at the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, said in a news release.
About 48,000 acres of federally-owned land in Utah are available for coal-mining operations, a big step in the Trump administration’s plan to increase energy production in the country, particularly fossil fuels. 
According to the analysis, an almost 12,000-acre parcel available for coal leases is directly adjacent to the west side of Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument, and south of Bryce Canyon. 
Mining in the area could affect the water that feeds tributaries of the Paria River, Jacqualine Grant, executive director of Grand Staircase-Escalante Partners, said in a statement. 
There are also parcels on the east side of Zion National Park, including a portion of the North Fork of the Virgin River and North Fork Road, the analysis says. Public land bordering scenic roads like state Highway 89, also known as Utah Heritage Highway, and the Mount Carmel Scenic Byway would also be available for lease in the area.
East of Capitol Reef National Park, the Bureau of Land Management is also offering an approximately 2,000-acre piece of land for leases, the environmentalists said. 



Let us know what you think...


 


“Coal mines near Zion, Bryce Canyon or Capitol Reef? It’s absurd. It was decided decades ago that these lands would be off the table,” Cory MacNulty, Southwest campaign director for the National Parks Conservation Association, said in a statement. “Dirty energy development has no place near our national parks, especially as iconic landscapes across the Southwest are already at risk of having hazy skies, polluted water, and a degraded visitor experience from nearby drilling and mining.”
The Department of the Interior, however, argues that opening the land for lease, along with lowering royalty rates to 7%, will help strengthen supply chains and the country’s energy security. 
“President Trump promised to put American energy workers first, and today we’re delivering,” Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum said in a news release. “By reducing the royalty rate for coal, increasing coal acres available for leasing, and unlocking critical minerals from mine waste, we are strengthening our economy, protecting national security, and ensuring that communities from Montana to Alabama benefit from good-paying jobs.” 
Lease sales are already happening across the country, according to the release. Together, they add hundreds of millions of tons of coal. 
The agency is also spearheading efforts to recover minerals like uranium, zinc, germanium, tellurium and rare earth elements from mine waste and abandoned sites.

Montgomery Police Chief James Graboys said there are multiple persons of interest and many leads, but declined to give further detail due to the ongoing investigation.
“It has to be pieced together, but I guarantee you this. When we conclude this investigation, I will give you a full breakdown,” Graboys said at a press conference Tuesday.

The shooting took place during celebrations following a football game in Montgomery. Police said Jeremiah Morris, 17, and Shalanda Williams, 43, were killed in the shooting. 
Five of the injured have life-threatening injuries and seven have non-life-threatening injuries. Graboys said Tuesday there had been no change in the condition of the injured. He and Montgomery Mayor Steven Reed thanked all law enforcement partners for their help in the investigation, as well as the community.
“I’m grateful for the citizens who have been calling in and who are making a difference,” Graboys said. “Unity is what we need now, because our clear purpose is holding people accountable who are responsible for this problem.”
Reed and his administration have been criticized by state leaders in their handling of crime in Montgomery. Gov. Kay Ivey instructed the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency (ALEA) to increase its presence in downtown Montgomery.
“We’ve been working with them already,” Reed said. “I think our men and women Montgomery Police Department are doing a very good job, and under the right circumstances, more collaboration can be impactful.”
Reed and other Montgomery leaders have noted that the city has increased the budget for the local police department by over 26%, and criticized the state for forcing the city to repeal an anti-gun ordinance last year. 
“You’ve seen the type of increase that we put into the budget and the type of investment we have put into our men and women,” Reed said. 
Alabama has some of the highest firearm death rates in the nation. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Alabama’s gun death rate in 2023 was 25.6 per 100,000, the fourth-highest in the country.

Gavin Newsom's chances in a presidential race.,"This week I, along with millions of other Californians, received a one-page ballot for the Nov. 4 special election.
My initial reaction as I opened the envelope was anger, perhaps even disgust, that I and my fellow voters are being asked to ratify Proposition 50, a nakedly partisan power play by Gov. Gavin Newsom and Democratic legislators trying to grab additional congressional seats for their party.
They want us to set aside — perhaps temporarily, perhaps not — the work of an independent commission that four years ago drew the 52 current districts after months of hearings and discussions. Democrats have benefited greatly from that plan but now want to greatly reduce Republican-held seats to near-zero.
The election is costing taxpayers nearly $300 million out of a state budget that’s already billions of dollars out of balance, thus violating in spirit, if not in law, the state constitution’s prohibition of “gifts of public funds.”
Prop. 50, if enacted, is not only a gift to the Democratic Party as it jousts with Republicans for control of Congress over the next three election cycles, it also blatantly serves Newsom’s obvious intention to run for president in 2028.
However, President Donald Trump is equally deserving of disgust for his role in the gerrymander game. He claims, without evidence, the 2019 election that denied him a second term was rigged, yet now he wants to rig the 2026 congressional elections.
Trump is asking red states to alter their congressional districts to give the GOP an advantage in the skirmish with Democrats over control of the House.
After Texas Republicans complied to gain five seats, Newsom countered with Prop. 50, which would approve districts that have been redrawn in secret, ignoring the fairness guidelines the independent commission followed.
The tit-for-tat duel symbolizes the perpetual power struggles that have replaced governance in the nation’s political system.
At the moment it appears that Prop. 50 will succeed. A new poll of 1,000 likely voters, conducted by the research firm co/efficient, found that 54% were supporting the measure, 36% were opposed and 10% were still undecided, reflecting the state’s pro-Democrat, anti-Trump voting history.
Eric McGhee, who charts political trends for the Public Policy Institute of California, says in a new analysis that passage of Prop. 50 could give Democrats 47 of the state’s 52 congressional seats, a gain of four, if every California district won by Kamala Harris last year also votes Democratic in 2026.
Democrats hope for a five-seat gain to offset the assumed five-seat loss in Texas. However, officials in at least six other red states are working on redistricting plans to increase Republican chances of maintaining House control in 2026. Meanwhile, other blue states have contemplated following California’s example, but the efforts don’t appear to be bearing fruit.
California’s gerrymander could have no effect on what happens in the 2026 congressional elections, but its effect on California could be heavy.
The new districts would be in place for three election cycles and, as written, Prop. 50 would disappear after the 2030 census, returning redistricting to the independent commission. 
The California delegation is likely to lose four seats after the census due to very slow, if any, population growth. The five new Democratic members of Congress — Prop. 50 babies, as it were — would probably be reluctant to give up their seats.  Therefore, the next governor and legislators would be under heavy pressure to maintain Democratic dominance of the delegation by retaining gerrymander power.
So how will my disgust about the entire process affect my vote —even if I resist the temptation to toss my ballot into the nearest wastebasket? I really don’t know.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/081425-Newsom-Redistricting-Rally-TS-CM-05.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-08 08:56:35.424043

Vice President JD Vance claimed Democrats would shut the government down to “demand healthcare for illegal aliens”—his words to describe limited state-funded programs that provide narrow services to undocumented immigrants.
Michigan does not fund these programs, rather only seven states and Washington, D.C. strategically allocate their own state dollars this way.
Earlier this year, Republicans passed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act using the same rhetoric, politicizing health care policy with immigration talking points. Now, the newest round of Medicaid cuts, which Democrats have opposed, threatens to destabilize health care for Michiganders and increase costs nationwide. The fact is that non-citizens are already excluded from Medicaid enrollment, and the state programs under scrutiny are designed to recover otherwise unpaid expenses for essential and emergency care that hospitals are obligated to provide.
The political focus may be on immigrants, but the reality is that lawmakers are holding health care for millions of Americans hostage—with no savings for Michigan, only deeper cuts to its health care infrastructure.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
As clinicians, we see firsthand the benefits of Medicaid, as the largest health insurance program in the U.S., covering low-income Americans, families, pregnant people, and those with disabilities. Federal law (EMTALA) requires hospitals to provide emergency care to anyone in need, regardless of their ability to pay. Emergency Medicaid funding, which helps hospitals meet this mandate, accounts for just 0.4% of federal Medicaid spending for all recipients, not just undocumented immigrants.
Yet in the current shutdown debate, these state-funded programs are cited as justification for reducing billions in federal health care funding, even though they receive no federal support. The result is a dangerous mismatch between rhetoric and reality, as political negotiations threaten to dismantle the financial framework that sustains EMTALA, potentially leaving hospitals uncompensated for legally mandated care and shifting those costs onto American families through higher premiums.
In addition, Medicaid cuts enacted by Republicans risk terminating state programs that have been shown to save state dollars. While lawmakers claim cutting access for undocumented patients would save Medicaid funds, Colorado demonstrates that limited coverage for low-income individuals, regardless of residency status, reduces overall health care expenditures in certain circumstances. Before expanding access to dialysis, Colorado spent nearly $20 million between 2017 and 2018 on costly emergency-only treatments delivered in the ER. After shifting away from emergency-only treatments and allowing scheduled dialysis, it nearly doubled access while cutting costs per patient in half.
This change reduced the burden on hospitals, meaning fewer costs were distributed to those with private insurance. These state funded programs show how strategic investments lower overall health care costs, protecting hospitals and insured patients alike. That’s not wasteful spending, it’s fiscal discipline. In cases like Colorado’s, whether or not programs exist, patients with kidney failure will still end up in our hospitals.
Funding cuts do not eliminate the need for care.
Instead of fiscal discipline, today’s shutdown fight advances a false narrative that scapegoats immigrants while undermining the very system it claims to protect. Restricting Medicaid under the guise of cutting costs does not erase expenses—it shifts them onto hospitals, insured patients, and communities. As with the One Big Beautiful Bill Act before it, framing Medicaid spending around undocumented immigrants misleads the public and distracts from the real consequences: destabilizing hospitals, raising premiums, and weakening care for millions of ordinary Americans.
In Michigan, where such programs do not exist, patients will still come to our hospitals whether they are citizens or not, and with less funding, our ability to support communities will be further undermined.

(Photo by Jeremiah Braun, Bureau of Land Management/National Interagency Fire Center)In Nevada, the majority of wildfires happen in the summer – but not all. And this year, dry conditions and strong winds have the potential to fuel destructive late-year fires. 
Wildfires in Nevada are typically from July to September when vegetation has been baked dry, heat is high and precipitation is low. However, some of the region’s most destructive fires can occur in the fall when snow hasn’t piled up yet, and seasonal wind patterns can make a fire spread fast.
Last year, wildfires from October through November accounted for a fourth of all Nevada wildfires. From Oct. 1 through Nov. 30 nearly 70 fires burned through more than 26,000 acres of wilderness, according to the Nevada Fire Stats dashboard.
The majority of acres burned that fall came from one wildfire in October – the Castle Ridge Fire in Elko County. It was also the largest wildfire in the state in 2024, burning through about 25,000 acres of land in 11 days before finally being contained. Strong winds at the time threatened to spread the fire towards the town of Midas, Nevada, located less than three miles away.
Some of the Great Basin’s most destructive wildfires can occur in fall or early winter due to the arrival of dry winds that typically happen in the cooler months. 
“That’s the thing that people miss more often. It’s not that it’s more likely to happen, it’s that it’s still likely to happen,” said Brock Uhlig, the State Fire Management Officer for BLM Nevada. “100% they still occur, and it is still something that we need to be mindful of and ready for.”
Strong winds alone don’t create wildfire, but as climate change drags dry weather later into the fall and early winter, fire season is more likely to overlap with the kind of hazardous wind conditions that can make fires spread more quickly and more difficult to control.
In 2025, Nevada is already experiencing the largest wildfire season since 2020,  Uhlig said. Since January, about 570 fires have burned through nearly 260,000 acres of wilderness in Nevada.
Healthy winter snowpacks last year created conditions that also allowed highly flammable invasive cheatgrass to multiply, while drought dried out vegetation across Nevada’s valleys. 
“There was a lot of carryover grass that we had, especially in Northern Nevada, like Humboldt County, Elko County areas, and that really was the driver for our large fires this year,” Uhlig said. 
Those conditions are likely to continue into the fall and early winter. Several parts of Nevada have above normal fuel loads that could lead to wildfires, according to the National Interagency Fire Center’s October report.  
In northern and western Nevada fine fuels, like cheatgrass, are above normal and could lead to large wildfires if they dry out and ignite. Until snow begins to fall, the region could be at risk of major wildfires during periods of strong winds after prolonged dry periods. Parts of central Nevada are also covered in above-normal fine fuel, according to the report.  
Drought conditions have persisted in much of the Great Basin this fall, including Nevada. Precipitation was also just below normal across much of eastern Nevada, and drought conditions have expanded across the state, according to the report. 
Wildfires in the state this year have been fueled by grasses dried out by drought and dry storms that bring more lightning than rain, said Uhlig.
“The bulk of our fire starts were from lightning. We had a little lightning bust last week that gave us quite a few incidents across the state,” Uhlig said.  “There’s always a fine line between thunderstorms that come through and give us good rain that makes fires easier to suppress and storms where there’s not much rain that hits the ground at all.”
While about half of wildfires this year were caused by lightning striking dry vegetation, the other half was caused by humans, according to Nevada Fire Stats.
Cooler fall weather can increase the use of public lands and the risk of human caused wildfires. 
“It’s the last chance to go out camping, it’s hunting season. All of us love to go out and use public lands in the fall,”  Uhlig said.
Hunting season, in particular, sees a rise in unintentional fire starts. Target shooting on dry grass can send sparks into dead, dry, and highly flammable vegetation.
In 2018, a massive wildfire blackened one of Nevada’s most popular recreation areas in Elko’s Ruby Mountains after a fire broke out near a shooting range on private land. The wildfire started Sept. 30 and lasted into early October, burning through about 5,000 acres of wilderness. 
“The thing that helps the most is not not driving off road. High grass building up under vehicles – hot mufflers hitting grass – can result in a fire. Make sure you have a shovel and water with you if you’re going to have a campfire.” Uhlig said. “All of our standard fire prevention needs remain valid no matter what time of year it is.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/54199821086_b60accbdcd_o-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-08 08:56:35.424043

The legislation also also directs the state to pursue alternative methods of execution. (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)“There will be no firing squads in North Carolina during my time as governor,” Governor Josh Stein said Oct. 3 after signing a criminal justice bill into law in response to the tragic murder of 23-year-old Iryna Zarutska on the Charlotte light rail. A statement we can’t believe had to be uttered in 2025. Iryna’s Law contains valuable legal system reforms, including mandatory mental health evaluations and a review of pretrial release processes. However, the law not only reinstated the death penalty in North Carolina—which had been halted for 20 years—but also allows convicted individuals to choose between the electric chair, lethal injection, or a firing squad.
One of the bill sponsors, Representative Reece Prytle, stated the bill “seeks to restore the death penalty as a deterrent and an option for prosecutors across the state.” In the 1976 Supreme Court ruling for Gregg v. Georgia, the Court noted that there may be several purposes for the death penalty, including deterrence. However, there is little evidence to support the claim that capital punishment deters homicide. In fact, some studies have found that homicide rates are higher in death penalty jurisdictions. This suggests that we may be heading in the wrong direction if the goal is to prevent incidents like Zarutska’s murder from happening again.
Even if deterrence were proven, serious concerns remain about how the death penalty is applied. According to reports, Decarlos Brown Jr., the man accused of stabbing Zarutska, has a history of schizophrenia, and he has been referred for a competency to stand trial evaluation. This indicates the court has concerns about his ability to understand the proceedings or participate in his own defense due to his current mental state. In the 2002 ruling of Atkins v. Virginia, the Supreme Court held that executing individuals who are intellectually disabled violated the Eighth Amendment’s ban on cruel and unusual punishment.
Although the Court has not banned capital punishment for all individuals with mental illness, subsequent cases have considered it cruel and unusual punishment. For instance, Oklahoma v. Quarterman clarified that executing a mentally ill person whose illness prevents them from understanding the reason for the death penalty is unconstitutional. In the 2007 decision of Panetti v. Texas, the Court ruled that a person must have a rational understanding of the reason for their execution. Since then, leading organizations–including the American Bar Association (ABA), American Psychological Association, American Psychiatric Association, and National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI)–have adopted policies opposing the use of the death penalty against people with mental illness.
The risk of wrongful executions associated with capital punishment cannot be ignored. Since 1973, at least 200 people on death row in the United States have been exonerated, including 12 from North Carolina. Advances in technology have helped prevent some wrongful convictions, but it cannot safeguard every case. While the evidence against Brown is undeniable due to the stabbing being caught on video, history has shown that innocent people have been sentenced to death and even executed. Reinstating capital punishment in North Carolina reopens the door to this irreversible injustice in future cases.
Furthermore, these policies can indirectly affect youth who engage in serious offending, as 16- and 17-year-olds are transferred into adult courts. In 2024, House Bill 834 expanded the number of youth who can be automatically tried in adult court for serious felonies. While that law doesn’t explicitly authorize the death penalty for minors, it increases the likelihood that teens could face adult sentencing. Twenty years ago, in Roper v. Simmons, the Court held that executing individuals who were under age 18 at the time of the offense was excessive and, again, in violation of the Eighth Amendment.
We are all seeking solutions to deter and reduce crime in North Carolina. But bringing back the death penalty shifts the focus toward retribution rather than prevention of crime. Evidence-driven solutions, such as investing in mental health services, strengthening community-based violence prevention, and expanding educational and economic opportunities, offer real promise. If our commitment is truly to community safety and justice, the death penalty is not the path forward.

Givens in an interview on Tuesday that the bill would help those who might struggle with putting a busy schedule as a parent.
“Not everyone has the opportunity to cook, all Sunday afternoon long and put different plates in the refrigerator,” she said. “I just thought of putting someone in my place, being with a sick child, working, trying to keep up with a heavy, rigorous schedule and trying to be everything that I wanted to be and needed to be as a mother, and thought, “Why are we not doing this?'” she said.
According to the USDA Food and Nutrition website, “foods that are hot at the point of sale” are not eligible for purchase under SNAP. A 2017 USDA memo said that hot foods, along with heated foods and cold prepared foods, were not considered “foods intended for home preparation and consumption.” A message seeking comment was left with the department Monday.
The USDA last year granted waivers allowing SNAP recipients in hurricane-affected areas to temporarily purchase hot food. 
The Alabama Department of Human Resources, which administers SNAP in Alabama said in an emailed statement Tuesday that currently SNAP recipients can purchase rotisserie chicken with their benefits if the chicken is cold and has a nutrition label.
Givens said she spoke with DHR about the cold food, but still thought SNAP recipients should be able to have hot food.
“I thought, well, not everyone, maybe 365 days a year, would have access to a stove,” she said. “There are those that, if they can get this rotisserie chicken, and it’s hot, and they can put something else on the table, it could be a meal, even if the power was out.”
Other eligible items under SNAP include:

Meat, poultry and fish

The Lincy Institute at UNLV, in a policy brief released Monday, makes the case that gender disparities in health, education, administration, and literacy (HEAL) professions warrant a closer look by state policymakers. Men make up only 22% of the HEAL workforce.
Men are losing out on stable jobs, some of which do not require a four-year degree. And the lack of men in crucial fields like education and health care is exacerbating already existing workforce shortages.
This HEAL workforce is expected to grow by 1.6 million jobs nationwide by 2033, according to the report, which analyzed data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and Nevada P-20 to Workforce Research Data System.
Lincy found that women are disproportionately enrolled in educational programs or training for HEAL occupations, not just at the collegiate level but also in high school career and technical education programs.
The report highlights a Higher Education Male Achievement Collaborative launched by the American Institute for Boys and Men and the University of Tennessee Knoxville. The collaborative explores best practices for increasing the enrollment numbers and graduation rates of men in college.
One such initiative at UT Knoxville supports men, especially Black and Hispanic men, in their transition to college with personalized coaching, leadership development and cultural immersion opportunities.
But researchers acknowledged those efforts would only reach men who’ve taken the step of enrolling in college. Nevada also needs to address the growing number of young men aged 16 to 24 who are not in employment, education or training, or “NEET.”
According to the American Institute for Boys and Men, Nevada has among the highest NEET rates for men. And it has the largest gap between its women and men NEET rates — 10% to 19%, respectively.
(Researchers note 1 in 5 young women classified as NEETs are the primary caregivers for children. This is not true of the young men; only 3% of them are caring for kids.)
“Reaching these males will require targeted outreach and partnerships with community organizations,” the Lincy brief concludes.
A commission on men and boys could complement Nevada’s Commission on Women, which was first created in 1991 but went dormant for two decades before being reactivated in 2014. Nevada is one of 35 states that had a commission on women as of 2023.
Commissions on boys and men are not commonplace. Washington State in 2023 became the first to create one. It focuses on making policy recommendations in five broad areas: education and skills; mental and physical health; fatherhood, family and relationships; jobs, careers, and financial health; and experiences of males in the court systems.
Richard Reeves, president of the American Institute for Boys and Men, acknowledged in a blog post before the Washington commission was created that such a proposal “can elicit a strong negative reaction.”
“Given the history of sexism that in many ways we are still struggling to move past, this visceral opposition is natural,” he wrote. “But having acknowledged our own discomfort and skepticism, we then need to look hard at the evidence that in fact, on many fronts, many boys and men are in trouble.”
He pointed to poorer education outcomes and higher suicide, incarceration and homelessness rates as examples.

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)While abortion has been a constant campaign issue for political candidates from coast to coast since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, it’s become barely a blip in New Jersey’s race to replace term-limited Gov. Phil Murphy.
That’s partly because New Jersey leaders have enacted strong abortion protections since then, observers say. Abortion rights supporters rank New Jersey at or near the top when it comes to reproductive rights, while the Murphy administration has declared the state a safe haven for those seeking or providing the procedure.
It’s also because both leading candidates for governor have said they support abortion rights. Rep. Mikie Sherrill (D) said she backs current state protections that allow abortion with no gestational limit, while Jack Ciattarelli (R) backs the procedure up to 20 weeks. The two are vying for Murphy’s job on Nov. 4.
Ashley Koning, director of the Eagleton Center for Public Interest Polling at Rutgers University, said affordability and taxes have increasingly edged out abortion as priorities for voters, both in recent surveys and in last year’s general election.
“I don’t really see an issue like abortion eking through in these final weeks,” Koning said. “At the end of the day, ‘It’s always the economy, stupid.’ That’s what New Jersey voters are going to care about when it comes to this Jersey-centric statewide election.”
Advocates on both sides of the reproductive rights fight agree the abortion landscape could look vastly different in New Jersey under a Republican governor, with Ciattarelli vowing to defund Planned Parenthood, fund antiabortion pregnancy centers, require parental notification for minors seeking abortions, and pass a bill now stalled in the Statehouse that would largely ban abortion after 20 weeks.
Abortion rights supporters fear New Jersey’s gubernatorial trends could prevail and land Ciattarelli the win. It’s been more than 60 years since either party won the governorship three elections in a row, as Sherrill is seeking to do this year.
“We’re preparing for either scenario, whether there is a Mikie Sherrill governor or Jack Ciattarelli is elected governor,” said Kaitlyn Wojtowicz, executive director of Planned Parenthood Action Fund of New Jersey. “We could face some really grave issues with Jack Ciattarelli as governor … to us, this is one of the most consequential elections of, I will say, my lifetime, when it comes to what the future of reproductive health care access can look like in New Jersey, especially with the threats at the federal level.”
President Donald Trump and his administration have moved to block Medicaid funds from Planned Parenthood, pardoned antiabortion activists charged with federal crimes for blocking access to clinics, and threatened access to birth control, among other things.

 Where the candidates stand

Sherrill has been a steadfast supporter of abortion rights, appearing at rallies and press conferences to advocate for reproductive rights, introducing legislation in Congress to protect abortion and IVF access for military women, and consistently voting to maintain abortion access.
Asked by the New Jersey Monitor if she supports any restrictions on the procedure, she said: “This is a decision that should be made between a woman and her doctor.”
“I’m in favor of choice,” she said.
Sherrill voted twice in favor of the Women’s Health Protection Act, which ultimately failed but would have codified the abortion rights enshrined in Roe v. Wade. If elected governor, Sherrill said she would move to include abortion rights in the state constitution.
“Jack wants an abortion ban. He’s also in favor of defunding Planned Parenthood. All of these things that can lead to worse and worse health for women in our state,” Sherrill said. “I think what we really need is a constitutional protection, so it doesn’t matter who’s governor, women are protected in our state.”
A Ciattarelli campaign spokesman directed the New Jersey Monitor to its website, which says the decision whether to end a pregnancy is “deeply personal” and “should be between a woman, her partner, her faith, and her health care professionals.”
But Ciattarelli has also said he supports repealing the Freedom of Reproductive Choice Act, the 2022 state law that codified abortion rights here, and passing the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, a bill that has been introduced every legislative session since 2016 that would ban abortion after 20 weeks except in cases of rape or incest or if the mother’s life is endangered. New Jersey is one of nine states that allow abortion at any point of gestation, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports abortion rights.
At a town hall in Pitman last month, Ciattarelli brought up abortion in response to a question about the rights parents have over their children’s health care decisions. He said he would bar people under 18 from getting abortions without parental consent.
“Here in the state of New Jersey, a child can’t get their ears pierced if they’re under the age of 18 without what? Permission from their parents,” he said. “We’re going to have 15- and 16-year-olds getting an abortion, and parents aren’t going to be notified? I have yet to find even the most liberal person that agrees with that policy position.”
He also has echoed the Trump administration’s calls to defund Planned Parenthood, saying he opposes using public funds for abortion and would redirect that money to antiabortion pregnancy centers. The Murphy administration remains locked in a legal battle with a group of these centers, which have challenged a state investigation into whether they use deceptive advertising to lure pregnant patients who may be considering abortion.

 ’20/20 Project’

Antiabortion advocates gathered at the Statehouse in Trenton last month for the New Jersey March for Life.
The march was just 40 days before the general election, but most speakers didn’t mention the election or Ciattarelli. That didn’t surprise Marie Tasy, who heads New Jersey Right to Life.
“He says he’s pro-choice,” Tasy told the New Jersey Monitor. Her group endorsed conservative radio host Bill Spadea in the GOP primary.
Brennan Coughlin, pastor of Fellowship CrossPoint Church in Chesterfield, said he’s “underwhelmed” by Ciattarelli’s abortion stance.
“I did not vote for him in the primary. I voted for Bill Spadea, who’s much more clear and strong on protecting babies in the womb,” said Coughlin, a frequent fixture at antiabortion rallies. “But I will definitely vote for Jack Ciattarelli, knowing that Mikie Sherrill would be, from my vantage point, continuing the policies of Gov. Murphy that we do not support and are staunchly opposed to.”
Michael D. Byrne regards such sentiments as a failure of messaging, rather than an enthusiasm gap.
Byrne is a Republican and member of the New Jersey Pro-Life Alliance, a group that formed after the spring primaries to mobilize voters on the abortion issue. They plan an advertising campaign in the coming weeks to let antiabortion voters know Ciattarelli is their guy, Byrne said.
While some abortion critics oppose the procedure at any stage of pregnancy, a 20-week ban has proven tolerable enough in antiabortion circles that a coalition of New Jersey advocates in 2017 launched an effort called the 20/20 Project to push for such a prohibition by 2020.
“It’s one of those 80/20 positions in politics where the vast majority of voters, when they have time to think about late-term abortion versus early, agree that there should be some limits,” Byrne said.
Byrne has a lot more enthusiasm for Ciattarelli than Tasy and Coughlin.
“We’re excited about finally having a candidate who is a serious candidate — who’s likely to win, I think, at this point — and who will champion the 20-week bill, as well as other common sense things like parental notification and ending taxpayer funding for abortion,” Byrne said.
Abortion rights advocates hope the schism in the antiabortion community will help sink Ciattarelli’s chances.
Wojtowicz said undecided voters need only look back to former Gov. Chris Christie’s tenure for a reminder of what New Jersey could look like under Ciattarelli. Christie repeatedly vetoed family planning funding, which drove at least six clinics to close. Beyond abortion, such clinics also offer patients screening for sexually transmitted infections and cancer, as well as preventative services including birth control, Wojtowicz said.
“We’ve been here before, and we know what we could expect under a Ciattarelli governorship. It would be devastating for public health,” she said.
Jeanne LoCicero, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey, said the next governor should not meddle in matters of bodily autonomy.
“Everyone should be able to get the reproductive health care they need, and that includes abortion care, and they need to be able to obtain that care when they need it and without the interference of politicians,” LoCicero said. “So New Jersey should be enacting protections for patients seeking abortion care and other reproductive care, and not putting barriers in place. These are decisions that need to be made with patients and doctors and not by lawmakers.”

A new series of achievement gap studies was released in June. These suggest some marginal improvement in closing achievement gaps for several minority groups over the past 16 years, but that more work is needed to support students of different ethnic and cultural backgrounds. 
The reports, conducted by the Commission on African American Affairs, the Commission on Hispanic Affairs, the Commission on Asian Pacific American Affairs and the Governor’s Office of Indian Affairs, were follow-ups to a series of landmark studies released in 2008 that prompted the Legislature to create the Educational Opportunity Gap Oversight and Accountability Committee. 
The Legislature funded the Oversight and Accountability’s request for the follow-up studies in the 2023-25 budget.
Representatives for the commissions said that limitations with past data that grouped multiple demographics together make it difficult to derive clear-cut takeaways from the reports. There were also some differences between the data used in the earlier research and the new studies, which makes it difficult to compare their results.  
The Oversight and Accountability Committee is charged with synthesizing the recommendations from the 2008 studies, and requested the follow-up research to assess their progress and identify gaps. 
The commissions’ recommendations to the committee and the Legislature included improving data collection, developing curricula that are more responsive to students’ cultural, historical, and contemporary experiences, and to recruit and retain more minority teachers. 
Representatives from the three commissions presented summaries on their reports and reactions to the data during a webinar hosted by the nonprofit League of Education Voters on Oct. 2. A representative of the Governor’s Office of Indian Affairs was not present. 
The Oversight and Accountability Committee’s response to the studies’ findings was generally positive, commission representatives said, though members expressed disappointment that more progress hasn’t been made. 
Last year’s standardized testing scores reflect persistent achievement gaps for several minority groups. For example, while 24.6% of white students received the lowest scores on the math assessment, the same was true for 47.6% of Black students, 53.9% of Native American students, and 56% of Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander students.
“There are student populations that need additional investment,” state Superintendent Chris Reykdal said when the scores were released last month. “Those kinds of investments have moved the needle, which is great, but the gap is still very large,” he added. 
Data difficulties
The 2008 studies conducted by the Commission of Asian Pacific American Affairs and the Commission on Hispanic Affairs did not distinguish between countries of origin or ethnic identities within their targeted populations. The Commission of African American Affairs has also acknowledged the need to disaggregate data on student demographics, which was not achieved with its 2008 study.  
“We know that the Latino community is not a monolith, but it is treated as such in our data sets. And by doing so, we cannot track short-term progress, we cannot track long-term systemic change, and we need to be able to do those two things to ensure that Hispanic and Latino students feel supported,” said María Sigüenza of the Commission on Hispanic Affairs. 
The Commission of Asian Pacific American Affairs had a similar problem with its two 2008 studies — one for Asian Americans and one for Pacific Islanders — but was able to disaggregate its population data in its new reports. Instead of grouping all Asian Americans together, for example, the study broke out the data between about 20 different ethnicities, such as Vietnamese, Chinese or Filipino. 
Because the data format ended up being so different from the 2008 studies, Nam Nguyen of the Commission on Asian Pacific American Affairs said the commission doesn’t consider them a true follow-up to the initial reports. 
“The data just doesn’t correlate with the previous work,” Nguyen said.
Focus on teacher diversity 
There was some variation between the needs of different minority groups identified by the studies, but all three commissions found that there is a strong need for more minority educators. 
Each study found that minority students feel more supported if they have a teacher who can relate to their experiences. 
“It’s so very important for all kids of color to be able to see people who look like them in the classroom for a variety of different reasons — everything from emotional support to just understanding what people go through and what the communities look like,” said Ed Prince of the Commission on African American Affairs. 
Teachers from minority groups are also better equipped to deliver culturally responsible curriculum and are less likely to “sideline” the experiences of their minority students, Prince said. 
A lack of Black educators possibly contributes to Black students being subject to discipline significantly more than their white peers. 
The League of Education Voters and the Black Education Strategy Roundtable, among other student advocacy groups, criticized a recent change in school discipline guidelines that critics said rolled back student protections that were implemented in 2019. 
“Every kid deserves to learn, and if you have a child that’s disrupting the class, that disrupts everyone,” Prince said. “But taking that kid out and having them away from the class for an hour, two hours, whatever, impacts their education.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/hs-classroom-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-10-08 07:59:05.646821

Mike Braun, left to right, on Wednesday, June 25, 2025. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Hoosiers deserve more than platitudes, conflicts of interest and unbid contracts. We deserve leaders who answer to the people, not to a select circle of insiders with the right connections. Unfortunately, the unfolding scandal at the Indiana Economic Development Corporation (IEDC) proves yet again that when politics, money, and power collide, it is everyday Hoosiers who are left footing the bill.
The recent revelations about “The Three Kings” — former IEDC executive Dave Roberts, Purdue Research Foundation President Chad Pittman, and former advisor to Gov. Mitch Daniels, Paul Mitchell — should concern every taxpayer in Indiana. Over six years, entities tied to these men collected more than $180 million in taxpayer-funded grants and no-bid contracts. These weren’t isolated missteps. They were patterns of behavior, aided and abetted by a quasi-public state agency that operated in secrecy and with little accountability.
Let us be clear: while Gov. Mike Braun’s audit may have reportedly found “no criminal activity,” that is hardly a stamp of integrity. Ethical impropriety does not need to rise to the level of criminality in order to erode public trust. Rules were clearly bent, disclosures were kept behind closed doors, and oversight was bypassed. Ordinary citizens know that if you break the rules, there are consequences. Yet when politicians or their allies do it, the refrain is always the same: “Mistakes were made, but let’s move on.”
We reject that.
IEDC forensic analysis highlights lackluster oversight and questionable spending

What message does it send if those responsible are allowed to continue cashing in on state contracts? Is the message that corruption is acceptable as long as you wear a suit and call it economic development? A factory worker who cuts corners would be fired. A farmer who failed to meet reporting requirements would lose subsidies. But insiders with access to millions in public funds are excused with a shrug. That double standard is corrosive to democracy. These findings need to be referred to the Inspector General and an investigation launched.
Braun has dubbed himself as a reformer, but his actions suggest otherwise. His administration’s first instinct was to control the narrative by hiring an out-of-state firm for nearly a million dollars to conduct a tightly managed audit, then withholding findings until after a legal review. That is not transparency; that is damage control. And when it came time to answer questions from the press, the governor literally walked away. Hoosiers see through this.
The Boone County Preservation Group cares about this issue because the IEDC was less than transparent on plans for the LEAP district in our community. The recently-released audit shows that during the review period, one-third of overall IEDC expenses went to the LEAP Project — about $495 million. Of that, $77 million went to Pure Development, which kept about $18 million for its work and paid the remainder to subcontractors. The Pure contract was awarded to them with no competition.
We believe the solution is not another round of half-measures or insider promises of “better controls.” The solution is independent oversight, free from political ties. We need further investigation from the Inspector General and an executive order banning the individuals who violated ethical norms from participating in future contracts, grants, or state business. Otherwise, bad behavior is not punished: it is rewarded.
We also believe it is time for the governor to stop pretending that this scandal is someone else’s mess. The LEAP District, the IEDC’s crown jewel, continues to swallow up farmland, deplete water resources, and saddle Hoosiers with billions in hidden costs. These deals weren’t coincidences; they happened because Indiana’s leaders, both past and present, placed secrecy and speed over accountability and stewardship.
Braun cannot phone in reform. He cannot duck out of press conferences. He cannot promise transparency with one hand while delaying reporting with the other. If he truly serves the people of Indiana, he must stand up to the very insiders who built their empire on the backs of Hoosier taxpayers.
Until that happens, we will continue to speak out. Because preserving Indiana’s farmland, our water, and our communities requires more than ribbon cuttings and glowing press releases; it requires honest leadership. And right now, that’s what’s missing at the Statehouse.

Kennedy Jr., President Donald Trump's nominee for secretary of Health and Human Services, testifies during his Senate Finance Committee confirmation hearing at the Dirksen Senate Office Building on Jan. 29, 2025, in Washington, D.C.  (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)This article first appeared on KFF Health News and is republished here under a Creative Commons Attribution-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License.
Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has floated a seismic idea: adding autism to the list of conditions covered by the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. The program, known as VICP, provides a system for families to file claims against vaccine providers in cases in which they experience severe side effects. Kennedy has also suggested broadening the definitions of two serious brain conditions — encephalopathy and encephalitis — so that autism cases could qualify.
Either move, experts warn, would unleash a flood of claims, threatening the program’s financial stability and handing vaccine opponents a powerful new talking point.
Legally, HHS “is required to undergo notice and comment rulemaking to revise the table,” said Richard Hughes, a law firm partner who teaches at George Washington University. The “table” is a list of specific injuries that the U.S. government accepts as presumed to be caused by a vaccine if those injuries occur within a certain time window. If someone can show they meet the criteria, they have a simpler path to securing compensation without having to prove fault. Autism is not in the table because a link between vaccines and autism has been thoroughly debunked.
If autism is added, Hughes explained, the VICP could face “an exorbitant number of claims that would threaten the viability of the program.”
Asked about its possible plans, an HHS spokesperson told CBS News the agency does not comment on future or potential policy decisions.
Carole Johnson, former administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration, which oversees VICP, cautioned that the system is already overburdened: “The backlog is not just a function of management, it’s built into the statute itself. That’s important context for any conversation about adding new categories of claims.”
Dorit Reiss, a law professor at the University of California College of the Law-San Francisco, said that any such change would be exploited: “This can, and likely will, be used to cast doubt on vaccines.”
Compensation without causation
The Vaccine Injury Compensation Program was born of crisis. In 1982, “Vaccine Roulette,” a television documentary, aired nationwide, alleging routine childhood shots were causing seizures, brain damage, and even sudden infant death. The program alarmed parents and triggered a surge of lawsuits against vaccine makers.
“That led to a flood of litigation against vaccine makers,” recalled Paul Offit, a pediatric infectious disease specialist and vaccine inventor at the University of Pennsylvania. “I mean, to the point that it drove them out of the business. … By the mid-1980s, there were $3.2 billion worth of lawsuits against these companies.”
Were it not for the VICP, Offit said, “We wouldn’t have vaccines for American children. The companies — it wasn’t worth it for them.”
The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 created a no-fault system. Families who believed a vaccine caused harm could file a claim; if the injury appeared on the table within a set time frame, compensation was automatic. If not, claimants could present medical evidence. The system had two purposes: provide compensation and protect the vaccine supply.
From the beginning, the table was understood not as a scientific document but as a legal tool.
“It’s a legal document and things can be included for policy reasons even if the causation evidence is weak,” Reiss said. She explained, “The program is designed to be generous, to compensate in cases of doubt.”
But, she said, “autism is not in that category. The science is clear. Adding it would be pure politics.”
This tension — between law, science, and public perception — has defined the program for nearly four decades.
What expansion would mean in practice
Since 1988, federal data shows more than 25,000 petitions to the VICP have been adjudicated; of those, 12,019 were granted compensation and 13,007 were dismissed. About 60% of compensated cases involved negotiated settlements in which HHS drew no conclusion about the cause. Over the same period, billions of vaccine doses were safely administered to millions of Americans.
Adding autism to the VICP table would change that picture overnight.
Federal estimates suggest up to 48,000 children could qualify immediately under a “profound autism” standard, with potential payouts averaging $2 million per case, at an initial cost of nearly $100 billion, followed by annual totals of about $30 billion a year — dwarfing the current $4 billion trust, a new analysis finds.
“Any case where the symptoms appeared in the past eight years and the parents blame vaccines,” Reiss said. “I don’t know how many that would be. The fund has a surplus of over $4 billion. One seriously disabled child’s care can cost millions, so a significant number, say 100,000 compensations, might exhaust it.”
Furthermore, with only eight special masters handling cases, the system would also be paralyzed by backlogs.
The stakes are not just fiscal. If the fund collapses under the weight of autism claims, vaccine makers may question whether producing vaccines for the U.S. market is worth the risk. That would mirror the crisis of the 1980s, which led to the establishment of the VICP.
Autism and the courts
In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Andrew Wakefield’s now-retracted paper alleging a link between the MMR vaccine and autism fueled a surge of VICP claims. By 2002, the VICP was swamped with petitions alleging vaccines had caused autism. The court consolidated thousands of cases into the Omnibus Autism Proceedings, selecting a handful of test cases to decide them all.
After years of hearings and expert testimony, the conclusion was unequivocal: vaccines do not cause autism. In 2010, the court ruled against petitioners on every theory of causation. The U.S. Court of Federal Claims affirmed, and the Court of Appeals upheld, the decision.
“That precedent is binding,” said Richard Hughes, a vaccine law expert at George Washington University and former VICP legal counsel. “Autism was litigated thoroughly and rejected. That still carries weight in the court today.”
The Ghost of Hannah Poling
Yet, the vaccine-autism debate has never quite faded. In 2008, the government conceded a case involving Hannah Poling, a girl with a rare mitochondrial disorder who developed autism-like symptoms after vaccination. Officials stressed the concession was specific to her condition, not evidence of a general link. But headlines told another story: “Family to Receive $1.5 Million in First-Ever Vaccine Autism Court Award.”
The Poling case fueled years of confusion.
Autism science today
The science is clearer than ever. Autism begins early in pregnancy, not in toddlerhood when most vaccines are given.
“Vaccinations … happened around the time families were recognizing symptoms of autism in their children,” said Catherine Lord, a UCLA clinical psychologist and specialist in autism diagnosis. “However, we now know that autism begins much earlier, likely as the fetus develops during pregnancy, so it cannot be an explanation.”
Peter Hotez, a pediatric infectious disease specialist and vaccine scientist at the Baylor College of Medicine who is also the father of a young adult with autism, underscores that point: “The drivers of autism are genetics and, in rare cases, environmental exposures during pregnancy, not vaccines. We’ve been over this ground for decades, and the evidence is overwhelming.”
Sarah Despres, former legal counsel to the secretary of Health and Human Services in the Biden administration and now a consultant to nonprofit organizations on immunization policy, adds that the compensation program itself is often misunderstood.
“The table was originally written as a political document,” she said. “The purpose of the program was to be swift, generous, and fair. … There would be cases that may not be caused by the vaccine but would be compensated if you went through this table injury scheme, where you don’t have to prove causation.”
What’s at risk: harm from the diseases themselves
The stakes are not abstract. Measles, one of the most contagious pathogens on Earth, spreads so efficiently that one infected child can transmit it to 90% of susceptible contacts. Before vaccinations began in the 1960s, measles sickened hundreds of thousands annually in the U.S., killing hundreds and causing thousands of cases of encephalitis and lifelong disability. Complications included pneumonia, brain swelling, and, in rare cases, a fatal degenerative brain disorder called subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, or SSPE, that can strike years later. This year, a school-age child in Los Angeles County died of SSPE after contracting measles in infancy, before being eligible for vaccination.
Mumps was once a near-universal childhood illness. Though often dismissed as mild, it can cause sterility in men, meningitis, and permanent hearing loss. Outbreaks on college campuses, as recently as the 2000s, showed how quickly it can return when vaccination rates slip.
Rubella, also known as German measles, is mild in most children, but can be devastating during pregnancy. Congenital Rubella Syndrome, or CRS, caused waves of tragedy before the development of the vaccine: Thousands of babies each year were born blind, deaf, with heart defects, or with intellectual disabilities. In medical texts, autism itself is listed as one of CRS’ sequelae, or possible consequences — proof that rubella infection, not vaccination, can contribute to developmental disorders.
Measles, mumps, and rubella “are not trivial,” said Walt Orenstein, former head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s immunization program. “Fever, high fever, is common … and they have frequent complications.”
And yet, as these diseases fade from living memory, a counternarrative has gained traction. On Sept. 29, the nonprofit Physicians for Informed Consent, a group that disputes the scientific consensus on vaccines, announced it had mailed its “Silver Booklet” on vaccine safety to every member of Congress, as well as to President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance. The book claims that “vaccines are not proven to be safer than the diseases they intend to prevent,” and calls on federal leaders to punish states that restrict vaccine exemptions. (The booklet isn’t free. The group sells copies for $25 on Amazon.)
Scientists say this framing misrepresents the basic math of risk. “Measles is one of the most important infectious diseases in human history,” notes “Plotkin’s Vaccines,” the field’s authoritative textbook. “The widespread use of measles vaccines in the late 20th and early 21st centuries led to a further marked reduction in measles deaths. Measles vaccination averted an estimated 31.7 million deaths from 2000 to 2020.”
Kennedy’s possible move to expand the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program hinges on casting doubt — on suggesting that science is unsettled, that vaccines may be riskier than diseases.
“One tactic used to argue that vaccines cause autism is the use of compensation decisions from the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program to claim such a link,” said Reiss of UC Law-San Francisco. “Even the cases that most closely address the question of vaccines and autism do not show the link that opponents claim exists, and many of the cases used are misrepresented and misused.”
Offit underscores the danger on the perception side. “When people see the Vaccine Injury Compensation program, they assume that any money that is given is because there was a vaccine injury,” he said.
Kathryn Edwards, an expert in pediatric infectious diseases and vaccine safety at Vanderbilt University, said, “Expanding compensation for issues that are not clearly related to vaccines … suggests that these conditions are related to vaccines when they are not.” She compared it to the removal of thimerosal, a preservative dropped from most childhood vaccines to ease public fears, despite no evidence of harm. “Now, we are still suffering from that action.”
Public health experts stress that such narratives invert reality. The very diseases being downplayed once killed or disabled tens of thousands of American children each year. As pediatrician, psychiatrist, and medical historian Howard Markel put it: “Back a hundred years ago, everybody lost a kid or knew a kid who died of one of these diseases. … We never conquer germs, we wrestle them to a draw. That’s the best we do. And so this is a real … handicap to the other side, the microbes who live to infect.”
Families and the future
The hardest voices to reckon with are those of families. Parents of autistic children often feel abandoned — unsupported by disability programs, exhausted by care needs, searching for answers. Kennedy’s appeal to them is emotional, not scientific.
Reiss noted that families deserve far more support but argues that it shouldn’t come through VICP.
“The program is to award compensation to those injured by vaccines,” she said. “We should have more direct support — disability funding, disability aid. Kennedy has been taking HHS in the opposite direction, cutting services where we need more.”
Despres made the same point: “The goal of the program really was if there’s a close call, we’re going to err on the side of compensation. … And it’s really important that everyone understands that compensation does not mean that the vaccine actually caused the injury. … And I think we have seen statistics around the compensation program misused by those who would want to sow distrust in vaccines, to say vaccines are unsafe, when in fact … that’s not what this is.”
UCLA’s Lord urged a shift in focus. “For the last 50 years, science has focused on the biological causes of autism, which has led to great progress, especially in genetics,” she said. Of Secretary Kennedy, she said, “He could help more by acknowledging the value of science, but also the need to better attend to the actual lives of autistic people and their families.”
What comes next?
If Kennedy decides to move forward with such a plan, HHS would need to draft a rule, open it to public comment, and then defend the change in court. The pushback will be fierce: from scientists, from public health leaders, and from families who fear being misled yet again.
The debate over adding autism to the Vaccine Injury Table is not just a policy debate. The program was built on the principle of compensation without causation, a fragile balance designed to sustain both trust and supply. Adding autism could collapse that distinction entirely.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Newsmakers)Condemned man Roy Lee Ward has withdrawn the final two federal lawsuits that sought to delay his execution, effectively guaranteeing that his death sentence will be carried out before sunrise Friday at the Indiana State Prison in Michigan City.
Ward’s decision ends months of last-minute litigation over how Indiana carries out executions and the lethal injection drugs the state uses. The dismissals close the window for courts to intervene, with the exception of last-minute relief from the U.S. Supreme Court. The nation’s high court justices denied such efforts ahead of the state’s previous two executions.
The 44-year-old Ward was convicted and sentenced to death for the 2001 rape and murder of 15-year-old Stacy Payne in Spencer County.

Gov. Mike Braun, following a recommendation from the Indiana Parole Board, denied Ward clemency in late September.
State officials have not said how much was paid for the most recent three sets of lethal injection drugs purchased by the Department of Correction in recent months, however. 
At least one of those sets of pentobarbital is expected to be used for Ward’s execution. Any unused drugs will expire at the end of the month, according to new court documents.
The governor previously disclosed that state officials spent $1.175 million on lethal injection doses over the past year — $600,000 of which was spent by former Gov. Eric Holcomb’s administration on drugs that expired before use. The cost has been between $275,000 and $300,000 per dose.
But neither the governor’s office nor the DOC has responded to multiple questions from the Indiana Capital Chronicle the last 10 days about the price paid for the latest rounds of pentobarbital.
Federal lawsuits dismissed
In an Oct. 2 filing, the Indiana Attorney General’s Office and Ward’s legal team jointly notified the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Indiana that they had resolved the death row inmate’s challenges.
Public defender Joanna Green told the Capital Chronicle the agreement “ensures compliance” with the prison’s written execution protocol.
Ward’s legal team had raised concerns about the state’s drug-handling procedures, including storage temperatures, the source and quality of pentobarbital, and whether the DOC followed its own internal directives after irregularities were reported during Benjamin Ritchie’s execution in May.
‘Violent’ moment during Indiana execution draws scrutiny; DOC officials deny ‘botched’ process

“After discovery, the parties came to an agreement that ensures compliance with the protocol and ensures, to the extent possible, Mr. Ward’s execution is not problematic given what happened in Mr. Ritchie’s execution,” she said, referring to accounts from Ritchie’s execution in which witnesses reported seeing the inmate lurch violently against his restraints after the injection began. 
DOC officials denied those reports, however, and maintained that “the execution was completed according to protocol.” No members of the media were permitted to witness Ritchie’s execution.
Court filings additionally outline, for the first time, how DOC acquired, transported, and stored the lethal drug used in the state’s two most recent executions.
DOC confirmed that the pentobarbital to be used in Ward’s execution is manufactured, not compounded. The state said in interrogatory responses that the drug was produced by a pharmaceutical manufacturer and distributed “without any post-manufacturing customizations.”
Attorneys for Ward and other death row prisoners have argued that compounded pentobarbital degrades quickly and can lose effectiveness or become contaminated because it is mixed in small batches by compounding pharmacies rather than manufactured under conditions regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
Manufactured pentobarbital is produced in sterile facilities under federal quality controls, with longer shelf lives and stricter oversight than compounded alternatives, according to court filings.
DOC indicated that each entity that handled or transported the drug kept it between 20 and 25 degrees Celsius, or about 68 to 77 degrees Fahrenheit. The drugs were not shipped through the U.S. Mail or by commercial carriers such as UPS or FedEx; instead, DOC employees personally retrieved them from a pharmacy and transported them to the state prison.
The pentobarbital arrived in a sealed cardboard box with a Styrofoam container inside. The vials were in a cardboard holder marked with the manufacturer’s label and accompanied by inventory slips and certificates of analysis.
Story continues below.
Temp Logs
 
Each vial was labeled by the original producer, and DOC officials said they possess certificates of analysis for every vial that will be used Friday.
Documents also show the vials of pentobarbital are kept on prison grounds in a locked safe secured by three separate locks. Only three prison employees can open the safe. 
Temperatures are checked daily with a thermometer and logged, and the drugs are kept in an environment “suitable for storage,” the state said.
Even so, defense attorneys pointed to potential temperature discrepancies in January and February, when DOC logs showed several consecutive days of storage conditions outside the recommended range — some days as low as 62 F. Green said those fluctuations “may have affected the drugs used” in Ritchie’s execution.
An updated sworn declaration filed by Indiana State Prison Warden Ron Neal also clarified that all three sets of pentobarbital now held by the DOC expire at the end of October.
Earlier, Neal testified that one batch might not expire until March 2026, but he said that was based on an incorrect manufacturing date.
Grievances denied, too
Ward had also filed internal offender grievances asking the DOC to modify the execution chamber — specifically objecting to the capacity of the witness room, the glass partition separating it from the chamber, and the placement of the inmate’s gurney. He also sought to have more witnesses present.
Green said prison officials refused to change the witness chamber, meaning “the witnesses cannot hear Roy and Roy cannot see his witnesses” — as was the case for Ritchie, and for Joseph Corcoran, who was executed at the state prison in December.
State law does not provide access for journalists to witness executions unless invited by the condemned person. A federal lawsuit challenging that restriction is still pending. The Indiana Capital Chronicle is a plaintiff in the case.
The Capital Chronicle witnessed Corcoran’s execution in December but was not invited for Ritchie’s. It remains unclear whether Ward has finalized his witness list.
Per Indiana statute, attendance at executions is limited to: the warden, a warden’s designated assistant, the prison physician, another physician, a spiritual advisor, a prison chaplain, five friends or relatives of the inmate and eight members of the victim’s family.
Final execution preparations
Ward’s execution will be Indiana’s second this year and the third since the state resumed executions after more than a decade’s hiatus.

The state prison’s execution team trains monthly, practicing IV insertions on both volunteers and medical training arms, with practices increasing as an execution nears.
According to discovery records, the execution team conducts regular walkthroughs of the chamber and equipment in the final days before an execution. The DOC confirmed that the condemned inmate undergoes a medical evaluation and weekly vein assessments, while the gurney, IV tubing, and other equipment are inspected and calibrated. The chamber is cleaned and checked daily during the final week.
State filings further show that communication systems connecting the prison to the governor’s office and Indiana Supreme Court are tested, and that DOC staff conduct trial runs to confirm that the separate viewing areas for victims’ families, defense witnesses and state officials function properly.
In the final weeks, prison officials also meet with the inmate to review the lethal injection process, witness lists and options for spiritual counsel or last words.
Three members of the team are responsible for administering the drug through an approximately five- to six-foot IV line, according to the latest court filings.
Those individuals are kept anonymous, and each is trained to administer the drug as part of a coordinated three-person team.

Photo by Peter de Sibour, courtesy of Explore Minnesota.Minnesota is home to one of the most extraordinary landscapes in the world: the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness. 
With more than 1,100 lakes and some of the cleanest water on the planet, BWCA is America’s  most visited federally-designated wilderness area — and central to our state’s identity and outdoor heritage.
And yet, it remains seemingly perpetually threatened. Corporate greed, foreign mining interests, and the whims of lawmakers have placed the Boundary Waters in the crosshairs time and time again. This year has been a year of nonstop tumult for the Boundary Waters. 
Just when we were in the homestretch for permanently protecting Canoe Country, the Trump administration vowed to greenlight sulfide-ore copper mining in its headwaters. The danger has never been greater. D.C politicians who are friendly with foreign mining conglomerate Antofagasta (which owns Twin Metals Minnesota) have introduced legislation to reverse the 20-year ban we received less than three years ago and plan to reinstate mining permits. 
Minnesotans know better. Across party lines, they value the Boundary Waters as a treasure worth protecting permanently. Polling shows that nearly 70% of Minnesotans support legislation to ban sulfide-ore copper mining in the watershed. We understand what’s at stake:

Environmental impact: Sulfide-ore copper mining is among the most toxic forms of mining, producing acid mine drainage that leaches heavy metals into surrounding waters. All copper mines pollute, and we have never had this kind of mining in our state — sulfide-ore copper mining is nothing like the taconite or iron-ore mining our state is accustomed to. In a water-rich environment like the Boundary Waters, with its low buffering capacity, pollution would spread quickly through interconnected lakes and streams. The strict “no degradation” standard for the Boundary Waters cannot coexist with copper mining in this region.
Economics: The Boundary Waters sustains a thriving outdoor recreation economy that supports 17,000 jobs and generates over $1 billion in annual revenue in northeastern Minnesota. Risking this sustainable economy for a foreign-owned mine that would pollute and leave toxic waste for generations is reckless.
Legacy: For over 100 years, the Boundary Waters has been intentionally protected — just as America has protected icons like the Grand Canyon. This is not the place to experiment with toxic mining. It is a national treasure that deserves permanent protection.

We can defend hard-won victories by electing Boundary Waters champions who can take on new threats head-on, and keep driving toward one clear goal: permanent protection of the entire Boundary Waters watershed, safe from the whims of any administration or Congress.
The good news is Minnesota is a backstop for the Boundary Waters. 
Gov. Tim Walz has called the Boundary Waters the crown jewel of the Upper Midwest, and under his leadership, state agencies have worked to uphold environmental protections. 
But the Legislature must go further by passing the Boundary Waters Permanent Protection Bill (HF 309 / SF 875). This legislation would ban copper-nickel mining in the watershed and prevent permits for this dangerous industry.
We can’t do it without lawmakers who understand the value of the Boundary Waters and the need to protect it. 
That is why the Save the Boundary Waters Action Fund — the 501c4 political arm of the coalition to Save the Boundary Waters — has strengthened its election program. Founded in 2018, Save the Boundary Waters Action Fund exists to help elect pro–Boundary Waters candidates. Join us October 23rd at the Loppet Trailhead from 6-8pm, where we’ll discuss strategy to prepare for the 2026 midterms. 
These elections will shape the future of the Boundary Waters by determining the balance of power in the Legislature. If we want permanent protection, we must send more champions to St. Paul who will defend Minnesota’s most treasured Wilderness.
Protecting the Boundary Waters from sulfide-ore copper mining isn’t radical. It’s practical, it’s popular, and it’s about safeguarding our clean water, our economy and our way of life. 
With the Boundary Waters under threat yet again, Minnesotans have a clear choice: stand with foreign mining billionaires, or stand with the people of Minnesota and the generations to come.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/canoeing-in-the-boundary-waters-_428149_peter-de-sibour-1024x725.jpg,,,2025-10-08 07:59:05.646821

Ryan Clancy (D-Milwaukee) speaks before a vote on a housing-related bill in the state Assembly Tuesday. (Screenshot/WisEye)A group of housing bills that Republican lawmakers have fast-tracked since they were first announced two weeks ago made it through the Wisconsin Assembly Tuesday — most with unanimous support, but not without criticism from Democrats.
In a floor speech before the Assembly began voting Tuesday, Rep. Kalan Haywood (D-Milwaukee), assistant minority leader, said the GOP housing package fell short of what might have been possible with bipartisan discussion.
“While there is support for many of these bills on our side, we are by no means satisfied,” Haywood said.
Haywood complimented the Republican chair of the Assembly’s Housing and Real Estate committee, Rep. Robert Brooks (R-Saukville), for his “willingness to listen and work together.”
He described bills enacted in the 2023-24 session as “a bipartisan housing package that we could build on this session,” and said that in the spring, bipartisan work had begun on a new round of bills, accompanied by “honest communication with both sides and with stakeholders.”
Those discussions stopped abruptly in June, Haywood said, and when the bills came out two weeks ago the results were “half baked.”
“There are some good things in these bills that may help create some additional housing, but we could have done much more,” Haywood said.
A series of procedural votes on the floor Tuesday surrounding one bill — AB 455, creating a grant program for condominium conversions from multi-family homes — was emblematic of the gap between how Democrats and Republicans viewed not just the legislation but the larger issue of housing.
In the Housing and Real Estate Committee meeting Friday, Oct. 3, Rep. Ryan Clancy (D-Milwaukee) managed to persuade three Republicans to join the panel’s Democrats to pass an amendment that expanded the bill to include housing cooperatives, not just condominiums.  
After the amendment was adopted, Sen. Steve Nass (R-Whitewater) sent an email written in red to all state lawmakers of both parties, mocking Clancy’s amendment as applying to “communes” and criticizing its Republican supporters.
When the bill reached the floor Tuesday, the original author, Rep. Dave Murphy (R-Greenville), submitted a rewrite, known as a substitute amendment.
The rewrite included another amendment, from Democrat, Rep. Lori Palmeri (D-Oshkosh), giving tenants of a building being converted to condos the right of first refusal to purchase their residence. But it omitted the Clancy amendment.
“We had a brief and awesome moment of bipartisanship this last week, and then we had an all red email from Senator Nass,” Clancy said on the Assembly floor. “I did not realize that my Republican colleagues were beholden to him and not even their own leadership there.”
The substitute amendment, Clancy said, would “strike out this bipartisan amendment and just turn it into another handout to developers.”
Brooks, the housing committee chair, had announced at the Republican press conference before the floor session that cooperatives would be stripped out, calling the approach “very difficult to manage because of the financing mechanisms and other things.”
Clancy said he would vote for the legislation despite the removal of his amendment. “But it is so disappointing to have to do that because we had something better in front of us,” he added.
The bill, like most of the bills up for a vote Tuesday, passed on a voice vote.
Others that passed with broad support included AB 424, updating requirements for the rental of mobile and manufactured homes; AB 451, allowing cities and villages to designate residential tax incremental districts to help fund infrastructure improvements; AB 452, allowing land subdividers to certify their designs and public improvements comply with state requirements; and AB 456, making a variety of changes to real estate transaction practices.
A handful of measures labeled as housing bills passed with little or no support from Democrats.
AB 453 would require local communities to grant rezoning requests for housing developers if they meet certain conditions, including that the area is projected as residential in the community’s comprehensive plan. The party-line vote was 55-39.
Rep. Mike Bare (D-Verona) said the measure fell short of what could have been done and that it lacked funding for local governments that would have to bear the cost it would impose. The bill’s author. Rep. David Armstrong (R-Rice Lake) vowed to seek funding in the next state budget.
AB 450 would put off the effective date of Wisconsin’s updated commercial building code until April 1, 2026. Originally blocked in 2023, the new code was reinstated by the the Department of Safety and Professional Services (DSPS) after a state Supreme Court ruling this July held that state laws allowing the Legislature to block executive branch administrative rules indefinitely were unconstitutional.
The current effective date is Nov. 1.
Rep. William Penterman (R-Hustisford) said delaying the code further was needed “for clarity” because builders had been planning projects under the previous code.
After the GOP majority rejected an attempt by Democrats to replace the bill with language that increased funding for DSPS on a 54-41 party-line vote, the legislation passed on a voice vote — but with substantial, audible cries of “No” from Democrats.
AB 366 would allow landlords to demand a written statement from a licensed health professional attesting to a tenant’s need for an emotional support animal.
“There are numerous people that have contacted us about the fraudulent means of how you can get a service dog,” state Rep. Paul Tittl (R-Manitowoc), said at a Republican press conference before the floor session.
On the floor, Clancy criticized the bill for potentially harming people for whom emotional support animals are a necessity but who are unable to see  a health professional.
“To the extent that there is a problem, where we want to actually certify that some animals are supportive and some are not, we can fix that problem,” Clancy said. “But that requires actually talking to the stakeholders before taking pen to paper.”

(Getty Images)Indiana’s colleges and universities won’t see new state incentive dollars this biennium for their performance on pre-set student success goals, but higher education officials said progress on key goals — especially for low-income students — is continuing.
A recent review by the Indiana Commission for Higher Education detailed how public institutions performed under the state’s Outcomes-Based Performance Funding (OBPF) formula, a model to tie a small portion of higher education appropriations to enrollment, degree completion and graduate retention, among other metrics.
But under Indiana’s latest budget, no new outcome-based dollars will be distributed until at least the next budget cycle.

The “Operating Prospective” line item — the pot of money dedicated to outcomes-based performance — was left unfunded in the current 2026–27 biennium. Also on hold are “bonus allocations” that were additionally intended to reward institutions that exceed goals in specific metrics by redistributing portions of funds not initially earned.
The freeze comes amid what state officials have called one of the tightest higher-education budgets in recent years. Lawmakers approved across-the-board 5% reductions to colleges’ operating appropriations and kept funding for debt service and repair-and-rehabilitation flat, meaning campuses will have to absorb rising costs without additional state support.
Brooke Kile, the commission’s senior associate commissioner for business solutions, emphasized during a Sept. 18 meeting in Jasper that even without new dollars, the commission will “continue to look at these metrics, continue to highlight them, showcase them, so that institutions know where they have opportunities to improve.”
Outgoing Commissioner Chris Lowery additionally said CHE staff will keep the outcomes work front-and-center despite budget cuts.
“This was a very challenging budget year,” Lowery said. “In spite of it not receiving specific funding, this staff will not forget that this is one of the chief priorities of this body.”
How schools performed
Indiana adopted the system in 2023 to link a portion of university funding to progress on outcomes such as enrolling and graduating more low-income and adult students, improving on-time degree completion, and increasing retention of graduates in Indiana. Each institution’s targets are different.
“Basically what outcome-based performance funding does is tie a portion of the state appropriation to the higher education institutions’ performance,” Kile said. “It’s a way to incentivize strong performance in areas that are important to the commission and important to the state.”
Despite the lack of funding, commission staff calculated what share of dollars each campus would have earned had incentive dollars been available. 
In the previous budget, the prospective incentive pool totaled roughly $34 million statewide.
CHE ultimately distributed more than $11.3 million in incentive funding across the public institutions in fiscal year 2024 — the maximum available — and about $16.7 million from a potential pool of roughly $22.7 million in fiscal year 2025.
In the most recent cycle:

Indiana University’s campuses earned $3,751,379, or 63% of the $5,931,768 available
Purdue University’s campuses earned $4,896,277, or 82% of the $5,981,634 available
Ball State University earned $1,915,358, or 72% of the $2,660,219 available
Indiana State University earned $1,035,535, or 70% of the $1,489,979 available
University of Southern Indiana earned $709,429, or 70% of the $1,020,760 available
Vincennes University earned $711,606, or 80% of the $889,508 available
Ivy Tech Community College earned $3,722,975, or 79% of the $4,702,207 available 

Commission staff did not release dollar equivalents for the new budget cycle, but the latest data reflect what share of funding each institution would have earned if dollars had been available.
Ivy Tech Community College led all systems with 100% of incentive funding earned, meaning it met or exceeded all of its weighted targets. Ivy Tech’s separate formula places more emphasis on workforce-aligned credentials and short-term certificates tied to employer demand.
The University of Southern Indiana followed at 75%, showing steady progress in low-income enrollment and on-time degree completion. Ball State University earned 70%, buoyed by improved retention and increases in low-income student completions.
Story continues below.
7.1-OBPF-Metric-Goals-and-Data-2025-Final
 
Among regional and research systems, the Indiana University system achieved 59%, with campuses like IU Kokomo and IU Southeast outperforming in low-income completions, though Bloomington lagged in adult and STEM-related metrics. 
Vincennes University earned 62%, boosted by credential production among adult learners, but held back by slower progress on retention. Indiana State University scored 50%, reflecting modest gains in enrollment but ongoing challenges in completion and graduate retention.
The Purdue University system earned the lowest share, 32%, with its West Lafayette and regional campuses missing benchmarks in adult enrollment and degree completions. 
Commission staff said Purdue’s scores partly reflect its already-high baseline of degree attainment and smaller pool of in-state adult learners.
More work ahead
The percentages represent how much of each institution’s weighted goals were achieved across eight categories: low-income youth enrollment; adult enrollment; on-time degree completion; overall degree completion; low-income student completion; adult completion; STEM completion; and overall graduate retention.
Degree completions are top performance goals set for Indiana’s public colleges and universities

Ivy Tech’s separate formula places more emphasis on completion of workforce-aligned credentials and short-term certificates.
Statewide, the strongest results were related to low-income students. According to the latest commission data, institutions met or partially met 80% of targets for low-income youth enrollment and 61% of targets for low-income completion.
But graduate retention remained the weakest area, with just 21% of goals achieved statewide.
“We’re very pleased — not satisfied, but pleased — to see these continue to grow,” Kile said. She added that progress is particularly encouraging given the sharp decline in college-going rates among low-income Hoosiers over the past decade.
Lowery agreed, noting that declining college-going rates were “almost exclusively in low-income students,” and that “to see those areas of progress being made — pleased, not satisfied — is really important.”
Kile emphasized that the commission plans to keep refining its data and targets.
“We want to make sure that institutions have something to stretch toward, reach toward,” she said, “but also understand they need some reliability in planning their operational expenses.”

Jeff Landry. 

Surgeon General Ralph Abraham, a Landry appointee who oversees the state’s public health efforts, said at a news conference Tuesday his staff was “not going to do anything” to promote the vaccine. The state health department didn’t hold flu vaccine events last fall either during Landry’s first year in office. 
It’s a departure from practice for Louisiana’s health agency, which held mass flu vaccine events for several years under previous governors, both Democratic and Republican. 
The state health department staged flu vaccine drives every fall long before the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, when the public became more skeptical overall of immunizations. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Abraham said he doesn’t favor mass flu vaccine events because they don’t allow for what he described as “informed consent” for a patient. The surgeon general works part-time as a primary care physician in a rural northeast Louisiana health clinic and has expressed skepticism about the efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccine. 

Abraham explained “informed consent” as the ability for a doctor to explain the benefits and drawbacks of a vaccine with a patient before the person makes a decision about getting vaccinated. 

“I’m not an anti-flu vaxxer. I gave six or eight flu vaccines in the clinic yesterday when the patients asked for them,” the surgeon general said. 
“I work in the poorest part of the state. That doesn’t mean my patients are not smart. They are very intelligent, and when given the right data, they can make the right decision,” he added. 
But Abraham highlighted a CIeveland Clinic study on the flu vaccine that has been bolstered by vaccine skeptics. 
Researchers looked at data from over 53,000 health care employees at the Cleveland Clinic Health System and found that vaccinated participants had a higher rate of flu infection during the 2024 flu season. 

Yet a Cleveland Clinic spokeswoman told PolitFact and several other news organizations that it would be inappropriate to doubt the flu vaccine effectiveness based on the 2024 research paper. 

Among other factors, the study did not evaluate whether a flu vaccination reduced severe illness or death in Cleveland Clinic employees who contracted the flu, a primary purpose of immunization. The pool of study participants also included very few elderly people or those with compromised immune systems, according to experts, which may have skewed its results. 
Tens of thousands of Americans die from the flu every year, and 2024 was a particular deadly year for children who contracted the virus. The U.S. saw more flu-related deaths in children last year than in the previous decade and a half, according to the Associated Press. 

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention counted more than 100 children last year who were diagnosed with a rare brain inflammation from the flu that can lead to seizures and hallucinations. Very few of the children who developed the complication were vaccinated, the Associated Press reported. 
The federal government has not changed its recommendations for the flu vaccine this year in spite of confusion over vaccine policy in general coming from the Trump administration. The CDC still recommends most people 6 months and older receive the flu vaccine, which is available as a shot and in a new mist form. 
Seniors, pregnant women, young children and people with chronic health problems such as asthma, diabetes and heart disease are particularly vulnerable to getting a severe case of the flu. The vaccine primarily lessens symptoms of the illness in people who contract the virus and won’t necessarily prevent an infection. 
The Louisiana Department of Health also still describes the flu vaccine as “the best and most effective way” to prevent the seasonal flu on its website, in spite of pulling back from vaccine events and public immunization campaigns.

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)There are moments in public life when policy decisions unfold not as abstractions, but as ruptures in the lives of ordinary people.
Oklahoma now stands in the midst of such a rupture. As the state’s mental health authority threatens significant cuts in its review of nearly 800 provider contracts — while withholding details of just how deep the reductions will go — one truth remains certain: residents will feel the consequences in ways too personal and too devastating to be tallied on any spreadsheet.
This is not a routine adjustment in bureaucratic machinery. It is the hollowing out of an already fragile system, stripping away what has long been treated as low-hanging fruit: the very lifelines that keep struggling families afloat. Behind every threatened contract is the prospect of a shuttered support group, a canceled counseling session and a phone that would no longer ring when someone reaches out for help.
The justification for these cuts has been framed as fiscal necessity: “the state cannot spend more than it has.” That reasoning, on its face, carries a certain inevitability.
But the deeper issue is what these choices reveal about priorities.
Mental health is treated as optional, expendable. That’s a misguided view in a state where nearly every Oklahoman feels the consequences of inadequate mental health resources.
The idea that there simply isn’t enough money ignores an inconvenient truth: lawmakers have repeatedly voted to reduce the state’s own revenue through tax cuts. It’s not that Oklahoma can’t afford to invest in mental health — it’s that the majority of elected officials have chosen not to.
Yet mental illness does not recede when budgets tighten. Addiction does not pause while ledgers are reconciled. The need only grows, silently, insistently, until it spills into public view through overcrowded jails, emergency rooms filled to capacity, and families breaking under the strain of untreated suffering.
The decision to move forward with contract reductions amounts to a gamble with human lives. Providing only weeks of notice before dismantling long-standing programs ensures that communities are left scrambling with little time to create alternatives or cushion the blow.
Smaller providers, often those most deeply embedded in local neighborhoods, may not survive at all. What disappears with them is not just a line on a budget but a relationship of trust painstakingly built over years.
The effects will ripple outward.
Schools will see the difference in students whose anxiety and trauma go unaddressed. Hospitals will absorb the weight as psychiatric beds become the default option for those with nowhere else to go. Law enforcement will shoulder the burden, left to manage crisis after crisis on the streets without the tools, training, or support that real mental health resources could provide.
Framing these cuts as fiscal discipline is short-sighted. Every dollar “saved” today will cost more down the line — in police response, in emergency care, in prisons, and in the wasted potential of people who might have thrived with timely support.
What is needed now is not simply more money, but leadership willing to put mental health at the center of Oklahoma’s priorities. Mental health cannot be treated as a discretionary expense, a casualty when balance sheets grow strained. It is core infrastructure — without it, classrooms struggle, workplaces falter, hospitals overflow, and even public safety erodes.
There remains a narrow window to change course, but it would require state leaders to summon the courage to intervene with decisive action that restores stability to the system.
Oklahoma stands at a crossroads.
One path leads toward a cycle of deepening neglect. The other demands investment, foresight, and above all compassion — a recognition that the health of a society is measured by how it treats those least able to weather hardship alone.
The time for delay, equivocation, or deference to short-term arithmetic has passed. What is at stake is nothing less than the dignity and stability of thousands of lives. And in the end, those lives are the truest measure of any ledger.

(Photo by Janelle Stecklein/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Oklahoma’s secretary of energy and environment has entered the race to be the state’s next attorney general. 
Jeff Starling said his private sector background and experience as a litigator at the national level sets him apart from other candidates running for statewide office.  
“I am not a career politician looking for the next rung in the ladder,” he said. “For example, I want to go in and have a long term, four year view of the office. And if I still have something to give after four years, run for reelection. My intent is to get out of the office, I’m not using it as a rung in the ladder to keep climbing politically.”
Starling, originally from Virginia, is set to face former legislator Jon Echols in the 2026 Republican primary. Both hope to succeed Attorney General Gentner Drummond, who is running for governor.
Starling has experience as a partner at a multi-national law firm’s litigation department. He’s worked as an in-house attorney and assistant general counsel at Devon Energy, served as the chief legal and administrative officer at Lagoon Water Midstream, a water management solution group, and as a clerk for a federal judge.

Gov. Kevin Stitt appointed Starling as Oklahoma’s Energy Secretary in 2024.
Starling said he decided to run for attorney general because he wants Oklahoma to be a state where his wife and two daughters can feel safe and build their lives. After a successful career in the private sector, he said he “owes” something back. 
“I also firmly believe in sort of a Founding Fathers’ vision, that private sector people need to lend their voice to public sector service, and that the public service is a service, it’s not a career,” Starling said. “And if you’ve been blessed with successful private sector experience and you’ve done well, then you owe something back.”
Starling said his priorities would include eradicating illegal marijuana grows, ensuring all people are treated equally under the law, and protecting the “unborn” and the Second Amendment. 
Rather than eliminating illegal marijuana grows one by one, Starling said his approach would be to utilize federal tools like the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act to “pull out these criminal enterprises root and branch and end them once and for all.”
“We have some of the strongest laws in the nation protecting the unborn and defending our Second Amendment rights, and it’s very important that the Attorney General stand in defense of those rights, and I will do that,” he said.

Joint effort brings students out to experience harvest of an animal that will be shared with elders and families. “This is your relative,” herd manager tells them.
The post On Wind River Reservation, a buffalo harvest for young and old appeared first on WyoFile .","WIND RIVER RESERVATION—The shot rang out, and the buffalo collapsed on a slope of silvery green sagebrush still damp from the previous night’s rain. 
The rest of the herd, in a field below, startled and then began milling. The lumbering animals slowly organized, moving toward the fallen bull. They surrounded the body, nudging and prodding it as if they were urging the bull to stand back up and join them. 
“This is the most heartfelt part,” Jackie White, Food Bank of Wyoming’s tribal relations specialist and a member of the Northern Arapaho Tribe, said from her vantage point in a nearby truck. This is how buffalo behave after a harvest, she said. It’s like they are mourning.

Later, after the bull’s body had been attached to a special trailer lift and transported to a patch of ground closer to the field, White stood before a group of sixth grade students from Arapahoe Schools to talk about the significance of the harvest. 
“We pray for that sacred buffalo that gave his life so we can have life,” she said. The animal will be carefully processed to waste as little as possible, she said. The meat will be ground, packed and eventually placed in more than 650 boxes that food banks will distribute to Wind River Reservation residents in November. 
Elders will also receive chokecherry jam in the November boxes. The jam comes from an August harvest of the berries, a cherished traditional foodstuff of the tribes, picked in Colorado. The effort yielded 300 pounds of chokecherries, which were sorted and frozen. White will be in Longmont later this week to help prepare the jam. 
Having traditional foods in the November boxes is an important way to celebrate Native American Heritage Month, White said. 
“I wanted something special for our elders,” she said. “We have so much love and respect for our elders. They are our knowledge keepers.”

This week’s buffalo harvests, which took place Monday and Tuesday, also doubled as a way to educate Native youth on traditions. 
Nathan Friday, who harvested the bull Monday morning at the Northern Arapaho buffalo site, burned cedar in a ceramic vessel. Jason Baldes, Wind River Tribal Buffalo Initiative Executive Officer, invited the students to “cedar” — a ritual that involves kneeling in the smoke — before paying tribute to the animal with a physical gesture.
“Even if you don’t help later, I want you to come up right now and touch that buffalo,” said Baldes, who manages the Eastern Shoshone herd. “Because this is your relative.”
One by one, the kids knelt on the ground, smudged themselves with smoke and then walked to the buffalo to rest one or two hands on its thick coffee-colored hide.

This is the second year of fall buffalo harvests in conjunction with food bank distribution. 
On Monday at the Northern Arapaho buffalo site, Cottonwoods flashed orange and gold on the banks of the Wind River, which ran a muddy red in the wake of a storm that smeared nearby peaks with snow. About 40 students, along with teachers, Buffalo Initiative staff and volunteers, participated in the harvest.

A second harvest followed Tuesday from the Eastern Shoshone’s herd side, with students bused from Fort Washakie to participate. 
The events connect several important Native threads, White said. The first is the traditional knowledge of elders. The second is the work of the Buffalo Initiative — a nonprofit started in 2022 that has worked to return buffalo herds to the tribes — which dovetails with tribal food sovereignty goals. The third is the transfer of knowledge and skills to youth. 
“This is really something significant for us,” White said. “So we all come together to help educate our youth. It is our hope and our prayers that our kids will take something good with them so they will continue to learn the culture and the traditions and how significant that sacred buffalo is to us.”

In that vein, she said, it’s more than a harvest. It’s a prayer, a ceremony and a learning experience.
Ancestors 
Eastern Shoshone members Jason and Patti Baldes started the Tribal Buffalo Initiative to catalyze reconnection to buffalo. Both tribes have a buffalo site, and herds have grown since the early days. 
On Monday, well over 100 buffalo occupied a field on the Arapaho site. Adult buffalo grazed while the lighter-colored calves lay partially obscured by yellow grass. 
The animals’ meat, hides and bones were key to the survival of the Northern Arapaho Tribe, the tribe’s Buffalo Manager Dennis O’Neal said. “We’re here today because of them … They don’t need us, but we need them.”

Though buffalo are no longer crucial for shelter and subsistence, O’Neal said, for modern Indians the animal provides both healthy food and an opportunity to get outside and exercise. The bull harvested Monday will feed a lot of people, he said. 
Harvesting a herd member, O’Neal said, “we don’t take it lightly.” 
The buffalo is in the songs, ceremonies and lodges of tribal people, Baldes told the students, stressing the gravity of the event to them. 
“This buffalo … he’s been missing from your lives for a long time. Been missing from our lives for a long time,” Baldes said. “We’re all very fortunate that this buffalo relative is still here for us.” 
For the most part, the middle-school-aged kids did not goof off or squirm. After they each had a turn touching the buffalo, field dressing began. The animal’s blood was spilled into a large cup. As several adults set to work skinning the buffalo, the students passed the cup around. Most drank from it.

After decades of cuts, the Wyoming Department of Health has already found ways to serve the state’s most vulnerable populations on a tight budget, the Healthy Wyoming board writes.
The post With health care access under attack, Wyoming lawmakers should be seeking solutions appeared first on WyoFile .","Wyoming residents are facing the steepest increases in health care costs in decades. 

Opinion

So you would expect state lawmakers to focus their time and energy on ways to help — and better yet, to find solutions that improve health care access and affordability in our state. Instead, a recent legislative subcommittee meeting focused on dissecting the Wyoming Department of Health budget to find suspected “hidden” funds to cut or redirect.
It was abundantly clear during the meeting that after decades of budget cuts, the health department has been incredibly creative in finding efficiencies to preserve essential services to our state’s most vulnerable populations. Cuts to the department, while costs are going up, would mean closing clinics just as thousands are about to lose insurance. That would be a terrible decision that would harm individuals and the health care system we all need to stay healthy. 
Right now, the health department spends less than 8% of its budget on administration. The remaining funds go directly to services for impoverished children, low-income pregnant women, veterans, children and adults with disabilities, people with mental illness and elderly folks who need support. The subcommittee is learning that the department’s budget is closely studied and justified every budget year, and there is no hidden waste to produce great savings. The department is doing its best to be responsible stewards of state resources and maintain critical health care services that Wyoming communities need.
But the subcommittee is not exclusively focused on cuts. The Joint Appropriations Committee requested these five additional days of meetings, in part to look at ways to increase the Developmental Disability waivers program budget and to consider how to use funding Wyoming will likely receive as part of the federal Rural Health Transformation fund.
At Healthy Wyoming, we absolutely agree that the Department of Health can justify additional funding to increase access to Developmental Disability waivers and decrease the length of time that families must wait to get support for their loved ones. But it should not come at the cost of cutting other programs. We believe that mothers — of all incomes — deserve to have access to birthing centers and OB-GYN services within a reasonable distance; that low-income older adults deserve to live out their lives with dignity; and children living in poverty deserve food, shelter and an education.
In failing to expand Medicaid to low-income adults, the state has missed out on a decade’s worth of federal resources, new health care jobs, financially secure health care clinics and boosted economic activity. Meanwhile, the existing Medicaid programs cover critical health care for thousands of eligible Wyoming citizens.
This fall, as open enrollment for Affordable Care Act marketplace coverage begins Nov. 1, millions of families face the threat of soaring premiums. Unless Congress acts, the premium tax credit enhancements, which have made marketplace coverage more affordable and contributed to historic coverage gains, will expire — forcing Wyomingites to pay premiums that could increase by tens of thousands of dollars.
For example, a 60-year-old couple making $82,000 would see their annual premiums for a benchmark plan increase from $6,970 to more than $44,392.
We welcome funding from the Rural Health Transformation fund included in the Big Beautiful Bill, although it falls short of what is needed to ensure stability for rural health care in the long term. It has limits, is temporary and cannot be an excuse to cut health department services.
During one point in the meeting, Chair Rep. Ken Pendegraft, R-Sheridan, shared a personal story about his experience being born with a cleft lip and palate and raised the question, when it comes to accessing care, “Who is more deserving?” 
We at Healthy Wyoming think that question misses the point. Every Wyomingite is deserving of access to affordable health care. Any cuts to the Wyoming Department of Health will mean pulling support out from under someone. Instead of deciding who should lose, we suggest legislators focus on finding solutions to improve health care access and affordability for all Wyomingites. 
The next subcommittee meeting is on Oct. 14.

The Healthy Wyoming Board is:
Chair Brandon Rosty and directors Jan Cartwright, Richard Garrett, Marguerite Herman and Patrick Sweeney.

In the wake of a deadly attack on a Michigan church, one Latter-day Saint's particularly noble act of grace deserves our attention, writes guest columnist Rod Miller.
The post My Mormon manifesto appeared first on WyoFile .","I’ve had a bone to pick with the Mormon Church ever since Brigham Young sent his Nauvoo Legion to arrest Jim Bridger, as part of Young’s takeover of Fort Bridger. The Mountain Meadows Massacre didn’t help matters at all. And I am firmly convinced that it was only rigid Mormon dogma that prevented Marie Osmond and me from having our chance to be a happy couple.

Opinion

Forswearing coffee and whiskey is not my cup of tea. So, yeah, you could say that I’ve not been a huge fan of the Latter-day Saints. But then, every religion on earth has its own, unique warts, so I cut ‘em all a bit of slack. We all struggle daily in our pilgrimage toward the divine.
But I like to keep an open mind about things metaphysical, so I paid attention to this article about one man’s response to a deadly attack on a Michigan church.
A member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is raising money for the family of a man who murdered members of that church in a mass shooting. The shooter’s family, innocent of everything but being his family, faces a dire financial situation due to his murderous act. A member of the broader family of the victims is stepping up to help.
Disclaimer: We are often subjected to tugs on our emotions to make political points. Cynical eyes may view this generosity as part of a long con, a calculated piece of political theater to signal virtue. But this act of Christian grace passes muster with my bullshit detector. I believe this act of Christian love comes from a deep place in the human heart, a place that is not obscured by politics.
This is a voice in the wilderness teaching us. When we allow God to work in our midst, this is what we should expect. This still, small voice speaks to us out of the thunderstorm we have made of the world. My advice is to listen.
God has been used as window dressing for mankind’s selfishness since before the Dead Sea Scrolls were written. Since before the Bible was translated into the King’s English. And I use God to mean that which all religions worship, in many different ways. I mean God, whose message is the same across religions, and is ignored by people of every faith. Yet this man raising money for the murderer’s family is an example of God’s message not being ignored.
David Butler, the church member who organized this fundraising effort, is swimming upstream against the strong current of animosity in our culture today. Our country and our churches, for whatever reason, are much more attuned to the Old Testament, fire and brimstone, drone-strike energy of a vengeful deity than to the forgiving message of the Gospel. His is a particularly noble act of grace, and we should all pay attention.
There will be support aplenty for the victims of this heinous act, and much hand-wringing and righteous outrage toward the perpetrator. Outrage is the lingua franca of our modern American society and, too often, of the sermons in our churches. It seems to me that we enjoy a collective thrill when our outrage button is pushed. We yearn for some Old Testament revenge.
Butler has taken a broader view, and one prompted by the New Testament’s message of love. His act of mercy toward the family of the shooter echoes Jesus’ words upon the cross in Luke 23:34, “Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do.”
Don’t misunderstand; I am not joining the Latter-day Saints because of Butler’s witness, nor will I go on a two-year mission. Don’t expect to see me sporting BYU merch, but I will tip my sweaty ol’ Stetson to a fellow Christian, regardless of denomination, who, by his courageous example, teaches us all how to walk the walk.

During a meeting Tuesday at the Idaho State Capitol in Boise, Idaho Legislative Services Office staffers demonstrated the new budget “base builder tool” for members of the Idaho Legislature’s Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee, or JFAC.
JFAC is a powerful legislative committee that sets all the budgets each year for every state agency and department. 
During legislative sessions each year, JFAC members and the Idaho Legislature routinely debate and scrutinize new spending requests that state agencies put forward each year. 
This new budget base builder tool will allow legislators and the public to drill down into the existing and ongoing elements of each agency’s “base,” budget, which traditionally aren’t as heavily scrutinized as the new spending requests. 
“Today is a big day,” said Rep. Wendy Horman, an Idaho Falls Republican who serves as the co-chair of JFAC along with Sen. Scott Grow, R-Eagle. “This is something that I know Sen. Grow and I have been working for for two years in our quest to increase the transparency and accountability of budgeting in the state.”
The new budget base builder tool is the latest in a series of changes that Horman and Grow have introduced to JFAC over the past few sessions. Other changes include dividing up how the budgets are set and voted on and changing voting procedures within JFAC.

The new budget base builder tool is free and available to legislators and the public by clicking on the “base budget dashboards” header on the Idaho Legislature’s website. 
Horman said performance-based budgeting is another term for the process.
Base budgets include all ongoing for state agencies, and account for about 90% of the statewide budget, state officials said Tuesday. Base budgets are cumulative and are built with ongoing funding actions taken during each legislative session, said Casey Hartwig, principal research analyst for the Idaho Legislative Services Office’s impact review team. 
In an era of revenue shortfalls and new budget holdbacks ordered by Gov. Brad Little, Democrats in the minority party serving on JFAC expressed concern Monday that the budget tool highlights only spending without providing additional information about inflation and population growth in Idaho.
“I’m concerned … that our (legislative) colleagues will look at this (and) all they will see is growth in these budgets but they won’t understand the real reasons,” said Sen. Janie Ward-Engelking, D-Boise.
State staffers told Ward-Engelking that they presented the budget information the way they did to match historic state budget documents, which were not adjusted for inflation. Meanwhile, Horman said JFAC members will receive a briefing on state spending that is adjusted for inflation during an upcoming meeting in November. 
Although the Idaho Legislature is not in session right now, Tuesday’s meeting was billed as a way to get acquainted with the new budget tool in preparation for the 2026 legislative session that begins Jan. 12 in Boise. 
As part of their efforts to gear up for the session, JFAC members will also participate in interim meetings Nov. 4 through Nov. 6. During the interim meetings, JFAC members are scheduled to receive a briefing on the general fund budget, study agencies’ budget requests for fiscal year 2026 and fiscal year 2027, review state expenditures and analyze per capita spending adjusted for inflation. 
JFAC members did not vote on any budgets or take any other action during Tuesday’s meeting.

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)“We’re talking about a major, major industry in our society today,” activist and writer Bianca Tylek told a group of about 20 people who packed a room at Madison’s Lake City Books Monday night. At the Q&A and book signing event, hosted by Ex-Incarcerated People Organizing (EXPO), Tylek — described as a leading expert in the prison industry — discussed her new book The Prison Industry: How It Works and Who Profits, offering her insights into what she called a $80-90 billion industry in America. 
“This is just a massive industry of folks who are using the correctional system to essentially extract either wealth or resources either from public coffers, or from low-income … communities that are directly impacted by incarceration,” said Tylek, who also founded and leads the non-profit organization Worth Rises, which works to confront and reform the prison industry. Tylek’s book delves into multiple aspects of the prison industry from food distribution to telecommunications and examines privatization, who profits and the lives of the people who are directly affected. 
The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
The discussion was moderated by Jerome Dillard, EXPO’s executive director, who sat beside Tylek asking  questions. Dillard called Tylek “my daughter in the movement,” and spoke of his admiration for her work and her spirit in fighting for change within the prison system. 
Dillard described attending an event in Appleton last week with Tylek where he was invited to receive an award, “not knowing what we were going into,” and realizing it was a Wisconsin Correctional Association conference. 
“I just couldn’t believe all the industries that were there with tables, and tabling the event with new devices and all this,” said Dillard. “I left there really broken and heavy. These conferences opened my eyes to how big this industry is … that individuals are capitalizing on human misery.” Conference tables displayed new kinds of spit masks and shock gloves to prospective correctional customers, some of whom made joking comments about using the devices on the job. “It just blew me away, you know, that she’s bragging about punishing and torturing people in their care,” said Dillard, recalling a woman who made such remarks. 
Tylek said that there are over 1,400 manufacturers of correctional and policing equipment nationwide. “Every single state has a correctional conference,” said Tylek. “Every single state has a sheriff’s association,” as well as conferences and associations dedicated to jails, parole and other aspects of the correctional system. Tylek recalled attending the American Correctional Association conference, one of the largest in the nation, where she saw an exhibit hall “with hundreds of corporations” with their own exhibit tables. 
“And not just tables,” Tylek told the crowd. “Probably the wildest thing I saw was one company drive a full bus into the convention center, where staff from correctional institutions could step onto the bus and play with all the equipment and trinkets that they were selling. And they gave out free raffle tickets and all these things, and probably the grossest thing that I experienced was all the tickets to private events. And I made my way up to a private event for Securus.” Tylek said that the company is one of the nation’s two largest prison telecommunication companies, and was one of the largest sponsors of the conference that year. “And they had a happy hour that involved a full open bar,” said Tylek, “a full swing dance performance, everyone just having the most joyous time of all. All while on the walls there were the kiosks, the tablets, the phone devices that you could go and speak to a Securus representative while you have your cocktail. And all of this built on about 2 million people who are sitting in a cage somewhere who will never see this, who don’t get to enjoy these luxuries in any of this. It’s heartbreaking, and it’s repulsive, I think, more than anything.”
Later, Tylek elaborated more on how companies use things like gifts and luxury vacations to grow their relationships with correctional and law enforcement leaders. “At conferences, you would get these private event tickets,” she said. At one such event, she recalled, attendees were given hand-rolled cigars. “That’s just the legal stuff that looks gross,” said Tylek. There are also “questionably legal” practices, such as offering “training cruises” in the Caribbean for prison and sheriff staff in brochures distributed during contract bidding processes.

On the dark end of the spectrum is bribery, such as the case of a Mississippi prison commissioner who was involved in a bribery and kickback scheme with private prison companies. Tylek highlighted how in Mississippi, a prison commissioner went on to work for a private prison company as a lobbyist. Similar revolving doors exist between the prison industry, especially private prisons, Homeland Security and immigration agencies, said Tylek.
Tylek described the rise of  the prison industry as a relatively new phenomenon in America. Prior to the abolition of slavery, she said, the prison population was predominantly white, and only shifted to being predominantly Black in the decades after abolition — a move  to “re-confine and re-enslave” Black people. Prison populations continued to grow into the 1970s and 80s, leading into the War on Drugs. “Really around the 1980s is when you start to see industry recognize a potential opportunity,” said Tylek. 
That’s the  era during which most of the private prison companies featured in her book began to emerge. Private prison industry representatives helped craft some of the nation’s most punitive laws such as three-strikes laws, truth in sentencing and mandatory minimums, which helped grow the prison population. “Those three pieces of model legislation were drafted by the prison industry, and specifically by private prison executives,” said Tylek. 
The consequences have been devastating for individuals and families, and also ripple out into society. “The impact of the prison industry bleeds far beyond prison walls,” Tylek said. Among those ripple effects are the cost borne by families that put money on the books for incarcerated loved ones to have food and hygiene supplies or simply to communicate, incarcerated people who work long hours for 14 cents an hour on average, missed child support payments from incarcerated parents and victims who don’t receive restitution. In addition, many small towns which once saw prisons as economic saviors now see them as burdens. 
“In the end, all of us are impacted,” said Tylek. “When we exploit people who are incarcerated, or we have a system that wants to put more people behind bars and for longer because a few stand to benefit, then socially we are all harmed by that.”

Yet a space ripe with so many problems also invites solutions. In several states, Tylek has been involved in movements to make phone calls to incarcerated people free and in more than one of those places, that effort succeeded. “Something that everyone can understand is what’s the importance of a phone call home,” Tylek told her bookstore audience. Families of incarcerated people often face significant financial challenges, including debt, income loss and unemployment. 
In 2017, Tylek began to focus on the prison telecommunications industry. “We led the first successful campaign to make communication completely free in a jail system,” said Tylek. That was in New York, and affected the infamous Rikers Island jail. From 2019 to 2023, Tylek’s organization Worth Rises pushed for free jail calls in San Francisco, San Diego, Los Angeles, Massachusetts, free prison calls in Connecticut, California, Colorado, Minnesota. Free prison calls were enshrined in the CARES Act as a result of that work. “We’ve been able to save families $600 million to date,” Tylek said, “and generate over 3 billion additional call minutes between people who are incarcerated and their loved ones.”
Dillard recalled celebrating some of those victories with Tylek, but the fight continues. “We’re in a dozen more states trying to fight for the exact same legislation to make communication free in our prisons and jails,” said Tylek. “The outcomes that we get are life-changing. In Connecticut we saw phone volume increase by over 120% overnight. In New York just recently, first data’s coming back and we are north of 40% increases in calling.” Some of that difference is also due to inconsistent call rates across different states, with incarcerated people being charged 2.8 cents per minute in New York versus people in Connecticut who were paying 32.5 cents per minute. 
“No matter where it happens, the change is substantial,” said Tylek. “These are real people with real lives. We have talked to families whose autistic child stopped speaking when her father went to prison. And when phone calls became free and he could call home again she started speaking again, her child development changed, she started engaging more in school, and now she’s flourishing, all off a simple phone call.”

Those kinds of victories can be replicated elsewhere. A campaign was launched earlier this year to make jail calls free in Racine County, and La Crosse became the first Wisconsin county to provide free jail calls earlier this year. 
“What I love about the examples in Wisconsin is that we had nothing to do with them,” Tylek said, drawing laughter from the audience in Madison. “My biggest goal has been for this movement to take itself.”

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout) Counselors within the Metro Nashville Police Department’s Family Safety Center routinely reach out to crime victims to offer free counseling and support to navigate the criminal justice system.
But soon after mass immigration enforcement sweeps in Nashville during May, the department’s five bilingual counselors witnessed a drastic, and alarming, shift.
In April, just before the Tennessee Highway Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, jointly conducted immigration sweeps, 699 crime victims sought the counselors’ help
By July, the number had shrunk to 61. Hundreds more – victims of crime including robbery, domestic violence, sexual assault, aggravated assault and other crimes – refused or ignored efforts to reach them. Counselors typically see more victims, not fewer, during the summer months due to seasonal crime spikes.
“After the ICE raids, advocates have found it challenging to build rapport with victims during the initial call to offer services. You can clearly see the difference in their response before and after the raids,” said Karina Fernandez, police crisis counseling supervisor.
“Many victims now refuse services, and some clients who do show up for appointments have disclosed they are afraid.”

The Trump administration’s highly visible immigration crackdowns have created new barriers to criminal justice and community safety, city law enforcement officials say.
Prosecutors have shown up to court to find immigrant victims a no-show, jeopardizing their ability to hold perpetrators accountable.
Hundreds of other cases have come to a standstill since January as ICE picked up alleged perpetrators without legal status from the local jail before trial, a fact that prosecutors and victims often learned only after they showed up to a court hearing. 
Davidson County District Attorney Glenn Funk said the immigration crackdowns ultimately “make Nashville a more dangerous place to live.”
“If the defendant, the person who caused the harm, is a citizen and their victim is a noncitizen and is afraid to come to court, they can continue committing crimes with impunity,” he said.
“For the defendants who are immigrants, I do not want someone to make bond and get deported and then never face accountability,” he said.
For victims ‘ICE often overshadows their cases’
Reported crime in Nashville is down overall this year, according to police data.  
Dispatched calls coded for the most serious crimes – murder, sexual battery, robbery and aggravated assaults – are down 14.8% to date this year over last; vehicle crashes are down nearly 7%. All other calls to police are down nearly 10%.
While experts say it is too early for data to reliably convey whether there’s been a dip in crime in Nashville this year – or an increased reluctance to report it – Justin Martinez-Aranda, a victim witness coordinator in the D.A.’s office, said he sees increased distrust of law enforcement among the Spanish-speaking victims of domestic violence he helps through the judicial process. 
“I’m seeing people hesitant to report,” he said. “There’s fear victims themselves might have repercussions for having reported the crime in the first place and I’m seeing a lot of victims sometimes feeling as if ICE and the issues posed by someone having an immigration hold overshadows their cases.”
Martin-Aranda said that in the immediate aftermath of the Nashville immigration raids in early May he saw a “significant decline” in victims wanting to proceed and reluctance to come to court. 
Tennessee ends funding for legal clinic serving immigrant crime victims  

The District Attorney’s office does not track the reasons why domestic violence victims do not appear in court but instances in which prosecution cannot move forward with victims’ testimony poses continued safety risks, Funk said.
“We want to make sure the victim can be safe going forward and if the person who victimized them was never held accountable, that person can continue to harm,” Funk said. “There’s no deterrence. There’s no accountability. There’s no rehabilitation because the person avoided prosecution, all because the victim was too afraid to come to court.”
The district attorney’s office does not consider immigration in prosecuting cases – a message they stress to victims.
“We do not take immigration status into account when handling domestic violence cases. Our priority is to provide support to all victims and hold all offenders accountable,” Assistant District Attorney Christina Johnson, a leader in the D.A.’s Domestic Violence Division, said.
 One metric the district attorney’s office has tracked among immigrant victims shows a marked decline.
Immigrant victims of certain crimes who lack legal status are eligible under federal law to apply for visas as cooperating witnesses. Last year, the district attorney’s office certified 422 of the victim visas. Thus far this year, they have processed just 324. 
“My own opinion is because they are scared to come forward because we’re a law enforcement agency,” said April Foster, an economic crimes investigator and visa certifying official.
Other criminal prosecutions have come to an end because the alleged perpetrator was picked up by ICE. 
Since January, 433 inmates have been taken into custody immediately upon release from the county jail, according to data provided by the district attorney’s office. Inmates are typically released from jail when they post bond or agree to a plea deal.
Tennessee nonprofits scramble to aid immigrant crime victims amid new federal rules

The majority of individuals taken from the Nashville jail by ICE — 324 — were facing misdemeanor charges.
The district attorney’s office has worked with ICE to return three individuals charged with violent crimes – homicide, rape and crimes against children. The individuals had been taken from jail to a Louisiana detention facility, but have since been brought back to Nashville to face charges.
Fernandez, the Nashville police crisis counseling supervisor, said victims are beginning to come forward more often since the May immigration raids but not at the previous levels.
Immigrant advocates say it is unsurprising to see immigrant crime victims reluctant to work with police and prosecutors and fear that a new federal presence in Memphis will further deter them from coming forward.
“What we know is when people are too afraid to come forward when they’re unsure what will happen is that it makes it unsafe for everybody,” said Judith Clerjeune, campaigns and advocacy director for the Tennessee Immigrant and Refugee Rights Coalition. 
Clerjeune noted the multi-agency effort underway in Memphis, including the National Guard is further sowing fear.
“It’s eroding any sort of trust or legitimacy our government needs to have,” she said.

(Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)Louisiana’s Attorney General Liz Murrill can intervene in a capital punishment case if a local prosecutor requests it, the Louisiana Supreme Court has ruled. Their decision, issued Tuesday, involves a New Orleans policewoman who was sentenced to die for her role in a 1994 triple murder.
Orleans Parish Judge Kimya Holmes ruled in May there was no provision in state law to allow Murrill to take over the case of Antoinette Frank, who continues to appeal the death sentence she received 30 years ago. Orleans District Attorney Jason Williams agreed in March to have the attorney general handle Frank’s case, citing an arrangement he and Murrill established last year to help pare down a backlog of pending prosecutions in the city.
The court ruled 5-2 to overturn Holmes’ decision, with Justices Cade Cole, William Crain, Piper Griffin, Jefferson Hughes and Jay McCallum in favor. 
“I’m grateful the Louisiana Supreme Court put to rest this frivolous claim regarding the Attorney General’s authority to defend these cases in State or federal court,” Murrill said in a statement. “This was another attempt by death penalty lawyers to delay these proceedings and I’m glad the Louisiana Supreme Court shut it down.”
Chief Justice John Weimer and Justice John Michael Guidry dissented, arguing that Murrill waited too long to appeal the lower court ruling.

Frank is appealing her death sentence in Holmes’ court, and the justices said she can continue to pursue that relief.  Her attorney, Matilde Carbia with the Mwalimu Center for Justice, told The Times-Picayune the Louisiana Supreme Court’s ruling didn’t cover the claims Frank is making in her appeal or Murrill’s argument that Frank waited too long to pursue relief.
In September 1995, it took less than a half-hour for a jury to return a guilty verdict against Frank, who worked off-duty security details at Kim Ahn restaurant in New Orleans East. Prosecutors said she conspired with known drug dealer Rogers LaCaze to rob the business on March 4, 1995. In carrying out the crime, LaCaze fatally shot Ronald Williams II, another NOPD officer who provided security at Kim Ahn, and Frank killed teenage siblings Ha and Cuong Vu, whose family owned the restaurant.  
Frank is exhausting what is likely her last avenue of appeal. In 2006, her attorneys argued Frank’s traumatic childhood was never taken into consideration during the sentencing phase of her trial. The Louisiana Supreme Court ruled in 2007 against withdrawing her death sentence, allowing her trial court to move forward with a death warrant.
But Frank’s attorneys managed to stave off two separate execution dates in 2008, arguing they hadn’t been given enough time to review her case files. It would later be learned that the judge in the case, Frank Marullo, had signed and order months before the Kim Ahn murders that allowed Frank to take the gun used in the killings from an NOPD evidence room. 
Marullo has claimed his signature was forged.
LaCaze, who was tried separately from Frank, was also sentenced to death in 1995, but his conviction and penalty were thrown out in 2015 when a judge ruled that one of the jurors at LaCaze’s trial didn’t disclose he was a state policeman. After a new trial in 2019, LaCaze was found guilty and given a life sentence.

Resuming executions
Murrill and Gov. Jeff Landry have pushed to conduct more frequent executions in Louisiana since both took office in January 2024. A month later, the state legislature approved the use of nitrogen gas to administer the death penalty. 
Until this year, Louisiana hadn’t carried out an execution since 2010, when Gerald Bordelon waived his remaining appeals and died by lethal injection for the kidnapping and murder of his 12-year-old stepdaughter, Courtney LeBlanc. Prior to that, the most recent non-voluntary execution in the state was in 2002. 
Louisiana and other states that used lethal injection to carry out the death penalty had to pause such executions when drug manufacturers, under pressure from critics, stopped providing the medications needed for that method.
On March 18 this year, Jesse Hoffman, 46, became the first person the state put to death in 15 years. He was executed by nitrogen hypoxia for the 1996 kidnapping, rape and murder of 28-year-old Mary “Molly” Elliot, who he abducted in downtown New Orleans and killed in remote St. Tammany Parish.
Frank is one of 53 people currently on death row in Louisiana, down from 56 when Landry and Murrill took office. 
Chris Sepulvado, 81, died at Louisiana State Penitentiary in February, less than a month before his sentence was to be carried out. He faced execution for the 1992 fatal beating and scalding of his stepson, 6-year-old Wesley Allen Mercer, in DeSoto Parish.
The death sentence and first-degree murder conviction of Jimmie Duncan was set aside in April when a judge determined bite mark evidence used in his 1998 trial was based on faulty science. The district attorney in Ouachita Parish has said he intends to seek a new trial for Duncan, who is still being held at Louisiana State Penitentiary.

Yet here in the Treasure Valley, too many of our youth are struggling under the weight of untreated mental health challenges. 
Families are desperate for support. Schools are stretched thin. And our nonprofit providers are running up against a wall of systemic barriers that have persisted for far too long. 
Idaho’s kids can’t wait. That’s why we’re launching a coalition for children’s mental health.

With more than two decades leading the Women and Children’s Alliance — and years working in education and youth-serving organizations — I’ve seen these challenges firsthand in classrooms, family shelters and counseling rooms. When kids and families struggle, the effects ripple through entire communities. Without enough mental health providers, we risk leaving youth without the support they need to grow into healthy, productive citizens. 
That is why the WCA has joined forces with the Children’s Home Society and the Idaho Youth Ranch in a coalition committed to addressing this crisis head-on. Together, we are: 

Fighting the provider shortage: Our organizations are struggling to recruit and retain qualified clinicians. In Idaho, about 74% of communities lack adequate mental health providers. That shortage means children often wait months for care or, worse, go without entirely. 
Advocating for better policies: Current laws require signatures from both parents before a child under 18 can access counseling, even in cases where one parent is the abuser. This legislation puts already vulnerable youth in further danger. At the same time, Medicaid reimbursement cuts are forcing providers to do more with even less. These policies must change. 
Collaborating for solutions: Our coalition meets regularly, aligns strategies, and shares both data and stories to help the public and policymakers understand what is at stake. We know the power of storytelling to break down stigma and inspire action. 

The reality is stark: without bold investment, more families will be forced to choose between sending their child out of state or watching them deteriorate at home. More youth will end up in the criminal justice system rather than in therapy. And more lives will be lost to despair. 
But I also see hope. Every day at the WCA, I witness families reclaiming stability and young people rediscovering their strength. When resources are available, transformation happens. 
Our coalition will not stop pushing until Idaho’s children have access to the mental health care they deserve. We invite every community member — including parents, teachers, business leaders, and policymakers — to join us. Together, we can shift the trajectory for our youth from crisis to resilience. 
Because every child deserves more than survival, they deserve to thrive.

(Photo by Erik Gunn/Wisconsin Examiner) Treatments for infertility can cost tens of thousands of dollars, leaving some couples to borrow huge sums to cover the expense and others to decide against having children at all.
Lawmakers are circulating a draft bill to change that by requiring health insurers in Wisconsin to cover infertility procedures. If the measure is enacted, Wisconsin would join 22 states and the District of Columbia in providing some form of coverage for fertility treatments, according to advocates.
“Infertility is a medical issue,” said state Rep. Jodi Emerson (D-Eau Claire) at a Capitol press conference Tuesday. “And like any other health condition, it deserves the medical treatment to be affordable and accessible. Yet right now, too many individuals and couples are forced to choose between financial stability and the chance to start a family. That’s a choice no one should ever have to make.”
Emerson is the lead Assembly author of the proposal, along with Sen. Kelda Roys (D-Madison), the lead Senate author.
Roys described infertility as a deep source of disappointment for many couples who want to have children. “One of the things that it shouldn’t do, though, is bankrupt you,” she said. “Everyone should be able to access treatment for health conditions and diseases like infertility without regard for the type of insurance you have.”
Dr. Bala Bhagavath, an infertility specialist based in Madison, told reporters that he previously practiced in New York and Rhode Island, where state laws mandate coverage for infertility treatments. Relocating to Wisconsin “has been a rude awakening,” he said.
“Although some patients get coverage for diagnosis of their condition, most pay out of pocket for both diagnosis as well as treatment,” Bhagavath said. “It’s quite common for patients to take out loans and second mortgages so that they can build a family. I’ve had patients taking a second job or moving south of the border to Illinois as they would get insurance coverage for infertility treatment.”
Dr. Lauren VanDeHey, a medical resident in obstetrics and gynecology, said that as a cancer survivor she underwent a procedure to preserve embryos to avoid the risk of damage from chemotherapy and radiation. She was able to get free medication and the cost of some of her in vitro fertilization services discounted, but is still faced with a $17,000 bill she and her husband  will have to pay off over the next several years, she said.
“I am fortunate I will be able to pay these debts off when I complete my medical training,” she said. “For others, taking on this expense is simply not an option. Support for this bill needs to be a bipartisan effort because cancer and infertility can affect anyone.”

(Photo courtesy of West Virginia Department of Health)Gov. Patrick Morrisey’s sale of a state-owned nursing home in Beckley is prompting a lot of unknowns, including what’s going to happen to inmates who reside on a floor in the facility. There’s also a substance use treatment facility housed within the building.
Jackie Withrow Hospital is among four hospitals being sold for $60 million to New York-based developer, Marx Development Group. The buyer could potentially build a new hospital in an undetermined location. 
Sen. Rollan Roberts, R-Raleigh
“Nobody’s confident of anything still yet,” said Sen. Rollan Roberts, R-Raleigh, who represents the area that includes Jackie Withrow Hospital. 
“I wish somebody would have negotiated that sort of a thing, and then none of these complications we would be dealing with with corrections or with the FMRS,” he said. 
Drew Galang, deputy press secretary for Morrisey, said that an addendum was added to the state’s contract with MDG that requires the company to assume the lease agreement between the Division of Corrections and Rehabilitation and the state for two years with the possibility to renew. 
“Majestic Care has experience with similar situations at some of their other facilities,” Galang said.
Like some other lawmakers, Roberts said he wasn’t included in conversations about Morrisey’s sale of four state-owned facilities that serve mostly elderly patients reliant on Medicaid for care. The other hospitals are located in Fairmont, Terra Alta and West Columbia.
The hospitals, which need extensive repairs, are operating at a $6 million annual loss to the state. MDG plans to build at least three new hospitals. 
Jackie Withrow is the only hospital that includes the state’s Division of Corrections and Rehabilitation.
The hospital’s lease, according to Roberts, doesn’t include definitive information on what would happen to inmates or FMRS and includes a 90-days notice if the hospital’s lease is going to change, he said.

David Kelly, commissioner for the state Division of Corrections and Rehabilitation, told lawmakers Tuesday at the state Capitol that he wasn’t consulted by the buyer about the inmate population. He could face a 90-day window to move inmates should the buyer decide to move the hospital.
“We would handle it. That’s our mission. It would not be ideal for us, but we would see that it is handled efficiently,” Kelly told lawmakers. 
The state’s correctional facilities were overcapacity as of Tuesday, according to corrections data shared with lawmakers. 
Roberts said that Jackie Withrow Hospital, established in 1930, will need to be rebuilt due to its condition. The hospital sale is expected to close Oct. 31. 
“It really puts you on weak standing as far as FMRS [and] the corrections. So, I don’t like that,” Roberts said. “I would rather us be able to have something more concrete. They’re going to have to tear down Jackie — it’s going to have to come down at some point.”
The state’s contract with Marx Development Group, obtained through a public records request, doesn’t require the company to build new facilities in the current hospital locations. Roberts is also concerned about the future of the hospital employees. 
“I don’t think they’ll build right there on the same property,” Roberts said. “It’s out of my hands. That’s all I can say. I keep saying, ‘They know that a lot of us are watching.’ And, I think that is the best pressure that we can put on.”
Majestic Care, a subsidiary of Marx Development group, will operate the hospitals in West Virginia. Paul Pruitt, Majestic’s CEO, has said that the goal is to build new facilities close to the current ones. 
The state’s contract requires that the company must acquire at least three new long-term care facility sites within six months or pay $5 million in damages to the state. The company aims to use labor and materials from West Virginia.

First of three articles about Michigan communities organizing to stop the construction of energy-intensive computing facilities. 
The Huron River winds through parks and wooded areas in eastern Ypsilanti Township where thousands of residents fish, canoe and swim. Now the University of Michigan and Los Alamos National Laboratory want to add a 300,000-square-foot taxpayer-subsidized data center with a 20-acre electric substation to the landscape.
The proposal has ignited a controversy. Township leadership has accused the university of being deceptive about its plans for the $1.25 billion data center, and wants U-M to instead build it in an industrial area.
Meanwhile, a group of about 300 residents called Stop The Data Center does not want a data center anywhere in Ypsilanti Township. They oppose it over potential increases in utility bills, local water pollution, regional air emissions and the center’s national security role. They labeled the township’s plan to relocate the center near a low-income area as “environmental racism,” and have protested at township meetings and board members’ homes.
“There are just a lot of community concerns and issues created by U-M at a time when people are struggling,” Ypsilanti Township Supervisor Brenda Stumbo said. “It’s sad. It’s frustrating.”
Township officials said they aim to force U-M to the industrial site change during the state environmental review process.
The controversy is one of multiple unfolding in Michigan in which grassroots campaigns from across the political spectrum have, or may, derail data center plans. Ypsilanti Township, a municipality of about 55,000 just a few miles west of Ann Arbor, is one of three communities in the area where residents are pushing back against similar plans.
The university did not respond to specific questions from Inside Climate News about the center, resident concerns or township accusations. Instead it noted information posted to its website.





Data centers house infrastructure for facilitating internet traffic and the artificial intelligence boom. Los Alamos, owned by the U.S. Department of Energy, is a federal national security and energy research lab. U-M describes the project in Ypsilanti as a “computation center,” in which Los Alamos would focus on “federal, classified research” in one building, and the university would conduct AI research in another. Construction would begin in 2027.
As data centers’ financial and environmental tolls have become clearer, there has been growing public concern about their impact and costs on nearby communities. In many communities, the centers, which require massive electricity and water consumption, have increased residential utility bills. In Michigan and elsewhere, the centers have required more fossil fuel plants to be built or delay retiring and threaten to derail the transition to clean energy. Opponents also have raised concerns that the centers can be a source of light, noise, water and air pollution.


The anti-data center campaigns in Michigan may succeed at the local level where levers to block projects are available, said Sean McBrearty, director of the Clean Water Action nonprofit, which has called for more environmental and financial protections around data centers.
“The state has a duty to balance the needs of our residents with the desires of these companies and that hasn’t happened,” McBrearty said. “Every step that holds these things up is critical to making sure Michigan residents have a say.”
The U-M center would use about 200,000 gallons of water daily, local utility officials said, while state documents show it would consume about 100 MW of power–as much as the rest of the township, by some estimates.
U-M has said it is taking measures “to ensure energy efficiency, water conservation, occupant comfort and minimal environmental impact to the project site.” A university newsletter in September offered that the facility’s “rooftops are being designed to accommodate solar panels, and the buildings will be fully electric. Cooling water will come from municipal sources.” It would not “draw or release any water into the Huron River.”
The project’s opponents say the center’s cooling water will ultimately end up in the river or environment, and fossil fuel will be used to generate electricity. Data and computation centers typically require backup generators that often run on diesel and are used monthly during routine maintenance. U-M has said its generators won’t use diesel, but has not said what will fuel them.
Though the township’s legal options are limited, local leadership should “use their creativity and actually succeed in their roles of protecting people,” said Vidhya Aravind, 39, a township resident and Stop Data Centers member. The group of area residents formed after the plans were announced, and includes people who live nearby, and U-M employees.
“It seems like they are resigning to having the data centers because the legal struggles in fighting it are too difficult, which feels like cowardice to me, especially when the entire township is at risk,” Aravind said.
 “Condescension and Disrespect”

Township officials said the university has been deceptive about its plans since they were first made public in 2024, and accused U-M of ramming through the project over the local government’s and residents’ objections. They say the situation is especially galling because the university does not pay taxes and has refused to help cover infrastructure costs local taxpayers must foot related to public safety, roads and utilities, Ypsilanti Township Attorney Doug Winters told Inside Climate News.
U-M in late 2024 submitted plans in a tax incentive application to the state that proposed a data center, also referred to as a computation center, on a 26-acre property along the river. But the university in early 2025 quietly bought an adjacent 120-acre property, then dramatically scaled up the proposal’s size once the tax incentive was approved in late 2024, Winters said.
Township officials, who are in lockstep in their concerns about the project, said the plan’s details remain unclear to this day. The project was presented as a light industrial development, Stumbo said, but she has since visited a similar-sized data center in Ohio. She said she was shocked to find massive generators, high tension wires, substations and large buildings.
“The first time I saw one I said: ‘Holy cow this is heavy industrial use,’” she said.
The university also told officials the center would create 200 high paying jobs. Stumbo said the township later learned only 30 would be local.
As township leadership learned more about the project early this year during ongoing discussion with U-M, they determined that it would not fit among the area’s parks, but could be built at the American Center for Mobility (ACM), a former General Motors plant site.
U-M officials balked at the suggestion. Stumbo said officials were stunned when the university told them that it had negotiated with ACM for 18 months but it had failed to secure a deal.
U-M agreed, in the face of some outrage among township officials, to try to re-negotiate with ACM, but will not allow the township to be part of that process.
The township also learned during a recent meeting with DTE Energy, the region’s energy utility, that it was only planning for upgrades to the site next to the parks and river.
Winters, the township attorney, said he now believes the university had no intention of using the ACM site and was “going through the motions” to placate the township. “As the old saying goes, ‘We may have been born at night, but not last night,’” Winters wrote in an Aug. 29 letter to U-M obtained via a Freedom of Information Act Request, that lambasted the university. The ongoing deceit and exclusion of the township from the process was the “height of condescension and disrespect,” he added.
“It is unbecoming for the stature of the University of Michigan, truly one of the best universities in the world, to tell Ypsilanti Township ‘thanks but no thanks’ when it comes to making decisions that will have a permanent and lasting impact upon the future of Ypsilanti Township,” Winters wrote in his letter.
The township is pursuing a “sound” environmental review and will explore other ways to force U-M at the state level to move the project to ACM. “We’re going to do our due diligence,” Winter told Inside Climate News..
 “Unreasonably Consumptive”

Aravind of Stop the Data Center said the group opposes building data centers anywhere in the township because of the energy use, pollution and potential impacts on utility bills.
“All of these AI data centers are unreasonably consumptive in terms of electricity and water,” she said. “They are all contributing to the destruction of the planet, and also rapidly causing destruction of areas around them.”
She noted the research will support national security: “This one in particular seems to be contributing to research on weapons of war, which we are categorically against.”
The group opposes building the center at the ACM site because Ypsilanti Township is among the lowest income communities in Washtenaw County, and the state scores West Willow, a neighborhood near the ACM site, in the 85th percentile in its environmental justice screening system.
Ann Arbor, where the U-M is located a few miles from Ypsilanti Township, is a much wealthier community, Aravind noted. “It has access to water and land,” she said. “But they did not choose to build it there, even though it would be closer to campus.”
Ultimately, the economic reward is too little and the environmental and climate costs are too high, Aravind said.
“Short-term economic development is not worth the destruction of the human species,” Aravind said. “Politicians have a tendency to talk about the economy as something important and tangible, and, yeah, it has impacts, but what is also important and tangible is growing up in a clean environment.”

Yet, Evans said, political priorities in the state, named after the immense river to its west, seem detached from that very culture. 
“A polluted stream, an environmental vulnerability, is actually an abrogation to what we might call the Southern way of life,” he said.
In 2023, a study concluded Mississippi was the most vulnerable state to climate change in the country. The research, done by the Environmental Defense Fund and Texas A&M University, quantified how a litany of social inequities exacerbate frequent natural disasters – such as flooding, tornadoes, hurricanes, heat and drought – not just in Mississippi but across the South. 
Grace Tee Lewis, a Texas-based senior health scientist with EDF and one of the study’s authors, said the region’s history of segregation and underinvestment in public services comes back to bite it when a disaster hits. In a rural state that ranks near the bottom in health outcomes and access to care, for example, a hurricane is all the more likely to sever a sick person’s access to medicine.

“In the South, where you have historical policies that have created a lot of stratification in wealth and resources, I think that contributes to disparities in vulnerability,” Lewis said. “That extends itself to investments in climate – flood mitigation, hurricane preparedness. Often what we see in the Gulf is, they’re the same communities that are getting hit time and again.” 
Lewis and her colleagues’ work echoes similar findings by the federal government. Both the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and U.S. Global Change Research Program published reports in recent years linking social disparities in the Southeast to a higher risk of impacts from natural disasters.
The study also said Turkey Creek, the historic Gulfport neighborhood founded by Evans’ ancestors and other freed slaves after the Civil War, sits in the fifth most vulnerable census tract out of over 73,000 in the United States. 
As he walked outside his mother’s house, Evans pointed to just under the roof, showing where the water finally stopped after Hurricane Katrina landed in 2005. While surprised Turkey Creek ranked so highly, he was well aware of its environmental challenges. 
The neighborhood’s settlers, he said, knew how to comport their lives with the surrounding watershed. They built their homes, for instance, on a ridge following the curvature of the surrounding streams. But especially after the city of Gulfport annexed the neighborhood in the 1990s, the watershed slowly devolved into pavement-laden developments.

“Climate resiliency,” Evans proclaimed, “starts with not being ground zero to someone else’s future.”
Over the years, coastal developers and officials replaced wetlands, which naturally absorb water, with concrete slabs that repel flooding onto other property.
David Holt, coordinator of sustainability sciences at the University of Southern Mississippi, explained that coastal cities after Katrina began developing further inland, replacing forested or grassy areas with subdivisions. But in doing so, Holt said, they were “not really thinking about drainage.”
“We get a lot of localized flooding with these new developments,” he said. 
Gulfport officials denied to Mississippi Today that commercialization has harmed the city’s drainage, adding they’ve improved stormwater management standards for new construction. But lifelong Coast residents, like Rose Green in Turkey Creek, said their ditches still regularly overflow, and fear their vulnerability to climate change will only grow without better planning. 
“The water is going to back up,” Green said. “We’re going to get drowned out here.”

“We are all in a disaster area”
Leaders and scientists around the world agree greenhouse gas emissions from human activity are warming the planet, leading to more variability in climate trends and a spike in extreme natural disasters. 
“The Southeast faces increasing intensity of climate change impacts including warming temperatures, extreme precipitation events, droughts, sea level rise, and tropical cyclones,” the Environmental Protection Agency says on its website.

In the last 10 years, according to federal weather data, storms in Mississippi caused an estimated $1 billion in property and crop damage. The data, from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, directly link those events to 84 deaths and 608 injuries, and indirectly to 19 other deaths and 100 other injuries. 
Half of Mississippi’s counties saw a direct or indirect death linked to a natural disaster in the last decade. 
“ The reality is that we are all in a disaster area,” Holt said. “Every corner of this state can be hit by a natural disaster.”

In many ways, surviving and recovering from disasters comes down to wealth, both on a personal and communal level. 
“Preparedness looks different for people who are low-income,” said Rhonda Rhodes, president of the Hancock Resource Center, which offers disaster counseling on the Coast. “They can’t just go get a hotel at whatever cost, so they’re stuck going to shelters, whether the storm gets here or not. They don’t get paid if they don’t work, they don’t have money for gas. 
“It is a real crisis for families that are low-income to have to evacuate. So a lot of them don’t, which is its own problem.”
The nation’s poorest state, Mississippi is already feeling the financial impacts of climate change more than most states. In 2021, only three states – Louisiana, Florida and Oklahoma – had a higher financial burden than Mississippi paying for home insurance premiums, which have risen as insurers adjust for the risk of increased disasters. 
Last year, amid rising temperatures, a third of Mississippians were unable to pay a recent energy bill, the highest rate in the country.

Over the summer, an Urban Institute study found that, based on average income, Mississippi would have the least fiscal capacity of any state to handle disasters should the Trump Administration follow through with plans to gut the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
“Should more disaster responsibility be pushed to the states, Mississippi would face some unique challenges relative to other states that have a broader set of reserves (for disaster funding),” Sara McTarnaghan, one of the study’s authors, said.
A scramble for mitigation funds
In recent years, governments at every level have shifted their focus to mitigation, or projects that better protect homes and infrastructure from natural disasters. 
The Mississippi Emergency Management Agency is overseeing 160 local mitigation projects. Those include safe rooms and sirens to prepare for tornadoes, drainage upgrades to deter flooding, and backup generators for water systems. 
But all of the state’s mitigation efforts are primarily funded with federal programs, and mainly through FEMA. The Trump administration cut one of the agency’s key mitigation programs – the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities fund, or BRIC – earlier this year. Moreover, the recent slew of cuts to EPA grants included $20 million set for a self-sustainable resiliency hub in Jackson. 
For many small, rural areas, federal mitigation dollars are the only path toward funding local climate resilience. Beverly Wright, executive director of the Deep South Center for Environmental Justice, said recent changes on the national level will disproportionately leave poorer communities in danger going forward.
“The cuts to FEMA are really devastating,” Wright said. “You really see bleak days ahead because Mother Nature is not backing off.”

In the Delta about 20 miles east of Clarksdale, officials in Marks are worried that flooding could contribute to the outmigration the small city’s seen over the last few decades. 
“In the early spring, it was raining every day,” said Joe Shegog, the town’s former mayor who stepped down from office earlier this year. “A lot of people couldn’t get in or out of their homes unless they used a boat.” 
Since 1980, Marks’ population dropped by over a third, Census data shows, from about 2,200 people to 1,400. The median household income is about $25,000 less than the rest of the state. 
A combination of flash flooding and water from the Coldwater River – which local officials say has gotten worse because of seepage from the Arkabutla Lake north of Marks – has become a regular threat to residents as the city’s drainage infrastructure has aged. 
A large swath of the city and its surrounding areas sit in “Zone A” of FEMA’s flood map, meaning they have high risk. As is the case with much of the Delta, flooding incapacitates Marks’ local farming, a key economic driver in the region and state as a whole. The EDF and Texas A&M study ranked Quitman County, where Marks is located, in the 98th percentile of climate vulnerability in the country. 
A screenshot of a FEMA map showing sections of Marks (in blue) that are in a “high risk” flood zone.
Shegog, who served as either an alderman or mayor in Marks since 1987, said the city’s small tax base can’t fund needed infrastructure improvements. In 2023, Quitman County applied for $5 million from FEMA’s BRIC program to upgrade drainage pumps and shore up levees. 
FEMA didn’t select the project, leading local officials to wonder if Marks just didn’t have enough property value to attract the spending. Velma Wilson, the county’s economic director, said the county planned to reapply before the federal government announced plans to cut the BRIC program in April. 
Similarly, Shegog said it’s hard to attract attention from the state with a dwindling population.
“There’s not as many votes in these small areas,” he said.

“We can’t do this forever”
In 2024, 63% of American adults were worried about global warming, according to a Yale University poll. In Mississippi, that number was 55%. 
What climate change will look like in the state isn’t a simple answer, explained Holt, the USM professor. While the conditions for hurricanes, for instance, have become more common as the ocean warms, increasing wind shear may also keep them from building and hitting land. What’s more clear, he said, is that the average storms are intensifying more rapidly and they’re coming during a wider span of the year.
“We’re supposed to be all nervous and worried in July and August, not October and November,” he said.
Another complicated trend, Holt explained, is that seemingly opposite extremes are each becoming more common: intense heat and ice storms, heavy rainfall and drought. 
But while more of the public recognizes the threats of climate change, the language around the issue is still politicized, Holt said.

“People want to say it’s not climate change, it’s just a natural cycle, or it’s all in God’s plan,” he said. “But the reality is, it doesn’t change anything.”
Holt argued that the economic effects of climate change may be the key to attract the attention of politicians and other decision-makers in Mississippi: If more intense flooding and drought continue to threaten one of its top exports – the state exported $2.3 billion in agricultural products in 2023 – and the federal government continues to cut funding it relies on, what does that mean for the state’s future?
“I think sustainability is an easy argument,” Holt said. “Do you want what we’re doing right now? Do you want to do that in 10 years? If you do, that’s sustainability. Resiliency is (recognizing) we can’t sustain this. We can’t do this forever. We can’t behave like this forever.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/29114023/3X0A8367.jpg,,,2025-10-08 06:56:20.339398

(Photo by Amelia Ferrell Knisely/West Virginia Watch)This week the weather cooled just a bit to mark the return of fall — and, for many West Virginians and Americans, the thrill of football season in full swing. As I followed West Virginia University’s games over the past couple of weekends, I couldn’t help but notice how deeply fans’ emotions rose and fell with each play. Victories lifted spirits; losses dampened moods — sometimes even shaping how people felt about themselves and their place in the world. 
Much like sports, our politics has increasingly become less about ideas and more about identity. But unlike football, where one side must win and the other must lose, the future of our state and nation depends on moving past hyper-partisanship to value diverse perspectives, listen openly, and work toward solutions that serve us all. The recent wave of political violence reminded us of how rapidly politics can slip into viciousness when our identities and rhetoric become sharper than our empathy.
As founder and president of The West Virginia Women’s Alliance, our mission is to build bridges across party lines to secure practical support such as affordable, high-quality health care, education, and child care — and to keep women and families healthy and safe in their communities. In our quest to discern how to move past unprecedented partisan divides, I found Ezra Klein’s “Why We’re Polarized” illuminating. In it he explains how politics in America has shifted from a battle of competing ideas regarding ideological issues to a clash of identities. Instead of debating policies on their merits, many of us now treat political affiliation as a core part of who we are — much like our religion, culture, or even our favorite team. 
This shift past ideology into identity makes compromise feel like surrender and turns those who disagree with us into existential threats, rather than fellow citizens who simply see the world differently. Klein observes that due to our human need to sort “us” versus “them,” to see our group triumph over outsiders in combat and in competition is all it takes for our “identarian” passions to engulf our rational mind. This suggests that one of the most salient questions in American politics is how strong our group identities are — how much we feel we belong to one team and how much we fear losing to the other team. But then Klein poses the questions we should be asking: what if it’s not just one team we belong to? What if it’s many teams, and what if all those teams begin working together? 
West Virginia is making progress in many places, but our most urgent needs demand common sense, coalition-building focus:

Maternal health needs attention. West Virginia’s maternal mortality rate is 23.9 deaths per 100,000 live births, well above the national target. 
Access to care is too often out of reach. One in five births (20.1%) occur in maternity care deserts. On average, women here travel 14.2 miles (about 20.7 minutes) to the nearest birthing hospital, with more than 22% having no birthing hospital within 30 minutes. 
Substance exposure remains a crisis: roughly 14% of infants are born with intrauterine substance exposure, and West Virginia has the nation’s highest rate of neonatal abstinence syndrome (most recently cited around 38–50 per 1,000 births vs. ~6 nationally). Just this week, there were reports of over 35 drug overdoses in Charleston in one day — usually the average volume seen in a month.
Family violence is devastating. Estimates indicate that about 39% of West Virginia women experience intimate partner violence (physical/sexual violence and/or stalking) in their lifetimes—an already staggering number that underscores the need for prevention and support. 
Foster care remains overwhelmed, with around 6,000 children in care as of early 2025. 
Child care is in crisis: 150 providers have closed in recent years, and the average cost is about $800 per month per child—unaffordable for many working families. 
Education outcomes lag. NAEP results show West Virginia below national averages across grades and subjects; for example, in 2024 our 8th grade reading and math average scores were below national levels and trailed the majority of states. 
And yet spending alone isn’t the issue: our per-pupil spending sits around the national average (roughly 27th–32nd by recent estimates), reminding us that how we invest matters as much as how much. 
The economy remains challenged. West Virginia’s labor-force participation rate remains the nation’s lowest at roughly 54–55%, and July’s jobs snapshot showed about 4,400 fewer employed West Virginians than a year earlier. 

Voters are sending a clear message about priorities. At the West Virginia Chamber’s Business Summit in August, pollster Rex Repass shared findings that most West Virginians want state leaders focused on the economy far more than divisive social fights. And in the August/September 2025 MetroNews West Virginia Poll, 71% of registered voters said the state should keep our strong school vaccination requirements, with majority support across parties and ideologies. Our immunization law requires entering students to be vaccinated for diseases like measles, mumps, rubella, polio, DTaP, varicella and hepatitis B—unless medically exempted. 
We should also be pragmatic learners from other states. New Mexico just announced it will become the first in the nation to offer universal, no-cost child care to all families starting Nov. 1, funded through earnings from its oil-and-gas-backed early childhood trust funds. That policy aims to save families about $12,000 per child per year and boost workforce participation—ambitions that speak directly to our needs. 
In the upcoming legislative session, I hope our elected officials take these signals seriously and work together across party lines to deliver on what West Virginians want: economic opportunity, healthy families, and schools that help every child thrive. It is our wish that our organization and others can aid with the solutions with long-term strategic planning, research, and education so that this vision can one day become our new reality.
During these crucial conversations on how to build a brighter future we won’t always agree; at times we’ll feel disappointment and even anger. But if we keep showing up for one another with respect, listen with open minds, and prioritize civility and collegiality, we can push back against fear and polarization. That’s how we build a stronger West Virginia and a more united America — not by silencing opponents, but by remembering we’re on the same team.

(Photo by Pete Comparoni, University of Kentucky) An executive at the University of Kentucky with connections to Sen. Mitch McConnell and Kentucky’s electric cooperatives will help lead a commission created by Kentucky lawmakers to review requests from utilities to retire fossil fuel-fired power plants. 
The Energy Planning and Inventory Commission, or EPIC, announced last week it had appointed Eric King, the University of Kentucky’s assistant vice president of federal relations, as the commission’s executive director. 
King in a statement provided by UK said he’s honored to “work with state leaders, energy experts and communities to evaluate our energy landscape and chart a path forward that keeps the lights on and our economy competitive.” 
“Energy policy touches everything — jobs, economic development, security and quality of life. EPIC’s role is to ensure Kentucky remains a national leader in providing reliable and adequate power across the commonwealth,” King said. 
King previously worked for more than a decade in federal government relations roles for UK, according to his LinkedIn profile. Before that, he worked in a government affairs role for Kentucky Electric Cooperatives and served as a legislative assistant for Sen. Mitch McConnell working on energy, agricultural and environmental policy. 
The origins of EPIC
The GOP-controlled Kentucky legislature created EPIC, housed at the University of Kentucky Center for Applied Energy Research, through the passage of contentious legislation in 2024, Senate Bill 349, over the veto of Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear. 
SB 349 requires utilities to file requests to retire fossil fuel-fired power plants, such as natural gas-fired turbines or coal-fired power plant units, with EPIC for review of the potential impacts of the retirements. 
EPIC is then required to report to the Kentucky Public Service Commission, the state’s longstanding utility regulator, whether it recommends or opposes the retirement request. The Public Service Commission has final say, though the regulator is required by state law to cite the findings of EPIC in any order that rules on a retirement request. 
Before state lawmakers created EPIC last year, retirement requests of fossil fuel-fired power plants would be filed directly with the Public Service Commission. 
The passage of SB 349 sparked an expensive lobbying battle last year in which investor-owned utilities such as Louisville Gas and Electric and Kentucky Utilities joined environmental advocacy groups to oppose the Republican-backed legislation. 
Critics of EPIC’s creation argued it was unnecessary bureaucracy that burdened ratepayers with costs and favored fossil fuel interests in a state that has long generated the large majority of its electricity through burning coal. Beshear in his veto of SB 349 wrote that utilities would “experience inordinate delays in authorizing new generation, which will jeopardize economic development.”
Republican lawmakers who touted EPIC said it was needed to address rising energy costs and energy reliability concerns that they attributed to burdensome federal environmental regulations on utilities. John Crockett, Louisville Gas and Electric and Kentucky Utilities president, had previously rebuffed assertions that Kentucky was in an energy reliability crisis.  
Sen. Robby Mills, R-Henderson, the primary sponsor of SB 349, said in a statement that after “more than a year of delays” from Beshear, he was encouraged to see the appointment of King. The GOP-controlled Kentucky Senate would have to confirm King to his role when it convenes next year.
“When I sponsored Senate Bill 349, the goal was simple: Kentucky must have a comprehensive, long-term energy plan that ensures reliable, affordable power for our families and businesses,” Mills said. “The General Assembly overrode the Governor’s veto because we refused to let politics in Frankfort or Washington jeopardize Kentucky’s energy security.” 
Beshear last year appointed to EPIC representatives from investor-owned utilities that had opposed the commission’s creation, including Crockett. 
Scottie Ellis, a spokesperson for Beshear, in a statement said despite the veto of SB 349, the governor’s administration “met the constitutional requirements for appointments, solicited nominees and made appointments” to EPIC, including making the last required gubernatorial appointment to EPIC in February 2025. 
“While the Governor cannot stop others from playing politics, he did his job and welcomes the new executive director,” Ellis said.

A potentially powerful executive committee
King will be working with a five-person executive committee that wields EPIC’s statutory power to review retirement requests from utilities, request documents from those utilities and intervene in any case or proceeding before the Kentucky Public Service Commission.
The five members of the executive committee are:

Ashli Watts, president and CEO of the Kentucky Chamber of Commerce, who was voted onto the executive committee by the broader membership of EPIC in a May meeting.
Wesley Cate, a past president of the Kentucky Oil and Gas Association and a director at the natural gas supply company NGL Supply Co. Ltd., who was voted onto the executive committee by the broader membership of EPIC in a May meeting.
Eston Glover, a former president and CEO of Pennyrile Rural Electric Cooperative and chair of the Pennyrile Regional Energy Agency that is trying to build a natural gas pipeline in Western Kentucky. Beshear appointed Glover last year to the executive committee, and the Kentucky Senate confirmed the appointment of Glover this year to the committee.
Edward Holmes, president of EHI Consultants in Louisville. Beshear appointed Holmes last year to the executive committee, and the Kentucky Senate confirmed the appointment of Glover this year to the committee.
Rodney Andrews, the director of the University of Kentucky Center for Applied Energy Research. 

EPIC members who vied for spots on the executive committee but did not receive enough votes included Jeffery Brock, a business manager and engineer for a subsidiary of coal company Alliance Resource Partners, and Caryl Pfeiffer, a retired employee of utility LG&E and KU. 
EPIC’s executive committee has only analyzed one retirement request so far: a request by Big Rivers Electric Corporation to retire a natural gas-fired turbine that had a “catastrophic mechanical failure that has rendered it inoperable.” EPIC’s report to the Kentucky Public Service Commission in July did not give a formal recommendation as to whether the turbine should be retired.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Eric-King-HS.jpeg,,,2025-10-08 05:57:16.454412

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)State gambling regulators are laying the groundwork to possibly expand online sports betting options beyond the single app run by Rhode Island’s exclusive lottery equipment and technology provider.
Eight firms responded to a preliminary call for interest issued over the summer by the Rhode Island Lottery soliciting feedback from sports wagering service providers who might want a slice of the state’s small sportsbook market.
Among those responding to the request for information was Brightstar, formerly known as International Game Technology (IGT), which has the state’s exclusive contract to run Rhode Island’s digital sportsbook through November 2026.
Rhode Island is one of four states — including New Hampshire, Delaware, and Montana — with only one betting app.
IGT, and since June, Brightstar, has managed the Sportsbook RI app since 2019. The app has had mixed reviews from users. Its reputation took a hit Sept. 7 during the first Sunday of the NFL season after its servers went down for 75 minutes, just ahead of the 4 p.m. games.
“This was unexpected and not a planned maintenance outage, which was resolved as quickly as possible,” the Lottery posted on X.
The other respondents to the request for information were Bally’s, Fanatics, Kambi, DraftKings, BetMGM, OpenBet, and FanDuel. 
Lottery officials will use feedback from responding companies to inform a request for proposals which might be ready to go out later this month Lottery spokesperson Paul Grimaldi said.
“[The] Lottery is moving ahead with its examination of whether adding more apps is feasible,” Grimaldi said in an email to Rhode Island Current.
Submissions from the eight companies that responded by the Lottery’s Aug. 22 deadline were not made publicly available. Rhode Island Current reached out to each company for comment.
Bally’s Patti Doyle spokesperson Patti Doyle said the Providence-based casino giant continues to “have an interest in a Rhode Island sportsbook RFP.”
Kevin Hennessey, spokesperson for Fanatics based in Jacksonville, Florida, said the company “publicly supports an open and competitive market in Rhode Island for legal sports betting.” 
Kambi spokesperson Peter Ranere declined to comment.
Brightstar spokesperson Mike DeAngelis acknowledged a request for comment, but had not responded as of 4:30 pm.
Spokespeople for BetMGM, OpenBet and FanDuel did not respond to requests for comment.
DraftKings spokesperson Parker Winslow declined to comment on the company’s response but stated the Boston-based company “continually explores opportunities” to expand its offerings. The company had supported legislation introduced earlier in March by Senate Majority Leader Frank Ciccone to allow between three to five sports betting vendors to open by July 2026. Ciccone’s bill cleared the Senate during the final weeks of the 2025 legislative session, but never reached the House floor. A House companion bill by Rep. Matthew Dawson, an East Providence Democrat, failed to make it out of committee.
Proponents of the legislation tried to make the case that bumping the number of online sports offerings would help boost revenue lost to neighboring Connecticut and Massachusetts in recent years.
Massachusetts, which launched online sports betting in March 2023, collected over $11 million million in taxable revenue solely from wagers on the seven apps available there in August of 2025, according to data from the commonwealth’s Gaming Commission.
Connecticut, which has three online sports betting vendors, saw over $13 million in revenue in August, according to data compiled by the state’s Department of Consumer Protection.
Rhode Island drew far less than both states, nearly $3 million in online sportsbook revenue, in August, according to Lottery data.
Poll: Rhode Island lags regional peers in sports betting
Patrick Kelly, a professor of accountancy at Providence College who studies gambling, said revenues from an expanded market would likely only be marginal.
“I don’t think it’s going to be much of a game changer,” he said.
Most bettors, Kelly said, gamble in their own states. And Rhode Island isn’t as into betting compared to its regional peers, according to a recent survey from the University of New Hampshire (UNH).
The poll released Oct. 1 looked at the frequency of sports betting across the four New England states where such wagers are legal, surveying 3,671 residents from across Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island between Sept. 17 and 23.
Massachusetts and Connecticut residents were most likely to bet on sports, with 18% of Bay State respondents saying they wagered on games at least occasionally. In Connecticut, the rate was 17%.
Rhode Island came in second to last with 15% of respondents saying they placed bets on sports at least occasionally. UNH’s survey does not list a number of participants by state, but Zachary Azem, project director at the university’’s survey center, said in an email that 737 Rhode Island residents took part. 
New Hampshire residents were the least likely to wager on games, with 10% saying they bet at least occasionally.
The margin of sampling error for the survey is 3.6%.
The primary draw in upping Rhode Island’s online vendors, Kelly said, would be for young college students living in neighboring states who can’t yet legally bet in Connecticut or Massachusetts, both of which require online bettors to be at least 21 years old.
Anyone 18 or older can bet on games in Rhode Island. And Kelly said he’s concerned that more offerings could get more students hooked, particularly young men on whom companies target  their marketing efforts.
“If you bring in all these other sports betting platforms, get ready for the advertising,” he said. “They’re going to have commercials on all the time.”

Kennedy Jr. speaks at the Rx and Illicit Drug Summit at the Gaylord Opryland Resort & Convention Center in Nashville, Tennessee, on April 24, 2025. (John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has floated a seismic idea: adding autism to the list of conditions covered by the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program.
The program, known as VICP, provides a system for families to file claims against vaccine providers in cases in which they experience severe side effects. Kennedy has also suggested broadening the definitions of two serious brain conditions — encephalopathy and encephalitis — so that autism cases could qualify.
Either move, experts warn, would unleash a flood of claims, threatening the program’s financial stability and handing vaccine opponents a powerful new talking point.
Legally, HHS “is required to undergo notice and comment rulemaking to revise the table,” said Richard Hughes, a law firm partner who teaches at George Washington University. The “table” is a list of specific injuries that the U.S. government accepts as presumed to be caused by a vaccine if those injuries occur within a certain time window. If someone can show they meet the criteria, they have a simpler path to securing compensation without having to prove fault. Autism is not in the table because a link between vaccines and autism has been thoroughly debunked.
If autism is added, Hughes explained, the VICP could face “an exorbitant number of claims that would threaten the viability of the program.”
Asked about its possible plans, an HHS spokesperson told CBS News the agency does not comment on future or potential policy decisions.
Carole Johnson, former administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration, which oversees VICP, cautioned that the system is already overburdened: “The backlog is not just a function of management, it’s built into the statute itself. That’s important context for any conversation about adding new categories of claims.”
Dorit Reiss, a law professor at the University of California College of the Law-San Francisco, said that any such change would be exploited: “This can, and likely will, be used to cast doubt on vaccines.”
Compensation without causation
The Vaccine Injury Compensation Program was born of crisis. In 1982, “Vaccine Roulette,” a television documentary, aired nationwide, alleging routine childhood shots were causing seizures, brain damage, and even sudden infant death. The program alarmed parents and triggered a surge of lawsuits against vaccine makers.
“That led to a flood of litigation against vaccine makers,” recalled Paul Offit, a pediatric infectious disease specialist and vaccine inventor at the University of Pennsylvania. “I mean, to the point that it drove them out of the business. … By the mid-1980s, there were $3.2 billion worth of lawsuits against these companies.”
Were it not for the VICP, Offit said, “We wouldn’t have vaccines for American children. The companies — it wasn’t worth it for them.”
The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 created a no-fault system. Families who believed a vaccine caused harm could file a claim; if the injury appeared on the table within a set time frame, compensation was automatic. If not, claimants could present medical evidence. The system had two purposes: provide compensation and protect the vaccine supply.
From the beginning, the table was understood not as a scientific document but as a legal tool.
“It’s a legal document and things can be included for policy reasons even if the causation evidence is weak,” Reiss said. She explained: “The program is designed to be generous, to compensate in cases of doubt.”
But, she said, “autism is not in that category. The science is clear. Adding it would be pure politics.”
This tension — between law, science, and public perception — has defined the program for nearly four decades.
What expansion would mean in practice
Since 1988, federal data shows more than 25,000 petitions to the VICP have been adjudicated; of those, 12,019 were granted compensation and 13,007 were dismissed. About 60% of compensated cases involved negotiated settlements in which HHS drew no conclusion about the cause. Over the same period, billions of vaccine doses were safely administered to millions of Americans.
Adding autism to the VICP table would change that picture overnight.
Federal estimates suggest up to 48,000 children could qualify immediately under a “profound autism” standard, with potential payouts averaging $2 million per case, at an initial cost of nearly $100 billion, followed by annual totals of about $30 billion a year — dwarfing the current $4 billion trust, a new analysis finds.
“Any case where the symptoms appeared in the past eight years and the parents blame vaccines,” Reiss said. “I don’t know how many that would be. The fund has a surplus of over $4 billion. One seriously disabled child’s care can cost millions, so a significant number, say 100,000 compensations, might exhaust it.”
Furthermore, with only eight special masters handling cases, the system would also be paralyzed by backlogs.
The stakes are not just fiscal. If the fund collapses under the weight of autism claims, vaccine makers may question whether producing vaccines for the U.S. market is worth the risk. That would mirror the crisis of the 1980s, which led to the establishment of the VICP.
Autism and the courts
In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Andrew Wakefield’s now-retracted paper alleging a link between the MMR vaccine and autism fueled a surge of VICP claims. By 2002, the VICP was swamped with petitions alleging vaccines had caused autism. The court consolidated thousands of cases into the Omnibus Autism Proceedings, selecting a handful of test cases to decide them all.
After years of hearings and expert testimony, the conclusion was unequivocal: vaccines do not cause autism. In 2010, the court ruled against petitioners on every theory of causation. The U.S. Court of Federal Claims affirmed, and the Court of Appeals upheld, the decision.
“That precedent is binding,” said Richard Hughes, a vaccine law expert at George Washington University and former VICP legal counsel. “Autism was litigated thoroughly and rejected. That still carries weight in the court today.”
The ghost of Hannah Poling
Yet, the vaccine-autism debate has never quite faded. In 2008, the government conceded a case involving Hannah Poling, a girl with a rare mitochondrial disorder who developed autism-like symptoms after vaccination. Officials stressed the concession was specific to her condition, not evidence of a general link. But headlines told another story: “Family to Receive $1.5 Million in First-Ever Vaccine Autism Court Award.”
The Poling case fueled years of confusion.
Autism science today
The science is clearer than ever. Autism begins early in pregnancy, not in toddlerhood, when most vaccines are given.
“Vaccinations … happened around the time families were recognizing symptoms of autism in their children,” said Catherine Lord, a UCLA clinical psychologist and specialist in autism diagnosis. “However, we now know that autism begins much earlier, likely as the fetus develops during pregnancy, so it cannot be an explanation.”
Peter Hotez, a pediatric infectious disease specialist and vaccine scientist at the Baylor College of Medicine who is also the father of a young adult with autism, underscores that point: “The drivers of autism are genetics and, in rare cases, environmental exposures during pregnancy, not vaccines. We’ve been over this ground for decades, and the evidence is overwhelming.”
Sarah Despres, former legal counsel to the secretary of Health and Human Services in the Biden administration and now a consultant to nonprofit organizations on immunization policy, adds that the compensation program itself is often misunderstood.
“The table was originally written as a political document,” she said. “The purpose of the program was to be swift, generous, and fair. … There would be cases that may not be caused by the vaccine but would be compensated if you went through this table injury scheme, where you don’t have to prove causation.”
What’s at risk: Harm from the diseases themselves
The stakes are not abstract. Measles, one of the most contagious pathogens on Earth, spreads so efficiently that one infected child can transmit it to 90% of susceptible contacts. Before vaccinations began in the 1960s, measles sickened hundreds of thousands annually in the U.S., killing hundreds and causing thousands of cases of encephalitis and lifelong disability. Complications included pneumonia, brain swelling, and, in rare cases, a fatal degenerative brain disorder called subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, or SSPE, that can strike years later. This year, a school-age child in Los Angeles County died of SSPE after contracting measles in infancy, before being eligible for vaccination.
Mumps was once a near-universal childhood illness. Though often dismissed as mild, it can cause sterility in men, meningitis, and permanent hearing loss. Outbreaks on college campuses, as recently as the 2000s, showed how quickly it can return when vaccination rates slip.
Rubella, also known as German measles, is mild in most children, but can be devastating during pregnancy. Congenital Rubella Syndrome, or CRS, caused waves of tragedy before the development of the vaccine: Thousands of babies each year were born blind, deaf, with heart defects, or with intellectual disabilities. In medical texts, autism itself is listed as one of CRS’ sequelae, or possible consequences — proof that rubella infection, not vaccination, can contribute to developmental disorders.
Measles, mumps, and rubella “are not trivial,” said Walt Orenstein, former head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s immunization program. “Fever, high fever, is common … and they have frequent complications.”
And yet, as these diseases fade from living memory, a counter-narrative has gained traction. On Sept. 29, the nonprofit Physicians for Informed Consent, a group that disputes the scientific consensus on vaccines, announced it had mailed its “Silver Booklet” on vaccine safety to every member of Congress, as well as to President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance. The book claims that “vaccines are not proven to be safer than the diseases they intend to prevent,” and calls on federal leaders to punish states that restrict vaccine exemptions. (The booklet isn’t free. The group sells copies for $25 on Amazon.)
Scientists say this framing misrepresents the basic math of risk. “Measles is one of the most important infectious diseases in human history,” notes “Plotkin’s Vaccines,” the field’s authoritative textbook. “The widespread use of measles vaccines in the late 20th and early 21st centuries led to a further marked reduction in measles deaths. Measles vaccination averted an estimated 31.7 million deaths from 2000 to 2020.”
Kennedy’s possible move to expand the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program hinges on casting doubt — on suggesting that science is unsettled, that vaccines may be riskier than diseases.
“One tactic used to argue that vaccines cause autism is the use of compensation decisions from the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program to claim such a link,” said Reiss of UC Law-San Francisco. “Even the cases that most closely address the question of vaccines and autism do not show the link that opponents claim exists, and many of the cases used are misrepresented and misused.”
Offit underscores the danger on the perception side. “When people see the Vaccine Injury Compensation program, they assume that any money that is given is because there was a vaccine injury,” he said.
Kathryn Edwards, an expert in pediatric infectious diseases and vaccine safety at Vanderbilt University, said, “Expanding compensation for issues that are not clearly related to vaccines … suggests that these conditions are related to vaccines when they are not.” She compared it to the removal of thimerosal, a preservative dropped from most childhood vaccines to ease public fears, despite no evidence of harm. “Now, we are still suffering from that action.”
Public health experts stress that such narratives invert reality. The very diseases being downplayed once killed or disabled tens of thousands of American children each year. As pediatrician, psychiatrist, and medical historian Howard Markel put it: “Back a hundred years ago, everybody lost a kid or knew a kid who died of one of these diseases. … We never conquer germs, we wrestle them to a draw. That’s the best we do. And so this is a real … handicap to the other side, the microbes who live to infect.”
Families and the future
The hardest voices to reckon with are those of families. Parents of autistic children often feel abandoned — unsupported by disability programs, exhausted by care needs, searching for answers. Kennedy’s appeal to them is emotional, not scientific.
Reiss noted that families deserve far more support but argues that it shouldn’t come through VICP.
“The program is to award compensation to those injured by vaccines,” she said. “We should have more direct support — disability funding, disability aid. Kennedy has been taking HHS in the opposite direction, cutting services where we need more.”
Despres made the same point: “The goal of the program really was if there’s a close call, we’re going to err on the side of compensation. … And it’s really important that everyone understands that compensation does not mean that the vaccine actually caused the injury. … And I think we have seen statistics around the compensation program misused by those who would want to sow distrust in vaccines, to say vaccines are unsafe, when in fact … that’s not what this is.”
UCLA’s Lord urged a shift in focus. “For the last 50 years, science has focused on the biological causes of autism, which has led to great progress, especially in genetics,” she said. Of Secretary Kennedy, she said, “He could help more by acknowledging the value of science, but also the need to better attend to the actual lives of autistic people and their families.”
What comes next?
If Kennedy decides to move forward with such a plan, HHS would need to draft a rule, open it to public comment, and then defend the change in court. The pushback will be fierce: from scientists, from public health leaders, and from families who fear being misled yet again.
The debate over adding autism to the Vaccine Injury Table is not just a policy debate. The program was built on the principle of compensation without causation, a fragile balance designed to sustain both trust and supply. Adding autism could collapse that distinction entirely.

It’s a sobering statement, coming out of a legislative session during which LGBTQ+ Mainers and allies pushed back against a suite of anti-transgender bills, countering a wave of political energy and propaganda that started all the way at the top with President Donald Trump.
It’s a moment for celebration, but I found that those who were on the frontlines of that fight are instead feeling trepidatious about what’s to come. 
For months, Maine was at the center of the anti-trans furor that swept the nation this past year, with the Trump administration zeroing in on the state’s longstanding protections for transgender rights and threatening retribution.
While several states advanced anti-trans legislation, Maine did not.
But since the session concluded, at least three school boards have voted to roll back protections for trans students. And despite those policies violating the Maine Human Rights Act, the commission that enforces those rules said it will not be taking independent actions against those districts.
Meanwhile, the Trump administration’s lawsuit challenging the state’s policy is ongoing.
“You could have the best laws in the country, and I would argue that at this point in time, Maine arguably does. However, those laws are only as good as the people who are charged with giving them effect,” said Bre Danvers-Kidman, a trans policy expert and former executive director of MaineTransNet. 
Danvers-Kidman said even if a policy is in blatant violation of the Maine Human Rights Act, “until a trans student is negatively impacted by that policy and their family has the money to sue, there’s no real teeth to it.”
From nonissue to wedge issue
Maine has long been on the forefront of LGBTQ+ rights. In 2005, the Maine Human Rights Act was amended (with bipartisan support) to include LGBTQ+ people, becoming the sixth state to specifically include gender identity and expression in its protections. In 2012, Maine was the first state to pass marriage equality by popular referendum. 
For 20 years, transgender rights, including access to sports, had been a “non-issue,” according to Destie Hohman Sprague, executive director of the Maine Women’s Lobby, which was part of the coalition that helped defeat the slate of anti-trans legislation last spring. 
“I think we are politically weaker,” Hohman Sprague said. “Even though these bills did not pass, I expect that folks who wanted to use these bills as an opportunity for increased media attention, increased focus on their preferred agenda, and using this issue to sort of distract and divide progressives, it absolutely worked, and I expect there will be a lot more of it.”
Hohman Sprague said there’s long been a practice in Maine of not allowing national politics to interfere with state policy and legislative work, but that has begun to change. 
The bills that sought to erode LGBTQ+ rights in Maine were mostly rejected along party lines, with some Democrats backing legislation that would restrict transgender girls from participating in girls’ sports. Sen. Rick Bennett of Oxford was the only Republican to oppose the bills, but he has since unenrolled from the party and is running for governor as an independent.
Gia Drew, executive director of Equality Maine, has also lamented how polarized LGBTQ+ issues, particularly trans rights, have become.
“The national spotlight and some of the local issues related to being trans has really unfortunately polarized the parties,” she told Eesha Pendharkar after the organization released its legislative scorecard. “Historically, LGBTQ+ rights had more bipartisan support.”
Time to build a bigger tent
Danvers-Kidman said that despite the vote breakdown, they had some productive conversations with Republican legislators and are hopeful they can build on that work. 
They also pointed to several members of the trans community “who just went and camped out at the State House and talked to people — not because they were being paid to do that, not because we told them to go every day and do that — but they were like, ‘No, I know enough about this. I’ve experienced this. I can go talk to people and tell them what it’s like.’”
“I think there’s such fear around talking to the bad guys on the other side,” they said, “and almost every time … it’s people who just don’t necessarily know what the reality of transition looks like.”
Looking on the bright side, Danvers-Kidman said, “It doesn’t escape me how special it is that we were able to hold the line when the president was looking at our whole state and trying to pull all the funding away over this one issue.”
They attributed that success, in part, to the way Maine’s “legal culture is geared toward ensuring everyone has the same opportunities.” They also pointed to the broad base of people who cared about these issues enough to show up to say, “Hey, this isn’t OK.”
Similarly, Hohman-Sprague credited the ultimate failure of the bills to the work of the coalition, which, in addition to MaineTransNet and the Women’s Lobby, included the ACLU of Maine, GLAD Law, the youth-led Portland Outright, and the Maine chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics. 
Asked what she would tell advocates in other states wrestling with similar challenges, Hohman Sprague said, “Keep the faith … this is a time to build the biggest tent we can to pool our skills, wisdom, expertise and resources so that we can push back these threats.” 
“This issue in particular was selected because it divides us,” she added, “and we cannot let it divide us.”

(Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)Virginia Republican gubernatorial nominee Winsome Earle-Sears built her political brand on transparency and accountability. But a closer look at her public filings reveals a pattern of omissions and inconsistencies in her financial disclosures — including a $12,000 “gift” far above the state’s legal limit and multiple undisclosed trips funded by outside organizations.
The Mercury reviewed several Statements of Economic Interests (SOEI), campaign finance reports and related documents obtained through the Virginia Conflict of Interest and Ethics Advisory Council. 
The records show that Earle-Sears, who has served as lieutenant governor since 2022, repeatedly failed to disclose gifts and travel benefits as required under state law, and in several instances amended her filings only after watchdogs or reporters raised questions.
“These aren’t minor oversights,” said Alex Keena, an associate professor of political science at Virginia Commonwealth University who studies political ethics and campaign finance. “To me, this raises serious concerns about her ability to govern lawfully and ethically and highlights obvious conflicts of interest.”
The Mercury sent Earle-Sears’ campaign a detailed list of questions regarding her financial disclosures, including specific inquiries about her reporting of gifts, travel and amendments. The campaign did not respond to several emails before publication.
 A $12,000 “gift” that defied Virginia’s limits

One of the most striking irregularities in Earle-Sears’ filings dates back to June 2021, when she reported receiving a $12,000 “gift” from Black Americans to Reelect the President — a pro-Trump organization for which she served as national chair. The disclosure appears in her 2021 SOEI filing, but she did not check any box to claim an exemption from Virginia’s $100 gift cap.
According to state law, public officials may only accept gifts exceeding $100 if they fall into narrow categories, such as attendance at a “widely attended event,” a gift from a personal friend, or a token of appreciation from a foreign dignitary. The law explicitly defines these exceptions under the code. 
The $12,000 payment to Earle-Sears does not appear to meet any of those criteria, and no exemption was indicated on her form filed with the Virginia Conflict of Interest and Ethics Advisory Council.
At the same time, federal election filings show that the same group paid Earle-Sears $7,966.12 for “event organizing,” “copy editing,” and travel between April and December 2019. The payments, disclosed to the Federal Election Commission, included airfare, lodging, meals and consulting services.
The dual reporting — as both a “gift” and as payments for work — blurs the line between compensation and gratuity. If the $12,000 was payment for her services, it should have been declared as income. If it was indeed a gift, it far exceeded the state’s allowable threshold.
“On the one hand, the ‘gifts’ she has received, such as foreign travel paid by lobbyists and donors or direct cash payments received from partisan groups, provide a window into who she is serving and whose interests she will prioritize in office,” Keena said. 
“On the other hand, a pattern of not disclosing these obvious conflicts of interest is indicative of a disregard of the law and implies she had something to hide.”
The 2021 disclosure, though publicly available, had not been widely reported until now.
 Undisclosed ALEC travel

Between 2021 and 2023, Earle-Sears attended and spoke at multiple events hosted by the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), a conservative nonprofit organization known for promoting model legislation on behalf of corporate members and Republican state lawmakers.
In December 2021, one month after being elected lieutenant governor, she was a keynote speaker at ALEC’s States and Nation Policy Summit in Washington, D.C., alongside then-South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem. The San Diego Union-Tribune described both as “rising stars in the GOP.”
In November 2022, she delivered another keynote at ALEC’s annual summit, which also featured former Vice President Mike Pence, according to an ALEC press release.
And in October 2023, she appeared as a featured guest at ALEC’s 50th Anniversary Gala in Washington, where she was billed alongside Republican Sen. Pete Ricketts of Nebraska and conservative commentator Hugh Hewitt.
Despite these high-profile appearances, none of the events — nor any related travel or lodging — appear on her state financial disclosures. 
Her 2022, 2023, and 2024 SOEIs each include a section requiring the filer to list “any lodging, transportation, money, or other thing of value” exceeding $100 received in their official capacity. Each year, Earle-Sears either checked “No” or reported nothing in that section.
That omission matters, because ALEC routinely covers travel and lodging expenses for elected officials. The group’s funding structure has long drawn criticism for creating an opaque pipeline between corporate donors and state legislators.
“Earle-Sears’ participation in multiple ALEC conferences without reporting any travel support is significant,” Keena said. “These are not inexpensive junkets. It reinforces the perception that there are special interests underwriting her access and agenda — and the public doesn’t see who’s paying.”
The Mercury found no record of Earle-Sears seeking reimbursement for any of the ALEC-related travel from her office, nor any campaign expenditure filings corresponding to those events.
 Pattern of late or missing disclosures

The unreported ALEC travel and the $12,000 gift fit a larger pattern of incomplete or revised disclosures during  Earle-Sears’ time as lieutenant governor.
In February 2025,  Earle-Sears filed her annual Statement of Economic Interests and certified that she had received no gifts or travel exceeding $100 in the previous year. 
But three months later, following a FOIA request by Democratic activist Josh Stanfield that revealed her participation in a 2024 trip to Israel funded by the Combat Antisemitism Movement,  Earle-Sears filed an amended report.
In the revised May 22 filing, she acknowledged seven previously undisclosed trips paid for by outside organizations, totaling $15,784.66, including the $6,000 Israel trip. 
Two other Virginia officials on the same delegation — Sen. Bryce Reeves, R-Spotsylvania, and Del. A.C. Cordoza, R-Hampton — each valued the trip at $10,000, Virginia Scope reported in late July.
Earle-Sears’ office did not explain the discrepancy or why the trips had not been reported in her initial February filing.
Keena said that such retroactive corrections raise questions about intent. 
“If it were one or two instances, then this could be brushed aside as an innocent mistake,” he said. “But there seems to be a pattern of accepting gifts and not reporting them, which is troubling to me insofar as it risks undermining public confidence that our democracy is free from corruption.”
 Private flights and unanswered questions

Earle-Sears’ disclosure history has drawn additional scrutiny since the Richmond Times-Dispatch reported this summer that her April 2023 travel between Winchester and Abingdon matched the flight path of a private plane owned by Gary Duncan, a car dealer and campaign donor whose business is regulated by the state.
Flight data reviewed by the newspaper showed Duncan’s Pilatus PC-12 aircraft made stops in Winchester and Abingdon that same day, aligning with  Earle-Sears’ appearances in both cities. Her campaign finance reports and ethics filings contain no record of that flight or any payment for private air travel.
Asked about the flight more than two years later,  Earle-Sears’ communications director told the newspaper, “We’re still trying to figure it out.”
Under Virginia law, a public official who knowingly files a false or incomplete Statement of Economic Interests is guilty of a Class 5 felony. The statute requires filers to sign an affirmation certifying their report is “full, true, and correct to the best of [their] knowledge.”
So far, neither Earle-Sears nor her campaign has addressed whether she reimbursed the donor, received the flight as a gift, or plans to amend her filings.
 An ethics system built on self-policing

Virginia’s conflict-of-interest laws rely heavily on self-reporting and public disclosure, with limited enforcement power. The state’s Conflict of Interest and Ethics Advisory Council can provide guidance and review forms but lacks the authority to investigate or penalize violations. 
Enforcement typically falls to local prosecutors or the attorney general, who seldom pursue such cases unless prompted by outside complaints.
“Sadly, hers is not a unique case,” Keena said. “President Donald Trump has exposed fundamental weaknesses in the enforcement of campaign finance law at the federal level, as the FEC has repeatedly chosen not to enforce obvious violations of federal law. At the state level, given Virginia’s lax treatment of campaign money, there seem to be little to no consequences for skirting the rules for a powerful elected official like Earle-Sears.”
Indeed, past scandals involving Virginia officials — from former Gov. Bob McDonnell’s conviction on corruption charges, that were later overturned, to lesser-known disclosure lapses by members of both parties — have led to only incremental reforms. While the General Assembly tightened some reporting thresholds after 2014 and passed legislation this year that bars candidates from using campaign contributions for personal benefit, it stopped short of imposing strict oversight or independent audits.
“To me, this raises legitimate questions about her capacity to serve with integrity as governor,” Keena added.
 A broader pattern of opacity

Earle-Sears’ ethics issues extend beyond the headline-grabbing flights and trips. 
Between 2011 and 2021, she owned Shenandoah Appliance, Plumbing and Electric, a Winchester-based business she purchased from its founder, Dave Brown, who told the Winchester Star that he sold it to her because she would continue its “Christian mission.” 
Earle-Sears disclosed the business on her 2012, 2013, and 2014 financial statements but failed to list it as a principal business activity in 2015, even though she continued to own it. She later told reporters during her 2021 lieutenant governor campaign that she had shut down the company because she “couldn’t hire workers,” according to the Richmond Times-Dispatch.
That inconsistency — coupled with her undisclosed ALEC trips, amended filings, and the unexplained $12,000 payment — suggests a recurring pattern of incomplete or misleading financial transparency.
 Political stakes framing

The revelations come as Earle-Sears is mounting a high-profile campaign for governor, positioning herself as a conservative reformer who has pledged, along with Gov. Glenn Youngkin, to “restore trust in government.” Her campaign materials tout her record as a Marine veteran, small-business owner and trailblazing lieutenant governor. 
She’s the first Black woman in Virginia’s history to occupy the role and is now facing off against Democratic nominee Abigail Spanberger; whichever wins, she will be the state’s first-ever woman governor. 
But experts say her disclosure record tells a more complicated story.
“In Virginia, our ethics system is based on the honor principle — you disclose what you receive, and the public judges you accordingly,” Keena said. “When an elected official repeatedly fails to meet that basic standard, it undermines the foundation of accountability.”
So far, no state agency has announced any review of Earle-Sears’ filings. If complaints are filed, they could trigger an investigation by the attorney general’s office or the State Board of Elections, though both have historically deferred to self-correction.

The research, supported by the conservative think tank, comes as school boards and the communities they serve increasingly diverge over policy decisions and values. In Virginia, conservatives have also pushed for voucher programs and charter schools, which opponents say will divert funding from public schools. 
About 75% of the 5,364 school board members across 3,093 districts surveyed for the study said they would give their schools an “A” or “B.” The study adds that among the general public, however, only about half grade their own schools so highly. 
“If board members consistently overestimate the quality of their districts, they may fail to recognize the urgency of reform in those same districts,” the report states. “They may dismiss parental complaints as outliers rather than indicators of systemic problems. And they may approve policies or budgets that assume satisfaction when dissatisfaction is widespread.”
The study, co-authored by David Houston and Michael Hartley, called “Who’s on Board? School Boards and Political Representation in an Age of Conflict,” includes school board member findings about demographic gaps, and their perceptions of elections and political alignment with the rest of the country. The study also pulled from previously conducted public surveys — including from Gallup, U.S. Census and Education Next Survey of Public Opinion — to generate estimates of the general population.
According to the study, school board members showed higher rates of alignment with the average of the U.S. population on cultural war issues like transgender student access than on long-standing debates like charter schools and teachers’ unions.
In Virginia, transgender student access has been a hot button issue over the past four years. Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration overhauled the state’s transgender student policies, which now states “students shall use bathrooms that correspond to his or her sex, except to the extent that federal law otherwise requires.”
The total number of local school boards that have adopted the policies is unclear, however a few in Northern Virginia have opposed making any changes, in an effort to support  transgender students. The U.S. Department of Education is now targeting some of them for their bathroom policies.
Transgender students’ bathroom access has also become a flashpoint in the gubernatorial race, with Republican candidate Winsome Earle-Sears speaking out against Loudoun County’s policy that allows students to use restrooms aligned with their gender identity rather than their sex assigned at birth. Democratic candidate Abigail Spanberger has broadly promised to protect LGBTQ+ students’ rights if she is elected governor. 
Regarding charter schools, researchers found that 59% of school board members oppose them, compared to 45% of the public respondents who favor them. 
In Virginia, the governor’s efforts to increase the number of charter schools have struggled due to pushback from some lawmakers and the state constitution’s requirement of state and local approvals. Virginia has a total of seven charter schools.
Nationwide, board members’ general political identity closely matches the country’s political leanings and policy views, according to the study. The report further states that about 65% of all board members share the same political party affiliation as the majority of voters in their local district.
In Virginia, school board candidates are elected without political party affiliation; however, some have received endorsements from political parties and organizations that favor specific political values. 
The study also identified demographic trends on school boards, including that most board members are more likely to be white and highly educated, and a quarter of members are current or former public school teachers. Researchers also said they found “gender parity” on American school boards after a 2001 survey by Hess and Leal reported that six in 10 board members were male.  
Board members nationwide described different electoral environments, which vary based on the size of the district, according to the study. The report goes on to say that in smaller districts, most elections are neither very competitive nor very partisan, and teachers’ unions play a relatively minor role. Cardinal News reported this week that at least eight Virginia school board elections will not have a candidate on the ballot this fall.
In larger districts, serving over 5,000 students, school board elections are more competitive, highly partisan and influenced significantly by major interest groups.

PENNINGTON GAP, Va. — On a Saturday evening in June, people of this rural region gathered at the historic Lee Theatre to celebrate the founding of Higher Ground Women’s Recovery Residence.



Author Barbara Kingsolver opened the facility in January with royalties from her Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, “Demon Copperhead,” whose plot revolves around Appalachia’s opioid crisis. The home offers a supportive place for people to stay while learning to live without drugs. Kingsolver had asked the women now living there to join her on stage.
Kingsolver, who grew up in Appalachia, suggested the women share with the audience what they were most proud of having gained from their first weeks at Higher Ground. But she learned they were more eager to brag on one another.
Supporters say Higher Ground provides stability and a reentry point after leaving jail, prison, or a treatment center. It offers a range of services and support in an area devastated by addiction to painkilling pills and other types of opioids. Most fundamentally, it’s a true home, with one- and two-person bedrooms, a communal kitchen, and a den. Residents say they have found affirmation from a cohort of women who understand how addiction can demoralize a person and estrange them from family and community.
Ronda Morgan, a resident, said her family has always been in her corner. But while she was serving a jail sentence for drug possession, she told herself, “I’m sick of them having to do time with me.” She was ready for recovery. Her daughter, who’s a nurse, told her about Higher Ground, the first facility of its kind in sprawling, rural Lee County. Morgan learned she could live there for up to two years to gain the footing that had eluded her in three-plus decades of addiction.
What she didn’t anticipate was the kinship she forged with her housemates — among them, Syara Parsell — and with Higher Ground’s staff.
Parsell, 35, one of Higher Ground’s first residents, said that in her time there she’s received help finding employment and enrolling in community college courses.
From the staff and Kingsolver, Parsell said, she has received judgment-free support. “Together,” she said, “we figure it out.”
Traditional treatment facilities typically operate under highly structured medical supervision. Recovery houses, like Higher Ground, offer a more relaxed environment, helping move a resident “toward being an independent, fully functional, self-reliant human being,” said Marvin Ventrell, CEO of the National Association of Addiction Treatment Providers.
“Recovery occurs in the community,” he said. But reentry must be approached delicately. “When addiction occurs with a human being, it also occurs within a family social structure.” If a person in early recovery returns to a family that’s unprepared, that person’s chances of success “are severely diminished.”
For Kingsolver, the opioid crisis became a focal point for what she hoped would be “the great Appalachian novel.” The epidemic “has changed so much of the texture of this place,” devastating families and communities.
Pharmaceutical companies targeted central Appalachia for sales of what they falsely claimed were addiction-resistant prescription opioids. Kingsolver wanted to “cast my net back over all of the extractive industries that have come to this place, taken out what was good, and left behind a mess.”
“The way I put it is, ‘They came to harvest our pain when there was nothing else left,’” she said.

In research for “Demon Copperhead,” she immersed herself in the stories of people who’ve navigated addiction and those who care and advocate for them.
The novel has been an enormous success, having sold more than 3 million copies and earning far more than her previous works. Kingsolver decided to dedicate hundreds of thousands of dollars to address the crisis that has overwhelmed the region where she was raised — and to which she returned full time in 2004.
Again, she set about listening. Drawing on a wide range of expertise, she determined that a women’s recovery home was the wisest investment.
Joie Cantrell works as a public health nurse in harm reduction for the Virginia Department of Health, supporting policies and practices to curb the negative effects of drug use, and serves as Higher Ground’s board chair. She had long recognized the need for just such a home.
“That was the part that was missing,” Cantrell said. Too often, when someone would come out of a treatment facility or incarceration, “we lost them. They fell back into the same old patterns.” She said the region sorely needed a safe, stable environment where women could recalibrate.
By August, the home reached its capacity of seven women. It’s right in town, “which is so important,” Kingsolver said, “because in this part of the country we have no public transportation.”
Parsell has long suffered from social anxieties; drugs were her escape. Here, her housemates embraced her. They’ve offered the support she’d never experienced.
“Every two seconds, someone’s like, ‘Syara’s here!’” she said. “I’m very grateful for it.” If there’s an issue in the house, “one of the seven of us has the solution.”
Four residents are employed outside the home, one is enrolled in community college classes, one is completing her GED with plans to continue her education, and everyone volunteers in the community. Crafting classes are offered. Family members visit.
“They’re living life,” said Subrenda Huff, who was filling in while director Liz Brooks took maternity leave.

Morgan said she accomplished more in a month at Higher Ground than she had in years. That includes applying for identification documents, taking budgeting classes, and seeking permanent housing. It includes sharing upkeep duties in the house.
Such was Kingsolver’s vision. But, she said, “here’s what I didn’t expect: The community embraced this with loving arms. I thought maybe people would say, ‘I don’t want this in my backyard.’”
Most of the furniture was donated. Kingsolver’s quarter-million or so social media followers have been instrumental in that. “But it’s not just book clubs in Switzerland or in California; it’s people in Pennington Gap,” she said. Church groups have donated “quilts, bedside lamps, things to hang on the walls just to make it homey.”
Before the facility opened, local folks volunteered to pull weeds, take down an old fence, and put up a new one. Kingsolver said the well of support “has been just endless. It’s been deep, and loving, and a wonder to see.”
Higher Ground, with only one paid staff member, has estimated yearly operating costs of $120,000, Cantrell said. Residents are charged $50 a week. Ventrell said that fees at other recovery houses vary widely but that $2,500 a month is an approximate average.
“We want them to focus on saving money and paying any restitution or fines they may have from past charges,” Cantrell said. “Some may be focused on repaying child support they may owe.”
Higher Ground receives no federal or state funding. Donations continue to pour in. And Kingsolver recently bought the building next door with plans to open a thrift shop, which would be a source of additional income for the home and offer retail work experience for its residents.
Supporters aspire to open more Higher Ground homes elsewhere in the region.
What these women are gaining, Kingsolver said, “is not just sobriety, but belief in themselves.”

Medicaid enrollees often struggle to find doctors willing to treat them because the government health care program pays low reimbursement rates for services. The Louisiana Department of Health announced Tuesday it has raised rates in order to incentivize more medical professionals to see people with Medicaid coverage. 
“Today’s move really creates a space to allow physicians all over the state to be able to take more Medicaid patients,” Louisiana health secretary Bruce Greenstein said at a news conference at the State Capitol.

About 1.6 million Louisiana residents, a third of the state’s population, receive health insurance through the Medicaid program. It provides government-backed coverage to low-income families, pregnant people, seniors in nursing homes and residents with disabilities. 

For years, doctors have complained the rates to treat Louisiana’s Medicaid enrollees are so meager that they don’t cover the costs of providing care in some cases. The low reimbursement contributed to a shortage of specialists, such as obstetricians who deliver babies, willing to treat Medicaid patients or practice in rural parts of the state, where Medicaid use rates are higher. 

Surgeon General Ralph Abraham, a primary care physician who works part-time at a health clinic in rural Northeast Louisiana, said he believes the higher Medicaid payments will help bring down the state’s high rates of chronic illnesses. People with Medicaid should be able find doctors sooner and prevent certain diseases from taking root, he said. 

“I can’t stress how big a deal this really is,” Abraham said. 
The change won’t be cheap, however. The higher rates are estimated to increase the state’s Medicaid budget by $258.4 million in the current budget year that ends June 30, 2026. This includes $200.5 million in federal funding and approximately $58 million from the state. 

The health department will cover $22.3 million of the state’s portion of the bill with savings achieved by removing people from the Medicaid program who were deceased or not supposed to be enrolled, said Drew Maranto, the agency’s undersecretary who oversees the Medicaid program. 
The new rates will bring Medicaid rates for various types of health care professionals – including doctors, nurse practitioners and physician assistants – up to at least 85% of the rates paid by Medicare, another government health insurance program that covers people 65 and older. 
Prior to this month, Louisiana Medicaid rates were approximately 73% of the corresponding Medicare rate, though the exact amount varied across the types of provider. For example, Medicaid rates for adult primary care visits are going up 31% under the new system, but the rate for anesthesiologists will only increase 24% because those services were already closer to the Medicare rate. 
The rate increases will be given out retroactively for medical visits made since June 30.
Dr. Wyche Coleman Jr., a primary care physician practicing in Coushatta, said he believes the higher rates will make it easier for him to find medical specialists to see his patients. Coleman said approximately 50% of his patients are enrolled in Medicaid. 
“I think that having these specialty physicians more available for our patients is going to improve the health care outcomes of Louisiana more than anything else I’ve seen happen in the last three or four decades,” Coleman said at the news conference. 

His son, Wyche Coleman III, is an ophthalmologist and the state’s deputy surgeon general. 

Gov. Jeff Landry and state lawmakers indicated through a 2024 law they are interested in increasing Medicaid rates even further. By 2027-28, Louisiana’s Medicaid rates are supposed to equal to Medicare rates. 

But any future increases will require state lawmakers to allocate more state funding to the Medicaid program and the federal government to agree to pay for the rate increases.

She sat beside women who talked about vacations she couldn’t afford. She felt invisible. She felt less than.
Then something shifted inside her. She decided to speak up and share some of her experience. Not for them but for herself. She named the fear. She saw the patterns. She began to understand her own story. She realized she belonged and started to feel present.
That moment did not change the room. It changed her. And because she changed, I did too.
My mother is Portuguese and Italian. My father is Black. Their stories don’t fit neatly into any textbook. But hearing their stories while growing up shaped me and how I see systems, silence, and survival. My parents taught me that storytelling isn’t just personal. It is political.
We are losing stories like theirs every day. Not because they aren’t powerful. Because we stopped asking. We stopped listening. We stopped treating lived experience as knowledge.
Intergenerational storytelling is not a hobby. It is public infrastructure. It is how communities pass down survival strategies, emotional intelligence, and civic memory. It is how we learn what systems erased and what people rebuilt.










My mother is Portuguese and Italian. My father is Black. Their stories don’t fit neatly into any textbook. But hearing their stories while growing up shaped me and how I see systems, silence, and survival.


Storytelling across generations has been shown to promote posttraumatic growth and healing and reduces anxiety, especially when paired with cultural rituals and community support. A study published online in June 2024 in Psychological Trauma found that when Black parents shared trauma narratives with their adult children, both generations experienced emotional relief and increased self-worth.
These stories are not just personal. They are policy-relevant. They are data.
Yet schools rarely teach oral history. Mental health assessments ignore cultural context. Community programs lack funding to record and preserve these truths. We treat storytelling like nostalgia. That is a mistake.
We need to act.
Educators can assign interviews with elders. Students can transcribe stories and reflect on their meaning. Community leaders can host forums where youth and elders build public memory together. Policymakers should fund oral history programs as mental health and civic engagement strategies. Families can ask questions. Record answers. Share them.
I recorded my mom’s story. Her voice cracked. Her truth didn’t. She taught me to speak up. She taught me to know my worth. She taught me that silence is not strength. She taught me that survival is not healing.
We don’t just inherit trauma. We inherit truth. Let’s make sure it’s heard.

Georgians should now be able to get the updated Covid vaccines at pharmacies without a prescription after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention approved the latest federal guidelines.
The same goes for access at county health departments, the state Department of Public Health said in a Tuesday press release.
In line with federal guidance announced Monday, “health department nurses or other providers will counsel patients on the risk-benefit of the vaccine based not only on age but other health conditions or considerations an individual may have,” DPH said.
Disruptions to the usual process for recommending who should receive the vaccines caused weeks of confusion over the availability of the shots, which started arriving in pharmacies in late August.
The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices didn’t meet until September to vote on who should receive the shots, so many pharmacies were requiring a prescription.
Georgia law is tied to the ACIP recommendation. The panel decided to allow people to decide for themselves whether to get the shot, in consultation with a health care provider or pharmacist. Now that the ACIP recommendation has been approved by the CDC, people can get the vaccine without a prescription, and most insurance plans will cover it at no cost to patients.
“We are able to give the vaccine now without a prescription. We just have to have a convo with the patient and review the screening form,” said Dr. Johnathan Hamrick, an Atlanta pharmacist who serves on the board of directors of the Georgia Pharmacy Association. “This is no different than how our pharmacies approach any vaccine.”
Some county health departments have started offering the shots, according to a DPH press release, and the departments are ordering a supply under federal programs to distribute for free or low cost to low-income children and adults.
The cost for uninsured adults will vary depending on the situation and location, DPH spokesperson Eric Jens said.
People who want to get the vaccine at their local health department should call in advance to ensure the shots are in stock, the press release said.
National pharmacy chains like CVS and Walgreens confirmed they are offering the shot without a prescription in Georgia.
Dr. Ashley Chinchilla, a professor at the University of Georgia College of Pharmacy, hailed the move.
“I’m glad patients will once again have access to Covid-19 vaccines without a prescription,” she said. The ACIP recommendation is “not quite the same as a universal recommendation,” Chinchilla said, but adults can still get the shot at pharmacies as in past years.
Ninety percent of American adults got their Covid shots in pharmacies during last year’s respiratory season, according to CDC data.
For people without insurance, the shots cost around $225 at CVS. A Walgreens spokesperson didn’t have information on its price.
The latest federal guidance does not specifically address Covid vaccines for children. However, the American Academy of Pediatrics issued recommendations in August that said those age 6 months to 23 months are at high risk of severe Covid and should get the updated vaccine.
Children 2 years old to age 18 who do not have risk factors for severe Covid should also get the shot if their parents want them to, the recommendations say. The AAP recommends that pediatric patients with risk factors like being immunocompromised, living with people who are at high risk or in congregate settings, and not having had the vaccination before get the vaccine.
Dr. Joanna Dolgoff, an Atlanta pediatrician, said she is following those recommendations for her patients.
Georgia’s Covid rate is low based on data from wastewater samples, and emergency department visits for Covid are declining from the summer, according to CDC data. But cases are expected to rise again around the holidays, state epidemiologist Dr. Cherie Drenzek said at a September DPH board meeting.
It’s important to get vaccinated ahead of time, physicians emphasized.
“As we head into fall and winter, during these months in particular, people spend more time indoors, and those respiratory viruses like flu and RSV and Covid spread much more easily because of the close contact,” Dr. Jennifer Brull, president of the American Academy of Family Physicians, said during a fall media briefing.
“Vaccines help protect not only ourselves but those who are around us, the people we love, older adults, young children, pregnant people, and those who have chronic health conditions.”

Illegal street takeovers, where drivers block roads to perform stunts, have become an increasing concern in cities across the country. (Image via video courtesy of Prince George’s County Police Department)Just before 2 a.m. on Sept. 14, engines roared in a Landover, Maryland, shopping center parking lot as a crowd gathered to watch souped-up cars spin in tight circles under the glow of streetlights. Then one car lost control.
Police say the white Infiniti sedan careened into a woman standing nearby, throwing her against another car. Police documents describe a violent impact that left her with life-threatening injuries: multiple fractures, lung trauma and a breathing tube to keep her alive. She survived and has since been released from the hospital.
The driver sped off, police said, but was later arrested and charged with assault and a range of traffic violations. Prince George’s County has seen at least 12 such takeovers this year, part of a growing trend that has prompted calls for tougher laws and more coordinated enforcement nationwide.
Policing experts say such events — which are often organized on social media and can draw hundreds of people to block intersections, highways or parking lots for stunt driving — have become increasingly dangerous and difficult to contain.
Like a flash mob, participants may swarm in and use their cars to block the streets, forming a circular barricade that stops the flow of traffic. Inside the circle, decked-out cars — often with performance upgrades or flashy modifications — spin, performing donuts, burnouts and other stunts. ATVs and motorcycles may join in. Passengers sometimes hang out of the windows. Tires squeal. Engines roar. Onlookers may gather nearby, filming and cheering.
At some takeovers, people may even ignite fireworks as exhaust smoke fills the air, adding to the chaos.
‘License plate flippers’ help drivers evade police, tickets and tolls

Takeovers usually unfold late at night, typically between midnight and 3 a.m., and can last anywhere from an hour to several hours, depending on the size of the event and how quickly police respond. Officers may first respond by using aerial surveillance to get a sense of the scene before moving in with cruisers to disperse crowds and, if needed, issue citations or make arrests.
Last weekend, street takeovers erupted across four Massachusetts communities — Boston, Fall River, Middleborough and Randolph — where large crowds blocked roads, set off fireworks and clashed with police. In Boston, a police cruiser caught fire after being struck by fireworks, and authorities made seven arrests across the four incidents.
In recent years, cities, counties and states have ramped up enforcement and enacted tougher penalties aimed at deterring what some officials describe as a reckless and fast-growing street takeover culture.
Maryland stepped up its efforts to curb street takeovers through a combination of legislation and coordinated policing. A law targeting illegal street racing and exhibition driving, which went into effect last year, allows convicted violators to have eight or more points assessed against their driving records — which could lead to license suspension or revocation — and carries penalties of up to a year in prison.
In July 2024, Maryland State Police established a regional task force that includes state police, the Maryland Transportation Authority Police, and local county and city departments.
The task force has made 61 arrests, recovered 37 handguns and 13 stolen vehicles, and dismantled 99 takeovers as of Sept. 23, according to state police.
Street takeovers — sometimes called sideshows — have existed in various forms for decades but gained popularity during and after the COVID-19 pandemic, according to policing experts. The events are often livestreamed and shared on social media platforms such as TikTok and Instagram, where they can draw millions of views.
“At a time when staffing is a real issue, departments are having to allocate resources to the problem and come up with solutions,” said Chuck Wexler, the executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, a national nonprofit think tank focused on policing standards. “It has mushroomed into a big problem.”
Police say the events can endanger bystanders, disrupt neighborhoods and sometimes involve other criminal activity, including vandalism, shootings and the use of stolen vehicles or parts.
In Prince George’s County, at least one street takeover last year was the scene of a homicide, according to local police.

New measures
This year, at least four states — Connecticut, New York, South Carolina and Virginia — have considered legislation aimed at expanding penalties for exhibition driving and street takeovers. Some proposed measures included higher fines, vehicle seizures and jail or prison time, depending on the severity of the offense.
The Connecticut and Virginia measures were enacted into law. The South Carolina and New York bills stalled in their originating legislative chambers.
Connecticut’s new law, which is now fully in effect, imposes tougher penalties on people involved in street takeovers. Anyone with three or more violations can have their driver’s license suspended for two years. The law also allows towns and cities to create their own local rules to address street takeovers. Municipalities also are allowed to destroy ATVs, dirt bikes and mini-motorcycles seized during these events.
Virginia’s law, which took effect in April, also strengthened penalties. People who take part in a takeover could face up to a year in jail, a $2,500 fine or both. Anyone caught riding on a car’s hood or roof can be fined $500. And if a takeover results in someone’s death, the law treats it as a felony, with a sentence ranging from one to 20 years in prison.
Some policing experts say these new laws are a step forward, but note that, like many public safety issues, addressing street takeovers also requires coordination between police and government officials at both the state and local levels.
“This is one case where legislation makes a difference,” said Wexler, of the Police Executive Research Forum.










It has mushroomed into a big problem.

More recently, the Milwaukee Common Council passed new fines for spectators and participants in street takeovers. The measure, which will go into effect Oct. 11, sets penalties ranging from $500 to $1,000 for spectators, $400 to $1,000 for drivers or organizers, and $300 to $1,000 for passengers.
The Milwaukee Police Department formed a task force in May to address street takeovers. From Sept. 2 to Oct. 1, the city’s police department responded to at least 30 street takeovers, according to police.
“It’s another tool we can use — something that helps,” said David Feldmeier, an inspector with the Milwaukee Police Department who oversees the city’s uniformed patrol. He added that the new penalties, particularly for spectators, will hopefully make the events less appealing and discourage people from attending altogether.
“We know we have a long way to go,” Feldmeier told Stateline.
In Los Angeles County, the district attorney’s office announced a partnership with law enforcement and other county departments to reduce street takeovers.
Launched in August, the plan aims to increase youth outreach and education, expand enforcement operations and install deterrents at intersections known for takeovers.
California also enacted a legislative package last year targeting street takeovers. The laws, which went into effect earlier this year, make it easier for law enforcement to arrest sideshow participants and to impound vehicles used in illegal activities on streets or highways or in parking lots.
Enforcement challenges
Police say enforcing laws against street takeovers can be difficult and dangerous. The events often draw large crowds, making it challenging to control spectators and maintain public safety. The takeovers also tend to happen in areas that block major intersections or parking lots, which may delay police and emergency medical services from reaching the scene when someone is hurt.
In reversal, more areas allow high-speed police chases

Some policing experts say that targeting takeovers in one area can sometimes push the problem elsewhere.
“Cities have found that if they crack down in their city, the problem will be reduced, and it’ll affect other cities,” Wexler said.
Police departments nationwide have tried a lot of strategies to address the gatherings. Some have used undercover officers, shared intelligence with neighboring jurisdictions and monitored social media to spot events before they happen. In some areas, police have even set up tip lines and offered cash rewards to people who can provide advance information about planned takeovers.
Still, officers sometimes face a disconnect between what people expect police to do and what’s safe or allowed under department policy.
Some residents might want police to immediately chase down drivers, for example, but many law enforcement leaders say high-speed pursuits — especially when no violent crime has occurred — can endanger not only drivers and officers but also the community at large. Police also don’t always know who is showing up to these events or whether attendees may be carrying guns, drugs or other illegal items.
That means police might ease into a crowd to break up onlookers, or let a takeover play out before clearing streets for oncoming traffic.
“You never really know who’s showing up or what their true intent is,” said interim Prince George’s County Police Chief George Nader. “We want the public to know that this is a dangerous thing.”

One bill introduced by Republican sponsors in the Ohio House attempts to bring up the “fetal personhood” debate again, while another seeks to further regulate medication prescribed through telehealth.
Yet another Republican bill touches on the information required to be shared by physicians when discussing abortion, and a fourth bill would bar Medicaid funds from going to facilities that provide abortion.
Abortion rights supporters think moves to continue regulating abortion in the state despite an amendment adding abortion rights to the state constitution mirror a national movement from Republican leaders to try to push back against abortion rights.
Because Ohio has a Republican supermajority in the legislature, a Republican governor and attorney general, along with an Ohio Supreme Court that has a 6 to 1 Republican majority, Danielle Firsich, director of public policy for Planned Parenthood Advocates of Ohio, says that anti-abortion sentiment in the halls of government is more empowered.
“We’re kind of in a perfect storm in the state of Ohio in this space,” Firsich said. “Even if some of these bills are flagrantly unconstitutional, it’s just a waste of our time, of the legislature’s time, of the taxpayer’s time.”
  Providers, prescriptions and personhood
While women’s health providers are already banned from using Medicaid funds specifically for abortion services, Ohio House Bill 410 piggybacks onto the work of congressional Republicans in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed by President Donald Trump in July.
The federal bill keeps federal funds from going to nonprofit organizations who received more than $800,000 in federal and state Medicaid payments in fiscal year 2023, specifically those that serve “predominantly low-income, medically underserved individuals by primarily providing family planning services, reproductive health and related medical care,” according to the Legislative Service Commission.
The banned organizations are those that provide abortions when the life of the pregnant individual isn’t in danger and the pregnancy didn’t result from rape or incest.

The state bill introduced Aug. 7 bars state Medicaid funds from going to those organizations as well. The bill’s co-sponsor, state Rep. Jean Schmidt, R-Loveland, claimed to the House Medicaid Committee when introducing the bill that it would not interfere with “a woman’s ability to exercise their constitutional rights under the Ohio Constitution.”
“In fact, we are upholding the core principles of our constitution to ‘enjoy and defend life and liberty,’” Schmidt said. “Although I do not believe they should exist, entities that provide elective abortions can continue to operate in Ohio and allow women to exercise that constitutional right to choose — the state will simply not provide the funding.”
The method of pushing bills that are directly related to measures that have either been struck down by courts or enshrined in the state constitution has historically been “fairly uncommon,” according to one political science professor, but a rise in these deliberate moves concerns not only those in the pro-abortion space, but political science in general.
“The rule of law should be considered as a rule of the people as a body politic,” said Ohio State University professor Jos Raadschelders. “And it is through their representation that laws are made.”
The state constitution was amended in 2023 to include abortion rights as part of it with 57% of Ohio voters approving the measure.
“I don’t care whether you’re in favor or against abortion,” Raadschelders said. “The one problem you should have with this … those are moral issues, and government should stay away from legislative morality.”
A true test of the amendment could come from Ohio House Bill 370, the language of which states an aim “to acknowledge the sanctity of innocent human life, created in the image of God, which should be equally protected from the beginning of biological development to natural death.”
The bill follows the messaging of previous “personhood bills,” in and outside of Ohio, which seek to give rights to the unborn, even before they have viability or development of any kind.
The bill notes the U.S. Constitution’s overriding authority over the state constitution, and presents an argument that the 14th Amendment would protect “preborn persons.”
The legislation seeks to repeal “provisions that may otherwise allow a person to direct, advise, encourage or solicit a mother to abort her child” as well.
Firsich said pro-abortion groups are “not un-used to fetal personhood bills,” but they have a less-than-consistent success rate across the country.
“Fetal personhood is so astoundingly unpopular that it’s much harder to get passed,” Firsich said, adding that the topic often splits anti-abortion groups as well.
Still, with national pushes to re-review previously FDA approved medication abortion drugs, and comments from federal leaders supporting anti-abortion movements, abortion rights supporters may not be able to rely on past precedent to guide the future of these new bills.
“They’re going to be using the death-by-a-thousand-cuts approach,” Firsich said. “You make it impossible for medical facilities to work, and it becomes a national abortion ban.”
In a bill that could come in conflict with not only the state constitution but also a recent court decision, Ohio House Bill 347 would only allow an “elective abortion” after a 24-hour waiting period in which a physician must “provide specified information and document the woman’s informed consent, except in the case of a medical emergency.”
The legislation would “permit” the State Medical Board to “adopt rules specifying adverse physical or psychological conditions arising from abortion that a physician must disclose as possible complications when meeting with the pregnant woman as part of the informed consent process,” according to the Legislative Service Commission analysis of the bill.
One of the members of the State Medical Board is Michael Gonidakis, a past president of the anti-abortion group Ohio Right to Life, and who is currently listed on the organization’s website as a “member trustee.”
Reproductive health facility representatives have said rules are already in place as part of basic medical standards to inform patients of the risks of medical procedures.
“This (new bill) not only sets up additional barriers for medications like mifepristone, but also requires misinformation from providers,” Firsich said.
A more generalized bill that has abortion rights advocates like Firsich concerned is a proposal to change regulations around the sale of “drugs causing severe adverse effects” and establish conditions on drug prescriptions.
Ohio House Bill 324 would require the director of the Ohio Department of Health to determine if individual drugs cause “severe adverse effects in greater than 5% of the drug’s users,” including death, hospitalization due to infection or hemorrhage, organ failure, or sepsis, according to the bill.
The determination would be based on insurance claims, patient reports, and FDA data. If an over-the-counter drug is determined to have caused those adverse effects in more than 5% of users, pharmacies and other retailers would be barred from selling it. The drug also couldn’t be distributed via mail-order.

The bill further requires an in-person examination of a patient and a follow-up appointment if a drug falling under the category is being prescribed by a physician.
“These measures ensure that patients receiving high-risk medications, even in an era of expanding telehealth, are protected through direct medical supervision, reducing the likelihood of preventable harm,” state Rep. Meredith Craig, R-Smithville, told the House Health Committee in June.
The bill itself does not mention medication abortion drugs like mifepristone, but supporters of the bill included anti-abortion groups like the Center for Christian Virtue and Ohio Right to Life, both of whom mentioned the abortion pills as part of their supporting testimony.
“At the heart of this legislation is the protection of women and children from dangerous drugs — most notably, chemical abortion pills,” said Katie DeLand, legislative director for Ohio Right to Life in testimony on Sept. 24.
The abortion drug mifepristone has been approved as safe and effective by the FDA for 25 years, since September 2000.
Planned Parenthood locations in the state have been pivoting to telehealth more because the loss of federal funding for non-abortion services, such as STI testing and preventive care, has resulted in closures and workforce reductions.
Having bills that further regulate medications as the access to care is reduced could negatively affect the patients more than any one else, advocates note.
“If you have a bunch of people who are having to get emergency medical care, there is only so much the medical field can do,” Firsich said. “It’s a massive ripple effect that touches a lot of other issues, and it becomes so overwhelming to operate in that system when you don’t know what you’re allowed to access and where and when.”
Hearings and recourse
The bill on Medicaid funds was scheduled for a second hearing on Tuesday for supporters to speak on the measure.
The high-risk medication bill is set to have its third hearing on Wednesday in the Ohio House Health Committee.
The Ohio House Health Committee has heard sponsor testimony on the bill to change informed consent laws in the state, but has not scheduled another hearing.
While the “prenatal protection” bill was introduced in June, it wasn’t referred to the Ohio House Judiciary Committee until September. No hearings have been scheduled on the bill.
Raadschelders said the current federal and state legislative system is working in a way he calls “na na bo boo politics.”
“’I’ll do to you, now that I’m in power, what you did to me,’” Raadschelders said. “The legislature overriding the voters’ will is an act of unbelievable arrogance.”
The only recourse from here, both Firsich and Raadschelders said, is “the people.”
“The founding fathers … they knew they were human, they knew they were not writing law the way that Moses wrote the Ten Commandments, that they would be written in stone,” he said. “The pendulum will swing back and I’m afraid the Republicans are eating each other alive.”
Firsich said the fight will be a long-term one, with challenges to perceived rights violations coming “in real time.”
“We literally can’t afford to be apathetic about these things,” she said. “People really want their elected officials to be people who are fighting for them, who are not backing down.”

(Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)The ACLU of New Hampshire is suing the state over its decades-old loitering and prowling law, arguing it is unconstitutional and unfairly targets homeless people.
Under New Hampshire state law, someone who “knowingly appears at a place, or at a time, under circumstances that warrant alarm for the safety of persons or property in the vicinity,” commits loitering or prowling. The ACLU, which filed the lawsuit last week, believes that’s too vague and open to law enforcement’s interpretation.
“This law allows officers to stop and detain and cite individuals based on their own hunches without any tangible evidence that criminal conduct has occurred,” Gilles Bissonnette, legal director for the ACLU, said. “It vests law enforcement with massive discretion in deciding when to stop and arrest people, and that massive discretion leads to arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.”
Specifically, the ACLU argues police are discriminating against homeless people.
“This isn’t just a law school exam problem,” Bissonnette said. “We’ve spent the last two years digging into how this law is actually being enforced in the trenches of our criminal justice system, and we learned exactly what we had feared: that this is arbitrarily used against unhoused people, poor people who are out in public.”
The ACLU analyzed state court records and found that circuit courts handled 89 loitering cases brought by the Manchester Police Department from July 2021 through December 2024, the group said. Approximately 56% of the cases were against homeless people despite homeless people comprising approximately .5% of the city’s population. In Concord, the group said it found that 43% of the 23 loitering charges brought by the Concord Police Department and handled by circuit courts from July 1, 2021 to June 30, 2023, involved homeless people. Some of the cases they examined involved homeless people who were outside an office building, walking in an alley, sleeping in front of a church, and sleeping by a parking garage stairwell, the group said. 
Neither Manchester Mayor Jay Ruais nor the Manchester Police Department responded to the Bulletin’s request for an interview. Concord Mayor Byron Champlin and the Concord Police Department also did not respond to interview requests.
The ACLU alleges the law violates the 14th Amendment’s due process clause and the Fourth Amendment’s prohibition of unreasonable searches and seizures.
New Hampshire’s loitering and prowling law has been in effect since 1971 (and amended in 1986). Today, the state is one of 16 that make loitering, loafing, and vagrancy illegal in all public spaces statewide and one of five states — alongside Delaware, Florida, Arkansas, and Georgia — that use language from the Model Penal Code, a 1961 a set of recommended laws created by the American Law Institute in 1961. Bissonnette argued the Model Penal Code’s language was too vague and has created unconstitutional loitering laws.
The laws have been challenged in those states as well. In 2023, the ACLU of Delaware sued the state of Delaware — much like its Granite State counterpart is doing now — and Delaware Attorney General Kathy Jennings ultimately decided to stop enforcing the laws last year. Going back further, Florida saw its law challenged in 1975, but the state Supreme Court, in State v. Ecker, ultimately upheld the law as constitutional. In 1981, the Georgia Supreme Court similarly ruled its loitering law was constitutional in Bullock v. City of Dallas.
“Those are very old cases,” Bissonnette said. “But we think when you look at the cases, it’s clear that laws like this are unconstitutional.”
He said the laws are concerning “especially in the environment we’re in now where unhoused people are very much under attack, including at the national level.”
Bissonnette cited President Donald Trump’s executive orders in March and July, which directed officials to forcibly remove, clean up, and criminalize homeless encampments in Washington, D.C., and to use civil commitments to place homeless people in institutions. He also pointed to the growing number of cities across the country — including Manchester — that have instituted anti-camping laws to criminalize sleeping on the streets since 2023, when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled such laws constitutional in Grants Pass v. Johnson.
“That’s just another reason why this case couldn’t have been timed better,” he said. “Because it is coming in the face of national efforts to criminalize this community. And we think it’s important in this moment to challenge these types of laws to demonstrate their unconstitutionality, but also to demonstrate to the public that this is a community that’s over-policed, and this is a community that has, for years now in New Hampshire, been subject to arbitrary discriminatory enforcement under a loitering law that has been around for over 40 years and has been unconstitutional for that entire time.”
Jennifer Chisholm, executive director of the Manchester-based New Hampshire Coalition to End Homelessness, agreed with the concern about increased criminalization of homelessness since Trump’s executive orders and the Grants Pass decision.
She said they’ve been hearing of an increase in ticketing of homeless people for both loitering and camping (with Manchester’s new anti-camping law) in New Hampshire.
“Sometimes tickets for these things are ranging upwards of $200, which puts people who don’t necessarily have financial resources in a really tough bind,” Chisholm said. “It’s actually making it harder for people to exit homelessness, and also creating some distrust and making it harder for people to remain connected with service providers.”
She also said there’s not a lot of evidence punitive measures like these are effective. She worries they “reduce the visibility of the problem of homelessness, but they’re just not really working to effectively solve the issue.”
New Hampshire Attorney General John Formella’s office declined an interview with the Bulletin, instead providing a statement: “We will review the complaint and respond as appropriate in court.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/aclusign-1024x714.jpg,,,2025-10-08 05:57:16.454412
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-08 09:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Why are CT Medicaid costs rising? GOP wants auditors to find out,Keith M. Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/08/ct-senate-audit-medicaid/,The GOP caucus asked the state auditors 'to reveal potential efficiency measures which could produce significant savings for taxpayers.',"Minority Republicans in the state Senate are calling for a new audit and other reviews of Connecticut’s Medicaid program to stem cost overruns that have plagued the program in recent years.
The GOP caucus, which controls 11 out of 36 Senate seats, sent a letter to the state auditors of public accounts, John Geragosian and Craig Miner, asking for a review “to reveal potential efficiency measures which could produce significant savings for taxpayers.”
Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield, also called for the General Assembly’s Human Services Committee and other legislative panels with jurisdiction over Medicaid matters need to investigate the factors driving Medicaid spending when the regular 2026 session begins in early February.
“There’s something going on, and we need to find out what that something is,” Harding said, referring to a new projection from Gov. Ned Lamont’s budget office that the Department of Social Services expects to exceed its $3.7 billion Medicaid line item by $100 million this fiscal year, which began July 1.
Social Services Commissioner Andrea Barton Reeves told The Connecticut Mirror last month that the surging costs tied to pharmaceuticals and inpatient hospital services both are straining the Medicaid budget.
Increased demand for behavioral health services, staffing shortages and medical inflation also are pushing inpatient service costs upward.
Lamont’s budget spokesman, Chris Collibee, added that the administration is following the matter closely, but changes in the economy and other factors also could affect Medicaid.
But Harding noted Connecticut’s struggles with Medicaid pre-date this fiscal year.
The legislature authorized $284 million extra to cover Medicaid cost overruns in 2024-25. And the health care program topped its budget by $166.3 million in 2023-24, according to records from the comptroller’s office.
Harding conceded some of the Medicaid growth likely stems from increasing numbers of Connecticut families unable to cover the state’s high cost of living.
The United Way of Connecticut reported last month that a record-high 581,000 Connecticut households, about 40%, couldn’t afford a basic “survival” budget in 2023. And while more than 60% of families in Bridgeport, New Haven, Hartford and other poor cities fall below this threshold, poverty now is growing the fastest outside of urban centers.
But minority Republicans in the state House and Senate said majority Democrats also are expanding Medicaid, which is funded annually with a combination of state and federal funding, without regard for what taxpayers can afford.
In January 2023, the state began covering children 12 and younger from families without qualifying immigration status. Initial expectations were that 4,250 kids would be enrolled, but that number reached 15,000 by July 2024. “It is driving and inviting illegal immigration into the state,” Harding said.
Lawmakers in 2023 ordered Medicaid coverage for services provided by health coaches and other community health workers, and they eased eligibility criteria for HUSKY C, which provides Medicaid to people who aren’t working and are 65 and older, blind or disabled.
And this year legislators took a first step, albeit much smaller than planned, to boost long-neglected Medicaid payments for providers who treat low-income patients. Connecticut hadn’t raised these reimbursement rates broadly since 2007, leaving many insured patients unable to find physicians who will treat them. 
But Rep. Jillian Gilchrest, D-West Hartford, predicted majority Democrats in the General Assembly won’t cut state investments in Medicaid, particularly given steep new federal cuts ordered for health care and nutrition assistance programs.
Gilchrest, who is running for Congress, added she is open to the Human Services Committee taking a closer look at Medicaid to make the program more efficient. 
“I think we need to look at reform of the health care system” to find savings, she said, but added that effort shouldn’t involve cutting help for the most vulnerable.
Geragosian and Miner’s office hadn’t responded to the Senate Republicans’ request as of late Friday.
But Medicaid already is subjected to multiple audits annually, though not necessarily ones focused strictly on cost efficiency.
The auditors must complete a yearly Federal Single Audit that examines the tens of billions in dollars Connecticut spends annually on Medicaid, welfare, housing, transportation construction projects and other programs backed with federal funds. Geragosian and Miner’s staff also conduct an audit of all state Department of Social Services operations every two years.
And within social services, the department’s Office of Quality Assurance also conducts regular audits of the state’s Medicaid program.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_2042-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-08 05:57:16.454412

(Photo by Wichayada Suwanachun/Getty Images)New Hampshire consumers who wish to choose privatized Medicare are facing a churn in the Medicare Advantage market, with two carriers, Anthem and Martin’s Point, leaving and another, Aetna, reducing its coverage to the two most populous counties.
This is not the fault of the New Hampshire Insurance Department or state policymakers, as Medicare Advantage plans are not state-regulated. In fact, it is only due to a law pushed by Insurance Commissioner D.J. Bettencourt that we at least have advance notice of plans exiting.
Nor is this churn attributable to federal regulation, such as it is. In Washington, D.C., both political parties have lavished funding upon Medicare Advantage as the most-favored nation among health care expenditures, allowing it to overtake traditional, or fee-for-service (FFS), Medicare.
In March, the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission reported that “Medicare will spend 20% more for (Medicare Advantage) enrollees than it would spend if those beneficiaries were enrolled in FFS Medicare,” and that Medicare Advantage overbilling alone may total $43 billion annually. Yet in April the federal government still announced a 7.16% increase in Medicare Advantage payment revenue, accounting for risk coding, for 2026. That dwarfs an announced 3.2% Medicare increase for nursing home care, let alone the announced (and disastrous) 6.4% Medicare cut for home health.
A year ago an audit of data by the Office of the Inspector General for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services found an unsupported $7.5 billion in risk-coded payments to Medicare Advantage insurers in 2023 alone. The Wall Street Journal found $50 billion in payments for questionable diagnoses from 2019-21, including over 66,000 Medicare Advantage beneficiaries diagnosed with “anatomically impossible” cataracts that had already been cured.
Nor do insurers passing on coverage here need a GoFundMe page. For example, Anthem’s parent, Elevance, reported $2.5 billion in profit in the second quarter of this year, and a year-over-year increase of 11% in Medicare Advantage enrollment.
Instead, what we see here and elsewhere is insurers making a rational decision to pass on markets less profitable than others. In neighboring Vermont, for example, the biggest Medicare Advantage insurer, Blue Cross and Blue Shield, notified enrollees that it was discontinuing coverage because prior insurer exits had left it with unsustainable risk. We are also a small, largely rural market, where building an adequate network is hard, and there hasn’t been as much Medicare Advantage take-up as elsewhere.
In the past, Medicare Advantage has been described as a “Cash Monster” but there are other ways for insurers to make money, including Medicaid. One growing approach is Special Needs Plans. Under a Dual-Eligible Special Needs Plan (D-SNP) a Medicare Advantage insurer can coordinate the needs of someone on both Medicare and Medicaid. The Kaiser Family Foundation reports that we are among seven states without this option, and the others, except for Illinois, are also all small in population.
Insurers have demonstrated an interest in this option being available in New Hampshire. The only trepidation I have is that KFF data from 2021 shows that D-SNPs, on average, have twice the denial rate on prior authorizations than Medicare Advantage plans, which have an atrocious 6% denial rate. However, D-SNPs would be a better arrangement than having insurers run the state’s Medicaid long-term care program, which they are again trying to do after being legislatively rebuffed in 2018.
Indiana is the most recent state to adopt that approach.  The Indianapolis Star describes it as a “painful, bureaucratic mess” with $300 million in cost overruns, and the current Republican administration faults the prior one for having taken this leap of faith.  There is no value proposition in having insurers “manage” the care, say, of a long-stay nursing home resident.
The estimated “depletion date” for the hospital insurance component of the Medicare trust fund is now 2033, according to a report issued by the Trump administration in June. That being the case, if there is a greater reliance on less expensive FFS it would be a positive for the taxpayers. And don’t worry: As surely as the sun rises in the East, health insurers will still make money.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/docmedicareadvantage-1024x617.jpg,,,2025-10-08 05:57:16.454412

(Photo by Graham Stokes for Ohio Capital Journal. Republish photo only with original story.)People reported reduced satisfaction with Ohio’s medical marijuana program since recreational marijuana sales started, according to a new Ohio State University Drug Enforcement and Policy Center survey. 
Slightly more than half of the people surveyed (56%) reported being either extremely satisfied or somewhat satisfied with the Ohio Medical Marijuana Control Program (OMMCP) — a drop compared to 74% on last year’s survey. 
More people also reported some level of dissatisfaction on this year’s survey — 30% in 2025 compared to 20% in 2024.

“I think the drop in dissatisfaction was … a little more than I expected,” said Jana Hrdinová, administrative director of the Drug Enforcement and Policy Center. “I expected a little bit of a drop … but going from (74%) to (56%), that’s a pretty big drop.”
The Drug Enforcement and Policy Center has been surveying medical marijuana patients every year since sales started in 2019 and the latest report is the first year when Ohio’s medical and recreational programs have coexisted. More than 4,000 marijuana users were surveyed. 
Ohio medical marijuana sales started Jan. 14, 2019, and totaled $2.23 billion with 331,341 pounds sold as of Sept. 13, according to the Ohio Department of Commerce Division of Cannabis Control.
Ohioans passed a citizen-initiated law to legalize recreational marijuana in 2023 with 57% of the vote, and sales started in August 2024. Ohio legal marijuana sales topped $702.5 million in the first year. 
The state’s medical marijuana program saw a 43% decline in active patients from May 2024 to July 2025 — going from 165,746 active patients in May 2024 down to 94,294 active patients in July 2025, according to the survey. 
The program had 184,958 patients at its peak in October 2023. 
More than half of those surveyed (56%) said they were extremely likely to continue to register as a medical marijuana patient and 16% reported being somewhat likely, according to the survey. 
It’s hard to know what this will mean for the future of Ohio’s medical marijuana program, but Hrdinová expects there will be a further drop in patients before the number of patients in the program eventually stabilizes. 
“For the medical patients, they do not want to necessarily see themselves as recreational patients or recreational users,” she said. “I think there is a perception or cultural difference in those two terms, so I think some patients will continue to register with the program regardless.”
The average monthly price of plant products rose to $7.42 per gram during fiscal year 2025 compared to $6.16 per gram in fiscal year 2024, according to the survey. 
Michigan’s average monthly price of flower in recreational dispensaries was $2.52 per gram, according to the survey. 
“Unfortunately, I think we are always going to be compared to Michigan,” Hrdinová said. 
“But at the end of the day, the fact is, if you drive to Michigan, you pay way less than you pay in Ohio dispensaries, and that’s just frustrating for people who cannot make the trip on a regular basis.”
More than three-fourths of those surveyed (79%) said using marijuana has reduced their need to use prescription pain killers and 26% said using marijuana helped them reduce their use of illegal drugs, according to the report. 
“There seems to be some public and private benefit for some people when it comes to replacing other substances with marijuana which might be less harmful than the other substances,” Hrdinová said. 
The Drug Enforcement and Policy Center laid out three policy priorities: regulating intoxicating hemp products, collecting data and funding Ohio-specific research, and providing education to the public.  
There are a handful of bills in the Ohio legislature that are trying to regulate intoxicating hemp products in various ways. 
The Drug Enforcement and Policy Center recommends having a 21-year-old age requirement to buy intoxicating hemp products, have specific safety and production standards on intoxicating hemp products, and not marketing those products to children, among other recommendations.

(Photo by Marty Schladen, Ohio Capital Journal.)Ohio educators will keep their voices on the retired teachers’ pension fund board for now due to an appellate court upholding a temporary block on a new state law that would have eliminated them. After this court loss, the Republican Ohio House speaker wants to remove judicial power to prevent one county’s judges from determining statewide law.
The state relies on teachers to educate the next generation of leaders.
“We all take part in helping children to grow and to benefit and hopefully flourish in their lives,” retired teacher Mary Binegar said.
And half a million active and retired teachers like Binegar rely on the State Teachers’ Retirement System (STRS) to help take care of them when their teaching days are done.
However, she stated that the state has altered the deal by changing the STRS board.
“As a person that depends on that pension, it’s really frightening, because I know that if they make decisions that are not in the best long-term interests of educators, that affects my life, my livelihood,” she said.
A last-minute provision inserted in the state budget, signed into law in July, changed how educators are heard.
It changed the makeup of the board from seven elected teachers — five contributing and two retired — to three elected after seats are phased out over several years.
Two of the educator seats will be for actives and only one retiree seat.
Each elected member will be able to finish their term, but once they term out, four of the seven seats will not be refilled.
Those four educator seats will be filled with newly appointed members.

Right now, the governor gets to appoint one investment expert. The Speaker of the House and the Senate president jointly appoint an expert. The treasurer gets an appointee, and so does the director of the Department of Education and Workforce.
Under the law, the treasurer will get two appointees, the legislative leaders will get one each and one combined, equalling three. The chancellor of the Department of Higher Education will get one, and the governor and the Department of Education and Workforce each get one.
Ohio Education Association (OEA), the Ohio Federation of Teachers (OFT), and the Ohio Conference of the American Association of University Professors (OC AAUP) sued the state, arguing the board changes are “unconstitutional and discriminatory.”
“It’s just not fair — not being treated like the other pension systems, not going through the process, not being transparent,” OEA President Jeff Wensing said.
The lawsuit alleges that the policy violates educators’ right to equal protection under the law because only STRS was changed, not the other four Ohio public employee pension funds.
Each of the other boards gives more seats to elected members than to political appointees.
The educators also take issue with the manner in which the provision was passed, without having it be considered on at least three different days, and that it was included in legislation that had more than one subject.
The budget, which was thousands of pages, covered everything from tax policy to STRS to LGBTQ+ rights.
Republican leaders claim there is good reason to change the board.
“I think there’s been pretty widespread concern about some of the management of the state teachers’ retirement system,” House Finance Chair Brian Stewart, R-Ashville, said during the budget process.
Stewart added that he helped add this provision into the budget because of the “last several years of turmoil and lawsuits and questionable investments,” he said.
In summary, there has been constant fighting, two board resignations, and allegations of both public corruption schemes and the mishandling of funds. There has been a senior staff dismissal and at least two senior staff resignations.
A 14-page whistleblower memo given to Ohio Republican Gov. Mike DeWine in May alleged a massive public corruption scandal brewing and moving quickly within STRS.
Attorney General Dave Yost soon after filed a lawsuit to remove former members Wade Steen and Rudy Fichtenbaum from the board, stating they were participating in a contract-steering “scheme” that could directly benefit them.
The lawsuit accuses the pair of “colluding” with investment startup QED Technologies, run by former Ohio Deputy Treasurer Seth Metcalf and Jonathan (JD) Tremmel, to secure a contract giving them 70% of the STRS assets — about $65 billion at the time.
The memo accuses QED of helping to elect board members who may be more sympathetic to their proposal.
Fichtenbaum and Steen adamantly deny any and all allegations against them, and are currently fighting in court against Yost.
Meanwhile, our 2024 investigation revealed that STRS was, once again, moving to hire a firm that allegedly had a lack of experience and personal ties to the board leaders. The consultants didn’t end up getting the deal following our story.
We have continued investigating the alleged scheme throughout the past year — including an interview with DeWine.
He expressed his deep concerns exclusively following our April 2025 report, in which we revealed hundreds of text messages about the relationship between Steen and members of QED.
Asked about the constitutionality of the board changes and previous comments that he didn’t think the board needed to change, DeWine said, “Well, of course I don’t think it was unconstitutional, but ultimately that’s a decision that has to be made by the courts.”
But educators got a win.
The Tenth District Court of Appeals has upheld a lower court’s temporary restraining order (TRO) before the case had its first hearing to decide on if there should be a preliminary injunction, another way to stop a law from going into effect during trial proceedings.
The case, being heard in the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas, has a hearing on Friday to decide if the law should be paused from going into effect.
Ohio House Speaker Matt Huffman, R-Lima, isn’t happy with the judge’s block.
“The General Assembly has the authority constitutionally to decide who’s on those boards,” Huffman said.
While he thinks that this provision’s restraining order isn’t a “big deal, it’s not an imminent problem,” he said that this is an example of a greater issue.
Judicial power

One county judge shouldn’t be able to determine statewide policy, Huffman claimed. After this ruling, he wants to make changes to judicial power as well.
“A bill that’s passed by the legislature, signed by the governor, went through the whole process — one judge someplace in Ohio is shutting that down,” he said. “I think we need to deal with that problem.”
When Huffman was Senate president during the last General Assembly, he and his caucus quickly put a provision into an unrelated bill that would allow the state to appeal TROs and preliminary injunctions made by county judges.
Right now, the state is unable to challenge non-permanent decisions.
When H.B. 305 passed the Senate that day, Huffman told reporters that this was important to rein in judges and trust the legislative process.
That same morning, the Ohio Supreme Court rejected the state’s attempt to narrow a TRO on the transgender gender affirming care ban law.
Questioned about his motives, he explained that the urgency for the provision wasn’t just about the transgender care case, but said it had been an issue in “many circumstances.”
He cited a Cincinnati court’s block on abortion bans.
Educators argue that all of this is a power grab and that the lawmakers just didn’t like that the board gave a bump in cost-of-living adjustments for retirees.
In response to Huffman’s comments, Wensing sent a statement talking about the importance of the judicial system and the separation of powers.
“Unfortunately, Speaker Huffman disagreed with the county court’s decision and now wants to change the rules of the process to create a system that may be more favorable to him. That kind of behavior would be inappropriate on a playground—and it’s just as concerning when it comes from our state leaders,” Wensing said.
“We must stand together to stand up against these attacks on the Constitution, just like we’re standing up to Speaker Huffman’s attacks on Ohio’s public school educators and their right to have a voice in the future of their own retirement security. If Speaker Huffman insists on trying to change the law, we look forward to seeing that new law challenged in court— starting at the county court level.”

(Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)The Trump administration tried to cancel Jimmy Kimmel — and it had some success, with two Ohio ABC affiliates temporarily refusing to run his late-night show. 
Free speech advocates said it was an authoritarian move to silence the administration’s critics. A prominent antitrust activist last week said that corporate consolidation is partly to blame. 
In the wake of the assassination of far-right commentator Charlie Kirk, Kimmel accused Trump and his allies of using it to score political points. 
The day of the killing — and before much, if anything, was known about Kirk’s killer — Trump blamed “the radical left” for the murder. A day later, he said “we just have to beat the hell” out of “radical left lunatics,” Politico reported.
Kimmel, a comic who frequently lampoons Trump, didn’t say anything about Kirk personally. 
He said Trump and others were “desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them” and were trying to “score political points from it.”
He also said Trump’s reaction to the murder was similar to “how a four-year-old mourns a goldfish,” the BBC reported.

The Federal Communications Commission regulates broadcast licenses and is supposed to promote competition. 
Even so, it has allowed several big broadcast mergers and is considering whether to lift a longtime ban on any mergers between the biggest four.
Two days after Kimmel’s comments, Trump-appointed FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr appeared to threaten ABC affiliates about carrying Kimmel’s show.
On a podcast, he said Kimmel’s commentary was “some of the sickest conduct possible.”
He added, “Frankly, when you see stuff like this, I mean, we can do this the easy way, or the hard way. These companies can find ways to change conduct, to take action, frankly, on Kimmel, or there’s going to be additional work for the FCC ahead,” Deadline reported.
Carr later claimed he wasn’t making threats. But two big owners of ABC affiliates might have thought otherwise.
Nexstar owns 32 affiliates and Sinclair Broadcast Group has 38 — including ones in Columbus and Dayton. Both companies temporarily canceled Kimmel’s show before later relenting amid public protest and pressure from ABC’s parent company, Disney.
Sinclair and Nexstar had reason to stay on Trump’s good side — they both have business before the FCC, said Stacy Mitchell, co-director of the Institute for Local Self Reliance, a prominent antitrust advocate.
In August, Sinclair announced a strategic review in which it would consider further acquisitions in the current deregulatory atmosphere.
“The company will evaluate all value-enhancing opportunities, including acquisitions, strategic partnerships, and business combinations, with potential partners in the broadcast and the broader media and technology ecosystem,” it said in a written statement.
Nexstar is trying to acquire the nation’s fourth-largest broadcaster, Tegna.
In a TikTok video recorded last week, Mitchell said that by being so big and trying to get bigger, the companies feel immense pressure to toe the political line imposed by the Trump administration.
“If you put too much power in a small number of media companies… they’re going to do the bidding of whatever master will allow them to make their profits,” she said. “I think we’ve understood in our history that you have to disburse economic power, because otherwise your freedom is ultimately at stake.”

It’s probably not that, although the entire incident demonstrates how little anyone gives our government institutions the benefit of the doubt these days.
Let me explain how I came to that conclusion.
I first wanted to drop by the library and see the scene for myself. So last week, I drove out to the lovely Leavenworth library.
The books from the fort were difficult to miss. They were arranged in multiple roller carts and being sold for a quarter apiece. By my rough estimate, there were several hundred books on the carts, mostly paperback volumes in good condition. Many had a stamp on the inside cover marking them as the military library’s property.
So the reader’s tip was correct on two substantial points. The books were there, and they came from the fort. But as I examined the titles, I came to feel that something was up other than the expulsion of DEI-connected titles. Sure, there were many books with the word “culture” in the title. But there were also volumes about Iran and North Korea, which seem worthy of continued study. There were also books included like Michael Lewis’ “Moneyball,” which seemed entirely off topic.
Most importantly, many of the books were available in multiple copies. For those familiar with the old days of university book stores, they looked like the stacks where students once had to buy their texts for the semester.
I purchased seven of the books — a shockingly affordable $1.75 — and headed home.



Discarded books
Some of the titles from Fort Leavenworth:

“Culture Matters: How Values Shape Human Progress,” by Lawrence E Harrison and Samuel P Huntington
“Fidel: A Critical Portrait,” by Tad Szulc
“The Geography of Thought: How Asians and Westerners Think Differently … and Why,” by Richard Nisbett
“Hidden Iran: Paradox and Power in the Islamic Republic,” by Ray Takeyh
“Imperial Life in the Emerald City: Inside Iraq’s Green Zone,” by Rajiv Chandrasekaran
“Kluge: The Haphazard Construction of the Human Mind,” by Gary Marcus
“Language Shock: Understanding The Culture Of Conversation,” by Michael H. Agar
“Motel of the Mysteries,” by David Macaulay
“A Splendid Exchange: How Trade Shaped the World,” by William J. Bernstein
“Turkey Unveiled: A History of Modern Turkey,” by Nicole Pope and Hugh Pope
“The World is Flat,” by Thomas Friedman
“The World’s Religions,” by Huston Smith”			




Once back, I sent an email to library director Matthew Nojonen and asked two questions. First, did he know why the books had been donated? Second, had he ever received such a large donation from the fort before?
This week, he responded.
“The books were donated because the CGSC no longer teaches the classes that used them,” he wrote. “I cannot recall receiving donations from the Post before but individual CGSC students have donated their used textbooks once they completed their coursework.”
There you have it. The Command and General Staff College at the base had changed courses and the library there no longer needed the books.
But there’s more.
You can access the library’s catalog online. I did spot checks for several of the volumes donated and found that copies remain at the fort. Yes, even those books with “culture” in the title can still be located and, presumably, checked out.
Inside one of the books for sale, readers can see the address and contact information for the Fort Leavenworth library. (Clay Wirestone/Kansas Reflector)
Unfortunately, we’re going through a government shutdown right now and the library has closed until Democrats and Republicans reach an agreement on reopening the government. So I’m not able to ask folks there about the books discarded and why so many came to the Leavenworth Public Library at once.
After all, military education decisions carry political weight as well. Why are some topics taught and others not? Were courses dealing with other countries and cultures pared back? Was this effort part of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s overall approach to a more manly, aggressive military?
Maybe. Again, I can’t say for sure.
This brings us to the whole crux of the matter. We live at a time when someone visiting a public library and seeing these books put out for sale can make reasonable assumptions. What has Hegseth or his boss, President Donald Trump, done to earn the benefit of the doubt?
As I write this, the Trump administration has been working mightily to deploy military forces to U.S. cities over the objections of mayors and governors. Anyone with eyes to see and ears to hear will wonder whether those in Washington, D.C., seek to cement authoritarian control over our nation.
As Fort Leavenworth casts off books and our nation waits to see what happens next, I sympathize with that jolt of fear.
On the other hand, you can pick up some great books for cheap.

Advocates aren't so sure.","Prince George's County Executive Aisha Braveboy (D) speaks at her swearing-in celebration at the Samuel Riggs IV Alumni Center at the University of Maryland, College Park in June. (Photo by Lauren Lifke/Maryland Matters)Prince George’s County Executive Aisha Braveboy says she has the utmost confidence in her nominee to run the county’s Department of the Environment, even though he was terminated from the department in 2014 for “gross negligence.”
A group of environmental and community activists in the county is not so sure. And they’re likely to be on hand Thursday when Samuel Belsham Moki’s nomination comes up before a County Council committee.
“I was just flabbergasted that someone who had caused such a grievance against the county on environmental issues would now be tapped to lead the Department of Environment,” said Carlo Sanchez, a lifelong county resident who represented the county’s 47th District in the Maryland House of Delegates from 2015 to 2018. “It’s just astounding, really.”
Sanchez said he is part of a loose group of environmental and community advocates who have coalesced in opposition to Moki’s nomination, have been reaching out to council members and who plan to speak out at public meetings.
The first opportunity is Thursday, when the council’s Transportation, Infrastructure, Energy and Environment Committee takes up Moki’s nomination. The five-member committee can issue a favorable or unfavorable recommendation on Moki’s appointment to the entire 11-member council, or it could vote to issue no recommendation at all.
Moki has been serving as acting director of the department since late June, when he was nominated by Braveboy.
It was later revealed that Moki had been terminated from the agency in 2014 over “gross negligence” and mismanagement of the county’s stormwater program. Stormwater violations accrued during Moki’s tenure cost the county thousands of dollars in fines.
Prince George’s County moves to put data center development on pause

Moki argued at the time that he had insufficient funds to handle the county’s obligation to control runoff, according to records from the county personnel board. But it found he had consistent access to a dedicated fund with tens of millions of dollars for stormwater management.
“The dishonesty about the budget was a significant violation of his employment by itself,” read the personnel board decision, signed by then-chair Carolyn F. Scriber. “His conduct calls into serious question the appellant’s trustworthiness and integrity.”
Moki challenged his termination before both the personnel board and in circuit court. Both bodies upheld his firing as justified, agreeing that he failed to manage the county’s compliance with Environmental Protection Agency mandates.
Since the firing was revealed, Braveboy has come out in full-throated support of her nominee. When asked for comment this week about the upcoming hearing, aides to the executive said she had nothing to add to her previous statements.
In an August news release, in response to questions from Maryland Matters, Braveboy passionately defended Moki’s aptitude for the post, arguing that his “record, credentials, and vision for the future of our environment speak louder than his past circumstances.”
Braveboy argued that Moki, who started with the county while Jack Johnson was executive, was terminated after a change in administration. Rushern Baker, who was elected in 2010, was reelected in 2014, the year Moki was fired.
She also said that during Moki’s tenure, the county was caught up in a period of “intensifying enforcement” of stormwater rules by the Environmental Protection Agency.
But advocates are not convinced, and are concerned that Moki’s appointment comes at a particularly delicate time for environmental policy in the county, as officials weigh rules for data center development in the county.
Tolson Banner, executive director of the Prince George’s Community Development Corp., a nonprofit focused on development issues, said it will be partially be the job of the county environmental agency to protect residents from noise pollution, air emissions — and the impacts of a data center’s significant water and power demands.
“Are we to believe that Samuel Moki will be able to do that, given the fact that he was fired for gross negligence? Are we to believe that?” asked Banner, a county resident for more than 20 years. “I doubt it very seriously. And these are the kinds of things that erode the public trust.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Taylor Frazier McCollum, a community advocate from Landover, started a Change.org petition to oppose a data center proposed for the old Landover Mall site, a petition that collected nearly 21,000 signatures since its debut in late June. Now, Frazier McCollum said she is spreading the word about Moki’s past.
“Once I found out about the history with his previous employment, it was like, ‘Why are we going to bring someone back that’s done us kind of dirty?’” she asked. “I don’t think that he’s the right choice.”
Braveboy issued an executive order on Sept. 12 placing a “temporary hold on accepting, considering, and processing permit applications” for data centers, while the county waits for research and recommendations that are due Nov. 30 from its Qualified Data Centers Task Force. Braveboy’s executive order expires on Dec. 31, 2025.
Braveboy told WTOP News that she supports data centers, but believes the county should pump the brakes because of resident concerns about their locations.
“I’m in support generally of data centers,” Braveboy said. “I do believe it’s a really good economic tool in the right locations.”
Staci Hartwell, a strategic adviser for the South County Environmental Justice Coalition, sits on the data center task force and worries that the pause is “performative,” and the county will end up green-lighting data center development regardless.
She said Moki’s appointment leaves her feeling worried for the future.
“It’s bad enough that they’re trying to take these data centers and ram them down our throats,” Hartwell said. “But then you’re going to put in place someone who has demonstrated that they’re not trustworthy?”
Banner said he’s concerned that the end result could be that county residents are disproportionately the victims of data center impacts, continuing a history of environmental racism in the majority-Black county.
“We know the history of environmental racism in this county, and in this nation. And we’re to believe that Moki is the best person suited to guard our interests?” Banner asked.
Maryland redrew an environmental justice map; polluted communities feel left out

Hartwell warned that appointing and confirming a candidate like Moki has the potential to send “shock waves through every corner” of the county agency.
“It tells staff people, it tells partners, it tells the broader community that accountability is optional, and that serious past failures can be rewarded with a promotion, instead of caution,” Hartwell said.
In a letter to the council, Braveboy wrote that Moki is “a distinguished public servant and policy expert with over two decades of leadership experience in environmental management, intergovernmental affairs, and academic instruction.”
She added that, in his prior tenure as associate director at the department, Moki “helped secure and manage” over $10 million in federal and state environmental grants, and “previously led major environmental programs and capital projects aimed at enhancing water quality, sustainability, and flood mitigation throughout the County.”
Her letter, addressed to Council Chair Edward P. Burroughs III, did not reference Moki’s termination.
Hartwell added that the nomination is particularly upsetting given that a number of qualified federal workers may be entering the job market as President Donald Trump (R) slashes the federal bureaucracy, including the Environmental Protection Agency.
“All of these brilliant — these stellar, great minds have been let go of the EPA. Some of them are residents here in Prince George’s County,” she said. “These are really reputable, credible people. Why are we not … looking at those people for candidates for this position?”
Local advocates say they’re still scratching their heads over the nomination — though they’re preparing to put up a fight.
“It just doesn’t add up. I don’t care what kind of math you’re using,” Banner said.
“I understand politics, but there’s some political decisions you should not gamble with,” he said. “With some political decisions you have to say, ‘No.’”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/DSC07841-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-08 02:56:52.119815

(File photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)A lawyer representing five unaffiliated voters is asking an Anne Arundel County Circuit Court judge to deny a motion to dismiss their suit challenging a state law that limits the participation of unaffiliated voters in Maryland primary elections.
The plaintiffs, represented by former Lt. Gov. Boyd Rutherford, are asking a judge to rule that state funding for partisan primaries violates their rights under the Maryland Constitution. An attorney representing the state is asking the judge to dismiss the lawsuit. The case is scheduled for an Oct. 20 motions hearing.
“This case, at its core, is a voting rights case,” Rutherford wrote on behalf of his clients. “It is not, as defendants suggest, a case brought to assert some violation of the Maryland Election law and to challenge a particular election outcome. Nor is it a taxpayer case.”
Instead, Rutherford said his clients are asserting that primary elections for the Democratic and Republican parties should not be paid for with tax dollars if nearly 1 million unaffiliated voters in the state cannot participate.
“In order to participate in their local elections process, they are faced with a ‘Faustian Choice’ : either they sacrifice their political beliefs and moral convictions and affiliate with one of the two majority parties for the opportunity to participate in the selection of a candidate, or stay silent and allow an increasingly smaller group of activists to select candidates,” Rutherford wrote.
“Yet, the Maryland Constitution does not require membership in a private party to exercise a citizen’s right of suffrage. The plaintiffs are challenging the state’s sponsorship of a closed primary system that denies plaintiffs their constitutional rights to vote ‘at all elections to be held in this state.'”
Justice Department, conservative law firm set sights on Maryland voter registrations

Rutherford represents five registered independent Maryland voters who are challenging state law that limits their ability to vote in primary elections. All five said they were barred from voting in the 2022 and 2024 primaries because they chose not to affiliate with a party.
Primary elections in Maryland are considered partially closed. Voters are required to affiliate with the Democratic or Republican parties to vote in most primary contests. Unaffiliated voters in Maryland can cast votes in state primaries only in nonpartisan races.
The lawsuit says the current current primary voting system is incompatible with the Maryland Constitution’s guarantee that voters have a right to vote in all elections in the state. If successful, the challenge could either force the state’s two majority parties to fund their own primaries or open the door to wider participation by unaffiliated voters.
Daniel Kobrin, an assistant attorney general representing the Maryland State Board of Elections, asked the court in July to dismiss the lawsuit, arguing its claims were based “solely as taxpayers.”
The motion filed by Kobrin also asks the judge to declare that the five voters have no right to challenge the restrictions on primary elections because of previous court decisions.
Kobrin noted two decisions by the Supreme Court of Maryland that said, “voters have no right under the state constitution to vote in the primary elections of a party to which they do not belong.”
In another case, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld closed primaries and a political party’s First Amendment right “not to associate,” which means it cannot be required to allow unaffiliated voters to participate, according to the motion filed by the board’s attorney
But Rutherford wrote that neither of those cases “involves a challenge to the constitutionality of the state’s endorsement of a closed primary system.”
“This is an open question that the Maryland Courts have yet to decide,” he wrote. “Accordingly, plaintiffs do in fact assert actionable constitutional claims, and the facts alleged provide sufficient basis upon which relief could be granted.”

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)Maryland joined 22 other jurisdictions urging the U.S. Supreme Court to take up, and reverse, a ruling that would prohibit individuals from challenging election laws and redistricting issues under the Voting Right Act.
The states’ brief, filed Monday, said the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals finding that only state and local governments can file challenges under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 takes away an essential tool in protecting voting rights. Section 2 prohibits racial discrimination in voting laws and policies.
The brief said about 91% of all Section 2 challenges from 1982 to 2024 came from private plaintiffs, and only about 7.5% were from attorneys general. The 2-1 ruling by a panel of 8th Circuit judges in May “is an outlier and wrong,” the states said, noting that the 8th Circuit is the only federal circuit to prohibit challenges to voting policies by private citizens.
The case, Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians v. Howe, stemmed from a lawsuit filed by tribes and individual voters against North Dakota Secretary of State Michael Howe, claiming that a state redistricting plan diluted the voting power of Native Americans, in violation of Section 2.
The Supreme Court this summer — at the urging of the attorneys general and others — put the 8th Circuit ruling on hold while the tribes and voters appealed the case to the Supreme Court.

Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown said that Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act is one of the “nation’s most important safeguards against racial discrimination in voting, and private enforcement has been central to its success for more than half a century.”
“The Eighth Circuit’s departure from decades of practice comes at exactly the wrong time – when federal enforcement has diminished and when millions of voters need protection heading into upcoming elections,” Brown said in prepared statement on the brief.
It comes a week before the court is scheduled to hold a second hearing on Louisiana v. Callais, which asks whether Louisiana violated the 14th or 15th Amendments — guaranteeing equal protection and voting rights — when it drew two majority-Black congressional districts in an attempt to comply with Section 2.
Former U.S. Attorney Eric Holder, speaking at last month’s Congressional Black Caucus Foundation conference in Washington, D.C., said the Supreme Court upheld Section 2 when it ruled Allen v. Milligan in 2023 that the state of Alabama’s new congressional map likely discriminated against Black voters.
“How are you now going to say that two years later something has happened and you’re now going to find Section 2 unconstitutional?” Holder asked. “Having said that, I worry about what the court is going to do, so we’ll have to see.”

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)LINCOLN — The Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission offered the state’s first medical cannabis cultivator licenses Tuesday, nearly a week after the voter-set deadline of Oct. 1.
Commissioners unanimously offered the first two of up to four cultivator licenses, a move challenging the Nebraska Attorney General’s Office, which had threatened to sue the commission if it did so. The first license offerings went to Nancy Laughlin-Wagner of Omaha, on behalf of the Midwest Cultivators Group LLC, and to Patrick Thomas of Raymond. 
Applicants have five business days to accept the license.
‘Do right by the people’
Someone who answered the number listed on the application for Laughlin-Wagner said the group would not immediately comment. Perry Pirsch, a lawyer working with Thomas, told the Nebraska Examiner that Thomas is “grateful for the opportunity that’s been granted to him.”
“I know that he will make the best out of it, responsibly, ethically, within the confines of the law, while trying to do right by the people of the State of Nebraska,” Pirsch said.

Thomas said in his application that he is a lifelong Nebraskan with more than 20 years of experience in agriculture, farming and land management. He is the owner and operator of Thomas Construction, a contracting business specializing in large-scale municipal water main projects. Thomas’ application listed Sarpy County Attorney Lee Polikov as a reference.
Thomas has a hemp cultivation license from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which he wrote that he would relinquish if he got a state license to grow medical cannabis.
The application for Laughlin-Wagner indicates she will serve as chief executive officer of Midwest Cultivators Group alongside Frank Hayes of Omaha as chief financial officer and Dave Kanne of Carroll, Iowa as chief operating officer.
Laughlin-Wagner is a registered nurse with more than two decades of executive leadership experience in hospital operations and managed care, according to the application. Hayes is the founder and president of Hayes & Associates LLC, a certified public accounting and consulting firm. Kanne has 30 years of agricultural and business management experience as co-owner of a family farming operation since 1993, which has 1,200 acres of corn and soybeans.
“We are committed to ensuring that our operations align with the commission’s standards, Nebraska law and the highest levels of compliance, safety and patient care,” the Midwest Cultivators Group leaders said in their application.
Any licensed cultivator can grow no more than 1,250 flowering plants at one time under commission regulations. The Medical Cannabis Commission plans to license transporters, product manufacturers and dispensaries at a future date.
Unclear rubric scoring
The commission also voted 3-0 to deny two other applications: Crista Eggers, for a facility in Yutan, and Casey Sledge, for a facility in Wayne. Eggers is executive director of Nebraskans for Medical Marijuana, the group that led the 2024 ballot measures that received approval from 71% of voters for legalizing medical cannabis and 67% of voters for a regulatory system.
Applicants needed an average score of more than 70 on a 100-point scale. Commissioners devised the business metrics but have not publicly released how it set them. The commission received 39 cultivator applications between Sept. 4 and Sept. 23, which were advanced for evaluation based on a random lottery system.

The average scores were 73.33 for Patrick Thomas, 72 for Nancy Laughlin-Wagner, 63.67 for Casey Sledge and 42.33 for Crista Eggers. The commission decided that an average of more than 70 made an application eligible for licensure.
Eggers’ application had the widest range, with evaluators scoring it at 11, 44 and 72 points.
Commissioner Lorelle Mueting of Gretna, a prevention specialist with Heartland Family Service, told reporters after the meeting that the scores closely followed commission regulations, which included requirements for a business and financial plan, growing location, security and more.
“The rubric went right through the regulations,” Mueting said, pulling out her annotated copy of the regulations. “Everything is in here that people needed to submit.”
Commissioners did not explain how Eggers’ scores ranged so widely, and they told reporters they were unwilling to say which commissioners gave what scores.
Public weighs in
The first licenses were set to be awarded Sept. 30 until the Sept. 29 resignations of Commissioners Bruce Bailey of Lincoln and Kim Lowe of Kearney, both of whom were part of an internal three-member evaluation team. Bailey had been the most supportive of a regulated but more permissive medical cannabis system, including for smoking marijuana.
Under the commission’s emergency regulations, set for a public hearing next week, future dispensaries could not sell raw cannabis flower, vapes, smokeables or edibles.
Nearly all members of the public testifying before the commission have opposed the proposed regulations, with some arguing that the voter-approved medical cannabis laws legalized all forms of cannabis for patient use and that smoking, for instance, might provide faster relief than tinctures or pills.

Maggie Ballard, also a prevention specialist at Heartland Family Service with Mueting, thanked the commission Tuesday for its work on a task she said is “as challenging as giving a cat a bath.” She said she particularly appreciated restrictions on smoking. Ballard testified in support of Gov. Jim Pillen’s appointment of Mueting to the commission in May.
“I just want to echo my appreciation and the appreciation of many, many Nebraskans that are either unaware of these meetings or have been way too afraid to speak up at these meetings, because they understand how polarized this topic has become,” Ballard said.
Lanette Richards of Scottsbluff, executive director of Monument Prevention, another drug prevention organization, also thanked the commission for regulations she said protect children.
“Even though this commission is setting guidelines for medical marijuana, we all know there is no difference between marijuana and medical marijuana,” Richards said.
Christy Knorr of Omaha, a hospice nurse, said a physician’s oath to do no harm includes medicine. She spoke of her wife’s fight with multiple myeloma, for which Knorr said marijuana helped provide some relief. Her wife died almost five years ago, and cannabis was the only medication to help take the edge off so she could sleep.
“People deserve choices in what medications they take,” Knorr said.

Lia Post of Springfield, a longtime medical cannabis advocate who said the medication helps her avoid opiates or other addictive substances, spoke in defense of Eggers as a mom who is trying to help her son. Post said whichever commissioner scored Eggers an “11” shouldn’t be on the commission.
“I would trade everyone in this room for one Crista Eggers, including myself,” Post said.
Next steps and legal threats
The commission’s regulations are in temporary “emergency” status, lasting up to 180 days max. The rules will go up for a public hearing at 1 p.m. Oct. 15 at the Nebraska State Office Building for up to three hours. No commissioner will be in attendance.
Commissioners will decide after that hearing whether to finalize the regulations, which would require approval from Attorney General Mike Hilgers and Pillen.
Zachary Pohlman, a deputy solicitor general for Nebraska, in March told state lawmakers during a legislative hearing on a separate legislative bill that federal law continues to criminalize marijuana. Pohlman said that if the Medical Cannabis Commission “tries” to issue licenses, “the Attorney General’s Office will challenge that action as preempted and unenforceable.”
A spokesperson for the AG’s Office declined Tuesday to comment on that previous position, which Hilgers has shared in court filings and public events.

Former State Sen. John Kuehn of Heartwell, a longtime marijuana opponent, continues to try to fight the laws in court, including through a similar preemption lawsuit. A Lancaster County District Court judge dismissed Kuehn’s latest lawsuit in June, which he is appealing to the Nebraska Supreme Court.
In a brief Monday to the Nebraska Supreme Court on that Kuehn case, the AG’s Office, as well as an outside attorney for the Medical Cannabis Commission, did not repeat the licensing argument but suggested another legal path to the courthouse door.
“The State itself could even challenge the Medical Cannabis Laws if, for example, it charges a defendant with illegal possession of cannabis, and the defendant raises the [Nebraska Medical Cannabis] Patient Protection Act as a defense,” the brief states.
Since the voter-approved law took effect in December, patients have legally been able to possess up to 5 ounces of medical cannabis in Nebraska with a health care practitioner’s recommendation.

The AG’s spokesperson declined to say Tuesday whether the state plans to challenge patient possession or whether any related guidance has been issued to local law enforcement.
Medical Cannabis Commission members have entered closed sessions at nearly every meeting to discuss “imminent” or “pending” litigation, which included Tuesday. Commissioners declined to comment on possible legal threats.
‘Good medicine’
Eggers, while not addressing her license application, asked commissioners to release the business grading rubric while expressing her gratitude for moving forward with licensing.
Said Eggers: “I hope that the individuals that receive these licenses are good people that have every intention of providing good medicine to the people of the state that so desperately need it.”
The next scheduled regular meeting of the commission is 1 p.m. Nov. 3 in the Nebraska State Office Building.

While the name of each evaluator was redacted on meeting materials, one commissioner’s evaluations ranged from 72 to 88, all passing. Scores from the other two evaluators ranged from 11 to 80. One appears to have given no passing scores, those higher than 70.

Bo Botelho, general counsel for the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services, which is assisting the Medical Cannabis Commission, said the rubric won’t be made public until after licenses are awarded. He said state agencies don’t typically disclose how evaluators score applications or contracts, partly so applicants answer equally.
“Like taking a test, if you know this question is worth a lot more, you may put a lot more information in there and not so much in the other ones, but those other ones are just as valuable,” Botelho said. “That’s why we generally don’t tell them how the scores are being divvied. We want the best response across the board.”
Botelho said “there’s no public purpose” to releasing who gave what score to which applicant.
“If there is a public purpose, I guess that argument can be made,” he continued. “But I would be afraid of that being used to maybe intimidate or harass an evaluator.”

(Photos by John Partipilo)Republican Matt Van Epps and Democrat Aftyn Behn will face off in a special election for the 7th Congressional District seat after securing their party nominations Tuesday.
Van Epps, the former Tennessee General Services Commissioner, won the GOP primary with around 49% of the 35,000 votes cast and Dickson state Rep. Jody Barrett finished in second with around 27%. Van Epps’ margin of victory was primarily driven by his support in Clarksville, where his military ties, support from former U.S. Rep. Mark Green, and a last-minute endorsement from President Donald Trump bolstered his path to victory. He also received a $750,000 boost from three dark money independent PACs — political action groups that aren’t required to disclose their donors —  including one that ran advertisements of him in his military uniform, calling him a “MAGA warrior.”
Behn, a Nashville state representative, narrowly won the Democratic primary with around 28% of the vote. All four Democrats running in the election received over 20%. When the race was called, Behn had only won one of the 14 counties in the district, but finished second in counties containing Nashville and Clarksville, where the majority of ballots were cast. Behn ran as a progressive outsider, advocating that the only way a Democratic candidate could win the heavily Republican district was with an energized turnout.
The district was previously represented by Green, a Clarksville Republican who was first elected to Congress in 2018, but resigned in July, triggering the special election. The 7th district encompasses the northern and western third of Davidson County, portions of Williamson and Montgomery Counties and about a dozen rural counties. It was redrawn in 2022, as part of the state Republicans’ successful gerrymandering that eliminated a U.S. House seat that covered all of Nashville.
The Republican primary included a field of 12 candidates, but Van Epps, Barrett and state reps. Gino Bulso and Lee Reeves emerged as the favorites in the race. The GOP candidates attempted to distinguish themselves from one another as they vied to demonstrate whose policies most closely aligned with those of President Donald Trump. 
The Democratic primary was a tight four-way race with Behn besting businessman Darden Copeland and fellow Nashville state Reps. Vincent Dixie and Bo Mitchell. All four of the candidates agreed they would serve as a check on Trump’s presidency. Copeland, a first-time candidate, earned 24.8% of the Democratic vote, followed by Rep. Bo Mitchell with 24% and Rep. Vincent Dixie got 23.2%.
Republicans currently hold a narrow 219-213 majority in the U.S. House. A Democratic win would not swing the majority but narrow it before the 2026 midterm elections. 
The winner of the Dec. 2 special election will have to run again in 2026 to secure a full term. 
How the Republican race played out
Almost $2.5 million of independent expenditures were used for mailers and TV advertisements. The School Freedom Fund, a pro-private school voucher group, spent nearly around $700,000 to target Barrett, who voted against the plan as a state representative. 
The School Freedom Fund played a pivotal role in Tennessee’s state House elections in 2024, spending almost $3.3 million to elect a slate of pro-voucher candidates, including Reeves. 
Van Epps outraised all the GOP opponents, but he also had a head start in the field when he announced his candidacy days after Green’s resignation.
Bulso put $500,000 of his own money into the race and Reeves spent $300,000 of personal funds. 
Polling a month before the election showed a dead heat between the four frontrunners, but in the final days, Van Epps secured the endorsement of Trump and Gov. Bill Lee. Reeves dropped out and endorsed Van Epps following Trump’s announcement.
How the Democratic race played out
Significantly less money was spent in the Democratic race compared to the Republicans. Copeland spent over $125,000 of his own money and raised the most of any candidate. 
But Behn, who has been working as a community organizer across the state since 2017, used her firebrand attitude at debates to distinguish herself from the rest of the group. 
It’s the second time in the last two years that Behn has taken on more centrist Democrats and emerged victorious. To win her state House election in a 2023 special election, she defeated a former member of the Metro Nashville Council who had been appointed to fill an unexpired term. 
Behn will enter the race as a significant underdog. 
The 7th district is rated a solid Republican seat, despite the special election. Green won the seat by 20 percentage points in the two elections since it was redrawn to include parts of Nashville. 
This is a developing story.

(Photo by Tom Williams-Pool/Getty Images)The FBI searched the cellphone records of Republican Alaska Sen. Dan Sullivan and seven other U.S. senators and a member of the U.S. House as part of its investigation into the Jan. 6, 2021 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, a newly released document shows.
The call logs cover several days during and around the insurrection, when rioters stormed the Capitol in an attempt to support then-incumbent President Donald Trump, who falsely claimed to have won reelection in 2020.
The logs do not show that the FBI obtained phone call recordings, only that an investigating agent was interested in who the senators were talking to, when they talked, how long they talked, and where the callers were. The document, released this week by the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, does not say why those senators were identified in particular and it does not say whether any investigative leads resulted from the records.
According to a news release from the committee, the FBI sought and obtained data about the senators’ phone use in the days before, on and after the Jan. 6 insurrection, from Jan. 4 through Jan. 7, 2021. 
The U.S. Department of Justice indicted Trump in 2023 for allegedly conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election, but the special prosecutor in charge of the investigation abandoned that case after Trump was re-elected in 2024. Department policy says that sitting presidents cannot face criminal prosecution, and after the 2021 insurrection, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a decision limiting a president’s liability for conduct while in office.
Asked whether Sullivan had any contact with people who participated in or organized the riot at the U.S. Capitol, Devyn Shea, a spokesperson for Sullivan, said, “absolutely not.”
In a written statement, Sullivan called the FBI investigation “an absolute outrage.”
“We’ve just learned the Biden FBI was engaged in what appears to be an unprecedented fishing expedition against at least nine sitting Republican members of Congress — none of whom were under any type of investigation — surveilling our personal cell phone calls with family members, staff and colleagues. This is a new low in the political weaponization of the Justice Department,” Sullivan’s statement said.
The other seven senators were Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.), Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), and Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.). Rep. Mike Kelly (R-Pa.) was also on the FBI list.
Some senators, including Hawley and Tuberville, voted to object to the certification of the electoral results of the 2020 election. 
Sullivan voted to support the certification of the election, and in a statement the day after the Jan. 6 violence at the Capitol, he called the event “sad” and “dispiriting.”
All have been supporters of Trump and his policies; in office, Sullivan has been a reliable vote for the president and his agenda.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/GettyImages-1230800959-700x467-1.jpg,,,2025-10-07 21:57:06.324147

Tim Walz said he anticipates President Donald Trump will send troops to the Twin Cities as part of the president’s campaign to target Democratic-led cities under the pretext of stamping out violent crime. “It’d be logical for them to come here. We fall into exactly what it looks like they’re trying to target — […],"New York Times correspondent Lisa Lerer (left) on Tuesday. Oct. 7, moderated a panel with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (center) and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker (right). (Photo by Michelle Griffith/Minnesota Reformer)Gov. Tim Walz said he anticipates President Donald Trump will send troops to the Twin Cities as part of the president’s campaign to target Democratic-led cities under the pretext of stamping out violent crime.
“It’d be logical for them to come here. We fall into exactly what it looks like they’re trying to target — blue cities in places that he wants to make an impact,” said Walz, who was speaking at a high-dollar business summit hosted by the Minnesota Star Tribune Tuesday.
Walz’s dark premonition comes as Trump deployed Texas National Guard troops to Illinois Tuesday. Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, who also appeared on the Strib panel the same day the troops arrived in his state, said the National Guard troops were assembling at a training center in Ellwood, Illinois, about an hour away from Chicago.
Illinois has sued to stop Trump’s deployment, and a court hearing on the motion is scheduled for Thursday. The court refused to immediately block Trump’s deployment of National Guard troops
“They are not on the streets of Chicago. I’m not getting any information directly from the government or from the National Guard. They’ve been federalized,” Pritzker said. “We don’t know exactly where this is going to end. What we know is that it is striking fear in the hearts of everybody in Chicago.”
Pritzker, who is a potential Democratic presidential candidate, said Trump’s claim of rampant crime across Chicago was “complete b.s.,” and Trump was “out of his mind and has dementia.”
Walz added: “I think it’s really important for the citizens to see — this is not normal.”
Walz’s prediction of soldiers on the streets of the Twin Cities comes on the day new reporting indicates crime is falling in Minneapolis across all major categories.
In June, Trump deployed the National Guard to California to quell protests against immigration raids. He also sent troops to Washington D.C., using crime rates and a large homeless population as the pretext. Earlier this week, Trump attempted to send troops to Portland, Oregon, before a federal judge stopped him.
Throughout the bleak, 45-minute panel discussion, the two governors described a federal government hellbent on growing its own power and quashing its political enemies. The pair also described how states have a limited ability to combat the feds, though governors of the Democratic states are seen as a key bulwark against Trump.
Walz and Pritzker said now is the time to face the federal government head-on, especially because Trump is becoming more brazen.
“It’s not easy not to choose to be an upstander, but this is exactly the moment for people to stand up,” Pritzker said.
The two joked about Trump arresting them, but when pressed, said it’s possible.
The governors were also asked about how Democrats can win future elections.
Walz said Democrats can’t merely oppose Trump — they need to show their positive vision for the country.
Both governors said Democrats need to run on kitchen table economic issues before they campaign on issues like upholding democracy in the U.S.
Walz, who is running for an unprecedented, third, four-year term said if he wins next year he will not run for president.
Pritzker said he hasn’t decided on a presidential run. He said he’d struggle to leave the people of Illinois at this political moment.
“I do not feel like I can abandon the people of my state in this moment, especially with Donald Trump as president,” Pritzker said.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_3701-1024x659.jpg,,,2025-10-07 21:57:06.324147

(Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)Standing at Independence Mall, the three members who represent Philadelphia in the U.S. House stood with federal workers and called on President Donald Trump and Republicans to come to the table to negotiate a spending plan to end the government shutdown.
“The only way this is going to end is through negotiation,” said Congressman Brendan Boyle (D-2nd District), who is the top Democrat on the House Budget Committee. “We should not be doing this to our fellow American citizens who are public servants.”
The federal government has been shut down since Oct. 1, as a result of lawmakers failing to reach an agreement on a spending bill. Republicans control the House and Senate.
With the government shutdown, all non-essential services have been suspended and several hundred thousand federal employees and active-duty service members will work without pay, NPR reports. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that approximately 750,000 federal employees would be furloughed each day of the shutdown.
“The reality is this, this is a completely unnecessary shutdown,” Boyle said. “This Republican shutdown is being forced by President Trump because he wants it.”

Congresswoman Mary Gay Scanlon (D-5th District) criticized the Trump administration’s positions on healthcare, taxes, tariffs, and other social programs.
“I’ll be doing everything I can, as my colleagues will be, to help you weather this storm, this attack on the federal workforce and on the federal government itself,” Scanlon said.
Scanlon told the Capital-Star that her office is already receiving phone calls from those who are concerned about receiving notices about healthcare premium increases.
“We’re here with unions who ordinarily are screaming that the only thing they care about is ending a government shutdown because of the impact on the workers,” she said. “But, here we have an administration that has already done such damage to the federal workforce that the unions are saying, ‘No, we need to all push back together against this administration.’”
Republican elected officials have blamed Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and Democrats for the ongoing shutdown.

Phil Glover, national vice president for the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) District 3, is part of a union that represents 30,000 federal employees across the state, with approximately 9,000 to 12,000 located in the Philadelphia area.
“It’s unacceptable to our members,” Glover said of the current government shutdown. “All of our members here are either working every day with no pay, or they’re home on furlough and not getting paid.”
He told the Capital-Star on Tuesday that roughly 85% of union members are still working, while the rest have been furloughed, thus far.
Glover mentioned employees still on the job are with the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) at airports, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Bureau of Prisons, and more.
Another concern Glover has are the threats made by the White House budget office to potentially fire government employees as the shutdown continues.
“This is bad stuff,” Glover said. “This is not helpful to the economy, and it’s not helpful to employees trying to put food on the table for their families, and the American public needs to wake up to what this is.”
Danny Bauder, president of the Philadelphia AFL-CIO, led workers at the rally with a chant saying “when workers rights are under attack,” they “stand up, fight back.”

He said the shutdown was an effort by the Trump administration to “squeeze people” and make them hurt economically.
Glover also called for union solidarity.
“Unions need to get together and speak out. Unions do not need to be divided by this administration with ‘Here’s a little contract here. Here’s a little handshake here,’” Glover said. “Every union in this country needs to get together and say, ‘Enough is enough’ of this administration and what they’re doing to the federal workers, and what they’re doing to regular workers.”
Boyle noted that it was not the first time he joined a protest in front of Independence Hall during Trump’s second term. A few months prior, Boyle and others held a press conference voicing their displeasure of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) firing federal workers.
While the federal government remains without a budget plan, Pennsylvania also remains the only state in the nation that has not passed some form of a budget for the next fiscal year.
Although the House does not have votes scheduled for the remainder of the week, Boyle said he is going to Washington D.C. tomorrow to find Republicans willing to negotiate an end to the shutdown.

Union leaders disagree with Fetterman’s support of GOP stop-gap spending bill
On Monday, the U.S. Senate voted 52-42 for the fifth time on a stopgap funding proposal to fund the government at Biden-era spending levels until late November. It needed 60 votes to advance.
Just three elected officials crossed the aisle to join Republicans in this spending proposal, including U.S. Sen. John Fetterman (D-Pa.).
Fetterman said it was a sad day for the nation leading into the government shutdown.
“I voted AYE to extend ACA tax credits because I support them — but I won’t vote for the chaos of shuttering our government,” Fetterman said. “My vote was for our country over my party. Together, we must find a better way forward.”
Glover told the Capital-Star that he’s communicated with Fetterman’s staff “quite a bit,” and said the senator’s reason is that government employees shouldn’t be a bargaining chip during a shut down and instead, should be paid.
“The problem with that idea is that they’re not bargaining,” Glover said.
Glover noted the previous continuing resolution passed in March, which was supported by Fetterman, was followed by the Trump administration making cuts to the federal workforce.
“There’s all these different pieces of the federal agencies that they’re just ripping apart without the Congress approving it,” Glover said. “And that’s our argument, is you got to put some protections in here, in any funding bill going forward to protect the federal workforce from these crazy cuts. It just doesn’t make sense.”

“I don’t care for Senator Fetterman’s logic and rationale when it comes to this,” the AFL-CIO’s Bauder said. “I think that given the overwhelming support for the federal government workers and their union that we are seeing and the fact that those organizations, those unions, don’t want to be shut down, but they want it to be very clear to the public who it is that shut the government down, and it was shut down by the Trump White House, by Speaker Johnson, and by the Republican Senate.”
“And so by playing footsie with the Senate Republicans, and by legitimizing their nonsense, all he is doing is elevating it and making it look like what it is that they’re trying to do is really helpful,” he added.
Glover had a simple message for Fetterman.
“He needs to go to his Republican buddies, whoever he’s working with on that side, because he seems to have aligned to the Republican Party,” Glover said. “Go use it. Get federal workers back to work. Negotiate. Get your colleagues to negotiate. That’s all we’re asking for.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/uscapitolstop2025-1024x722.jpg,,,2025-10-07 21:57:06.324147

BURLINGTON – Kelli Perkins knows she’s stepping into an equity role that has seen significant turnover in challenging times.
“I do feel a cautious optimism,” said Perkins, who was appointed Burlington’s director of racial equity, inclusion and belonging last month. 
“I feel like the mayor is ready to make it a priority to get this office back on a stable footing and to become a solid, permanent part of the Burlington city landscape, and so I feel excited for that partnership,” she said.

The five-year-old city department has been a revolving door of Black women leaders leaving amid a perceived lack of support. 
The equity director position was first created by the City Council with then-Mayor Miro Weinberger’s support in 2019. The new role represented a milestone in the city’s decades of efforts to advance equity, Weinberger said at the time.
During the Black Lives Matter movement and the racial reckoning that heightened after the murder of George Floyd in summer 2020, the REIB office grew to 15 full-time employees. It dispensed special pandemic recovery funds to businesses owned by people of color under Tyeastia Green, the city’s first director of racial equity, inclusion and belonging.

But Green’s tenure was marked by public disagreements with the mayor over how the city should address systemic racism. Weinberger was criticized after he initially sidelined her from a policing study and later launched an investigation into a Juneteenth event that Green helped organize that did not unearth any fraud but found alleged mismanagement. 
City leaders and advocates said Green was unfairly targeted based on her race, and that reflected persistent bias in city and state politics. Weinberger’s spokesperson at the time defended the mayor’s record on racial equity and the reasons for the review.
“It’s a hard job, often isolating, particularly when you are the lone dissenting voice in the room,” said Green, who came from Minnesota, and started work in April 2020. She held the position for nearly two years, and now lives in Illinois.
Green resigned in February 2022 but declined to comment last week on her experience, except to say that community engagement was a challenge during the pandemic.
She said she is “rooting for Kelli” to bring the position back up to where it should be: to fight for fairness and inclusion, to consider racial justice in city decisions, and to influence policy in a way that makes Burlington a place where constituents and employees can feel supported.
“Kelli is an excellent choice,” she said in an interview last week. “I think that Kelli is going to be the one that can actually bring this position back to where it should be.”
As the third Black woman to step into the top role, which also had three interim directors, Perkins is aware of but seems unfazed by the department’s embattled history. 
She said she hopes to figure out root causes of any issues that persist at a time when DEI efforts are under attack and Black women are bearing the brunt of federal dismissals nationwide, as The Guardian recently reported.
“Right now in America, the landscape is that Black women are the ones who are losing jobs in this anti-DEI landscape and are the most affected,” Perkins said last week in an interview. “So I think this is a really good opportunity for Burlington to really be on the front end, really trying to figure out where we fall in that and what needs to happen.”
Perkins brings two decades of experience at the intersection of educational administration, human resources and diversity, equity and inclusion. She was most recently at Vital Communities, an Upper Valley nonprofit, has a doctorate in education from Northeastern University and a master’s in adult education from North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, according to a press release.

A revolving door
Almost eight months after Green resigned in February 2022, Weinberger appointed Kimberly Carson, director of education and human capital development at the Iowa Judicial Branch, to the director position in November 2022 and allocated nearly $2 million to the REIB office. Carson left after 18 months for a new position in North Carolina.
Following Carson’s departure, Burlington elected its first female and openly LGBTQ+ mayor in March 2024, a Progressive who ran on a platform of racial justice and equity.
In one her first tasks as mayor, however, Emma Mulvaney-Stanak slashed the REIB department’s funding in an effort to balance a $13 million budget deficit, including leaving the top position vacant. She also directed the office to be funded by the general fund, a move away from dependence on one-time monies.

The work continued under Christian Berry, a Black woman who was already in the REIB office, who took on the role of interim director and continued providing language access to city residents, developed a plan for equity-based education and training for employees and organized the annual Juneteenth celebration in the Queen City.
Originally from Tennessee, Berry holds a master’s degree from the University of Vermont and is an adjunct professor at the Community College of Vermont. She moved into the equity office late 2023 from her job as the workforce development director in the state Health Department.
At last month’s press conference to announce Perkins’ hire, councilors thanked Berry for her continued hard work. She reverted this week to her former role as the communications and community engagement manager.
The official interim director since November 2024, Berry said she has unofficially led the office since she joined the office in October 2023.
Berry’s accomplishments include setting multi-year strategic vision and implementation plan, launching a new grant program and strengthening relationships with community organizations – all with a staff of three, she said in an interview.
Calls for the city to hire locally and internally for the office were among criticisms around retention voiced in the past. Mulvaney-Stanak called Berry “a steady and thoughtful leader” in her State of the City address this year and said she values promoting employees from within. 
Berry said she applied and interviewed for the director position but is equally happy to be on Perkins’ team. “I’m excited to work with her,” she said.

The hiring process is confidential and Perkins was chosen after a national search that netted more than 40 applications. The candidates interviewed were all Vermont-based, said Joe Magee, the deputy chief of staff for the mayor.
Mulvaney-Stanak “is deeply committed to the work of REIB,” Magee wrote in an email Tuesday. Despite having to make “difficult decisions around staffing and programming citywide,” she has protected five full-time positions in the office, he added.
Since Mulvaney-Stanak became mayor, she has worked to clarify the purpose and vision of the department, encouraged department leaders to set goals via an equity lens, fueled cross-departmental collaborations to further integrate the work of the REIB office – such as developing employee trainings on equity with HR – into city government, Magee added.
The REIB office currently has four positions staffed and one vacancy with salaries totaling $390,603.00. An additional $87,360 is budgeted for seasonal expenses, Magee said.
Under the leadership of Perkins, the mayor hopes the REIB office will continue to lead the work to deepen the city’s commitment to racial equity, inclusion and belonging, both in the community and within city government, he added.
Perkins said she plans to build relationships and foster change by having critical conversations about equity with stakeholders in the city and with residents in Burlington.
“It is my goal to continue to elevate the work of this department in breaking down the power dynamics of privilege that exist in our city that we can see and embrace the humanity in all of us,” she said during the brief appointment ceremony at City Hall on Sept. 25. “Burlington can be a city where anyone can thrive and I’m ready to engage in the work ahead to make this a reality.”
Mia Schultz, president of the Rutland Area NAACP, encouraged the city to provide Perkins with the support, stability and resources she needs to succeed in the role. 
It is unfortunate, she wrote in an email last week, that a key office, created to center belonging and accountability for the whole community, has turned into a revolving door. “That doesn’t just weaken the office. It undercuts the entire promise of equity in Burlington,” Schultz said.
City councilors echoed support of the new director last month. 
City Councilor Melo Grant, chair of the REIB city council committee, said at last week’s press conference she is pleased Perkins has taken on the role “to strengthen the department and to help people in the community be less afraid, because people are afraid of this work right now.”
The work of the REIB office is “vital” in the current climate to ensure equity and inclusivity all around, said City Council President Ben Traverse during the press conference announcing the new hire. 
“If Burlington is to remain a resilient community in the face of attacks on DEI at the federal level, we must remain steadfast in our commitment to this work locally,” he said in the press release.

Wylie Galt, R-Martinsdale, during a press conference on MEPA legislation, Wednesday, Feb. 12, 2025.Montana’s Department of Environmental Quality is seeking public input on how state agencies collect and analyze greenhouse gas emissions during environmental reviews.
The effort comes out of Senate Bill 221, which directed the Department of Environmental Quality to develop new guidance on greenhouse gas emission assessments in a way that prevents industry and development from becoming bogged down in regulation and litigation.
Signed by Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte, SB 221 was carried by Sen. Wylie Galt, R-Martinsdale, and drew bipartisan support from both chambers.
“Our next steps will be to develop that guidance document that will outline exactly how we will do greenhouse gas assessments for fossil fuel activities, as well as what parameters we’ll look at for non-fossil fuel activities,” Sonja Nowakowski, director of DEQ, said when the bill was signed. “These will be very open and transparent processes, and we look forward to engaging with the public and getting everyone’s input as we move forward.”
In 2025, the bill was among a suite of laws the Montana Legislature passed in response to the state Supreme Court’s decision to uphold a youth-led constitutional lawsuit that found the state could not limit analysis of greenhouse gas emissions during the environmental review process.
In a 6-1 decision in Held v. Montana, the Supreme Court affirmed the Lewis and Clark District Court order that Montana’s constitutional guarantee of a “clean and healthful environment” includes a stable climate system.
The ruling was widely panned by Republican officials across Montana. Legislative leaders told the courts to “buckle up” in response to the decision, and brought a number of bills aimed at changing the judicial system as well as addressing the Held decision and reforming the Montana Environmental Policy Act.
“In the Held v. Montana court case, they tried to twist MEPA into something it was never meant to be — a tool to deny permits and block development,” House Speaker Brandon Ler, R-Savage, said at a signing ceremony of legislation in response to Held on May 1. “With the signing of this MEPA reform package, we’re making it clear that Montana’s environmental policy is about reform decision making, not weaponizing and litigation.”
The department published its draft guidance document on Oct. 1 and is now seeking “substantive public comments” through the end of the month.
Agencies will use the document as a framework for gathering and evaluating greenhouse gas emission data and potential impacts to Montana’s environment while conducting environmental assessments and environmental impact statements required by MEPA.
Under SB 221, state agencies must conduct a greenhouse gas assessment for all fossil fuel projects, as well as for projects involving stationary combustion devices, construction and mobile engine operation, and ecological functions.
The draft document defines greenhouse gas emissions as gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and fluorinated gases that are released into the atmosphere.
It also provides for how agencies should calculate emissions from a project based on size and project type, as well as providing both qualitative and quantitative perspectives on the secondary impacts that greenhouse gas emissions would have on the human environment.

The bureau reviewed the Wyoming senator's phone records as part of an investigation into attempts to overturn the 2020 presidential election. 
The post The FBI and Lummis’ phone records — what we know so far appeared first on WyoFile .","The FBI analyzed phone records of nine Republican lawmakers, including Wyoming U.S. Sen. Cynthia Lummis, as part of an investigation into efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election, according to information released Monday by GOP senators. 
“The FBI in 2023 sought and obtained data about the senators’ phone use from January 4 through January 7, 2021,” according to a press release from Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley of Iowa. The committee oversees the FBI. 
The data does not include the content of the calls, the release said, but shows “when and to whom a call is made, as well as the duration and general location data of the call.” 
Included in the release was a copy of a one-page FBI document dated Sept. 27, 2023, which lists Lummis alongside seven other U.S. senators and one U.S. representative. Several parts of the document were redacted.  
“FBI special agent [redacted] conducted preliminary toll analysis on limited tolls records associated with the following US Senators,” the document states. 
Alongside some of the other listed Republicans, Lummis is accusing the bureau of more than what is indicated in the document, including espionage. 
“I’m absolutely appalled that the Biden administration used the FBI to spy on the private communications of Republican U.S. Senators — myself included,” Lummis said in a statement to WyoFile. “This was a blatant assault on our constitutional rights as elected officials and a calculated attempt to sabotage the separation of powers.” 
Lummis is calling for “immediate investigation and prosecution,” and that those responsible “be held accountable” to ensure “this abuse of power can never happen again.”
The document does not indicate why the phone records of Lummis, or the other eight Republicans, were of particular interest to the FBI. 
However, most of the nine lawmakers took varying actions to overturn the 2020 presidential election. Lummis, for example, voted against certifying election results in Pennsylvania, where President Joe Biden won, after armed protestors broke into the Capitol. 
Lummis has her own theory for why she was included. 
“The only reason I can think of why the FBI felt it had to spy on me and my Republican colleagues is that we support President Trump,” Lummis said Tuesday in a post on X. 
Lummis was not available for an interview with WyoFile before this article was published. 
At a Senate committee hearing Tuesday with Attorney General Pam Bondi, Republican lawmakers pointed to the FBI document as proof that the Biden administration had politicized the federal agency. They also repeatedly denounced Jack Smith, the former special counsel who indicted President Donald Trump for conspiracy and other crimes related to Jan. 6.
After Trump won in 2024, the Justice Department dropped the case as part of a longstanding policy that says sitting presidents cannot face criminal prosecution.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)The day after the Utah Legislature voted on its preferred congressional map as part of the state’s court-ordered redistricting process, plaintiffs in the state’s redistricting lawsuit filed a new complaint in court, claiming that Utah lawmakers have yet again overstepped their constitutional authority. 
The plaintiffs, in the complaint filed Tuesday, allege Utah lawmakers have passed another law undermining the “core anti-gerrymandering goal” of a 2018 voter-approved initiative known as Proposition 4 “for no compelling reason,” and it therefore violates Utahns’ right to alter or reform their government. 
The complaint alleges SB1011 — a bill lawmakers passed into law Monday that requires three statistical tools to determine whether a congressional map favors one party over another — violates the Utah Constitution. It also urges 3rd District Judge Dianna Gibson to block it from taking effect, preliminarily and permanently. 
Utah Legislature picks congressional map supported by Republican party

“Rather than comply with Proposition 4’s prohibition on partisan gerrymandering, the Legislature has rushed to amend the law to neuter that prohibition by enacting (SB1011),” the plaintiffs’ attorneys wrote in the complaint. “Worse yet, it has changed Proposition 4 to require partisan gerrymandering in favor of the majority party in Utah — contrary to the major purpose behind the voters’ reform.” 
As of Tuesday, Gibson had not yet weighed in on plaintiffs’ new complaint. 
As Utah’s redistricting legal battle continues to play out, Gibson is expected to pick a new congressional map — either the Legislature’s or one of two proposed by the plaintiffs — by Nov. 10, the final deadline for new boundaries to be in place for the 2026 elections. 
Unless Gibson declares SB1011 unconstitutional and blocks it from taking effect, she’ll have to pick a map that passes all three of its statistical tests. 
Sen. Brady Brammer, R-Pleasant Grove, sponsored SB1011, which was approved by a vote of the Utah Legislature during a special session on Monday, when lawmakers also voted to approve their preferred congressional map — a map the Utah Republican Party also urged its members to support — to submit to Gibson to consider as a replacement to the 2021 congressional boundaries she has voided.

In previous rulings, the Utah Supreme Court and Gibson has sided with the plaintiffs in their claims that the Utah Legislature overstepped when it repealed and replaced Proposition 4 — which sought to create an independent redistricting commission — with a new law that weakened the voter-approved law and turned the independent redistricting commission into an advisory body that lawmakers could ignore. 
The 2021 congressional maps, which the plaintiffs have alleged were a “blatant gerrymander,” were a product of an unconstitutional process, Gibson ruled, and she ordered Utah go through a new redistricting process in court to remedy the map ahead of the 2026 elections.
In that ruling, Brammer argued Gibson “invited” lawmakers to clarify Proposition 4’s “general” and “nonspecific” language regarding what tools should be used to evaluate redistricting maps. His bill requires congressional maps, specifically, to pass a set of these statistical methods to test whether they favor or disfavor any political party: the partisan bias test, an ensemble analysis, and the mean-median difference test.

As Democrats did in the House and Senate chamber on Monday, the redistricting lawsuit’s plaintiffs allege that those tests — especially the partisan bias test — are the “worst available” tools to use in a “lopsided” state like Utah, where Republicans outnumber Democrats by hundreds of thousands statewide, but Democrats are concentrated in areas including Salt Lake County, which the 2021 congressional map cracked into four districts. 
SB1011 “profoundly impairs Proposition 4’s prohibition on partisan gerrymandering in several ways,” the plaintiffs’ complaint says. “Its primary feature is to infect the law with a cherry-picked test, the ‘partisan bias’ test, that is universally known to be inappropriate for use in states like Utah that are not politically competitive in statewide elections.”
The partisan bias test, the complaint says, “requires assuming a counterfactual scenario in which each of two parties receives an even share of the statewide vote, to compare the expected seat share of the two parties in that scenario.”
“It asks, in other words, what share of seats each party would win in a hypothetical scenario where the statewide vote is perfectly tied at 50-50,” the complaint continues. “And if one party wins more seats under a given redistricting plan than the other in this scenario, the plan exhibits partisan bias.” 
Utah Republican, Democratic party leaders spar over picking preferred congressional map

Applying that test in states like Utah “causes false and irrational results,” the complaint says. “It labels maps that provide the minority party (here, Democrats) with a single district biased against Democrats because they would not win a second district in the imaginary world in which elections suddenly become tied statewide. The test prioritizes focusing on the imaginary world of tied elections over the actual world of lopsided statewide reforms.” 
“Thus, it labels maps that provide Democrats zero districts unbiased against them and maps that provide Democrats one district biased against them,” the complaint says. “This makes no sense in the real world of Utah elections, and it’s why the political scientists who developed the test have repeatedly warned it should not be applied to noncompetitive states like Utah. This is a universally accepted view.” 
The other two tests in SB1011 — the mean-median difference test and an ensemble analysis — also shouldn’t be used to assess partisan gerrymandering in “noncompetative” states, plaintiffs’ attorneys wrote. 
“The mean-median difference metric does not detect cracking gerrymanders in a state like Utah, which is how any disadvantage to the minority party in Utah generally manifests,” the complaint says, contrasting that with another statistical tool called the efficiency gap, which is designed to detect both cracking and packing. In redistricting, “cracking” is a term used to describe splitting up a geographically compact minority population, while “packing” refers to concentrating groups of voters into a small number of districts.
Plaintiffs submit 2 congressional maps to judge as Utah lawmakers vote on their own

The ensemble analysis also has “serious design flaws that impair Proposition 4’s reforms,” the complaint adds. 
All together, SB1011’s changes to Proposition 4 create a framework that the complaint called “a wolf in sheep’s clothing” — while also noting that the bill was written as only applicable to assessing congressional maps, not other types of maps like legislative districts. 
“Here’s why,” the complaint says. “The partisan bias test operates irrationally in Utah. It labels congressional maps (which have just four districts) that are obviously extreme gerrymanders as ‘unbiased’ and maps that are partisan neutral ‘biased.’ For congressional maps, this irrational feature of the test singularly benefits Republicans.” 
However, when applied to the state’s legislative districts, the partisan bias test deems those maps as “extremely biased,” the complaint says, “while other more appropriate tests like the efficiency gap do not.” 
“The fact that (SB1011) seizes upon the partisan bias test’s irrationality only when it benefits the majority party and not when it harms the majority party is a perfect illustration of how the new law requires, rather than prohibits, party favoritism in redistricting,” the complaint says. 
As a whole, SB1011 “severely restricts the available data and scientific and statistical methods,” plaintiffs allege. Instead of applying the “best available” measures as Proposition 4 calls for, “it applies the worst available. And it makes the worst available measures exclusive, prohibiting use of the best available measures.”

(Photo courtesy of Des Moines Public Schools)Des Moines Public Schools officials may be considering the use of E-Verify, a federal system for checking job applicant’s ability to legally work in the U.S., following the immigration arrest of former Superintendent Ian Roberts.
The Des Moines School Board moved Friday to sue JG Consulting, the firm contracted in the search leading to Roberts’ hire, saying that his immigration status, previous criminal charges, and falsification of other parts of his resume such as his education credentials, should have been brought to their attention during the hiring search and background check process.
Josh Romero, the attorney for JG Consulting, said in a statement Friday that Roberts had provided necessary verification of his ability to legally work in the U.S. by completing the I-9 employment eligibility verification form and submitted other required documentation during the hiring process.
But some officials say further vetting on applicants’ immigration status should have been performed. One step that has been called for is the use of E-Verify, the federal web-based system that uses federal documentation to check job applicants’ legal eligibility to work in the country.
U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley released further information on the U.S. Department of Homeland Security responding to his request Sept. 30 seeking additional information about Roberts’ criminal and immigration history. According to a release from Grassley, DHS officials shared with the Iowa Republicans’ office that Des Moines Public Schools has never been enrolled in the E-Verify system.
The federal officials also said if E-Verify was used in Roberts’ case, his immigration status should have been flagged.
“Based on the facts that USCIS is aware of, Mr. Roberts should have not possessed any valid documentation evidencing employment authorization,” the DHS response to Grassley’s office read. “If an E-Verify case had been created using an expired Employment Authorization Document (EAD), it would have resulted in a nonconfirmation.”
Phil Roeder, a DMPS spokesperson, said in a statement the district had not violated any laws by not confirming Roberts’ ability to work using the E-Verify system.
“While the school district does not currently use E-Verify, and it is not a requirement of Iowa employers, the information presented by the superintendent candidate on and with the I-9 form was consistent with the claim that he was a U.S. citizen,” Roeder said. “The district will continue to cooperate with and respond to state and federal officials on any issue.”
State lawmakers have proposed requiring employers use E-Verify during recent legislative sessions. In 2024, the Iowa Senate approved a measure requiring employers to use the federal system in addition to prohibiting businesses from knowingly employing an “unauthorized alien employee.” These measures have failed to advance in the House in previous legislative sessions.
Senate Majority Leader Mike Klimesh said in a statement Tuesday the Roberts situation “has highlighted the need for policies at the state level to combat illegal immigration” — and that he expects conversations on requiring employers to use E-Verify will come up in 2026.
“In the past several years, Senate Republicans have passed bans on sanctuary cities, given local law enforcement more tools to enforce immigration laws at the state level, and have passed E-Verify legislation several times,” Klimesh said. “E-Verify and other issues to address illegal immigration will continue to be a topic of conversation amongst Senate Republicans over the coming weeks and months heading into the legislative session. I expect we will continue to lead on protecting Iowans from again experiencing this type of fraud and continue strengthening our state regarding illegal immigration.”
Roberts was detained by U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement in September, resigned from his position as DMPS superintendent and had his license revoked by the Iowa Board of Educational Examiners.
Roberts, who is a citizen of Guyana according to court records, had been hired by DMPS in 2023. Documents released by DHS last week confirmed Roberts was given an order of removal by an immigration judge in May 2024 and had a criminal history that included charges related to firearms and possession of narcotics.
In addressing the DMPS lawsuit, Romero said JG Consulting had performed its duty, reporting some information — like the fact that he had not received a doctorate from Morgan State University which he claimed on his resume — to the board before it decided to move forward with Roberts’ hire.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/54737396700_aed9b5be71_k-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-07 18:56:41.662483

Photo by Katherine Dailey/Michigan Advance. Michigan House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) repeatedly criticized Democrats for what he called a lack of transparency and wasteful spending in the process of passing the state’s budget during a press conference on Tuesday, while commending the inclusion of Republican priorities like an end to taxes on tips, overtime and Social Security, as well as funding for local roads.
In the press conference, held just after Gov. Gretchen Whitmer signed an $81 billion budget for Fiscal Year 2026, Hall blamed the hours-long shutdown on Oct. 1, prior to the passage of a continuation budget, on Democrats, who he called “a very dishonest group of people.”
“The Democrats were willing to shut down the government over not disclosing their pork, and that was ultimately the reason that these negotiations went on as long as they did,” he said, referring to the hundreds of millions of dollars in projects from individual lawmakers that were funded by the budget.
Hall’s stance, however, does not tell the full story of the budget leading up to the deadline at the end of September. Hall and his Republican colleagues did not introduce their budget proposal in the House until Aug. 26, months after the Democratic-controlled Senate passed their version of the budget in May. The governor put forth her own proposal in February — both well in advance of the deadlines to pass budgets. 
“Their plan was to disclose after the governor signed the bill. That was what was holding this up,” he added. “What we wanted was for it to be disclosed before the vote.” Hall also noted that in the FY26 budget, earmarks accounted for $168 million, while in the prior year, they made up over $1.3 billion. Those earmarks came from both Democratic and Republican lawmakers. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Hall gave the example of the elimination of 2,000 so-called “ghost employees” — unfilled government employee roles — as a win for Republican priorities of cutting wasteful spending, though he said that there were “at least another 3,000” of those ghost employees that would have to be cut going forward. 
Cutting that “waste, fraud and abuse,” which Hall repeatedly referenced in his statements, was what allowed the roads funding deal — a nearly $2 billion funding plan that was a priority for both Hall and Whitmer — to make it through negotiations, and he said that the plan could have even been larger had there been more spending cuts. 
As for the cannabis tax that will fund the roads plan, Hall called it a “volatile” funding source, adding, “there’s not an easy way to determine how much money that raises.”
But he did note that education funding — over $21 billion in a school aid package — was not cut in favor of the roads plan. 
“Democrats tried to tell you that you had to pick between fixing the roads and funding education,” he said. “I always said we didn’t have to.”
Hall further emphasized that the Republican priorities in the budget delivered for working families — he told reporters that while he is the House speaker, no increased taxes on gas or on hunting and fishing registration fees would go into effect. 
“It was really critical that we deliver tax relief for working people, and that we amplify the working families tax cut that President Trump and the Republican Congress have approved so that our tipped workers, our people working overtime, and also our seniors on Social Security, have no tax on their state tax,” he said.
Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks (D-Grand Rapids) also spotlighted Democratic priorities that remained in the budget through negotiations, including universal free breakfast and lunch for students, in a press release following the bill’s passage in the legislature on Friday.
“Senate Democrats worked across the aisle to get the job done and deliver another responsible budget that boosts public education, invests in our aging roads, and protects access to health care, all while mitigating the worst effects of the devastating federal cuts. I cannot emphasize enough the importance of state legislatures in this critical, tenuous moment,” she said.

Going forward, Hall said, his priority for the remainder of 2025 is to completely eliminate the Strategic Outreach and Attraction Reserve, or SOAR, program and end any remaining grants from the defunct Michigan Economic Growth Authority, known as MEGA, two programs designed to bring jobs to Michigan, which Hall said had created no jobs. SOAR was completely cut out of the budget that was passed by the legislature. 
“I’m committed to working with the Governor and trying to do something before the end of the year that eliminates SOAR, eliminates MEGA, that comes up with something that can help Michigan compete with other states, but allows us to make great deals,” he added, referencing a bill by state Rep. Mike Hoadley (R-Au Gres). That bill, which is not yet publicly available, would “end the days of the cash giveaways, once and for all,” Hall said. 
“We’re not going to be paying cash up front, and we’re not going to give the Michigan Strategic Fund the ability to change everything all the time,” Hall said when asked what would be included in that forthcoming job creation legislation, though he noted that the other details of the bill all still need to be negotiated.

,Mississippi Today,2025-10-07 22:45:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,"Jackson Council asks to reverse third-party water order, JXN Water responds",Alex Rozier,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/10/07/jackson-council-asks-to-reverse-third-party-water-order-jxn-water-responds/,The Jackson City Council voted 6-1 to ask U.S. District Judge Henrt Wingate to take  the city's beleagured water system away from the third-party manager.,"The Jackson City Council voted Tuesday in favor of taking the city’s water and sewer systems back from under third-party control. 
In 2022, as part of a federal consent decree, U.S. District Court Judge Henry Wingate put the struggling water system under the control of now JXN Water manager Ted Henifin, who also took over Jackson’s sewer system in 2023. Henifin said repeatedly he planned to stay until 2027, although Wingate has the ultimate say over when and whether to transition control back to the city.   
Tuesday’s resolution “encourages” Wingate to reverse the 2022 order. Longtime Ward 3 Councilman Kenneth Stokes introduced the measure and described a strained relationship between the utility and Jackson residents. Stokes characterized the utility as being “disrespectful” and having “talked down” to customers. 
“The citizens are beginning to lose faith in JXN Water,” he said.

Specifically, Stokes claimed JXN Water is sending out inaccurate bills and then aggressively shutting off connections until customers make large down payments on their debt.  
The council voted 6 to 1 to approve the resolution, with Ward 1 Councilman Ashby Foote the lone dissenting vote. 
Later in the day, JXN Water responded in a statement that financial challenges with the water system need resolving before returning control to Jackson. The city, the utility added, is largely at fault for those challenges.
“Significant progress has been made in restoring and maintaining reliable operations,” the statement said. “However, achieving financial stability remains the greatest challenge and must be resolved before any transition can occur. Otherwise, Jackson risks returning to the same conditions that led to the federal government’s intervention.
“The failure of the City’s water and sewer systems can be directly tied to a lack of financial resources — largely due to the City’s past inability or unwillingness to set sustainable rates and ensure all users paid for the services they received. Without a long-term, financially sound plan, the system will inevitably deteriorate again.”
Before Tuesday’s vote, Ward 5 Councilman Vernon Hartley asked the city’s chief administrative officer, Pieter Teeuwissen, if there were plans to transition the system back under Jackson management. Teeuwissen said the court order over the water system says the parties need to have a transition plan in place in October 2026, but added he expects the transition to begin sooner than that.
“I suspect the timeline will be something sooner than what the city previously agreed to,” he said, noting that he, Mayor John Horhn and Henifin met last Friday and are “constantly” meeting to discuss transition options.

JXN Water confirmed they’ve met with the city, but said it will be “months before a viable proposal can be shared.” The statement also said a utility authority with appointed board members would likely need to temporarily run the systems after JXN Water while the city developed a transition plan.
While voting for the resolution, Council President and Ward 4 Councilman Brian Grizzell supported the idea of a separate utility authority. It would be more sustainable, Grizzell said, if the systems weren’t subject to the regular turnover in the mayoral and public works offices.
JXN Water communications officer Aisha Carson said multiple council members have reached out to the utility to request it restore water to connections it turned off due to nonpayment. Carson said the utility couldn’t “cherry pick” which accounts to shut off, and added that the city council had earlier this year asked JXN Water to ramp up collections to address revenue shortages. 
“It’s very difficult for us to apply that collections policy when we experience pushback from City Council leaders who have actually told us to ramp up collections,” she said.
Carson said JXN Water is shutting off water connections to about 1,000 accounts a week, a rate its maintained for the last three to four weeks. Earlier in the year, the utility said in its financial plan that it found over 14,000 accounts that receive water but weren’t paying, and that they would be the focus of its collection efforts. 
In another move, the council voted unanimously for another resolution to encourage JXN Water to offer bill adjustments. Stokes, who introduced that resolution as well, said customers who see discolored water from their taps should receive a discount.  
In August, JXN Water said it was seeing increased levels of manganese, a naturally occurring mineral, in the Ross Barnett Reservoir. While the increase may turn tap water brown in some cases, the utility said, the effect is only “aesthetic,” meaning it’s not a health concern. The utility said at the time it was adjusting treatment techniques to reduce the effect, which Carson said adds to their expenses. But some customers, Stokes said Tuesday, are still not drinking the water when they see the discoloration and instead paying extra to buy bottled water.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/23205322/Jackson-City-Council-1.jpg,,,2025-10-07 18:56:41.662483

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Oklahoma’s newly sworn-in state superintendent said he intends his brief 15 months in office to be “more than just a stopgap.”
The coming days and weeks for Lindel Fields, who took the oath of office Tuesday, will center on rebuilding communication and relationships across the state, particularly with educators, families, news media and state officials, including his own employees at the Oklahoma State Department of Education. That will involve a listening tour across Oklahoma, he said.
Fields, a former CareerTech center administrator, aims to move the needle on student outcomes, too, despite his short term in office, he said. During a press briefing Tuesday afternoon at the Education Department, he said he believes his administration “can make a difference in 15 months” and reminded news reporters that New York City’s Empire State Building was built in 14 months. 
“No matter who comes after me in this role, I want to leave them with a strong foundation on which to build,” he said.
A cornerstone of that foundation is bringing in a “turnaround team” to help stabilize the Education Department after former state Superintendent Ryan Walters’ turbulent tenure ended with an early exit. 
Over the coming weeks, Fields and that team will review all agency finances, vendor contracts, pending lawsuits, “organizational misalignments” and more, he said.
Fields and Gov. Kevin Stitt, who appointed him to complete Walters’ term through January 2027, brought in education professionals and other officials from across the state to lead the turnaround.

Most of them will work at the Education Department full time, relocating to Oklahoma City if necessary, said Tara Thompson, Fields’ interim communications adviser and the chief of communications at Broken Arrow Public Schools.
Thompson will assist with agency communications while the Education Department seeks to hire a communications chief permanently. She said she will work for both the agency and Broken Arrow schools while commuting back and forth from the Tulsa area. 
Fields, of Tulsa, is still deliberating with his wife to figure out their living arrangements, Thompson said. They have a daughter in fifth grade in Tulsa Public Schools.
The chief financial officer of Tulsa schools, Kristen Stephens, will move to the state capital to oversee the Education Department’s finances, operations, compliance, federal programs and human resources. 
Stephens’ first task is to review the agency’s financial state and to build a 2027 fiscal year budget proposal. The Oklahoma State Board of Education is expected to vote on Stephens’ budget request during its Oct. 23 meeting, Fields said. 
Walters presented a budget proposal shortly before he resigned, but the board tabled it without taking any action.

Fields and the board will meet for the first time this week on Thursday to vote on teacher certifications, student transfer appeals and other matters, he said.
The relationship between the board and the state superintendent, which became strained in the late stages of Walters’ tenure, also appears to be changing. 
Thompson said Fields intends to collaborate with board members to place items of their choosing on meeting agendas and to give the board ample time to review agenda materials before they meet, two things Walters refused to do.
Fields’ team plans to deliver a yearly budget proposal to the board on Oct. 15, which would give the board members a week to examine it before they meet at the end of the month, Thompson said. 
She described the turnaround team’s approach to agency finances as a “trust but verify” method. She said the agency doesn’t intend to hire external auditors, but it would cooperate with any audits that are called.
“We’re looking into everything that we can,” Thompson said. “We’re being very objective. We’re assuming the best. Obviously, we’ve got a lot of great employees at the state Department of Education that work very hard, but everything will be reviewed and anything that’s found to be fiscally irresponsible or not in the best interest of our taxpayers will be brought to light and corrected to the fullest extent possible.”

Another member of Fields’ incoming team is Romel Muex-Pullen, who will take a 15-month leave of absence from Metro Technology Centers in Oklahoma City, where she is an associate superintendent. 
Muex-Pullen will lead the Education Department in areas of assessments, instruction, and teacher recruitment and retention.
Fields said recruiting and retaining classroom teachers is one of his top three priorities over the next 15 months, along with improving student literacy and connecting students with career pathways.
Finding a way forward for assessments, also known as state testing, has gotten “messy,” Thompson said.
While districts were welcoming students back in August, Walters abruptly announced his intention to eliminate Oklahoma’s statewide tests this school year and replace them with district-selected benchmark assessments.
Doing so would require federal approval first, but “frustratingly, the status of that right now is unclear,” Thompson said. 
The U.S. Department of Education website indicates Oklahoma hasn’t requested any waivers from the federal agency since December 2024.
Statewide testing of public school students is required under federal and state law. Thompson said “it’s an assumption that we can lean towards” that testing will happen this school year.
“It’s hard to say if anything is safe right now with all the different moving pieces,” she said. “But coming from a school district, I can tell you that’s what we’re planning on. We’re planning on state testing happening. We’re just trying to get clarification on is there a different test we’re supposed to be using.”
Office of Educational Quality and Accountability executive director Megan Oftedal will join the Education Department full time to handle data analytics and artificial intelligence initiatives. Fields said she will focus on ensuring data is accurate, accessible and actionable. 
While Thompson advises on communications, the only remaining spokesperson from Walters’ administration, Madison Cercy, remains at the department.
Fields hasn’t fired any employees since he stepped into the superintendent role, Thompson said. He also hasn’t removed any of Walters’ appointees to state boards, though she said some might have left their roles through “natural attrition.”

So far, that appears to only apply to Kendra Wesson, a former state Board of Education member whom Walters appointed to the Oklahoma State Textbook Committee. Wesson is no longer listed on the textbook committee’s webpage as a member.
Walters’ other appointees are still listed as current members of the Statewide Charter School Board and the Teachers’ Retirement System Board of Trustees.
Stitt’s chief of staff, Tom Newell, will join the Education Department to take charge of staffing and government relations, Fields said. The governor’s education secretary, Nellie Tayloe Sanders, will leave her position to assist Fields as an adviser on special projects.
As Fields’ 15 months in office begins, he said he and his team will focus on education, not “trying to convince you to vote for me.” He has said he has no interest in running in the 2026 state superintendent election.
“I plan to sprint for 15 months,” Fields said. “My normal way is the tortoise always wins the race, slow and deliberate, but the tortoise is going to have some tennis shoes on for the next 15 months.”

Leif Olson was approved to become the U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Iowa and David Waterman as the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Iowa as part of the nominations package, passed along party lines in a 51-47 vote. U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley celebrated the successful approval of Olson and Waterman to these positions in a statement Tuesday.
“After months of unprecedented Democrat obstruction, Republicans successfully confirmed Iowa’s highly qualified U.S. Attorney nominees,” Grassley said. “Mr. Waterman and Mr. Olson will help keep Iowans safe and faithfully serve our great state with honor and distinction. Iowa needed its top federal law enforcement officials in place, and Senate Republicans delivered.”

Waterman previously served as an assistant U.S. attorney in the appellate and criminal divisions of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Middle District of Florida, in addition to working as an attorney at Lane & Waterman LLP in Davenport. Prior to his confirmation, Olson served as chief deputy attorney general in Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird’s office.
Grassley also praised the confirmation of other U.S. attorneys throughout the country in the Tuesday vote.
“I’m proud Senate Republicans broke through the Democrat blockade and successfully confirmed 16 U.S. Attorneys to serve their respective communities,” Grassley said. “We won’t allow Democrats to stand in the way of Americans’ safety and wellbeing.”
Trump nominees had been blocked from approval for months by Senate Democrats, who had taken steps to slow down the confirmation process. But GOP leadership approved a rules chance that allowed the chamber to vote for nominees in groups rather than requiring each appointee gain individual approval. The Senate approved the first batch of Trump nominees through this process in September.
The en bloc vote also included Iowa Board of Regents member David Barker’s appointment to serve as assistant secretary for postsecondary education in the U.S. Department of Education. Barker has said he planned to resign from the Regents board once his new position was confirmed.

(stock photo/Getty Images)A Montgomery County lawyer who’s made a career out of suing telemarketers has been dealt a loss in a case seeking damages from Pennsylvania House Majority Leader Matt Bradford over pre-recorded calls to his constituents.
Bradford’s robocalls to people in his district are not covered by the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA), the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said in an opinion Monday. That’s because the calls are a legitimate function of a state legislator’s office, to benefit the public.
In a unanimous decision, Circuit Judges L. Felipe Restrepo, Anthony J. Scirica and Tamika R. Montgomery-Reeves noted the United States’ constitutional structure was designed to prevent the federal government from overreaching into states’ affairs. 
“We are thus hesitant to assume Congress would go so far as to hinder state legislators from communicating with their constituents,” the opinion by Scirica says. He noted the judges’ doubt was heightened by the fact the messages were vetted by state House staff and found to have “a clear legislative purpose and [serve the] public benefit.” 
The calls from Bradford’s office concerned an information session about state government health insurance, government resources available during the COVID-19 pandemic, notification of government employment opportunities, a document shredding event for constituents, and a family fair at a local zoo, according to the opinion.
“Such communications related to the health, safety and general welfare of the people clearly serve the ‘public good’ — as opposed to any personal affairs or a re-election campaign,” the opinion said.
Andrew Perrong, the Glenside attorney who filed the suit, said he disagrees with the decision and is considering his options to seek reconsideration. Bradford had appealed a federal district court judge’s decision in Perrong’s favor that robocalls from lawmakers are prohibited except when they pertain to an emergency.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
A recent law school graduate, Perrong, 28, said he has been suing telemarketers and scammers since 2015, before he had any formal legal education. Dubbed a “robocall warrior” in a 2018 Philadelphia Inquirer profile, Perrong’s law practice website touts class-action settlements totaling more than $9 million. 
Bradford’s lawyer, Karl Myers, said they’re pleased with the decision because it will help ensure constituents are able to find out about services they may find beneficial.
“It is consistent with what we understood from the start: that the TCPA was meant to stop harassing and fraudulent commercial robocalls, not calls from state legislators offering programs for the public’s benefit,” Myers said in a statement.
The Republican and Democratic caucuses of the House and Senate filed amicus briefs in support of Bradford’s arguments that public officials are not included in the meaning of “person” under the law.
TCPA, first passed by Congress in 1991, gives the Federal Communications Commission authority to regulate the use of telephones, fax machines and text messaging to protect consumers from harassing, intrusive, illegal, and unwanted communications.
The law includes a private remedy for consumers, allowing them to collect damages of $500 per violation and triple damages of $1,500 for willful and knowing violations, according to the opinion.
Bradford’s calls, which were pre-recorded and made using an autodialer, were typical of those used by lawmakers to contact constituents using resources provided for operations and expenses in their districts. 
In order to place such calls, a representative or senator’s office must make a request to their caucus’ communications office, where the message is reviewed to ensure it has a legislative purpose. If the communications office determines it does not, the request is rejected, the opinion says. 
Scirica’s opinion notes that House rules bar lawmakers from using mass communications within 60 days of an election, although a temporary rule made an exception for messages related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Perrong said he’s driven to fight robocalls because of the harassment and disruption they cause in daily life. As a student at La Salle College High School, Perrong said marketing calls were so frequent they interrupted his studies. 
His lawsuits target telemarketing companies and large corporations that conduct their own telemarketing, but he also sued the Montgomery County Democratic Committee. That suit was also unsuccessful as a result of a technical difference in the way the committee’s calls were placed. 
Citing data compiled by the privacy app Youmail, Perrong noted consumers receive billions of robocalls each month.
“It’s a problem that’s not going away and in fact, is getting worse,” he said. 
While he acknowledged there’s a difference between spam calls and the constituent services calls lawmakers use, Perrong said he’s focused on what he described as the “pervasive harm” of pre-recorded calls.
“The medium is what Congress designed the TCPA to protect,” he said.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/cell-phone.jpg,,,2025-10-07 18:56:41.662483

Teresa Leger Fernández, who represents the state’s 3rd Congressional District and much of Northern New Mexico, appeared at an Oct. 7, 2025 news conference, celebrating state lawmakers’ push to establish permanent funds for acequias and land grant mercedes in the upcoming legislative session. (Danielle Prokop / Source NM)As climate-fueled disasters cause mounting damages to New Mexico’s acequias amid rising costs, leadership from traditional ditch communities and land grant-mercedes say they need state help.
Those leaders discussed the issue on Tuesday in front of the state Roundhouse, as Democratic lawmakers previewed legislation for next year’s session that would establish two muli-million dollar funds to help pay infrastructure costs for dam repairs and debris removal, as well as for affordable housing developments on community-owned land.
“It’s more than a bill, it’s a promise,” said Sen. Leo Jaramillo (D-Española). “It creates a permanent fund so our New Mexico’s historic land grant and acequia communities can invest in our future, clean water and strong local infrastructure; more so in rural New Mexico where we need it the most.”
Similar legislation brought in 2025 — House Bill 330 — advanced through House committees and a floor vote, but stalled in the Senate Finance Committee. The bill, which would have dedicated $5 million in two funds for both acequias and land grant-mercedes, simply “ran out of time,” Jaramillo said.
“I’m very optimistic for it to pass this year,” he said.
But while acequias and land-grant mercedes count as government entities in law and predate New Mexico’s statehood by hundreds of years, their ability to obtain state or federal funding remains a challenge.
Since 2022, fires and flooding — including millions in damages to dozens of canals in September — have devastated more than 200 acequias across the state, said Paula Garcia, the executive director of the New Mexico Acequia Association.
“With about 700 in the state that means one in four acequias is in crisis from some kind of climate disaster,” she said.
Garcia said uncertainty about receiving U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency funds and challenges navigating the state’s disaster funding creates a continued level of precarity as calamities pile up.
“It seems like every time there’s a disaster, we’re starting from scratch,” Garcia told Source NM. “Now having a funding source would be a game changer because we wouldn’t be scrambling every time there’s a disaster on how we’re going to piece together that recovery money.”
U.S. Rep. Teresa Leger Fernández, who represents the state’s 3rd Congressional District and much of Northern New Mexico, said she’s had to repeatedly “educate” federal agencies to get funding for acequias, and said this pool of funding may offer chances to seek federal grants in the future.
“When the State of New Mexico passes legislation like this that not just builds upon the recognition, but says, ‘we are going to provide the funding at these levels, then they can go and seek matching funding from the federal government,’’ said Leger Fernández, who was in the state rather than Washington, D.C., due to the ongoing federal shutdown. “That’s why what the legislators have done today is so essential — because we want to multiply, as much as possible, the funding that comes into rural communities.”

The Iowa Board of Behavioral Health Professionals has charged Kayla Reisinger with failure to comply with the current Code of Ethics of the American Counseling Association by entering into relationships with current clients, their romantic partners, or their family members.
Reisinger was also charged with violating a rule that “prohibits sexual activities or sexual contact with a client’s or former client’s relative” when there is “a risk of exploitation or harm to a client or former client.”
She is also charged with failure to comply with rules concerning client boundaries and non-professional interactions or relationships that are not of a sexual nature.
Among the violations alleged by the board:
— Reisinger told a colleague she was contacting a client, a minor, after the client’s guardian had terminated counseling services, out of a desire to take legal custody of the client and continue communicating with them. Reisinger allegedly had contact with the minor client outside of business hours, attended the client’s school concerts, introduced her children to the client, and made tentative plans to house the client in her home.
— Reisinger fostered another client’s cat and communicated with the client personally via Snapchat.
— Reisinger began seeing one client’s minor child on a professional basis, while providing the child with Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR), while providing no rationale for the decision. In an email, Reisinger allegedly told the child’s parent she knew EDMR was “against best practice” but proceeded to schedule and provide the therapy.
— Reisinger allegedly told colleagues she helped facilitate two clients begin a dating relationship.
— During an appointment with her personal therapist, Reisinger allegedly disclosed she was having a relationship with the caregiver for a minor who was one of her clients, and had also helped that client get a prom dress.
As a result of the charges, Reisinger recently agreed to a six-month license suspension, after which her license will be placed on probation for 36 months.

RANDOLPH — Ten minutes before the doors opened, a line of a dozen or so customers had already formed outside Gifford Medical Center Auxiliary Thrift Shop in Randolph on a gray September morning. 
When the clock struck 10 a.m., customers quickly filed inside. Some beelined for a table of Halloween decorations, others disappeared behind racks of clothes and $3 pairs of shoes. Still more paused to peruse rows of glass vases marked $1, used kitchenware, books and mugs for 50 cents, and antique ephemera going for a couple bucks. 
At first, the small store was quiet as customers scanned the items on display. But it wasn’t long before regulars and store volunteers began to catch up with one another amid the shopping. 
“I come for the fellowship,” said Marcia Eaton, a retired Randolph resident who stops by the store about five times a week. Eaton also comes for the deals, which in her mind are part of what makes the Gifford store “the best thrift shop for miles around.” 
For many, especially families in need, shopping at thrift stores such as the one in Randolph has long been a way to source clothes and household goods at an affordable price.
But for some, visiting thrift shops, or their cousin, vintage boutiques, is more than an occasional errand, it’s a dedicated pastime. Generation Z’s environmentally conscious shopping habits have only made the trend grow.

In the Upper Valley, the options for secondhand goods are vast and varied. The scene appears to be in a state of flux, with a number of traditional thrift shops shuttering in recent years while vintage boutiques have set up shop in their place.
Still, a cohort of dedicated shoppers have remained.
Located on the same lot as the medical center, the Gifford shop is one of the Upper Valley thrift stores that often draws a crowd. Founded in 1906 as the Randolph Sanatorium Ladies Aid Society, the store has remained faithful to the original notion of what a thrift store is: a charity or nonprofit-run enterprise where people in need can source clothing and household items at an affordable price. 
Prices at the store typically hover around a couple dollars, or less. Profits go to funding the medical center. 
“You have to have the community in mind when you do that,” store employee Hannah LaPlaca said of the shop’s low prices. 
“It’s a real community-based space,” she said.
Among the store’s dedicated following of shoppers is Kenny Benoir, 64, of Randolph, who treats the space like an art supply shop. On that September morning, Benoir had stumbled on a bag of Lincoln Logs he planned to use on one of his bird houses, which he sells to friends.
In the past, he’s bought antique tea cups at the store to turn into candleholders. He estimates he’s made about 20 of them at this point, and a number of whirligigs, too. 
“My house looks like a museum,” he said. 
For customers who are retired, the Gifford store offers an opportunity to socialize and build structure into their day.
It’s “part of people’s social schedule to come through and that’s what makes it amazing,” said Ann Hunt, a community health worker at Gifford who’d stopped by on her break to scope out the Halloween decor. 
She often tries to source holiday decorations at the store. “That way you’re not buying new stuff,” she said.

Tough margins
While thrift shops like Gifford’s auxiliary store have the infrastructure to maintain a steady flow of business and donations, several independently-owned businesses have recently closed their doors.
Among them are the Thrifty Fox in South Royalton and Consign and Design in West Lebanon.
Meanwhile, Gail Egner is on the fence about whether to keep the lights on at Uplifting Thrifting, her storefront in the train station in White River Junction.
A practice manager at a recovery center and a member of Hanover dispatch, Egner said running the store for the past six years has been a “happy heart project.” 
She’ll often work directly with families in need within area school districts who are looking for shoes and apparel.
Usually Egner makes enough to cover the store’s monthly rent of over $1,800, but sometimes she’s had to pay some of it out of pocket. 
Things have gotten tougher in the past month or so, since a construction project at the train station has caused foot traffic to slow and blocked customer parking. Some days, she makes just $40 in sales. 
On top of that, the Town of Hartford precludes street advertising, so directing people to the store, which sits slightly off White River Junction’s main drag, has proved a challenge. 
Egner recently reduced the store’s hours of operation to some weekends while she decides what to do next.

Curated selections
While some Upper Valley thrift stores are struggling, a handful of secondhand boutiques touting a more curated selection, often with a higher price tag, have recently set up shop.
In August, Lyme couple Kristyn and Greg Smith opened vintage and sustainable clothing store Rue and Ren on South Main Street in White River Junction, just a short walk from Uplifting Thrifting. 
The Smiths both enjoy the challenge of rummaging through a thrift store’s supply for a rare or specialty item at a low price. Sometimes they play a game where they each pick an item out of a Goodwill bin and see who can make a bigger sale.
But they recognize that not everyone shares their passion for the hunt. “So that’s what this shop is kind of for:  People who like that look or like that vibe, but they don’t want to go dig around for maybe a piece,” Kristyn Smith said. 
A native of Maine, Kristyn Smith has been thrifting since high school. She runs Lucky Star Stables in Lyme in addition to Rue and Ren.
In college, she sold shoes on eBay to pay for her own horse, whom she named after the website. For his show name, she chose Buy It Now. Selling vintage clothes online helped her cover the cost of caring for her horse as well as other daily expenses.

In addition to clothing, shoes and other items collected by owner Kristyn Smith, nine vendors sell at the store. Photo by James M. Patterson/Valley News 
By now she’s amassed a big enough inventory to stock the store for about a year. “I like to dig, and I like to find treasures. But I don’t want to keep the treasures,” she said. 
The store’s prices run the gamut from $25 for a graphic T-shirt to $70 for a men’s L.L. Bean jacket and $200 for certain vintage sweaters. In general, the couple tries to price items below the going rate on eBay in order to keep stock moving. 
Rue and Ren also carries clothes from 10 or so vendors who pay a monthly fee to rent rack space at $100 a rack. Vendors have to sell enough to cover their rent, otherwise, after two months, they’re asked to make way for someone new. 
“If you want this type of curated vintage, you go to Boston or Burlington. There’s nothing in between. So that’s kind of our aim, to be that in between,” Kristyn Smith said.

Co-owners Madison Boardman and Bar Dadon have a similar goal for their vintage store, Mahshu, which they opened in Woodstock a little over a year ago.
Like the Smiths, the couple got their start selling secondhand finds online, mainly through Instagram, before opening a small storefront in Enfield and eventually moving to the Woodstock location, a ground floor unit on Maxham Meadow Way, just outside of town, that they purchased for $200,000. 
A Stevens High School alum, Boardman, 30, would often rummage through the dense collection of knickknacks at a nearby secondhand store during lunch.
“I got really drawn into finding things,” she said. 
Dadon, meanwhile, grew up enmeshed in skate and snowboarding culture in Worcester, Mass. 
“Skateboarding isn’t a mainstream thing, so you didn’t want to be wearing what the masses are wearing,” he said. 
His family didn’t have a lot of money, so shopping at thrift stores became an affordable way to build his own style. Even if something wasn’t his size or vibe, he’d pick it up for a friend who might like it. 
After years of rifling through estate sales, yard sales, thrift stores and online shops, the couple have become experts in unearthing vintage finds. 
“I can spot a pair of Carhartt’s through the aisle,” Dadon said. 
They’ve both noticed prices increase at area thrift stores in recent years, while the quality of the clothes has diminished.  
“I feel like people have caught on to the trend of vintage and that has made a lot of secondhand skyrocket,” Boardman said. 
“It’s really frustrating,” Dadon said, to devote time to rummaging through racks of clothes for a high quality item only to find that the thrift store has already marked up the price. 
“Why did I just spend all my time looking through the rack? I could have just gone to a curated store, saved my time and shopped a nice collection,” he said. 
The clothes at Mahshu represent a version of that nice collection. The compact store is filled with stacks of Levi’s 501 jeans, graphic T-shirts, vintage designer sweaters, secondhand lace tops, denim vests, trucker hats and retro Dartmouth crew necks.
A few weeks ago, a sale rack at the front of the store offered one item for $25 and two items for $40. Other pieces, like their selection of Levi’s, sell for $100 or more, and one-of-a-kind and designer garments creep into the $500 range.
The store’s main clientele include Woodstock tourists traveling from New York, Boston and Texas.
The couple often joke that they opened the store to make friends, Boardman said, and they hope to host social events in the space in the future.
Mahshu “fills some void that I think we both have just being in rural America,” Dadon said.

Sheeler hired the business to clean out his house after his wife died and he moved to an apartment three years ago, and he now frequently visits the store. “It took me a couple years doing this business to not feel weird about selling stuff,” said Pridgen. She credits Freihofer for his idea to open the store as a way to keep useful items out of the landfill, and avoid overwhelming other resellers with daily donations. Photo by James M.

Clean outs
While the Gifford store offers low prices through a charity model, and Rue and Ren and Mahshu sell a handpicked, albeit pricier selection of vintage goods, KIS Thrift, short for Keep It Simple, in Wilder, is built around the business’ clean out operation.
In 2021, couple Sam Freihofer and Margaret Pridgen started offering a clean out service at people’s homes after watching their own family and others’ be overwhelmed by the process of downsizing as parents enter old age.
The couple started selling the unwanted items — furniture, clothes, home goods — at a small storefront in Hartford Village. In March they moved to a larger space on Hartford Avenue in Wilder that they purchased for $800,000.
In August, the business completed their 1,000th clean out.

Darcy hired Freihofer and his crew as he prepares to move out of his house after 12 years there. “It’s a hard move,” said Darcy. “You don’t want things to go to the dump,” he said. “If you’re going to make a little money on these things, that’s great because it will go to somebody who will use it.” Photo by James M. Patterson/Valley News
While KIS is a for-profit endeavor, the store generally keeps its prices pretty low to ensure people in need can get what they’re looking for and to keep stock moving.
The store is chock-full with kitchen appliances, work tools, furniture, blankets, clothes and wall art. Bookshelves against one the walls advertise five books for $1.
Store manager and former Valley News editor Maggie Cassidy noted that as much as KIS is a place to source household goods at a reasonable price, it’s also a “third space” for people to hangout and socialize.
Wilder resident Lily Hempt, 39 stops by KIS multiple times a day to browse and chat with the store’s employees. “If I’m not working, I’m coming here,” she said.
Hempt grew up attending auctions and antique sales with her mom. Now a jewelry maker, she finds inspiration in the antique textiles, books and magazines she discovers at KIS.
“It’s the treasure hunt,” that appeals, she said, and at KIS, she always knows she’ll find something good.
Hempt also has made a thrifting friend through her trips to KIS. The two join each other on thrifting runs, and he’s helped answer questions about certain items that come across their path.
Their outings reflect LaPlaca’s observation at the Gifford store that September morning that thrift stores offer “Good, clean fun…You don’t have to break the bank to put a smile on someone’s face.”

(File/Getty Images)COLUMBIA — A rule barring books containing “sexual conduct” from the school libraries in the state is unconstitutional, teachers and K-12 librarians are arguing in a federal lawsuit filed Tuesday.
The state Board of Education has required teachers and school librarians to remove 21 books from classrooms and shelves since the regulation went into effect in June 2024. The board voted to allow six books to remain. One of those books — “Crank” by Ellen Hopkins — requires parental permission to check out.
10 more books must be removed from SC public K-12 schools, board rules

The rule violates students’ right under the First Amendment to receive information, lawyers for the South Carolina chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union argued in the lawsuit, filed on behalf of three high school students, their parents and school librarians.
In addition to the rule, the organization also is challenging guidelines from the state superintendent that require agency employees to adhere to new federal policies surrounding race and gender.
“The SCDE will vigorously defend these commonsense policies, which set clear and legally sound standards for South Carolina’s public schools,” said Jason Raven, a spokesman for the Department of Education, in a responding statement.
In the meantime, the ACLU is asking a judge to return the books to shelves as the case makes its way through the court system.

A vague rule
The regulation, which the state board passed unanimously in February 2023, prohibits any books that contain “sexual conduct” as defined and listed in the state’s obscenity law.
When teachers and librarians called the rule too vague to understand, board members attempted to clarify it last November by reviewing 11 books staff members identified as likely to face challenges. However, the board’s decision to keep “1984” on shelves despite it including a scene where characters have sex caused even more confusion, the lawsuit claims.
Orwell “went right up to the line but never crossed it” in writing “1984,” said board member Christian Hanley, who requested the department-led review. A book could mention sex as long as it didn’t describe a sexual encounter in a way that allowed readers to visualize the act, Hanley said at the time.
What that might mean, however, depends on the reader, causing confusion among librarians, the lawsuit argued.
“This standard is highly subjective, and librarians do not know how to apply it,” the lawsuit reads. “Different people require different amounts of detail to form a mental image, and librarians do not know whose perspective matters.”
The education agency, the lawyers claim, has in turn denied students access to a broad range of books and other materials at school, potentially including literary classics, without a legitimate reason.
Uncertainty as to how school librarians should enforce the rule also goes against their constitutional right to due process, the lawyers argue in the lawsuit, which includes the 750-member South Carolina Association of School Librarians as a plaintiff.
‘A chilling effect’
Fearing some sort of penalty, some school districts and librarians have gone further, removing more than just the required books from their schools, according to the lawsuit.
For instance, the Berkeley County School District blocked students’ access to a state-funded online research program out of concern that some of its content might violate the regulation. Although the district resumed access for high school students, younger grades can’t access information designed for them to use, the lawsuit claimed.
Statewide, librarians afraid of losing their jobs and teaching licenses for violating the regulation have cut down on the books they add to their libraries, in some cases deciding not to buy any new fiction at all, according to the lawsuit.
Librarians face “the impossible task of discerning which material ‘describes’ sexual conduct and which do not,” the lawsuit reads. “The result has been a chilling effect in South Carolina schools, as librarians take a better-safe-than-sorry approach to avoid punishment.”
Students lose out on a valuable part of their education when books are removed from the library, according to the lawsuit. At least one of the books removed from shelves, “Half of a Yellow Sun” by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, appeared on an Advanced Placement exam in recent years as a possible text from which students could pull. Without access to that book, students’ scores might suffer, reducing their chances to earn college credit, the lawsuit argued.
Under the regulation, “it does not matter whether the school is an elementary or a high school,” the lawsuit reads. “It does not matter whether a book is pornographic or great literature.”
Beyond ‘sexual conduct’
Beyond the state’s rule on “sexual conduct,” lawyers for the ACLU went further to challenge the state’s response to Trump administration policies surrounding race and gender
In court filings, the lawyers point to a memo sent by State Superintendent Ellen Weaver to department staff in March.
Here’s how 3 SC nonprofits use funding flagged by Trump administration for references to gender

In that memo, Weaver reiterated federal guidance that all department-provided materials should avoid mentions of transgender people or genders other than male or female. Nor should the department use any material promoting the idea that members of one race or sex are inherently superior to another, or that “the United States is fundamentally racist, sexist, or otherwise discriminatory.”
The memo said those standards apply to all department documents, policies, guidance and resources.
That guidance could cause the department to remove any number of books, textbooks or other material from schools that address difficult aspects of history, such as slavery, women’s suffrage, or the Civil Rights movement, the lawsuit claimed.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/library-books.jpeg,,,2025-10-07 18:56:41.662483

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)Arkansas’ higher education institutions and the state’s education department have not been immediately impacted by the government shutdown, but officials said they’re preparing to make adjustments as needed. 
Payroll for some employees at the University of Arkansas’ Fayetteville campus may be affected by the shutdown, but any furloughs would pertain to federal employees or positions that are federally funded with no alternative funding source available, Director of Media Relations and Core Communications John Thomas said Monday. 
“Our units have been asked to provide alternate university projects and funding options (other than state funding which may not be used for this purpose) for employees in positions tied to active federal research grants ahead of the next payroll deadline, so at this time we do not plan to furlough employees,” Thomas said in an email.
Arkansas agencies directed to furlough employees if federal government shuts down

Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders directed state agencies last week to prepare to furlough employees fully or partially funded by federal money ahead of the government shutdown that began Oct. 1. Arkansas state agencies furloughed nearly 250 employees last week as a result of the federal government shutting down, the Arkansas-Democrat Gazette reported Monday. 
Arkansas State University has had “no immediate impact from the shutdown,” Chief Marketing and Communications Officer Todd Clark said Tuesday. 
“If federal dollars remain available or have already been received, A-State employees will not be placed on furlough,” Clark said. “Our institutions will continue to lawfully access and utilize those funds.”
Regarding student loans and financial aid, Thomas said University of Arkansas Fayetteville officials are expecting some delays to Army and Air Force ROTC students’ living stipends and tuition awards. Meanwhile, the University of Arkansas at Little Rock had not seen any impact on federal aid as of Monday, according to Assistant Vice Chancellor of Enrollment Management Jonathan Coleman. 
“Payments for loans and grants will continue, and we can continue paying work study employees,” Coleman said. 
Grants at UA Little Rock were under contract so no stop orders had been received as of Monday, Vice Provost of Research Brian Berry said.  
At the University of Central Arkansas, there’s been “no discernible impact on any grant funding or student financial aid,” and the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) portal was still functioning as of Monday, according to Director of Media Relations Tiffany Head.
As the shutdown is “a very fluid situation,” Thomas said the University of Arkansas Fayetteville is providing updates on contingency plans from federal agencies and state and UA System guidance for its research community on its website. 
At the state level, the Arkansas Department of Education “has sufficient funding for programs and salaries at this time,” Public Information Coordinator Rachel Starks said Tuesday. 
“We are monitoring the situation. If the shutdown is prolonged, we will make adjustments,” Starks said.
Education Secretary Jacob Oliva told lawmakers Monday that an extended government shutdown could further exacerbate challenges with the School Readiness Assistance Program. The federally-funded program provides financial assistance for child care to eligible, low-income families while parents work or attend school.
ADE announced updates to the program’s reimbursement rates and copayment structure last month in an effort to reduce the waitlist and make the program more financially sustainable, according to the agency. The announced changes met pushback, and the education department last week delayed cuts to providers’ reimbursement rates until Nov. 1, but moved forward with participant co-payments on Oct. 1 as planned, according to the Arkansas Democrat–Gazette. 
Oliva told the House and Senate Education committees Monday that the program’s “current rate system is unsustainable.”
“This program will not exist by Christmas,” he said. “We are using reserves right now making payments that we can’t afford to do. And if the government doesn’t open up when we get a next quarter payment, I’m going to be back here in two to three weeks to tell you there’s no more program.”
Although ADE created a strategy to slow things down to sustain the program, Oliva said “everybody’s complaining about it,” so the agency paused its actions and is working on organizing a meeting with stakeholders next week to discuss ideas for long-term sustainability of the program. 
“If the Legislature wants to help support, we’re willing to do that, but what I am telling you is we don’t have $6 to $8 million a month to maintain the status quo,” he said. “That is unsustainable, and every week that goes by is $2 to $3 million that we don’t have additionally coming into that pot of money.”

On Friday, Achilles of Boise filed a complaint alleging that U.S. Forest Service Chief Tom Schultz violated the Hatch Act by displaying what Achilles called “overtly partisan messages” appearing on the Forest Service’s websites.
The messages, which were still visible on the Boise National Forest and Payette National Forest websites on Tuesday, state: “The Radical Left Democrats shut down the government. This government website will be updated periodically during the funding lapse for mission critical functions. President Trump has made it clear he wants to keep the government open and support those who feed, fuel, and clothe the American people.”
 Complaint says messages on websites violate the federal Hatch Act

In his complaint, Achilles alleged that displaying partisan political messages on public digital infrastructure, such as Forest Service websites, is a violation of the Hatch Act. The act, which is a federal law passed in 1939, limits certain political activities of federal employees, as well as some state, D.C., and local government employees who work in connection with federally funded programs.

Achilles asked the U.S. Office of Special Counsel to investigate the matter and take appropriate enforcement action. 
“The Forest Service is the largest manager in Idaho, overseeing roughly 40% of the state’s land,” Achilles wrote in the complaint. “Since 1905, the Forest Service has managed these public lands for the benefit of all Americans, regardless of political identity. Aggressively partisan political messages on federal agency websites constitute not only a violation of the Hatch Act but also a violation of the nonpartisan standards that all Idahoans demand of Forest Service employees.”
Achilles recently served as a Democrat in the Idaho House of Representatives before he announced July 1 he was stepping down to run for the U.S. Senate in 2026 as an independent for the seat held by incumbent U.S. Sen. Jim Risch, R-Idaho. 
When asked last week by the Idaho Capital Sun about the impact of the government shutdown on U.S. Forest Service’s forests in Idaho, an unidentified U.S. Department of Agriculture spokesperson provided a nearly identical message to the message now displayed atop the Forest Service’s websites.
“The Democrat shutdown will cause real harm to American farmers, ranchers, and rural communities,” the spokesperson wrote in an Oct. 1 email to the Sun. “President Trump has made it clear through his support of H.R. 5371 that he wants to keep the government open and support those who feed, fuel, and clothe the American people.”

(Photo by Sara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)Democratic leaders, health care providers and consumer advocates praised a Colorado board’s decision last week to cap the price of a prescription drug used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases, the first action of its kind in the country.
The state’s Prescription Drug Affordability Board, which was created through 2021 state legislation, set an upper payment limit, or UPL, on Enbrel during its meeting Oct. 3. It means insurers and patients can pay no more than about $31,000 per year for the medication, compared to the average insurance plan payment of $53,049 for the drug in 2023.
Colorado is the first state to set such a limit.

“Of course, $31,000 is still a lot of money, but it’s also over $20,000 less than $57,000,” Gov. Jared Polis told reporters Tuesday, surrounded by doctors, patients and advocacy groups. “To see real change when it comes to the high price of prescription drugs, we need federal action. (UPLs) can only be state-by state, drug-by-drug action.”
The UPL was determined using the standard weekly adult dose of 50 milligrams and relied on Medicare’s “maximum fair price” that manufacturers negotiated at the federal level.










I hear from my neighbors and my friends about the impossible decisions they make every month — paying the rent or filling their prescriptions, cutting their medications in half in order to try and make them last.


– State Sen. Julie Gonzales


About 2,600 Coloradans used Enbrel in 2022, according to a report from the board, with about 60% using commercial insurance. Those patients’ out-of-pocket costs averaged about $650 every month.
“I hear from my neighbors and my friends about the impossible decisions they make every month — paying the rent or filling their prescriptions, cutting their medications in half in order to try and make them last,” said Sen. Julie Gonzales, a Democrat who ran the legislation to establish the affordability board.
One patient surveyed by the board said Enbrel reduced the pain and swelling caused by their psoriatic arthritis so they could finally attend college. Another said the drug allowed them to walk longer distances and hike again. Another said the drug let them “live my own life with few modifications and compromises.”
It was a lengthy journey for the board to set this first UPL. Enbrel was 1 of 5 high-cost prescription drugs the board opted to review for affordability in 2023. Last year, the board voted to declare Enbrel unaffordable, which triggered the process to set a UPL with public comment, rulemaking and data analysis, including a 500-page affordability review report.
The UPL will go into effect in 2027.
“Would I love for every single decision to be made quickly? Certainly,” Gonzales said. “But I know that this is the first step. It won’t be the last, and I look forward to the work that the PDAB will undertake as they continue to look at medications, their costs and conduct their research. It’s not my role to ask them to move more quickly or more slowly. That is their work to do.”
Risk to access
Opponents contend that while price can be an obstacle to getting medication, it is more often a complicated blend of insurance barriers, income level and inability to access financial assistance.
“A UPL does not address the real problems patients identify. Instead of layering a new and untested pricing mechanism onto a system already stacked against patients, the board should focus on reforms that tackle these systemic drivers of unaffordability directly,” a letter from members of the Ensuring Access through Collaborative Health and Patient Inclusion Council coalitions to the PDAB says.
Other opponents worry about how a UPL could affect access to Enbrel in Colorado, one reason the board declined to designate the cystic fibrosis drug Trikafta unaffordable.
“Historical and economic history suggest that UPLs will create purchasing restrictions that threaten to limit patient access. If the purchase price is capped at a level where the buyer — be it independent physician practices, rural clinics or (pharmacy benefit managers) — loses money, the product will not be available to the patients who require these essential medications,” Dr. Harry Gewanter of Let My Doctors Decide wrote in a letter to the PDAB.

The program offers breastfeeding support and monthly vouchers for healthy foods to women who are pregnant, breastfeeding or postpartum, as well as infants and children under the age of five.","A program that provides food and nutrition services to nearly 70,000 Mississippi caregivers and children is currently running but could close this month if the Health Department does not find state funds amid the federal government shutdown, according to the state Health Department. 
The Women, Infants and Children (WIC) program is federally funded, according to Mississippi State Health Department spokesperson Greg Flynn. Enrollees can continue to use their current benefits until they run out. The state Health Department is exploring options to keep the program alive with state funds if the shutdown continues, Flynn said.
Tens of thousands of Mississippians rely on WIC each month. The program offers breastfeeding support and monthly vouchers for healthy foods to women who are pregnant, breastfeeding or postpartum, as well as infants and children under the age of five. Statewide, there are about 300 WIC-approved grocery stores and pharmacies where members can use their benefits. 
While existing federal funds may keep the program open temporarily, the National WIC Association said in a Sept. 30 statement that immediate action by Congress is necessary to make sure essential services aren’t disrupted. 
“Failure to rapidly reopen the government could result in State WIC directors being put in the horrible position of trying to manage their programs with insufficient funds,” said Georgia Machell, president and CEO of the association, in the statement. 
During the government shutdown, new applicants will only be approved if they fall under “Priority 1” designation, which includes pregnant and breastfeeding women and high-risk infants. However, according to Flynn, officials will not require proof of pregnancy, breastfeeding or a high-risk infant to determine priority status, allowing people to get the help they need while it lasts. 
“Priority 1” applicants will still need to follow the guidelines for approval, including bringing proof of income, residence and identification to their initial WIC appointment. More information about the application process can be found on the state Health Department’s website. 
Federal shutdowns do not happen often. The last one occurred in December 2018 and lasted for 35 days. The current shutdown is a week old, and congressional Democrats and Republicans remain in gridlock over how to fund the government. 
The main point of contention between parties is the expiration of Biden-era subsidies that are making health insurance more affordable for millions of Americans, with Democrats pushing for their renewal. If they are not renewed, KFF estimates premiums on marketplace insurance plans will more than double next year.
In 2024, over 331,000 Mississippians relied on tax credits to make their insurance plans more affordable, according to an analysis by the American Cancer Society. Should those enhanced tax credits expire, annual premiums would increase by $2,571 on average for a family of four with an annual income of $64,000, according to Keep Americans Covered, a nonpartisan coalition of major health care groups, such as the American Academy of Family Physicians.
Meanwhile, state Health Department contract workers were given stop-work orders last week with the end of their pay period, and were notified their jobs and compensation were paused until the shutdown ended. The department has said it is prioritizing maintaining direct services such as WIC during the shutdown.
“WIC is a vital support system for thousands of Mississippi families,” according to the department’s last memo, shared on Oct. 2. “MSDH remains committed to minimizing the impact of the federal shutdown on the families we serve. We thank you for your trust and patience, and we will continue to provide updates as the situation evolves.”

(Photo: NCGA screenshot)Year after year, retired state workers hope the North Carolina legislature will agree to adjust their pensions to reflect the higher cost of living. 
The legislature decides in some years to grant one-time bonuses with money most often coming from the general fund. But legislators have not been able to turn to the pension fund to pay cost of living adjustments, or COLAs, because the fund has repeatedly missed its growth targets. 
That could change in a few years. A new board overseeing state pension investments will consider the balance between pension investment risks and returns with an eye toward being able to provide COLAs. 
Tim O’Connell, executive director of the NC Retired Government Employees Association, said it’s good to have more than one person responsible for pension investments. North Carolina was one of the few states that put the legal authority for pension fund management in one person’s hands. 
“There is better news ahead for retirees, and quite honestly, for active employees and for taxpayers,” O’Connell said. Vetted and balanced investment decisions will be good for the state, he said. 
“A lot of things that needed to happen with the pension are happening,” O’Connell said. 
State Treasurer Brad Briner, who was elected last year, pushed for the new law creating the board. The new investment authority had its introductory meeting in August, but Briner started making changes to the pension fund months earlier – notably, investing money that was being held in cash. 
Briner announced in July that the pension fund posted record returns in the first six months of 2025. 
“We don’t take the responsibility of protecting and growing taxpayer dollars lightly,” Briner told legislators at a Tuesday oversight committee meeting. “We know you expect us to alleviate the strain pension deficits cause on the budget. We know retirees expect us to move into a position where cost of living adjustments can be considered. We know taxpayers expect us to make sound and reasonable decisions with their money, particularly in mitigating how much of the annual budget is funded into the pension system.”
The pension fund, valued at more than $133.8 billion, has more than enough to pay retirees each month. But in actuarial terms, it’s running a deficit. As investment returns improve and the deficit closes, it will be time to consider cost of living increases, Briner said in an interview this week. 
The state could reach that point in 2027, he said. 
“The market is running really hot right now,” he said in the interview. “It’s been good for us, but it won’t always be this good.”
State employees don’t often receive genuine cost of living adjustments that mean permanent increases. The last time state employees received a cost of living increase was in 2016, when they received 1%, according to the Treasurer’s office. Local government retirees, whose COLAs are determined by a board of trustees, received a 0.1% increase in 2015. 
The pension plan for teachers and state employees and the plan for local government employees are the two largest of the state’s seven pension plans.
Under former Treasurer Dale Folwell, who took pride in his conservative approach, the pension fund had the worst investment performance of any state, according to a 2023 Yale University analysis. Folwell tended to hold a greater proportion of the pension fund in cash than other public pensions. 
Folwell never liked the idea of spreading responsibility for pension investments to an investment board and still doesn’t. 
He said in an email that market downturns after 9/11, in the 2008 financial crisis, and during the COVID-19 pandemic affected the ability to pay COLAs over the last 25 years. 
O’Connell said the pension fund shouldn’t take on too much risk, but it shouldn’t take on too little, either. 
“We’re aspiring to be average,” he said. 
The State Employees Association of North Carolina once supported widening responsibility for pension investments. Now, SEANC Executive Director Ardis Watkins said, they don’t think it matters. 
“Governance doesn’t matter,” she said. “Transparency does.”
SEANC is approaching the new investment authority with “hesitant optimism” that Briner “will steer this board toward appropriate decisions,” Watkins said.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screen-Shot-2025-10-07-at-1.05.23-PM-1024x643.png,,,2025-10-07 18:56:41.662483

A jury found him not guilty of murder by reason of insanity after he stabbed a 6-year-old child to death. (Kentucky Department of Corrections)Kentucky Parole Board members received what police describe as violent threats after the early release of a child killer attracted criticism from the Trump White House and conservative influencers.
The Parole Board had unanimously recommended on Sept. 30 that Ronald Exantus, 42, remain in prison, but a state law required that he be freed under mandatory re-entry supervision, according to a news release from the Kentucky Justice and Public Safety Cabinet.  
In recent days, parole board members “have had their personal identifying information released online and threats of violence and deaths (made) against them and their families,” the Kentucky State Police said in a news release Monday.
State police warned that such threats are a crime, punishable by jail, and will be investigated. 
Exantus, a dialysis nurse, drove from Indianapolis to Versailles in Central Kentucky in December 2015, entered an unlocked home and killed 6-year-old Logan Tipton with a butcher knife taken from the kitchen. Exantus injured the boy’s father and another child.
Exantus admitted killing the child. A jury in nearby Lexington found that he was not guilty of murder and burglary by reason of insanity and guilty but mentally ill on assault charges. He was sentenced to 20 years. 
The Kentucky Supreme Court upheld the conviction in 2020.
Matt Walsh, a right-wing political commentator and podcaster, highlighted the early release of Exantus in an Oct. 3 post on  X, calling it “one of the most heinous miscarriages of justice in American history.”
White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt reposted Walsh’s comments, saying, “I can confirm the White House is looking into this. It’s wholly unacceptable for a child killer to walk free after just several years in prison.”
Exantus was released on Oct. 1 after serving seven years and will remain under supervision until June 18, 2026, according to state records which indicate he will serve his supervision in another state. Violating terms of the supervision could result in his return to prison.
The release from the Justice Cabinet says, “At a time when political violence is on the rise, it’s more important than ever that information shared is accurate and threats like these are taken seriously.”
It includes this statement by Parole Board chair Ladeidra N. Jones: “Despite repeatedly voting for Ronald Exantus to remain in prison, Parole Board members have faced significant threats over the last several days, even having their personal addresses released publicly.
“We are encouraging individuals to take these threats seriously and to prioritize factual information, which is that the board did not release Exantus – instead, a law passed by the General Assembly did.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Untitled-design-16-e1759873943605-1024x455.jpg,,,2025-10-07 18:56:41.662483

Roger Marshall, R-Kansas, says Democrats interrupted federal government operations due to a ""derangement syndrome"" tied to opposition of President Donald Trump. Marshall referred to the weeklong shutdown as a ""cynical political"" effort to comply with ""radical left-wing extremists."" (Anna Kaminski/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — U.S. Sen. Roger Marshall diagnosed the ongoing shutdown of the federal government as a malignancy infecting Democratic lawmakers.
The Kansas Republican, who was a physician in an obstetrics practice before elected to Congress, said Democrats at the Capitol were infected with “Trump derangement syndrome.”
“They have a hatred for President Trump that I’ve never seen,” Marshall said on a speech on the floor of the U.S. Senate.
Marshall, who was among lawmakers skeptical of President Joe Biden’s victory over Trump in 2020, said an underlying issue was Democrats had yet to accept outcome of 2024 elections that placed Republicans in control of the House, Senate and White House.
“If you want to continue your liberal socialist policies, Democrats, win an election,” Marshall said.
He accused Democrats of using the shutdown that began Oct. 1 to play hypocritical games with U.S. health care policy. The most “failed system” and “biggest waste of money” is the Medicaid system that has enrolled about 400,000 Kansans, he said. The senator said Democrats were complicit in creating financial challenges that threaten rural hospitals in Kansas and other states.
The six-person Kansas congressional delegation — five Republicans, one Democrat — have shared views on the weeklong shutdown tied to failure to pass a short-term funding bill to finance government operations. Democrats conditioned support for a bill on extension of health subsidies that lowered the consumer cost of Affordable Care Act plans. Republicans say the shutdown must end before working on the tax credits for health insurance.
The House adopted a temporary funding bill, but the Senate hasn’t voted for a comparable bill allowing the government to function until Nov. 21.
“This is not a shutdown that makes any sense at all,” said U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran, R-Kansas. “The American people — Kansans — deserve something different from the U.S. Senate. Every city council or commission, every school board, every local government office in my state passes a budget and then lives within that budget every year. Every local unit of government can figure this out, and the U.S. Senate is failing one more time.”
Moran, who has voted with Marshall to break the Senate’s deadlock, said the federal government shutdown “means uncertainty. A shutdown means dysfunction.”
U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids, the lone Democrat in the delegation, said Democrats in Congress were fighting to extend availability of ACA tax credits to keep health care affordable. More than 160,000 Kansans relied last year on tax credits the 3rd District representative said should be made permanent.
“Because congressional Republicans have refused to extend them, premiums could rise by $700 next year, putting thousands of Kansans at risk of paying more or losing coverage,” Davids said.
She said the shutdown would harm hardworking Kansans and the moment called for Republicans and Democrats to work together on a solution.
U.S. Rep. Derek Schmidt, a Republican serving the 2nd District in eastern Kansas, said the Senate ought to get behind the House-passed bipartisan bill. The approach would get the wheels of government moving and create time for the House and Senate to work on full-year appropriations bills, he said.
“Regrettably,” Schmidt said, “Senate Democrats are insisting on the inclusion of a $1.5 trillion wish list of additional reckless spending instead of passing the House’s continuing resolution. This shutdown is entirely the result of those unreasonable demands.”
U.S. Rep. Tracey Mann, a Republican in the mostly rural 1st District, said the shutdown was triggered by Democrats who wanted taxpayers to “pay for health care for illegal immigrants and authorize trillions of new dollars in federal spending.”
He complained Democrats would rather see Trump fail than work in a bipartisan manner to operate government.
“I understand that some in Washington prefer to grandstand and try to score political points rather than do what’s best for the country, but it is time to stop the political theater and work together to get our fiscal house in order,” Mann said.
U.S. Rep. Ron Estes, the 4th District congressman serving the Wichita area, said he had his congressional pay withheld due to the shutdown. He blamed U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-New York, and his allies for the impasse.
“Republicans have done our job,” Estes said. “I hope my Democrat colleagues will put Americans first and end this shutdown soon.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/250925_marshall1-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-10-07 18:56:41.662483

The city made mistakes in creating its original TIF district back in 2011, and the error had compounding effects for years. The City Council has approved a payment to resolve any debt to the education fund.

BURLINGTON — The Queen City is set to send more than $95,000 in tax increment financing to the state in order to reconcile mistakes that snowballed starting over a decade ago. The move, which was unanimously approved by city councilors Monday night, will pay off the city’s debt to the state education fund. 
The issue began back when the city was considering a number of infrastructure development projects downtown. 
Tax increment financing, or TIF, lets municipalities go into debt for financing public improvements and use the increase in property tax revenue to pay off their debt down the line. By law, some of that money also gets sent to the state’s education fund. 
But when Burlington created its downtown TIF district, it miscalculated the parcels of land that would be included. That error had compounding effects for years, which caused a number of financing issues in the downtown district from 2012 to 2023. 
A state audit from 2024 discovered those errors and determined that overall, Burlington owed $95,363 to the state’s education fund. That money will come from the city’s downtown TIF fund, not the city’s general fund. 
“What goes in our pot and what goes in the state pot isn’t easy to figure out,” councilor Sarah Carpenter said during Monday’s meeting. 
When introducing the resolution to councilors, Ashley Parker, Burlington’s capital programs director, expressed frustration that Burlington has to pick up the tab for its mistakes when other state bodies signed off on the erroneous reports. 
City employees made the mistake back in 2011 when they decided what parcels of land would be included in the TIF district. They accidentally left out two parcels of land that should’ve been mapped within the district, city assessor Joe Turner said at the meeting. 
One of those parcels included a 15-unit condominium, Turner said. Leaving it out “hurt the worst,” he said. And the mistakes left the city with an incorrect estimate of property tax value within the district. 
“It’s really important that the starting values are correct,” Deputy State Auditor Tim Ashe said in an interview Tuesday. Later on, those values determine how much tax revenue goes to the city and how much goes to the state education fund, he said. 
While city employees made the initial mistake, the state tax department and the Vermont Economic Progress Council also signed off on the documents that contained errors. The city tried to use that “as reason for us to not make this payment,” Parker said.
“Really, the responsibility was on a lot of different bodies who had their hands on this document,” she said. 
But ultimately, the city has to pick up the tab. 
Parker reminded council members that state auditors are set to review the city’s second TIF district, the waterfront district, soon. And it’s important to be “in good standing,” she said, with state officials who watch over their finances. 
When the audit was first released last year, Miro Weinberger, the city’s mayor at the time, claimed that some of the audit’s findings were “bogus.” 
Ashe said that auditors just look at the numbers and follow the facts. 
Even though the council unanimously approved moving the money from the TIF district into the state education fund, Ashe said auditors always follow up within the year after an audit to make sure mistakes are corrected.

(Submitted photos)North Dakota is about to lose its superintendent but gain a U.S. attorney after the U.S. Senate confirmed dozens of federal nominations Tuesday.
North Dakota Superintendent of Public Instruction Kirsten Baesler was confirmed as the next assistant secretary of elementary and secondary education at the Department of Education. The Senate voted 51-47 to confirm more than 100 nominees.
Baesler was nominated to the position in February and was advanced out of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions to the Senate floor in May.
Nicholas Chase was also confirmed as part of the U.S. Senate’s approval vote on Tuesday and will serve as the U.S. attorney for North Dakota. Chase served as a judge in North Dakota’s East Central Judicial District with chambers in Fargo after being appointed to the position by then-Gov. Doug Burgum in 2022. 
He was nominated for the position in May and was advanced to the Senate floor out of the Judiciary Committee in September.
In a social media post after his nomination, North Dakota Attorney General Drew Wrigley wrote that Chase was a “dedicated public servant with deeply held constitutional and patriotic principles.”
Chase had previously served for 20 years in North Dakota’s U.S. Attorney’s Office and rose to the rank of first assistant U.S. attorney and acting U.S. attorney. Jennifer Klemetsrud Puhl had been serving as acting U.S. attorney for North Dakota.
Terry Van Horn, spokesperson for the North Dakota U.S. Attorney’s Office, said he didn’t believe the government shutdown would affect a swearing-in ceremony for Chase.
In a statement last week, Baesler said she anticipated the federal government shutdown would delay the Department of Education’s ability to administer her oath of office.
Baesler’s new position comes during a time when Trump’s administration is trying to eliminate the Department of Education and send its programs to other federal agencies or back to the states to administer.
In May, the department announced it reduced the number of staff members at the department nearly in half before a federal judge temporarily blocked its reduction in force plan. The Supreme Court allowed the department’s downsizing efforts to continue in a 6-3 decision in July.
It will be up to Gov. Kelly Armstrong to appoint a new superintendent once Baesler officially resigns. An election for the office will be held in 2026.
Baesler was reelected to her fourth, four-year term in 2024 and has served as the state’s superintendent since 2013.
During last month’s ceremony for North Dakota Teacher of the Year, Baesler said she was ready to get started at the department.
“I’m excited about going out there and doing the work for all of our nation’s children,” Baesler said.
Baesler said her actions on education in the state have been rooted in what is best for all children in North Dakota “regardless of their zip code.”

(Photo courtesy of Planned Parenthood of Tennessee and North Mississippi.)Planned Parenthood has temporarily closed one of two Memphis clinics as a result of a federal appeals court decision that allowed the Trump administration to block patients from using Medicaid as their insurance at the reproductive health provider.
A new federal law passed by Congress and signed into law by President Donald Trump implements a one-year block for patients with Medicaid – TennCare in Tennessee – from getting care at Planned Parenthood clinics nationwide.
While the law does not specifically name Planned Parenthood, it targets any reproductive care organization that offers abortions and receives more than $800,000 in Medicaid funding annually. Planned Parenthood, a frequent target of Republicans, is the nation’s largest provider of reproductive health care.
“Due to this restriction Planned Planned Parenthood of Tennessee and North Mississippi located at 835 Virginia Run Cove…has made the decision to temporarily close this health center, beginning Monday October 6, 2025, so that we may provide care more efficiently to our Memphis-area patients,” a message posted on the the clinic’s website said. 
Planned Parenthood’s other Memphis health center on Poplar Avenue remains open, the message said.
A spokesperson for Planned Parenthood of Tennessee and North Mississippi referred questions about the closure to the website statement. Planned Parenthood also operates clinics in Nashville and Knoxville, which remain open.
Medicaid does not cover abortion and Planned Parenthood clinics in Tennessee ceased providing abortions when a state ban took effect in 2022.  Tennesseans insured through Medicaid have received primary care, gynecological care, cancer screenings, birth control and other healthcare services at the clinics.

(Patrick Lohmann/Source NM)As New Mexico lawmakers set their sights on big legislative changes this January to address a statewide doctor shortage, Republicans on a legislative health care committee criticized the Democratic committee chair for bringing in a presenter Tuesday who provided “irrelevant” statistics supporting “biased” solutions.
Northwestern University Professor Bernard Black presented the findings of his research to members of the interim Health and Human Services Committee during its meeting in Albuquerque. His presentation argued that states that adopted medical malpractice reform, particularly caps on allowable damages, did not see significant changes in health care costs or doctor retention. 
He also argued that New Mexico has not actually seen a sharp increase in certain indicators that point to medical malpractice policy as a major factor in doctors leaving the state. When adjusted for inflation, population or other factors, he said, what appear to be increasing costs or decreasing physician counts actually become largely flat trends in New Mexico over the last three decades or so. 
When accounting for inflation, for example, the amount of medical malpractice awards per physician is not increasing, he argued, and neither is the cost of medical malpractice insurance for certain high-risk specialties.

And he also said the number of physicians is not greatly decreasing per capita,   except in rural areas, which he said was “not limited to New Mexico. This is a nationwide pattern.” 
Black’s findings did not square with what committee Republicans and at least one Democrat said is happening in New Mexico. Sen. Martin Hickey (D-Albuquerque), a retired physician, dismissed out-of-hand any recommendations for New Mexico premised on the idea that the population is growing here or that doctors are not leaving. 
“It is not growing. We’re probably shrinking. The number of doctors is not increasing. In fact, we’re the only state to lose doctors, and it’s going down,” he said. “So at the core of what you’re presenting, I’m challenging.”
A recent estimate from the New Mexico Medical Society documented the departure of about 250 physicians in recent years. 
The three minutes allotted for question-and-answer prevented Black from responding to Hickey, but he did elsewhere in the presentation acknowledge gaps in the data on which he relied, including noting that some Texas data is more than 20 years old and others is best on survey data. 
“I wish we had better data. Some of the data from Texas is getting old, but it’s consistent with everything I know,” he said. 
Sen. Jay Block (R-Rio Rancho), who is on a Republican task force pushing a number of medical malpractice changes, offered to share data with Black about physician shortages. 
He was among three GOP senators who signed a news release later Tuesday denouncing Black’s presentation and contending that “progressive Democrats” such as Chair Rep. Liz Thompson (D-Albuquerque) “would rather shield trial attorneys with lies and misinformation than truly represent the needs of everyday New Mexicans who are begging for commonsense solutions to improve their access to quality healthcare.”
Still, Black defended his research, noting in the presentation that he’s published 40 peer-reviewed articles and is often cited on Google Scholar. He said he tries to use the best available information and statistical techniques to find recommendations that make him an “equal opportunity annoyer” of both Democrats and Republicans. 
Think NM: Address medical malpractice, licensing to lessen health care worker shortage

Thomson said she invited Black in to provide a national perspective looking at states that had adopted medical malpractice reforms, including what changed and what didn’t.
But she and other lawmakers bemoaned what they characterized as gaps in New Mexico-specific data that would help inform lawmakers’ next steps on the issue. 
“We are kind of shooting in the dark. We do bring in national experts, because we don’t have New Mexico data, and that is just wrong,” Thomson said, before calling on her colleagues to “figure out a way so that we can get the data that we need to make intelligent responses.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_1141.jpeg,,,2025-10-07 17:58:13.231922

The fuel revenue index (FRI) program, which allows the county to index gas taxes to the rate of inflation, is set to expire at the end of 2026. Commissioners introduced an ordinance Tuesday seeking an extension of the program. 
The county is scheduled to hold a public hearing on the item Nov. 18. 
The FRI has been a major source of additional funding for roadway projects in Southern Nevada since going into effect in 2014. The Regional Transportation Commission of Southern Nevada (RTC) currently receives 24.6 cents of the total 75.8 cents per gallon state fuel tax charged in Clark County.
M.J. Maynard-Carey, the CEO of the RTC, told commissioners in 2024 that without continuing the FRI the commission projected a $156.3 million deficit starting in 2028.
The Clark County Commission originally approved adjusting the tax for inflation in 2014, and two years later nearly 60% of Clark County approved extending the fuel revenue index until 2026. 
Assembly Bill 530, passed in the recent 2025 Legislative Session, allows the Clark County Commission, by a two-thirds vote, to extend FRI an additional decade beyond its current sunset date. Continuation beyond 2036 would require voter approval.
Similar legislation was introduced in 2023. Assembly Bill 359 passed with bipartisan support but was vetoed by Gov. Joe Lombardo. 
A business impact statement will be presented to commissioners Nov. 4.

(Henry Redman | Wisconsin Examiner)A Waukesha County judge on Monday issued a temporary partial stay of his ruling in a case over how state election authorities verify the citizenship status of people registering to vote. 
The partial stay was issued after the state Department of Justice had requested that Judge Michael Maxwell hold up the entirety of his order pending an appeal. Oral arguments will be held Oct. 31 to determine if the rest of the order should be stayed. 
Maxwell ruled Friday that the Wisconsin Elections Commission and Department of Transportation have a duty to match citizenship records with the state’s voter registration system to determine that non-citizens are not registering to vote. In his order, he also required that state and local election officials stop accepting new voter registrations without checking citizenship status and that the parties in the lawsuit meet to determine a plan for checking the existing voter rolls for non-citizen voters. 
The Monday order that partially stayed the decision put a pause on the halt to accepting voter registrations. 
DOJ had argued that Maxwell’s order would require a “massive overhaul” of the state’s voter registration system and take months to implement, that the ruling doesn’t make clear what the citizen verification requirement actually entails and potentially violates state law requiring the elections commission to maintain the electronic voter registration system. 
Non-citizens are not allowed to vote. Current law requires that people seeking to register to vote attest under penalty of imprisonment that they are U.S. citizens. In Wisconsin, immigrants without legal documentation are unable to obtain a driver’s license and a state-issued photo ID is required to register to vote. 
Despite little evidence that non-citizen voters are casting ballots in large numbers, the issue has been repeatedly raised by Republicans in recent years — particularly since President Donald Trump falsely claimed that the 2020 election was stolen from him, and among Republicans who are already skeptical of the election system as a whole.

The Burlington soccer club, fresh off a national men’s championship, is now set to expand into a women’s semi-professional league for the 2026 season.

Vermont Green FC, the semi-professional soccer club in Burlington whose men’s team won a national championship in August, plans to field a women’s team for a first-ever full season in 2026, its owners announced Tuesday.
The Green’s men’s side has played four summertime seasons — and found runaway success — since its founding in 2022. Over the last two years, the club has also fielded a women’s team for several exhibition matches, all of which Vermont has won. Those games weren’t part of any formal league or tournament, though, and instead meant to test the waters for a more permanent women’s team at some point in the future.
Now, the club is set to join United Soccer League’s USL W, a nationwide summer competition made up largely of collegiate women’s players who often aim to get recruited to play professionally. It’s a parallel of the semi-professional men’s league — United Soccer League 2 — that the Vermont Green men’s team plays in.

The club said its women’s team plans are contingent on two other clubs joining what would be a new, five-team “Northeast Division” within the national USL W league. In addition to Vermont, two teams based in Connecticut have agreed to join so far.
In its 2025 season, which ended in July, USL W had 93 teams across 15 regional divisions. Vermont Green is confident that two more Northeast teams will come on board in time for the 2026 season, Patrick Infurna, one of the club’s co-founders, said Tuesday.
“We’re just incredibly excited to continue growing soccer in Vermont,” he said.
Infurna said local hype around Vermont Green’s women’s exhibition games has made developing a permanent side a matter of when, not if. Those three games all drew sold-out crowds to the team’s home turf on the University of Vermont campus.
The team has also gotten a boost from a big name.

Ahead of its first exhibition match in 2024, it recruited Sam Mewis, who won the 2019 World Cup with the U.S. women’s national soccer team, to coach and help train its players. Mewis moved to Vermont last year after retiring from her professional soccer career in the U.S. and the U.K.
Infurna said he expects Mewis to stay involved with the club when it fields a permanent women’s squad in 2026, though he isn’t sure yet what her role will be.
“We’ve seen amazing enthusiasm over the last two summers, not only from the fans, but also from some of the nation’s top players in their desire to play here in Vermont,” Mewis said in a club press release Tuesday.
Currently, there are no active professional or semi-professional women’s soccer teams in the state, according to Infurna. Vermont Fusion, a soccer club in Manchester, has fielded a team in the semi-pro national Women’s Premier Soccer League — which is separate from USL W — in the past, though didn’t do so this year or in 2024. 
Meanwhile, he pointed to how the state has a likely little-known piece of women’s soccer history: Vermont State University Castleton, in the 1960s, was one of the first colleges in the country to give women an opportunity to play competitive soccer against other schools, predating the implementation of Title IX rules requiring equal athletic opportunities.
With its women’s team, Vermont Green is “following up on an already well-established and well-supported soccer community in Vermont,” Infurna said. “But, you know, we’re trying to take it to another level.”
Vermont Green said in the release that information about tickets and game schedules for the women’s team would be available early next year. The club expects to sell separate season tickets for its men’s and women’s teams, it said.

That’s all it took for Mtume Matthews to gather hundreds of Delta State University students, faculty, staff and neighbors to a candlelight vigil on the night of Sept. 18. 
There they mourned 21-year-old Demartravion “Trey” Reed, the first-year student who took his life earlier that week. 
The death of the Black student jolted the city of Cleveland, a small college town in northwest Mississippi with a roughly 2,700-student population, into national headlines. A flurry of social media posts with conflicting information on Reed’s death led to confusion about campus safety. 
There was also public outcry — prompting a response informed by Mississippi’s history of racism and violence — where many disputed his death twice ruled as a suicide by state and county authorities. Reed’s body was found hanging from a tree on campus Sept. 15. Results of a second independent autopsy commissioned on behalf of Reed’s family have not been released.
But Matthews said that moment of solemnity and stillness on the campus quadrangle that night gave him an idea.

“In those first few days, students just wanted answers. That was the biggest thing,” said Matthews, a junior studying flight operations. “But now, it’s like, ‘OK, where do we go next?’ How do we hold each other accountable and build a family?” 
In the weeks following the death of their classmate, students including Matthews, Jamaal Bryant and Maitlynn White have rallied their peers to process grief. They’ve created memorials and fundraisers for Reed’s family, launched new mental health initiatives for student groups and provided solutions and support on campus. 
And, university officials are taking notice. 
The day after the vigil, Bryant, president of DSU’s Divine Nine chapter, approached Matthews with a solution. He wanted Black male students to open up and express their feelings about loss. Having a safe space to do it would make everyone more comfortable, he said. 
“There’s a stigma that Black men don’t talk to anybody. That we handle things by ourselves or we don’t need anyone to lean on,” Bryant said. “That can build so much pressure within us. (Reed) could’ve been looking for someone or a community in his time of need.”

In 2023, suicide was the third-leading cause of death for Black people between the ages of 15 and 35, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Death by suicide spiked for Black males ages 10-24 by 36% between 2018-2021. 
Black youth are also less likely to receive adequate access to care than peers in other demographic groups, in part because of “systemic inequities, including racism, poverty, as well as deeply rooted stigma around mental health and well-founded cultural mistrust of the health care system,” according to an April 2024 report from Pew Charitable Trust. Risk factors for suicide can often be misunderstood or ignored in African-Americans males. 
Starting this month, the African American Student Council and Delta State’s Divine Nine, a council for the historically Black fraternities and sororities on campus, is hosting biweekly discussions on mental wellness. They  aim to provide students with coping skills to care for their mental health, as well as “building a family away from home”. 
“That’s what college is really about, you know,” said Matthews, president of the African American Student Council. “We needed to come around each other because we don’t want anyone to be isolated during this time.” 
Forty percent of the students at Delta State are Black.
The sessions will be on Fridays from 1-2 p.m. for men and 2-3 p.m. for women in the Statesmen Room. 
Each talk will feature a guest speaker, most likely a university official on campus who can share wisdom and insight on how they manage their health. They will be followed with break-out sessions and include pamphlets, guides and resources from the university’s counseling services center. 
“After the vigil, everybody kind of got the reassurance like, ‘we got each other,’” Bryant said. “We’re just trying to make sure that everybody is OK on campus. You know, get us back on a positive foot. ” 
‘The Resolve and Resiliency’
It has been difficult for students and faculty to feel like they’ve emerged from this “dark moment,” said Eddie Lovin, vice president of student affairs. 
When he was first alerted to the news, he called Paula King, the director of health and counseling services. They began to strategize what outreach and support would look like for their students. 
They opened Sillers Chapel, the university’s church, for prayer and meditation knowing that students would lean into their faith. 
King’s office began receiving an outpouring of emails and phone calls from other Mississippi public universities and colleges, Cleveland school system’s therapists and Life and Health, a community mental health agency. All offered to assist with services. 
In trying to use lessons learned from the fatal shooting on campus of history professor Ethan Schmidt in September 2015, King said her staff knew how to manage that swell of support. 
They learned that support for students was needed in weeks following a traumatic event, rather than in that moment. 
Symptoms of grief like irritability and trouble sleeping and concentrating, can show up much later, she said. The goal for King and her staff these past few weeks has been to increase awareness around resources and services. 


“A lot of what we’ve done has been making sure people know what to expect when you experience something traumatic and that you did not have to know (Reed) to be affected by his death. That it is kind of a human thing to feel that way,” Paula King, director of health and counseling services.


“We have definitely seen an influx of traffic,” King said. “A lot of what we’ve done has been making sure people know what to expect when you experience something traumatic and that you did not have to know (Reed) to be affected by his death. That it is kind of a human thing to feel that way.” 
Lovin also received a text from Hayden Kirkhart, president of the student government association. Kirkhart told him the students were setting up tables in the lobby of the Union so peer counselors could connect and talk. It was the initiative within those first few hours that overwhelmed Lovin with admiration. 
“Our student leaders stepped into the trenches right there alongside administration, faculty and staff trying to provide that support knowing that they were also dealing with everything going on,” Lovin said. “The resolve and resiliency of them in the face of everything, I got strengthened every time I found out they were doing this for each other.” 
‘Strong minds, Strong Statesmen’ 
The announcement of Reed’s death hit close to home for Maitlynn White.
White, a senior studying elementary education, lost a childhood friend from suicide during her freshman year. The pain she felt in the moment was heavy and isolating. But, it was small, simple messages that reminded her that her friend “was in God’s arms, at peace.”

“I realized how important it is to be there for others and  create spaces where students can support each other,” said White, president of College Panhellenic Council. “That experience inspired me to step into the role of being a student for students making sure no one has to grieve alone.” 
So White pulled a six-pack box of colorful sidewalk chalk from the trunk of her car. She walked to different spots on campus and wrote affirmations. 
“You got this,” said one note scrawled in blue chalk on the sidewalk near Cain-Tatum and Lawler-Hawkins Hall. It was accompanied by a big smiley face. 
“Strong minds, Strong Statesmen,” said another affirmation in white and black chalk, echoing school pride, colors and mascot. 
“You are loved,” one note said,  ‘o’ replaced with a pink heart.

With an increase in mental health campaigns, students are encouraging open dialogue to create a campus culture where everyone is supported and valued, White said. 
The sidewalk messages to students were a break from the solitude, stress and confusion everyone was feeling at the time. Writing them became a reminder of her own strength in that moment. Everyone is processing this loss together, she said. 
“No college student wants to talk about how they’re really feeling,” White said. “Most of the students here are experiencing a loss of a peer for the first time. The mental health campaigns and initiatives we establish now will continue well after we graduate.”
Speaking of Reed, she said. “It’s to honor him and make sure that no Delta State student is left behind.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-07 21:15:09+00:00,CT Mirror,CT GOP calls for reforms to earmark process: ‘There’s no oversight’,Mark Pazniokas,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/07/gop-calls-for-earmark-reforms/,Their press conference was pegged to an FBI investigation into Sen. Doug McCrory and the trial of former CT budget official Kosta Diamantis.,"Republicans called Tuesday for reforms of how Connecticut state lawmakers earmark tens of millions of dollars annually in grants for favored nonprofit groups with scant vetting, oversight or transparency.
“There’s no application process, there’s no public hearing, there’s no statutory requirements, there’s no oversight before, during or after,” said Sen. Rob Sampson, R-Wolcott. “Essentially, it’s a closed-door process, where political connections decide who gets our money.”
The press conference by the House and Senate Republican minority leadership was pegged to the FBI investigation of the role played by Democratic Sen. Doug McCrory of Hartford in determining earmarks, as well as the trial that opened this week of a former school construction official charged with bribery.
“We have this culture of corruption in which the candy store is open,” said Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield.
“I guess it’s a good thing — but embarrassing for the state of Connecticut — but the FBI is doing our work for us,” said House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford.
Disclosure of the FBI investigation has brought new attention to the age-old political art of using earmarks to garner votes for a budget, a practice that exponentially increased as COVID relief arrived via the federal American Rescue Plan Act. 
Earmarks grew relatively scarce in the decade after the 2008 recession, but ARPA gave lawmakers a deep funding pool that allowed them to disburse $281 million in directed grants, Republicans said.
As the ARPA money ran dry, as the Connecticut Mirror reported in August, legislators appropriated $60 million over the past two biennial budget cycles for unrestricted grants.
The top Senate Democrats, Senate President Pro Tem Martin M. Looney of New Haven and Senate Majority Leader Bob Duff of Norwalk, dismissed the news conference as a political stunt and noted that the GOP leaders have been silent about what they say are the greater misdeeds of President Donald Trump.
“Connecticut Republicans’ sudden concern about transparency is predictably hypocritical. They’re silent about the massive actual corruption happening in Washington under Donald Trump,” said the Senate Democrats in a statement.
As examples, they offered “Trump’s border czar getting $50,000 in a paper bag to steer contracts, Trump’s foreign bailout for billionaire donors, Trump’s constant leverage of the government for his own enrichment, and Trump’s administration hiding the Epstein files and considering a pardon for Ghislaine Maxwell.”
Neither Looney nor Duff responded to calls for comments on what previously has been exposed as an earmark process with few standards. McCrory, who remains on the board of the Community Investment Fund, which distributed competitive grants, declined to comment.
In an interview, House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, shared the annoyance expressed by Looney and Duff, but he acknowledged the desirability of some reforms.
“At the end of the day, people want to get political. That’s fine,” Ritter said. “But do I think there are people who want to look at the process and get some questions answered? Yes, and I’m one of them.”
Ritter said he was open to some of the basic reforms suggested by the Republicans, including requiring nonprofit recipients of grants to submit financial documents, including their 990 tax returns. Those documents are public information, but the state agencies that disburse the earmarks do not routinely require them.
But he said Republicans are being disingenuous in claiming they never have sought or obtained earmarks.
“If you want to clean it up in a bipartisan way, let’s have that conversation. But you can’t ignore precedent or past practice that you participated in, and I don’t think you can honestly sit there with a straight face as a party and wag the finger at Democrats, given the things going on in this country,” Ritter said. “It’s very hypocritical, in my opinion.”
Candelora, who generally has a constructive relationship with Ritter, complained that the extent of the earmarks has grown while the oversight has shrunk. The GOP minority scrambles to assess the legitimacy of recipients, some of whom are new.
Yes, he said, earmarks have been around for a long time.
“These are always contained in the budget,” Candelora said. “We’re relying on AI and chat GPT to figure out where they go. We don’t think that’s a prudent way to do things.”
Sampson noted that $75,000 went to Black Girls Get LegalTee, Inc., a Norwalk organization that got IRS tax-exempt status only a year ago. Its listed agent of services is the sister of state Rep. Kadeem Roberts, D-Norwalk.
“Shouldn’t that at least raise a question about a conflict of interest?” Sampson said.
Roberts did not return a call seeking comment.
Roberts is a member of the Black and Puerto Rican Caucus, whose members are each granted $150,000 to distribute in earmarks, a practice established after the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown.
Urban lawmakers and community advocates said the killing of 20 students and six educators was understandably galvanizing, and it led to passage of some of the nation’s strongest gun safety laws. But they said the reaction underscored to them the tolerance of a steady and largely unnoticed wave of violence claiming the lives of urban young.
Candelora said the Republicans are “all for helping high-risk children, for helping reduce violence in our cities. That earmark was made well-intentioned. And it’s lost its way, very clearly.”
Many of the grants have little connection with preventing youth violence, he said. The reforms could help them rediscover their original purpose.
“I think that this process would reassert and make sure that the spirit of what we pass is fulfilled, because we’re all sympathetic to the issues in our cities. We want to reduce violence,” Candelora said, “For me, Nothing is more frustrating to watch that money be squandered and wasted by legislators who have pet projects and don’t care about the people in their districts.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/67A83BA9-8334-4D7C-A2FC-AA535B2E0CE7-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-07 17:58:13.231922

Circuit Judge Daniel Green ruled Tuesday that the latest language drafted by Missouri Secretary of State Denny Hoskins and approved by Attorney General Catherine Hanaway is now “fair and sufficient.” It was Hoskins’ second attempt to write a summary that will appear on the ballot, and the approved version still doesn’t specifically mention that most abortions would be banned. 
The language approved Tuesday by Green states:
“Shall the Missouri Constitution be amended to:

Guarantee women’s medical care for emergencies, ectopic pregnancies, and miscarriages; 
Ensure women’s safety during abortions; 
Ensure parental consent for minors; 
Repeal Article I, section 36, approved in 2024; allow abortions for medical emergencies, fetal anomalies, rape, and incest;
and Prohibit sex-change procedures for children?”


Until this week, the fourth bullet was the sticking point for Green, who said that Hoskins had to be more explicit in stating that a current constitutional amendment would be repealed. The previous ballot language used the word “amend” rather than “repeal,” which Green called an “insufficient and unfair” characterization of the measure.
But attorneys representing abortion-rights organizations said even with the inclusion of the word “repeal,” the current language continues to be misleading, in part because it does not include the name of the amendment that would be repealed, instead assuming voters know that it’s a reference to “The Right to Reproductive Freedom Initiative.” 
“The secretary’s new bullet point four also still implies that (the amendment) gives rights to Missourians for the first time,” attorneys Chuck Hatfield with Stinson LLP and Tori Schafer with the ACLU of Missouri, wrote in a court filing opposing the language on Monday. “Voters should not be made to believe that, for the first time, Missourians will have access to abortions in certain circumstances.”
Missouri attorney general subpoenas Planned Parenthood for patient abortion records

The passage of the reproductive rights amendment, which was listed as Amendment 3 on the 2024 ballot, enshrined the right to abortion up to the point of fetal viability in the state constitution. This legalized broader access to abortion than Missourians had seen in years. 
Before November 2024, almost all abortions were illegal in Missouri, with limited exceptions for medical emergencies. 
The proposed new ban, which will also be listed as Amendment 3 on the 2026 ballot, would be slightly less restrictive than the near-total ban implemented in June 2022. It would allow abortions for survivors or rape or incest up to 12 weeks gestation, though it is not clear if or how a survivor would need to prove the assault in order to receive medical care.
Hoskins was tasked with rewriting the ballot language in keeping with a new law after Green determined the initial wording by lawmakers failed to alert voters that the amendment would ban most abortions.
Today’s decision confirms that our office is following the law and protecting the integrity of Missouri’s ballot,” Hoskins said in a statement Tuesday. 
Hoskins was also responsible for writing the fair ballot statement that appears in polling places and on the office’s website that summarize what both a “yes” and “no” vote mean.
This approved fair ballot statement lays out that a “yes” vote would guarantee women’s medical care under specific scenarios, including ectopic pregnancies and miscarriages, and allow abortions in the first 12 weeks festation in cases of rape or incest. It would also ban gender-affirming health care for minors.   
A “no” vote, Hoskins wrote, in part, would “limit abortion” to specific scenarios.
Attorneys for abortion-rights groups also took issue with this language, arguing in court filings Monday that it doesn’t make clear that “instead of enshrining a right for the first time,” the proposed amendment “reduces the protections currently existing in the constitution.”
The judge also weighed whether the inclusion of a ban on gender-affirming care for minors violates the constitution’s prohibition on ballot questions containing more than one subject. Critics say the provision targeting transgender care  is nothing more than “ballot candy” designed to trick voters. 
Green disagreed, giving the amendment approval for the ballot after concluding that abortion and gender-affirming health care were related enough to meet constitutional requirements for a single subject.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_0817-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-07 17:58:13.231922

The drought, the floods of the last couple of years — the extremes, the swings — all of it is related to climate change.

This story by Briana Brady was first published in the Shelburne News on Oct. 2, 2025.
Anyone taking a walk near Shelburne Beach can see it: the lake is low. The beach stretches out farther than some may have ever seen it. Lake Champlain is nearing a historic low water level that was recorded in 1908.
Despite some rain in the last week or so, most of Vermont is considered in “severe” or “extreme” drought, with the worst off areas in the southern half of the state. While the water levels in the lake might be one of the most visible impacts of the drought, ecosystems from the headwaters of the LaPlatte River to the wetlands it travels through are feeling the impacts.
“So much of the effects of climate change are like an extreme storm or it’s not raining outside, but the lake is like a signal. It’s a signal we can see and we can touch and we can jump into or walk on top of, based on what the weather is doing, what the climate is doing,” Matthew Vaughn, the lead scientist at the Champlain Basin program said.

According to scientists, this drought is part of a cycle of floods and drought Vermont has been experiencing, exacerbated by climate change, and the long-term effects are largely unknown.
A perennial concern for the watershed and the lake is the amount of phosphorus in the system, which can cause dangerous algae blooms. According to Vaughn, the impact of drought on the level of phosphorus in Lake Champlain is not even — it depends on the weather and the location.
With little wind and low water levels in shallow parts of the lake, phosphorus that has sunk in sediment to the lakebed may be released into less water. That can create higher concentrations of phosphorus. According to Vaughn, he is less concerned about Shelburne Bay experiencing more concentrated phosphorus during this drought than other areas — Shelburne is much closer to meeting its water quality target, and recently there has been at least some rain.
In fact, in some places, Vaughn noted, the lake might show lower levels of phosphorus than usual. Less water moving through the system means less phosphorus reaching the lake. However, the phosphorus will still build up in the system — when it does rain, everything will still wash downstream.
Like the lake, the surrounding wetlands are also much drier. Although shorebirds might be experiencing expanding feeding grounds in shallow, muddy areas, for animals like waterfowl, their nesting areas may not be as available. The trend continues upstream.
“We’re finding our cold-water species are the ones we’re most worried about, but we find that they’re holding on as long as there’s pools with cold water in them,” said Will Eldridge, an aquatic habitat biologist with Vermont Fish and Wildlife.
The brook trout, for example, Eldridge noted, seem to be doing alright. They haven’t experienced any large decline in population. Although there are some areas without water, and therefore no fish, those that have found pools of water to wait out the drought are surviving. Partially, he said, this might be thanks to the fact that during this drought period, Vermont didn’t simultaneously experience extreme heat — the streams and pools stayed cool, as most of the water flowing through them is ground water.
However, the recharge of groundwater is its own issue.
This summer, after finding a large leak in its water system, which currently operates on a single well, Hinesburg halted all new water allocations. Concerns about water in town were exacerbated by the drought.
“Especially in a time like this, when we haven’t had any significant rain to help replenish the aquifer in a while, and that, you know, looking forward, it doesn’t seem like there’s going to be any for a while,” town manager Todd Odit said at a selectboard meeting at the end of August.
Groundwater in Vermont is often replenished not just from rains throughout the spring and summer, but also through snowpack. In fact, according to Eldridge, during winter, snow often leads to a greater recharge of the system than rain, slowly absorbing into the ground rather than running off into streams and rivers.
The drought, the floods of the last couple of years, all of it is related to climate change. Summer droughts like the one Vermont is experiencing may show us how low aquifers can get, but warm, rainy winters might be setting the stage for those droughts.
“There’s things that we’ve shown have recharged the groundwater and actually helped maintain base flow during dry periods,” Eldridge said. The example he gave were establishing headwater wetlands — areas that will better absorb water even without snowpack during the winter. In places like the LaPlatte headwaters, this might help the aquatic ecosystem maintain during drought.
Both Eldridge and Vaughn agree that the current drought is part of what seems to be a recurring cycle: drought and flooding.
“My greater concern definitely is, are the extremes we’re seeing where we have, you know, two years of really extreme, unusual flooding, where we had, like, episodic events that brought a lot of rain all at once for over a day or two period, and now this pretty notable dry spell just within a few years, I think we’re really seeing the effects of climate change, and we’re seeing it too with our patterns of precipitation, even in typical years,” Vaughn said.

[…]","Photo illustration by Getty Images.A group aiming to protect ballot initiatives in Montana has filed a Constitutional amendment to ensure Montanans can petition to enact laws in the state without interference.
“This initiative protects the right of Montana voters to propose and vote on laws that matter to them,” said SK Rossi, spokesperson for Montanans Decide, in a statement. “Too often, politicians forget who they work for and they push agendas that serve their own interests rather than listening to what voters want.
“Montanans know what is best for Montana, and this measure protects our right to propose and vote on laws that put our interests first.”
The Montana Constitution protects the right of the people to enact laws by ballot initiative.
However, Montanans Decide said the process to place measures on the ballot is under fire, and it must be protected in the state Constitution.
The proposed language states the process to submit ballot initiatives must be impartial, predictable, transparent and expeditious, and the government should not support or oppose a ballot measure.
The proposed ballot language is this:

        The Montana constitution reserves to the people the powers of initiative and referendum. CI-*** amends the constitution to protect this fundamental right from unjustified interference by the government. Specifically, CI-*** requires impartial, predictable, open, and timely processes for ballot issues, including approving petitions and ballot statements, resolving legal challenges, and verifying signatures. It requires the state to allow ample time for signature gathering, and prohibits disqualification of petitions because of minor or technical issues and allows voters to withdraw their signatures if they choose.    
 
In an email Monday, Rossi said the citizen initiative process in Montana used to be “much more straightforward.”
“Over the years, the legislature has made it much more difficult and complicated for Montana voters to exercise our right to propose and vote on laws that affect our lives,” Rossi said.
In the last couple of sessions, for example, Rossi said the legislature added “exorbitant fees” and administrative hurdles for signature gatherers.
“Montanans have a right to propose and vote on laws that affect our lives, but the process is under attack,” Rossi said in the news release. “This measure protects that right and keeps government accountable to us.”
In 2024, a district court judge found a $3,700 filing fee to propose an initiative to be unconstitutional in a lawsuit over ballot measure restrictions including ones in Senate Bill 93 from 2023.
Lewis and Clark District Court Judge Mike Menahan also struck down a requirement for review by a legislative committee as unconstitutional, although he upheld some other changes the plaintiffs had challenged from the 2021 and 2023 sessions.
For example, Menahan said the agency reviews the plaintiffs challenged might not be necessary to the process, but that didn’t make them automatically unconstitutional.
The judge said he was sympathetic to the short timelines the plaintiffs faced, but the legislature is allowed to set terms for how the power of initiative is exercised, and agency reviews should be considered individually.
In a news release, Montanans Decide said attempts to infringe on the citizens’ initiative process continued in the 2025 Legislature, “making this constitutional initiative critical to protect the voice of Montana voters.”
If approved for the ballot, the proposed Constitutional amendment will come before voters in November 2026.
To appear on the ballot, the measure requires the Montana Attorney General to approve its language as legal, as outlined by the Montana Secretary of State’s Office.
It then requires signatures from at least 10% of electors in Montana, including at least 10% in each of 40 legislative House districts.
The Secretary of State’s Office lists seven other measures that could appear on the November 2026 ballot, including Constitutional initiatives to require nonpartisan judicial elections and ones to limit property taxes.
Montanans Decide’s committee registration to the Commissioner of Political Practices is dated Friday. Its first campaign finance report is due on Jan. 5, 2026.
In the meantime, Rossi said the effort is supported by “passionate people here in Montana.”
“This is a home-grown effort, and our coalition is made up of groups, volunteers, and grassroots donors across Montana who are working to get this amendment onto the ballot and passed next November,” Rossi said in an email. “ … And only Montana voters will have the power to pass this ballot measure.”

The bill they passed remains pending the governor's signature. (Getty Images)Federal action this week on vaccines has cleared the way for New Mexico health officials to purchase COVID-19 vaccines for children. 
However, a state public health order intended to improve COVID-19 vaccine access remains in effect, while state legislation that would provide New Mexico health officials more options for its vaccine policy remains pending.
On Monday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced that Acting CDC Director Jim O’Neill had signed off on the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices’ recommendations for the COVID-19 vaccines.
While previous guidelines recommended COVID-19 vaccines for most people, the current recommendations appear less clear-cut. 
“ACIP’s recommendation emphasized that the risk-benefit of vaccination in individuals under age 65 is most favorable for those who are at an increased risk for severe COVID-19 and lowest for individuals who are not at an increased risk,” the CDC news release said.
While the CDC site, as of publication, had not been completely updated with the vaccination schedules, the news release also emphasized “individual-based decision-making,” along with “shared clinical decision-making” for people seeking vaccines.
In a statement provided to Source NM, state Health Secretary Gina DeBlassie confirmed that the CDC signoff on the ACIP guidelines means New Mexico will be able to purchase COVID-19 vaccines for children, which the state had been stymied from doing while those guidelines were in limbo.
DOH Communications Director Robert Nott, in an email response to questions from Source, said the state expects to have a supply of the vaccine for children within two weeks.
Nott also noted that, “Since the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends anyone 6 months or older can get a COVID vaccine with shared clinical decision making, it means anyone can get a COVID vaccination without a prescription and yes, it is covered by insurance.”
Moreover, he added, the “‘adult formulation’ for Pfizer/Modern/Novavax is approved for those age 12 and over, so pharmacies and providers who have adult COVID vaccine on hand can vaccinate people 12 and over. (i.e. adults).”
Prior to the CDC adopting the recommendations, state lawmakers last week during a special legislative session passed Senate Bill 3 in part to address the state’s ability to purchase children’s COVID-19 vaccines in the face of federal uncertainty.
The bill also, however, contains a provision allowing the health department to rely on other professional organizations besides ACIP for New Mexico’s vaccine policy.
SB3 remains the only piece of legislation from the special session Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham has yet to sign, after state Republicans’ opposition blocked an emergency clause that would have allowed it to go into effect immediately.
A spokesperson for the governor’s office told Source NM the governor is expected to take action on the bill later this week.
In the meantime, New Mexico Department of Health Communications Director Robert Nott confirmed that DeBlassie’s standing public health order from September remains in place.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/vaccinekids5andyounger-scaled-1-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-10-07 17:58:13.231922

(Photo by Clark Kauffman/Iowa Capital Dispatch; board seal courtesy State of Iowa)Five years after an Iowa nurse was convicted of drug-related crimes, he has agreed to surrender his Controlled Substances Act registration to the Iowa Board of Pharmacy.
The disciplinary case is one of several in which the board has recently sanctioned Iowa-licensed pharmacists for criminal offenses, drug-dispensing errors and other violations.
State records indicate that in 2020, advanced registered nurse practitioner Robbie Robinson of Sioux City was criminally charged with 10 counts of obtaining a prescription drug by fraud.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
He later pleaded guilty to one count of tampering with records, a charge that was tied to allegations that he wrote a prescription for Bactrim for his girlfriend; one count of fraudulent practices in the third degree, for allegedly billing the cost of the drug to her insurance, and one count of obtaining a prescription drug by fraud, for allegedly writing a prescription for his girlfriend without the authority to do so.
In January 2021, the Iowa Board of Nursing charged Robinson with prescribing or dispensing drugs to individuals who either weren’t patients or were outside his area of specialty. The board also charged Robinson with prescribing or dispensing drugs without adequately documenting the work or without evaluating the patient.
As a result of those charges, the board allowed Robinson to keep his nursing license subject to one year of probation.
In June 2022, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services issued a ruling affirming that Robinson was excluded from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and all federal health care programs for five years. During his exclusion, DHHS ruled, Robinson could not use his federal Drug Enforcement Administration registration, which he then surrendered.
Under Iowa law, Robinson cannot maintain an Iowa Controlled Substances Act registration without a federal DEA registration and so, in July 2025, Robinson agreed to surrender his CSA registration to the Iowa Board of Pharmacy.
In its September 2025 decision agreeing to the registration surrender, the board did not indicate why the action was being taken five years after Robinson’s arrest.
Other Iowa Board of Pharmacy licensees recently sanctioned include:
— Benjamin Grote, who has agreed to refrain from practicing pharmacy in Iowa. According to the board, Grote also maintains a Nebraska pharmacist license that is currently under probation for reasons the Iowa board has not disclosed.
The Iowa board alleges Grote is “currently unable to practice pursuant to Iowa Administrative Code 504.2(4),” which is a state regulation that speaks to professional misconduct related to a licensee’s excessive use of alcohol or drugs.
According to the board, in order to meet its interest in protecting the public, Grote has agreed to suspend his practice in Iowa pending a board review of his ability to practice safely. The board has opted not to publicly disclose the city or pharmacy where Grote has practiced.
While the Iowa board has disclosed very little information about the allegations against Grote, Nebraska state licensing officials have publicly detailed a long history of arrests and disciplinary actions in which Grote has been involved.
Records from the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services indicate that in 2007 Grote engaged in unprofessional conduct when he sent a sexually suggestive email to “a young female co-worker.”
Grote was also accused of making inappropriate sexual inquiries of a young, female job applicant, asking about her drinking habits and whether she and her partner used condoms. He allegedly presented the applicant with a box of condoms at the conclusion of the job interview. As a result of those allegations, Nebraska officials placed Grote’s license on probation for five years.
In 2019, the Nebraska board suspended Grote’s license for 12 months after he was allegedly convicted of third-offense drunken driving in Iowa.
In 2021, the state of Nebraska reinstated Grote’s license subject to one year of probation that required him to abstain from alcohol.
In 2022, Nebraska officials extended Grote’s probation, censured him and fined him $500 after he was allegedly arrested again for third-offense drunken driving. In July 2025, Nebraska officials suspended Grote’s pharmacy license for 30 days and fined him $2,000, alleging he had tested positive for the use of alcohol.
In August 2025, Grote allegedly participated in a substance abuse assessment in which he admitted consuming eight “shooters” — a term typically used to describe 50-milliliter bottles of alcohol — per day since his license was suspended.
That same month, Grote was allegedly pulled over driving north in the southbound lanes of a highway in Platte County, Nebraska. Police alleged he had a blood-alcohol level that was three times the legal limit, and they charged him with felony fifth-offense drunken driving, an open-container violation and other offenses. Those criminal charges are still pending, according to state records.
— Robert Rehal, who practices in Sioux City, was charged by the board with dispensing an incorrect medication in May 2024 by failing to “verify the correct medication was in the correct bag for the correct patient.”
The board has opted not to publicly disclose the nature of the medication, the name of the pharmacy where the drugs were dispensed, or the patient outcome. Rehal agreed to have his license placed on probation for one year.
— Kerry Hogan, who practices in Urbandale, was charged by the board with dispensing an incorrect prescription drug to a patient in April 2024 by filling two separate prescription bottles with the same medication rather than providing the two “separate and distinct medications the patient had been prescribed.”
The board has opted not to publicly disclose the nature of the medications, the name of the pharmacy where the drugs were dispensed, or the patient outcome. Hogan was issued a warning and fined $1,000.
— Kindra Kruse, who has been charged by the board with diverting prescription drugs from a pharmacy for her personal use or for distribution. The board alleges that four years ago, in 2021, it fielded a complaint alleging Kruse had diverted controlled substances from the pharmacy where she worked.
After a board investigation, Kruse agreed to enroll in the Iowa Monitoring Program for Pharmacy Professionals, but then failed to cooperate with the terms of the program and surrendered her license in January 2022. In June 2024, Kruse applied for, and was granted, reinstatement of her pharmacist’s license and was ordered to comply with all provisions of disciplinary probation.
The board alleges Kruse has not complied with all provisions of her probation. Kruse has agreed to voluntarily surrender her license. The board has not disclosed the city or the pharmacy where Kruse has practiced.

This story was originally reported by Mel Leonor Barclay and Shefali Luthra of The 19th. Meet Mel  and Shefali and read more of their reporting on gender, politics and policy.
In the lead up to her son’s birth, Jacqueline made plans to call 911 for an ambulance to pick her up from her North Florida home and transport her to a hospital about an hour away.
The second-time mom and Guatemalan immigrant, who has lived in the country for a decade, would have relied on her husband to drive her to the hospital. But a few months ago he was deported, leaving Jacqueline and her daughter without the family’s primary source of income, transportation and support.
One morning in March, Jacqueline said, her partner was pulled over on his way to work when law enforcement officials discovered he didn’t have a valid driver’s license. Jacqueline’s pregnancy was in its early stages. Her husband fought his case from detention for three months before U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) removed him to Guatemala.
“He was deported and I was left behind, thinking, ‘What am I going to do?’” said Jacqueline, who requested that her last name not be published because she lacks permanent legal status. The couple shares an 8-year-old daughter who was born in, and is a citizen of, the United States.
This summer, as she entered the later stages of this pregnancy amid the Trump administration’s turbocharged immigration enforcement, Jacqueline found herself so fearful of being detained that she avoided leaving her home. Her husband’s car sits in the driveway, but there are no signs of him in the small room Jacqueline shares with her daughter. His belongings — tools, clothes, even personal photos — are with him in Guatemala. The only family pictures Jacqueline has are on her phone.
Her partner was the family’s main provider, rotating between picking strawberries or watermelon and packing pine needles for mulch, depending on the season.
Jacqueline struggled to get the most basic items to welcome a baby: Someone gifted her a used carseat and crib, which sit in the packed room along with onesies and other clothing items she’s collected inside a large plastic bag. She’s hoping that a federal assistance program will cover the cost of formula. A baby tub is still on her list.
Medical care in her rural area has been possible only because a small nonprofit organization nearby that provides prenatal care services offered to pay for Ubers so she could continue regular check-ups. Even if she wasn’t behind the wheel, Jacqueline says that just the act of leaving her home feels risky since her husband’s deportation.
“Things got really complicated. He paid our rent — he paid for everything,” she said. “Now, I’m always worried.”

Medical care and support essential to a healthy pregnancy have become harder for people like Jacqueline to obtain following President Donald Trump’s inauguration. Many patients — nervous about encountering immigration officials if they leave their homes, drive on public roads or visit a medical clinic — are skipping virtually all of their pregnancy-related health care. Some are opting to give birth at home with the help of midwives because of the possible presence of ICE at hospitals.
Across the country, medical providers who serve immigrant communities said fewer patients are coming in for prenatal or other pregnancy-related care. As a result, patients are experiencing dangerous complications, advocates and health care providers told The 19th.
“Fear of ICE is pushing my patients and their families away from the very systems meant to protect their health and their pregnancies,” said Dr. Josie Urbina, an OB-GYN in San Francisco.
In January, Trump rescinded a federal policy that protected designated areas including hospitals, health clinics and doctors’ offices from immigration raids. ICE has recently targeted patients in hospital maternity wards and on their way home from prenatal visits.
A majority of Americans believe ICE should not be carrying out immigration enforcement at health centers. A new poll from The 19th and SurveyMonkey conducted in mid-September found that most Americans don’t think ICE should be allowed to detain immigrants at hospitals, their workplace, domestic violence shelters, schools or churches.
Women are more likely to oppose enforcement in these spaces than men. More than two-thirds of women said ICE shouldn’t be allowed to detain immigrants in hospital settings.
Enforcement is only expected to grow as the administration works to meet its ambitious deportation goals. The federal government is pouring more than $170 billion over the next four years into expanding immigration enforcement, the result of Trump’s signature tax-and-spending bill. About $45 billion has been directed to expanding detention facilities; $29.9 billion is to increase ICE activity.
That expansion could put even more births at risk. Approximately 250,000 babies are born every year to immigrants without permanent legal status. Already, research has shown these immigrants, who have higher uninsured rates, are less likely to seek prenatal care and are at risk of worse birth outcomes.
Major medical groups, including the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecologists, World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend regular prenatal and postpartum care as a key tool to combat pregnancy-related death and infant mortality.
According to the federal Office of Women’s Health, infants born to parents who received no prenatal care are three times more likely to have a low birth weight and five times more likely to die than those born to parents who received regular care.
A CDC analysis published last year found infant mortality rates went up the later families began prenatal care: 4.54 deaths per 100,000 deaths for families whose prenatal care began in the first trimester, compared with 10.75 families whose prenatal care began in the third trimester or who did not receive any at all.
“A lot of patients aren’t going to get help,” said Yenny James, the founder and CEO of Paradigm Doulas in the Dallas-Fort Worth metro.
After her husband’s deportation, Jacqueline became so fearful of being detained that she avoided leaving her home. “He was deported and I was left behind, thinking, ‘What am I going to do?’” she said. (Michelle Bruzzese for The 19th)
James said she’s seeing an increasing number of emergency cesarean sections  because of untreated gestational diabetes, or preeclampsia — a deadly pregnancy complication — that went unnoticed because of lacking prenatal care.
In Denver, OB-GYN Dr. Rebecca Cohen has delivered multiple babies this year for women who have told her that, because they fear endangering themselves or their families, they have received no prenatal care. Several have given birth to babies with fatal fetal anomalies that were never diagnosed because the women did not receive prenatal ultrasounds.
“They were willing to forgo care — their own health care — but to find out that something was devastatingly wrong with their child is when they feel like maybe they should have risked it,” Cohen said. “There’s a sound of a mother’s wail that anybody who has worked labor and delivery has known, and it will haunt you for the rest of your life. To hear that when it could have been prevented, it is just absolutely devastating.”
Early in her pregnancy, Jacqueline received free care at a local clinic. Shortly after her husband’s detention, she called the office to let them know she likely wouldn’t make her next appointment.
“I told them that I probably wouldn’t be able to make my appointments anymore, well, because I’m really afraid given what happened to my husband. And they offered to help,” she said.
Jacqueline and the nonprofit clinic worked out an arrangement: The day of her appointments, someone at the clinic called an Uber to her home, paid for by the clinic, and let her know when it would arrive so she could be ready.
Many people in her small town have come to rely on a single person who does have a valid driver’s license for transportation. That driver recently brought Jacqueline to an appointment with the local office that manages the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC), which she is relying on for baby formula and food. There were no guarantees that this driver would be available to take her in whenever she goes into labor.
The Biden administration directed ICE not to detain, arrest or take into custody pregnant, postpartum or breastfeeding people simply for breaking immigration laws, except under “exceptional circumstances.” The Trump administration has not formally reversed that policy. But despite the directive, reports from across the country confirm that ICE has detained numerous pregnant immigrants since Trump took office.
James said that until the Biden guidance is formally rescinded, she will continue to encourage pregnant immigrants to print it out and carry it with them.
“I told my doulas — have them print out this ICE directive, have them keep it with them, so that they know and these agents know that we know our rights, our clients know their rights,” James said.

It’s unclear exactly how many pregnant immigrants are being detained by ICE, or have been arrested by the agency. A May report from the office of Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin found 14 pregnant women in a single Louisiana detention facility at the time of staff’s visit.
Another report out of the office of Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff published in late July found 14 credible reports of mistreatment of pregnant women in immigrant detention. The report cited an anonymous agency official who said they saw pregnant women sleeping on floors in overcrowded intake cells. The partner of a pregnant woman in federal custody said that she bled for days before she was taken to a hospital, where she miscarried alone. A pregnant detainee who spoke to Ossoff’s office said she repeatedly asked for medical attention and was told to “just drink water.” The office received several reports of clients waiting weeks to see a doctor, and that sometimes scheduled appointments were canceled. ICE has disputed the report.
“Pregnant women receive regular prenatal visits, mental health services, nutritional support, and accommodations aligned with community standards of care. Detention of pregnant women is rare and has elevated oversight and review. No pregnant woman has been forced to sleep on the floor,” ICE said in a statement posted on their website.
ICE did not respond to a request for comment.
Fear of being detained is a major contributor of stress for pregnant immigrants. Research shows that even when pregnant patients do receive medical care, prenatal stress puts many at greater risk of complicated births and poor outcomes, including premature birth and low infant birth weight. Babies born after an immigration raid are at a 24 percent higher risk of low birth weight, according to one study.
Monica, 38, is expecting her fourth child in November. The Tucson resident, who requested that her last name not be published out of fear of being detained, has lived in the United States for two decades but has no legal immigration status.
This pregnancy has been unlike the others, she said: While Monica has continued with her prenatal care appointments, her anxiety levels about her immigration situation have colored her experience. Her other children, who are in their teens, are U.S. citizens but grappling with the stress of their parents’ situation. Her husband also doesn’t have authorization to live in the country.
“We try to be out and about much less, and to take precautions,” she said. “Whenever we do leave the house, we have it in the back of our minds.”
Monica said she has seen reports of ICE being allowed inside hospitals, and she is worried about facing immigration officers while or following her birth. Her plan is to have her partner and a group of friends at the hospital to make sure she’s never alone.
“My biggest fear is going to the hospital,” she said.
Stress like Monica’s makes pregnancy more dangerous.

“In our hospital, every doctor I’ve talked to — and these are doctors that have been there 20 years — all are saying these past six months they’ve seen worse obstetrics outcomes than ever in their career,” Dr. Parker Duncan Diaz, a family physician in Santa Rosa, California, whose clinic mostly cares for Latinx patients. That’s included more preterm labor and more pregnant patients with severe hypertension.
“I don’t know what’s causing it, but my bias is that it is the impact of this horribly toxic stress environment,” he added, specifically noting the stress caused by the threat of immigration enforcement.
In recent months, Dr. Caitlin Bernard, an Indiana-based OB-GYN, has seen a number of pregnant patients seeking emergency attention who have not received any prenatal health care. One was 31 weeks, approaching the end of her pregnancy. Another was more than 20 weeks pregnant when she came to Bernard’s office, having developed complications from a molar pregnancy — a rare condition that means a healthy birth is impossible and that without early treatment can result in vaginal bleeding, thyroid problems and even cancer.
“Anytime you’re not able to access that early prenatal care, we do see complications with that,” she said. “And many of these things can absolutely be life-threatening for both the moms and the babies.”
Dr. Daisy Leon-Martinez, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist in San Francisco, said she now regularly cares for patients in her labor and delivery ward who have been transferred to her hospital because of newly developed pregnancy complications. These are often their first doctors’ visits since becoming pregnant. Many of those patients have told her that they did not want to seek prenatal care for fear of encountering immigration officials.
During regular visits, she added, she has advised people with pregnancy complications that they would be best served by a hospital stay — only to be told that her patients no longer feel safe going to the hospital.
The current enforcement environment is challenging immigrant advocates, who are continuing to encourage immigrants to seek appropriate medical care while acknowledging that doing so is increasingly risky.
Lupe Rodríguez, the executive director of the National Latina Institute for Reproductive Justice, said her organization is urging pregnant immigrants to seek the health care that they need, and to be proactive about making plans for themselves and their families in the event that they are detained.
“We can’t know for certain about any given [health care center] whether or not it’s going to be safe. One of the things that we’ve been seeing is leadership at some of these health centers — big hospitals and clinics — have said that they will provide the kind of protection that folks need, that they don’t want folks to be afraid of care,” Rodriguez said.
While those statements signal the intentions of a hospital’s leadership, Rodriguez said, “we still know that there are individuals within some of those care centers that are part of the reporting mechanism or are intimidating people.”

Jacqueline approached the last days of her pregnancy hopeful that the place she had chosen — a large university hospital that workers at her local clinic recommended — would be a safe place for her to give birth.
One night at the end of September, when labor pains grew too intense, she called for an ambulance and made it to the hospital. When she got there, she asked her providers if there were any ICE agents near the building. She had heard of a man at a local hospital being detained after having surgery. They told her there were none they were aware of.
She went on to deliver her baby under general anesthesia after a long, difficult labor. “I didn’t even hear him cry when they pulled him out,” she said. Her only relative left in the area was taking care of her daughter, so she recovered alone at the hospital for five days before heading home in an Uber that a social worker procured for her and her son.
“If my husband was here, he would have been there with me at the hospital,” Jacqueline said while recovering at home. “He would be here taking care of me, of us. I wouldn’t be worried about the things I still want to get for the baby.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-07-165242-1024x670.png,,,2025-10-07 16:59:12.742793

And when Roy began looking for an administrative assistant to hire for that business, she said, there was only one real choice: Diamantis’ daughter Anastasia.
Roy, who is the owner of a company called Construction Advocacy Professionals, was the second witness to testify in the ongoing criminal trial of Kosta Diamantis, a former state deputy budget director.
And just like the first witness in the case, she told jurors on Tuesday that she provided favors and money to Diamantis in order to secure his support in obtaining lucrative contracts on several school construction projects. 
[The Kosta Diamantis Timeline: What you need to know]
Federal prosecutors, who have charged Diamantis with 22 counts of bribery, extortion, conspiracy and lying to federal investigators, wasted no time in getting Roy to acknowledged that she hired Diamantis’ daughter — who had no experience in the industry — in order to keep him happy and to gain a leg up on bids for school construction projects.
Roy testified that she hired Diamantis’ daughter without interviewing any other candidate for the position and chose to pay her $45 per hour for a part-time role that later transitioned into a full time job.
With the jury watching on, Assistant U.S. Attorney David Novick asked why Roy would agree to do that.
“Mr. Diamantis was very powerful in the state,” Roy said. 
“I paid a higher rate because Mr. Diamantis told me to take care of his daughter,” Roy said, adding that Diamantis repeatedly mentioned the large amount of student loan debt his daughter owed.

Roy told the jurors that Diamantis’ daughter was not a particularly good employee and had no interest in furthering a career in the construction industry. But Roy kept her on the payroll, and awarded her bonuses, to keep Diamantis happy and to secure more contracts on school projects in Connecticut.
“I couldn’t get rid of her. She was Mr. Diamantis’ daughter. I would have been blackballed from every job,” Roy said. 
Roy also told the jury that she paid Diamantis directly on several occasions when he asked for money. Two of those payments were checks written out to Diamantis. But in another instance, Roy said she hand-delivered $1,000 in cash to Diamantis at a coffee shop in Hartford.
Roy said she wrapped the cash in a towel and said the experience made her “feel like drug dealer.”
As Roy testified, Diamantis sat at the defense table, taking notes and whispering with his attorney.
Roy’s testimony was meant to bolster the prosecution’s claims that Diamantis used his position as the director of the Connecticut Office of School Construction Grants and Review to extort contractors and profit from the local school projects he oversaw.
Diamantis’ defense attorney, Norm Pattis, attempted to raise doubts about those claims earlier on Tuesday when he cross examined John Duffy, another masonry contractor who served as the government’s lead witness. Duffy has already pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit extortion in connection with the case.
Pattis sharply questioned Duffy over the course of several hours and tried to make the case that it was Duffy who “shook down” Diamantis. 
Pattis questioned Duffy about how frequently he called Diamantis seeking his help on publicly funded construction projects. And he pointed out that at one point Diamantis suggested that Duffy should be paying him a retainer for the amount of assistance he was providing to Duffy.
That line of questioning was intended to make the jury doubt whether Diamantis extorted Duffy and his boss Sal Monarca, the owner of Acranom Masonry, as prosecutors alleged. 
Pattis directly asked Duffy whether he sought to take advantage of his relationship with Diamantis, who is his former brother-in law. And he asked what Duffy thought when Diamantis assumed control of Connecticut’s school construction program.  
“You thought it could be good to have an uncle in high places, correct?” Pattis asked, using the nickname Duffy used to describe Diamantis. 
“Yes,” Duffy grudgingly admitted. 
Diamantis’ daughter and his ex-wife, Duffy’s sister, were in the front row of the gallery as Duffy wrapped up his testimony on Tuesday.  
Pattis pointed at the pair at one point during cross examination and asked Duffy whether he ever “used” his niece in the past to try to curry favor with Diamantis by delivering wine to him during the holidays. 
Duffy said that it might be true. 
The majority of Pattis’ questions, however, were intended to show how Duffy repeatedly lied to federal investigators over the course of more than six interviews and to make the jurors question the reliability of Duffy’s testimony. 
Duffy admitted that he initially lied to the FBI before being confronted with evidence of the payments to Diamantis. But he told the jury that he had testified honestly in court.  
“I lied sometimes,” Duffy said. “Sometimes I’m afraid. Sometimes I’m trying to protect myself, and sometimes trying to protect other people. But I’m telling you the testimony I gave in this court is 100% the truth.”
“How is the jury to know when you are lying and you are telling the truth?” Pattis asked at another point.
Federal prosecutors tried to redeem Duffy after Pattis’ cross examination.
But they spent far more time reminding the jurors about the amount of text messages that were presented, which showed Diamantis directly asking for money from Duffy and Monarca.
Some of those communications included memorable details, like the code words that Duffy used to refer to the bribery payments to Diamantis. 
In one such text exchange from January 2020, Duffy told Diamantis that he could expect to receive a “birthday card.” 
Under questioning, Duffy admitted that “birthday card” was code for the payments to Diamantis, and he acknowledged that Diamantis’ birthday is actually in June, not January.
Later, prosecutors highlighted a similar text in which Duffy and Diamantis discussed how Monarca owed him 62.5 “pints.” 
“What are pints?” Novick asked Duffy. “Are we talking about Guinness?”
“No, not talking about Guinness,” replied Duffy, who grew up in Northern Ireland. “The 62.5 pints is talking about $62,500.” 
Duffy explained to the jurors that his use of the code words was an attempt to be “discreet” and conceal the bribery payments that were being negotiated. 
The jury was also shown a message in which Diamantis invited Duffy to attend a “fundraiser” to help pay for Diamantis’ daughter’s tuition at the private Renbrook School in West Hartford. 
“The school is not giving out scholarships. So we are trying to raise what we can up to $28,000,” Diamantis wrote in the message. 
Duffy said he never made a “donation” to that fundraiser, which was held at Cava, a restaurant in Southington that Diamantis frequented. 
But Duffy told Monarca in a separate message in 2020 that several key people from the Connecticut construction industry were expected to attend that event.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025_1007_SR_KostaTrialDay2_004-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-10-07 16:59:12.742793

(Henry Redman | Wisconsin Examiner)More than two years after $125 million was set aside in the 2023-25 state budget to fund the remediation of PFAS contamination across Wisconsin, legislators are again trying to pass two bills to get that money out the door. 
At a Senate public hearing Tuesday, the bills’ Republican authors said they’re “all ears” for reaching a compromise on the bill’s final language. However in the last legislative session, initial hopes that a deal could be reached went unfulfilled after Republicans, Democrats, business groups and environmental organizations dug into their positions and the bill was ultimately vetoed by Gov. Tony Evers.
As was the case in the last effort, the dispute is over who and how the state will hold entities responsible for PFAS contamination. 
PFAS are a class of man-made chemical compounds commonly known as “forever chemicals” because they don’t break down easily in the environment. The chemicals, which were used for decades in goods such as non-stick pans, fast food wrappers and firefighting foams, have been connected to causing cancer, thyroid diseases and developmental problems. Communities across Wisconsin have found PFAS contamination in their water supplies. 
Sen. Eric Wimberger (R-Oconto), one of the bills’ co-authors, said at the Tuesday hearing he’s trying to make sure people don’t have to choose between “their health and financial ruin” by testing for contamination and potentially being held responsible for paying for the clean up under the state’s spills law — which allows the Department of Natural Resources to force “responsible parties” to pay for the testing and remediation of chemical contamination. 
“We are transitioning from a medical and legal paradigm where a widely used substance was not considered hazardous, to a paradigm where it is considered hazardous, it’s imperative we don’t sweep up those who are not responsible and treat them as though they are,” he said. 
Wimberger and Rep. Jeff Mursau (R-Crivitz) have proposed Senate Bills 127 and 128, which establish the exemptions under which people won’t be held responsible for PFAS contamination on their property and create a number of grant programs to spend the $125 million. 
The challenge is that Republicans and industry have different definitions of who counts as responsible for contamination than Democrats and environmental groups. Constructing exemptions to the spills law that are too narrow could result in people being forced to pay for remediation they didn’t cause. But writing the exemptions too broadly could result in polluters passing the cost of remediation on to taxpayers. 
Across the state, municipal wastewater treatment utilities sell or give away the byproducts of their plants to use as fertilizer on farm fields. The DNR grants permits to allow the spreading of these byproducts, known as biosolids, which for years was seen as an environmentally responsible source of fertilizer because it was recycled. However biosolids from places with PFAS contamination in the water are contaminated, which can pollute the water near the field where they’re spread. 
Wimberger wants to make sure these farmers aren’t on the hook with the DNR to pay for contamination they didn’t know was happening and the DNR gave them a permit to create. 
But environmental advocates don’t want the exemptions to be so vague that they’re available to entities such as paper mills or chemical manufacturers. 
“We’re just asking you to understand that the way that you word an exemption is going to matter,” Christine Sieger, director of the DNR’s remediation and redevelopment bureau, said in her testimony. “I implement the spill law all day, every day, and I can tell you, people are crafty when it comes to getting out of liability. They will come up with all sorts of ways for how they can get themselves off the hook. And I just, I don’t want you to help them do that. Let’s make sure that they can take care of our people and clean up the mess that they’ve made.”
After the proposed PFAS bill was vetoed by Evers last session, Wimberger complained that opponents raised concerns about the exemptions being too broadly worded without naming specifics. On Tuesday, he said people objected with “platitudes” rather than specific language that could be corrected and that he hoped opponents could be more constructive this time around. 
Erik Kanter, director of government relations for Clean Wisconsin, said Tuesday the organization couldn’t support the proposal without amendments, proposing specific line-by-line changes for the bill authors to make. 
Kanter pointed to a line in SB 128 that states “a person that spreads biosolids or wastewater residuals contaminated by PFAS in compliance with any applicable license or permit” is exempt from being held responsible for PFAS contamination under the spills law. However, he said, that line is so vaguely worded that an industrial manufacturer could purchase and spread biosolids on its property as a way to gain an exemption from being held responsible for contamination it caused by creating PFAS as a byproduct of manufacturing. 
“The legislature created the PFAS trust fund 29 months ago,” Kanter said. “Marinette, Peshtigo, the Town of Campbell, the town of Stella and communities and individuals throughout the state have waited and waited and waited for state government to create the programs through which the PFAS trust fund can be allocated. They don’t deserve to wait another day. They don’t deserve a bill that doesn’t meet their needs or lets polluters off the hook and saddles taxpayers with the bill. We believe that compromise is possible and essential. We value the bill authors’ partnership to find compromise on this bill. Clean Wisconsin shares their goal in getting a bill to the governor’s desk for his signature this session, and we will continue working in good faith toward that end.”
Both Mursau and Wimberger expressed hope that they could write an amendment that would get enough support to be signed into law.
“It’s my intention to take the feedback here … and bring forward the amendment that can earn the support of the Legislature to be signed into law by the governor,” Mursau said. “I also want to take this opportunity to thank the groups and individuals who have come to us, not just with criticisms, but with constructive ideas. Those who are willing to engage in dialogue, not just opposition, have been instrumental in helping us shape the legislation that can actually pass and deliver results. In a divided government like ours, meaningful progress requires compromise. I’m grateful for those who recognize that and continue to work with us in good faith.”

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Brown University Health has merged its virtual outpatient adult mental health treatment programs offered by Newport and Rhode Island hospitals, the health system announced Tuesday.
The newly-combined programs — known as partial hospitalizations —  exceed the level of support received during a typical therapist or psychiatrist visit, but aren’t as intensive as an inpatient stay in a psychiatric facility. 
“By combining our programs, we’re able to offer patients more specialized options together with a broader range of therapies, without sacrificing the personal, team-based care they have come to count on,” Sarah Schmidhofer, MD, the director of the adult partial hospital programs at Brown University Health, said in a statement. “Having all these services under one roof makes it easier for patients to get the right help at the right time.”
The partial hospitalizations consist of individual and group therapy, medication planning, and care coordination after discharge, all delivered online within a day program that runs Monday through Friday. The idea is to allow patients to live their lives while still receiving the support they need.  
There are multiple treatment “tracks” available, including a general treatment track, a program tailored for young adults, and one heavily grounded in dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), a cognitive behavioral method used to treat people who have trouble regulating emotions. The new consolidation streamlines operations across both hospitals and allows patients more flexibility in treatment options.
There are also two specialty tracks, which focus on adults with trauma, and people with comorbid mental health diagnoses, respectively.  
“The best of both the Newport Hospital and Rhode Island Hospital programs were combined to create one merged, expanded program, featuring self referral,” Elena M. Falcone-Relvas, a Brown Health spokesperson, said via email Tuesday.
Hannah Herc, division director of the adult partial hospital program, in a statement that the merger “allows ease of access to care and the ability to more efficiently connect individuals with specialty care options to best suit their needs.”
The length of program participation depends on the track pursued. A patient on the trauma track, for example, might stay four to six weeks, while a young adult could stay two to three weeks. A daily schedule is also dependent on the program but might run from around 8 a.m. to 2 p.m.
The partial hospitalizations are available to patients living in Rhode Island and Massachusetts.

(Fran Baltzer for New Jersey Monitor)Lawyers for an indicted New Jersey congresswoman sent a letter to the judge overseeing her case on Monday objecting to federal officials comparing her to antifa in public statements.
The letter is the third time that lawyers for Rep. LaMonica McIver (D-10), who is accused of assaulting federal officers during a scuffle outside a migrant jail in Newark in May, have criticized government officials’ public statements about the congresswoman. McIver’s attorneys have said they threaten McIver’s right to a fair trial by an impartial jury.
“We bring these statements to the Court’s attention as fresh evidence of the need to restrain the government’s extrajudicial statements related to this case … as well as of the government’s unconstitutional selective enforcement and prosecution,” Monday’s letter from McIver attorney Paul Fishman reads.

Fishman’s letter refers to a Sept. 26 U.S. Department of Homeland Security press release headlined “DHS is Fighting Back Against Antifa Violence” that includes McIver in a list of “Antifa-aligned left-wing violent extremists” facing federal charges.
McIver was indicted over claims that she impeded Newark Mayor Ras Baraka’s May 9 arrest at Delaney Hall, the migrant jail in Newark. Federal prosecutors say McIver assaulted officers during the melee that erupted when agents moved to arrest Baraka (prosecutors dropped the single charge facing Baraka days after his arrest).
Other suspects included in the Sept. 26 press release include a 36-year-old who allegedly entered a Dallas migrant jail and claimed he had a bomb, someone accused of shooting at ICE officers at a facility in Texas and a Tennessee woman accused of attempting to run over a U.S. Customs and Border Patrol agent with her car.
In Monday’s letter, Fishman also referenced a social media post from the Department of Homeland Security on Sept. 26 that included McIver in a thread touting arrests of “dozens of Antifa-aligned left-wing violent extremists.”
The thread is still online, but the specific post citing McIver as an example for “assaulting a federal law enforcement officer” and accusing several members of Congress of “breaking into” Delaney Hall has been deleted.
In legal filings in McIver’s case from August and September, her legal team objected to separate posts from federal officials that they said prevented McIver from getting a fair trial. Some of those posts, including one that claimed she and her House colleagues “stormed the gate and broke into” Delaney Hall, have been deleted.
Videos released by court officials last week captured more than two hours of footage from May 9, including video showing McIver and two of her House colleagues, Reps. Rob Menendez and Bonnie Watson Coleman, walking onto the jail’s property and then being escorted inside the facility.
McIver has pleaded not guilty to the charges. She said she was at the jail on May 9 to conduct a legal but unannounced inspection of Delaney Hall, which had opened days earlier despite Newark city officials’ claim that it had not been properly inspected by the city. She says federal prosecutors are improperly targeting her because she’s a Democrat who has been critical of President Donald Trump’s immigration agenda.
A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security deferred to the Department of Justice, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

In the absence of federal action, states are increasingly striking out on their own to regulate artificial intelligence and other automated systems. (Photo by Leon Neal/Getty Images.)Although Gov. Ron DeSantis for months has hinted at legislation addressing the rapid growth of artificial intelligence, insurance lobbyists argued before a Florida House panel Tuesday that state law already regulates AI in the insurance sphere.
The four witnesses plus an AI subject-matter expert spoke to the Insurance and Banking Subcommittee during a panel discussion about AI use in the insurance industry. The meeting followed DeSantis’ months-long push to address the skyrocketing energy costs of artificial intelligence and the growing concern over AI taking human jobs.
The lobbyists insisted generative AI is helping to process claims and detect fraud, adding that AI, designed to help — not replace — the workforce, is just as subject to the Florida Insurance Code as humans are.
“Any decision made or any action taken by an insurance company, be it by a person, a human, an AI platform, all of that is governed by Florida law,” said Paul Martin, vice president for state affairs at the National Association of Mutual Insurance Companies. He added that the insurance company will always be at fault for errors committed by anyone — human or robot — on its behalf.
“The claims laws apply irrespective of the source of the wrong decision, the bad decision. If it’s an AI platform that makes a mistake, if it’s a human that makes a mistake, that same law applies,” he added.
DeSantis and AI
AI is one of the few policy areas in which DeSantis has appeared to break with President Donald Trump. The U.S. House of Representatives in May passed a major budget bill banning states from passing AI regulations for a decade, although the Senate promptly blocked it.
In one of his first social media posts critiquing AI, DeSantis questioned why Congress would want to “kneecap” states’ ability to control the technology.
“It basically means we’re going to be at the beck and call of Silicon Valley tech overlords,” he said during a subsequent press conference.
He’s since cast dark predictions that AI will eat into white-collar jobs while dismissing it as a “regurgitation of bullsh—.” More recently, he’s slammed the technology’s massive thirst for energy, arguing that taxpayers and utility ratepayers are footing the bill.
Despite these qualms, DeSantis vetoed a bill during the 2025 session that would have studied AI in the workforce, noting that the technology is spreading so quickly that the study would be obsolete as soon as completed.
Jarrett Catlin, of the pro-AI lobby TechNet, stressed that piecemeal regulation by the Office of Insurance Regulation would be better than sweeping statutory changes by the state government. He asked lawmakers to avoid passing AI packages using a one-size-fits-all-approach, and instead use targeted legislation when specific issues arise.
“Targeted is always better,” Catlin said. “It’s a challenge to figure out how to … fit those different rules and regulations across all these different industries.”
Colorado passed the nation’s first comprehensive AI regulation package in 2024, but a recent special session called to handle budget shortfalls became a “battleground” for the law, complete with shouting matches throughout the Capitol halls, the Clark Hill consultancy reported.
Tech lobbyists, opposing the law, helped craft new legislation delaying its enactment until June 2026.

(Photo by Preston Keres/ USDA/FPAC)Environmental groups are appealing a federal court’s decision to uphold a rule exempting livestock and poultry operations from reporting significant releases of air pollutants. 
The environmental groups allege the rule is unlawful and that exposure to ammonia and hydrogen sulfide from these operations is responsible for more deaths annually than exposure to air pollution from coal plants. 
The National Cattlemen’s Beef Association, which intervened in the case, celebrated the court ruling in its favor and said the rules were “onerous and unnecessary” by requiring producers to file “complex, overreaching reports.” 
In August, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia denied the environmental groups’ request for summary judgment and instead granted judgment on behalf of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Cattlemen.

EPCRA and CERCLA
Two laws are at play in the case. The Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act, or EPCRA, and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, or CERCLA, which require certain entities to notify EPA and local officials of a “potentially dangerous” release of a hazardous substance, according to EPA. 
EPA has attempted to change the rule, as it relates to animal waste at farms, in the past, according to the court’s filed memorandum of opinion. Then in 2018, Congress passed a law that exempted air emissions from animal waste on farms from CERCLA reporting requirements. 
In 2019, EPA filed a final rule to exempt animal waste emissions from EPCRA requirements in order to match the regulations to the recently changed CERCLA rules. 

Plaintiffs in the case
Environmental groups in the case include Rural Empowerment Association for Community Help, Animal  Legal  Defense  Fund, Center for Food Safety, Don’t Waste Arizona, Environmental Integrity Project, Food & Water Watch, Humane Society of the United States, Sierra Club, Sound Rivers, Waterkeeper Alliance and Center for Biological Diversity.

The environmental groups alleged EPA relied “unlawfully” on the congressional changes to CERCLA as justification for changing the rules in EPCRA that let “the industrial animal industry off the hook.” 
The opinion from U.S. District Court Judge Timothy Kelly said the EPA rule was “consistent with the best  reading” of EPRCA regulations and provides an explanation for exempting animal waste air emissions. 
Kelly wrote that to remain consistent with statutory text, EPA had “no leeway to consider the public’s right to access information” and “no discretion to consider environmental effects” when issuing the 2019 rule. 
Environmental groups say reporting requirements protect communities 
In a joint news release about the decision to appeal the federal court’s decision, the environmental groups said the pollution reporting requirements at hand “are designed to guarantee that communities and emergency responders have access to information necessary to protect themselves from harmful exposure to these extremely hazardous substances.” 
A recent peer-reviewed study from the University Michigan found that communities with the highest concentrations of animal feeding operations, like cattle feedlots, dairy farms and hog farms, have elevated levels of harmful fine particulate matter. 
According to the study, fine particulate matter was 28% higher in census tracts with high concentrations of cattle feeding operations and 11% higher in census tracts with hog farms. 
The environmental groups’ news release said the ammonia and hydrogen sulfide released by “factory farms” can cause health problems like respiratory diseases, eye and nasal irritation, nausea and death.
Kelly Hunter Foster, senior attorney at Waterkeeper Alliance, said people have a “right to know” when hazardous air pollution is released near their homes, schools or work. 
“EPA has a responsibility under EPCRA to ensure that information is disclosed to the public,” Hunter Foster said in the release. “Its mandate is to protect human health and the environment, not to create loopholes that allow polluters to hide the truth and put communities and ecosystems at risk.” 
In a news release about the court’s opinion, National Cattlemen’s Beef Association said EPCRA and CERCLA regulations were intended to address “massive, severe” environmental contaminants and chemical spills. Instead, the association said, the laws were “weaponized” by animal rights groups targeting “family farms and ranchers.” 
Kaitlynn Glover, the association’s executive director of natural resources, said the environmental laws should not “govern” cattle farmers. 
“This decision affirms that family cattle producers should not have to file reports for a natural, biological process under a law meant for significant chemical contaminants,” Glover said in the release. “NCBA stepped up to protect family farms and ranches through this litigation and we are pleased that the federal district court has brought clarity to this decades-long discussion.”
Tarah Heinzen, the legal director for the involved environmental group Food & Water Watch, said the Trump Administration’s “see no evil approach will not stand in court.” 
“Trump’s EPA is suppressing critical pollution data required to keep frontline communities safe and hold polluters accountable,” Heinzen said in the release. “Factory farms emit dangerous amounts of hazardous chemicals — willful ignorance of the data will not change the truth.” 
The appeal from environmental groups was filed Oct. 3.

It was initially preserved in 1976 as Congaree Swamp National Monument. It was redesignated as a national park in 2003. (Photo by Skylar Laird/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — Trails across South Carolina run by the National Parks Service are still open during the government shutdown, but events have been canceled, and indoor areas are shuttered for the time being.
The federal shutdown that began Oct. 1 put an estimated 750,000 employees nationwide on furlough and shuttered some government services as funding lapsed. That included the National Park Service, which has seven sites in the state, including the multi-state Overmountain Victory Trail.


As a general rule, grounds and trails remain open at National Parks Service locations in South Carolina, including the state’s only national park. But visitor’s centers, historic homes and other staff-operated buildings are closed, according to the agency.
Hikers can still walk Congaree National Park’s trails, including the elevated parts of the iconic 2.6-mile looping boardwalk, which leads guests to an overlook next to Weston Lake. The boardwalk’s lower parts remain closed for construction, according to the park’s website.
Some National Park Service staff continue to work without a paycheck, particularly security, fire and emergency response workers, according to the Department of the Interior’s contingency plan. The agency did not respond to a request for more information about staffing specifics in South Carolina.
Because of the reduction in staff, Friends of Congaree Swamp cautioned hikers to stay on the trails and remain vigilant to avoid needing search and rescue aid, which may be more limited during the shutdown. The nonprofit and other partner organizations that support National Park Service sites asked visitors to stay especially mindful not to make any messes on the sites, since staff won’t be around to clean them up.
Taking trash home instead of throwing it away in park trash cans will help keep the area clean amid reduced trash collection, according to Friends of Congaree Swamp.
Like the trails at Congaree National Park, some of the state’s national historic sites that are easy to access will remain open to the public. For instance, while the museums at Ninety Six National Historic Site and Cowpens National Battlefield are closed, visitors can still walk along the miles of hiking trails and read signs that tell the history of the areas.
SC’s 40,000 military members remain on duty without pay amid federal government shutdown

Boat tours are not running to Fort Sumter, according to Spiritline Cruises, which partners with the National Park Service to ferry visitors to and from the historic island. The tours, which cost $40 per adult, usually leave from Charleston’s Liberty Square six times a day and twice a day from Mount Pleasant’s Patriots Point, according to the company website. The grounds around the Fort Sumter and Fort Moultrie visitors’ centers, where tourists can take in views of the island fort and historic signs, remain open, according to Friends of Charleston National Parks.
Park-run events were canceled, though some may be rescheduled, according to the sites. But events run by other organizations that already have permission from the National Parks Service may continue.
For example, the annual Congaree SwampFest, which brings musicians and vendors to the national park, took place as planned over the weekend. But park rangers won’t be on hand to tell visitors folklore about South Carolina’s cryptids, such as the Lizardman, or the real animals that inspired the legends as part of the Mythical Creatures of Congaree event. The sold-out tour at the national park, scheduled for every Saturday in October, was put on pause.
It’s too soon to tell whether state parks might see a slight increase in visitors if the federal closures drag on, said Joy Raintree, director of state parks for the Department of Parks, Recreation and Tourism. Fall, with its cooler weather and autumnal foliage, is already a busy season for the state parks department, so the agency will be ready for any visitors who decide to stop by, she said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Congaree-straightened-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-07 16:59:12.742793

(Matthew Perschall for Louisiana Illuminator) A state judge has dismissed a lawsuit Black state lawmakers filed to force Attorney General Liz Murrill to resume defending the state’s congressional districts currently being challenged before the U.S. Supreme Court. 
The Louisiana Legislative Black Caucus filed a suit last month in 19th Judicial District Court to allege Murrill is not upholding her constitutional duty to defend laws the legislature passes. She is instead arguing against the constitutionality of the congressional district map lawmakers approved last year in order to advance Republican political interests, according to the filing. 
After previously defending the map, Murrill effectively switched sides and joined the white voters who challenged the map once their case was scheduled for new arguments before the U.S. Supreme Court. 
Murrill argued the Black Caucus lawsuit was inappropriate, and that the lawmakers had no standing to file it. 
Judge Eboni Rose-Johnson agreed and dismissed the suit. 
“This was the proper result,” Murrill said in a news release. “Our focus is on arguments in the United States Supreme Court and addressing the flaws in the court’s jurisprudence that deprives the Legislature of their constitutional duty over drawing maps.”
Black Caucus chairman Rep. Edmond Jordan, D-Baton Rouge, said he disagreed with the ruling and that the caucus is considering its next steps. 
“I think we clearly got a cause of action because while the Attorney General might have the discretion of whether she wants to get involved in a suit, once she gets involved, then she’s got to represent our interests,” Jordan said.
“That’s the biggest issue for us,” Jordan added. “So who represents the state of Louisiana? Who represents the people of Louisiana, if there’s a law that we pass that’s presumed constitutional, that she’s trying to say now is unconstitutional?” 
At issue is a congressional map the Legislature adopted last year that includes two majority Black districts, including a new one that stretches from Shreveport to Baton Rouge, slashing across the center of the state. The map is currently before the U.S. Supreme Court in the case Callais v. Louisiana, in which the white plaintiffs argue race determined the boundaries of the new 6th Congressional District.
The outcome could decide the future of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which prohibits election laws or procedures that purposefully discriminate on the basis of race, color or membership in a language minority group.

Film Lovers Invited to Celebrate Wilmington International Film Festival
WILMINGTON — October 7, 2025 — Delaware’s film fans, families, and arts supporters are invited to be part of history this weekend as the city hosts the first-ever Wilmington International Film Festival, running October 9–12. The four-day celebration will showcase more than 50 films from around the world, along with live music, food, and community events designed to make Wilmington a true destination for cinema and creativity.
Organized by Gordon DelGiorno of Film Brothers Productions, a longtime Delaware filmmaker and event producer, the festival aims to shine a spotlight on the First State’s emerging arts scene and growing film economy.

“This is more than a film festival,” DelGiorno said. “It’s a community celebration—an opportunity to show that Wilmington can be a true center for film, art, and storytelling.”

A Citywide Celebration of Film
The festival unfolds across four key venues—The Screening Room at 1313, Theatre N @ Nemours, The Delaware Contemporary, and Penn Cinema on the Riverfront. The Chancery Market serves as the festival’s social hub, offering food, drinks, live music, and networking for filmmakers and fans alike.
Opening Night on Thursday, Oct. 9, features Shelf Life, a Tribeca Film Festival winner, followed by a wine-and-cheese reception at The Screening Room.
The schedule features a diverse mix of international and U.S. films, with highlights including:


Friday, Oct. 10: End of the River (Bulgaria/Ukraine), a moving cross-border drama; Arrest the Midwife (U.S.) documentary with Q&A; The Spies Among Us (U.S.) Cold War doc; and the 17th Annual Festival of Shorts, hosted by DelGiorno.


Saturday, Oct. 11: Kids Shorts family matinee; How to Build a Library (Kenya) documentary on education; Becoming Vera (U.S.) drama of self-discovery; and the red-carpet Caribbean Film & Fashion Night, featuring Caribbean stars Spragga Benz and Oliver Samuels.


Sunday, Oct. 12: Phunny Business: A Black Comedy, a joyful documentary on Chicago’s first Black-owned comedy club, followed by the Awards Brunch at The Chancery Market.


Beyond the Screen
The Wilmington International Film Festival is designed to engage the whole community—with filmmaker meet-and-greets, live performances, artist talks, and international cuisine transforming downtown and the Riverfront into a celebration of culture.
DelGiorno said the event underscores the growing opportunity film brings to Delaware’s economy.

“Film is part of our future infrastructure,” he said. “It’s not just about art—it’s about jobs, small-business growth, and giving Delaware a global voice.”

Delaware’s new film incentive program, launched this year, is already attracting attention from independent producers, positioning the state to compete with regional neighbors for film and TV projects.
A Collaborative Effort
The festival is powered by a network of community and business partners, including the Caribbean American Chamber of Commerce of the Northeast, which sponsors the Caribbean Film & Fashion Night. Venues such as The Delaware Contemporary, Theatre N, and The Screening Room at 1313 are donating space, while The Chancery Market provides the event’s lively hub for food, networking, and conversation.
Together, they’re helping establish Wilmington as a creative crossroads for film lovers, families, and professionals from across the region.

Don Davis urges flood insurance fix amid government shutdown,Christine Zhu,,,,,https://ncnewsline.com/2025/10/07/us-rep-don-davis-urges-flood-insurance-fix-amid-government-shutdown/,North Carolina’s eastern residents rely on the National Flood Insurance Program during hurricane season.,"U.S. Rep. Don Davis addresses reporters at his Goldsboro office on Oct. 7, 2025. (Christine Zhu/NC Newsline)GOLDSBORO — Rep. Don Davis, a Democrat representing North Carolina’s first congressional district in the eastern part of the state, is asking national leaders to restore access to flood insurance despite the federal government shutdown.
Speaking to reporters at a press conference in his Goldsboro office on Tuesday, Davis said the National Flood Insurance Program is essential for the constituents in his coastal district. But the federal government shutdown, which began last Wednesday, keeps North Carolinians from buying or renewing policies.
The NFIP is the country’s largest residential flood-insurance program and provides more than $1.3 trillion in coverage to 4.7 million policyholders nationwide, according to Davis’ office. His staff estimates there are 11,614 NFIP policies in place in North Carolina’s first congressional district, with about $3.22 billion in insured value.
“Many of the communities across eastern North Carolina are rural and lower income, relying even more so on the National Flood Insurance Program,” Davis said.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency’s authority to renew NFIP policies expired at midnight on Sept. 30 due to the government shutdown, Davis said. Although existing policies remain active, FEMA cannot issue new or renewal flood-insurance policies until the shutdown ends.
It’s an issue of concern for residents as hurricane season continues. Gov. Josh Stein declared a state of emergency on Sept. 27 for what became Hurricane Imelda, lifting it on Monday. A handful of houses in the Outer Banks collapsed from the storm.
“Flooding is the most common and costly natural disaster in the United States, and eastern North Carolina has experienced numerous devastating events — from hurricanes to recurring inland storms,” Davis wrote in a Tuesday letter to U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson and Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries.
Tuesday marks almost a week of the shutdown, leading to delays in services and pay for constituents and workers, and spawning partisan attacks over the shutdown’s cause and its consequences.
Davis represents North Carolina’s most competitive seat in the U.S. House. National and state Republicans have issued numerous ads and statements targeting him ahead of the midterm elections in 2026.
The congressman dodged a question from NC Newsline on how long he would continue to vote with his party on shutdown negotiations. He said his priority lies with the families of his district.
“We’ll let politics unfold how they unfold,” Davis said. “My focus is on helping the families of eastern North Carolina, helping them to navigate the shutdown, ideally helping to bring us out of the shutdown.”
On social media, the North Carolina GOP accused Davis of “choosing to side with far-left Washington liberals over his own constituents.”
North Carolina GOP communications director Matt Mercer told NC Newsline that Davis “voted in lockstep” with Democrats in Washington.
“The Davis Democrat Shutdown is jeopardizing paychecks to servicemembers and federal law enforcement while starving programs to help low-income families put food on the table,” Mercer wrote in an email.
There’s a substantial military population in North Carolina, particularly in Davis’ district. Seymour Johnson Air Force Base is located in Goldsboro, and Elizabeth City has a Coast Guard Base. Active-duty personnel must carry out their assignments without pay until the shutdown ends, putting economic pressure on those communities.
An Air Force veteran, Davis is one of four members of the state’s congressional delegation who is requesting his pay be withheld for the duration of the shutdown.
“As a member of Congress, I felt compelled to make sure I’m not receiving pay,” he said. “That’s the minimum that I believe that we should do, lead with compassion, and fight passionately here.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_4157-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-07 15:56:48.180866

The effort, stemming from an executive order from President Donald Trump, has already resulted in the removal of signs about the horrors of slavery, massacres of Indigenous peoples, and the threat of climate change, even on lands directly in harm’s way.

	Consider Acadia National Park in Maine. More intense storms and rising seas are accelerating erosion and killing native plants along its iconic coastline. Warmer temperatures are assisting the spread of an invasive insect that totally wiped out the park’s red pines. And yet last month, park employees removed multiple signs explaining how climate change was contributing to these changes.
“Getting access to that information when you’re right there is a way to see with your own eyes what is going on,” said Chellie Pingree, a Democratic representative from Maine. The removed signs didn’t just educate visitors about environmental problems — they also outlined steps visitors could take to reduce their carbon emissions, such as taking a shuttle bus instead of a personal vehicle to visit popular park sites.
Trump’s executive order in March directed the Interior Department to remove descriptions that “inappropriately disparage Americans past or living” and focus instead on “the greatness of the achievements and progress of the American people.” The directive also demanded an emphasis on “the beauty, abundance, and grandeur of the American landscape.” Even items at national park gift shops were subject to review.

This isn’t the first obstacle the Park Service has endured under Trump’s second term. Due to federal cuts, the National Park Service has lost a quarter of its permanent staff, many of whom worked to preserve species and natural features in the parks over the long term. Employees at Acadia are stretched very thin, with more than 60 vacant year-round staff positions, according to Todd Martin, senior program manager for the Northeast for the National Parks Conservation Association. The administration has also proposed cutting the Park Service’s budget for 2026 by $1.2 billion.
Gutting those resources, particularly at a time when climate change is altering national parks, means that the very beauty Trump wants to highlight is at risk of disappearing.
National parks have warmed at double the rate of the rest of the country, according to research from Patrick Gonzalez, formerly the principal climate change scientist at the National Park Service. “More severe heating occurs in national parks because extensive areas of the national park system are located in extreme environments — in the Arctic, at high elevations, and in the arid Southwest,” he said.
Some of the parks’ namesake features could be lost: the glaciers of Montana’s Glacier National Park could vanish within decades, the Joshua trees could eventually disappear at California’s Joshua Tree National Park, and more severe wildfires have already taken out a fifth of California’s famous sequoias. Warming temperatures could hurt Yellowstone National Park’s bison population, and sea level rise is reducing habitat for the Florida panther in the Everglades.
“We as a country worry about losing these spectacular resources, and people want to know what the Park Service is doing to keep them alive and to make sure they survive past this generation,” said Kristen Brengel, senior vice president of government affairs at the National Parks Conservation Association. “Hiding this information from the public is just not what the Park Service is about.”
Some signs explaining environmental threats came out of the Park Service’s climate change response strategy created under President Barack Obama in 2010, which placed a focus on communicating the risks of global warming — and what could be done about it — to the public. The interpretive signs were carefully vetted by scientists and other experts to ensure they were accurate before they went up, according to Gonzalez.
It’s unclear how many of these signs will be removed as a result of Trump’s executive order, but many have been brought to the administration’s attention. Park officials at Great Smoky Mountains National Park, on the border of Tennessee and North Carolina, flagged a plaque explaining how fossil fuels cause air pollution that harms plants and animals. At Everglades National Park, an employee noted that signs about farming and urban development damaging the land “could be conceived as being disparaging to the development of industrial America.” Meanwhile, at Cape Hatteras National Seashore on North Carolina’s Outer Banks, an employee wondered if a sign about sea level rise threatening the Ocracoke ponies’ habitat “reduces the focus on grandeur, beauty, and abundance.”
Other environmental information has already disappeared from park signs. In July, Muir Woods National Monument in Northern California removed its “history under construction” exhibit that had added historical and cultural context to its existing signage. The new information had included explanations of how the Coast Miwok and Southern Pomo peoples maintained the land for centuries through cultural burns, as well as informing visitors that the conservationist Gifford Pinchot, who worked to preserve Muir Woods, also promoted eugenics.

Park Service staff have told Brengel that being asked to report and censor their own signs has been a morale killer. “They’re devastated,” she said. She’s heard that some parks have been told not to remove any more signs because of “bad publicity,” but also that many parks west of the Mississippi have been told to keep flagging signs to comply with the directive.
“This is not over,” Brengel said. “They’re planning to censor more parks. It’s just a matter of time at this point.”
None of the national parks Grist contacted commented on the environment-related signs that were removed or flagged for review, deferring to the Department of Interior or the National Park Service. (National parks employees have been told not to talk to journalists, sources told Grist.)
“Thanks to President Donald Trump, Interior is ensuring that the American people are no longer being fed the lies of the delusional Green New Scam,” said Aubrie Spady, the Interior’s deputy press secretary, in a statement. “The content was taken down because this administration believes in only administering facts based on real science to the American public, not brainless fear-mongering rhetoric used to steal taxpayer dollars.”
Elizabeth Peace, a spokesperson for the National Park Service, put it a more neutral way: “The president has directed federal agencies to review interpretive materials to ensure accuracy, honesty, and alignment with shared national values.”
The sign removals are part of a larger pattern to hide information about climate change from public view. In his second term, Trump has launched an assault on climate science, deleting landmark climate reports, slashing funding for climate research, and ending a program that tracked the country’s greenhouse gas emissions. Language about the changing climate has vanished from federal websites, including entire pages about it on the Park Service website.
In response, scientists, academics, and other volunteers have worked to save the data that’s being lost and try to make it available for the public to find again.
The erasure of “negative” stories at national parks has spurred another such initiative, called “Save Our Signs.” The goal is to crowdsource photos of signs from National Park Service sites all around the country to create a publicly accessible collection. So far, Save Our Signs has received more than 10,000 photos from hundreds of sites, said Jenny McBurney, a government publications librarian who helped start the project.
Politicians are also pushing back. Last month, Pingree and dozens of representatives signed a letter to National Park Service director Jessica Bowron condemning the removal of historical signs and asking for detailed information on all the signs that had been flagged for violations, altered, or removed.
McBurney said that the Save Our Signs project is still accepting photos, even though it’s already seen an outpouring of support. “You can just tell that people really care about our parks, and they want to make sure that this important information is preserved.”

(Niki Kelly/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Indiana Supreme Court Chief Justice Loretta Rush addressed a bevy of court-related issues when meeting with reporters Tuesday — including technology and safety.
The Indiana Supreme Court received 704 cases in fiscal year 2025 and disposed of 692 of them. Of the opinions issued by the high court, 77% were unanimous. In a recent addition to their workload, the court has handled three capital cases in the last calendar year.
Rush noted that a tight state budget meant she didn’t receive matching dollars she had hoped to use to shore up courtroom security around the state.
“Court security and threats to the judiciary in my time as a judge are at all-time high,” she said. “And I have judges that hear cases and sentence people with no security in the courtroom. It’s just dangerous.”
“Temperatures are up,” she acknowledged.

Read the Indiana Supreme Court’s annual report here.

Such concerns aren’t unique to Indiana. Police are investigating a Saturday fire that burned down the home of a South Carolina circuit court judge, who had reportedly received death threats for weeks related to her work.
But Rush was pleased the General Assembly did provide $6 million over the next two years for a single integrated system to collect and report accurate statewide jail population data — INjail. So far, six counties are on the system but 27 others have expressed interest or signed up to implement it.
It is up to individual county sheriffs to participate.
“It’s going to be a slow roll,” Rush said — depending on funding available to add counties.
There are currently 20 different jail management software systems throughout Indiana and the new system will make it easier to track offenders, cases and real-time jail data.
Overall, Rush said she is glad to see Indiana’s courts issue full written opinions and stay nonpartisan.
“In some ways, it’s just nice that I think our Indiana courts are boring,” She said. “I’ll stay boring and hard-working. I think that works.”
Rush acknowledged a recent uptick in criticism of the judiciary, and encouraged people to make sure they have complete information before condemning decisions. She said cases are sometimes charged a certain way for a reason or there are other situational variables not included in the state’s filing system.
Rush noted reporters used to cover sentencing hearings and provide some of that context.
“I think public debate on the judiciary is fine … I just wish it was always correct,” she said.

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)President Donald Trump has nominated the head of South Dakota’s Division of Criminal Investigation to lead the U.S. Marshals Service in the state.
Dan Satterlee was recommended for the job by his boss, South Dakota Attorney General Marty Jackley, according to a Tuesday news release from Jackley’s office. Satterlee’s nomination had the support of all three members of the state’s congressional delegation, the release says.

Satterlee currently oversees the DCI, the state’s investigative policing agency. Its agents assist local law enforcement, particularly in smaller cities and counties that have major crimes like homicides. The DCI also oversees law enforcement training in South Dakota, and is headquartered in the same building as the training facility, the George S. Mickelson Criminal Investigation Center.
Jackley installed Satterlee, a 30-year veteran of the agency, as its leader in 2023. 
Satterlee’s nomination as U.S. marshal has been referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee for consideration. If approved there, the nomination would go to the full Senate.
U.S. marshals are responsible for the oversight and movement of federal prisoners in South Dakota, as well as for security on federal properties.
The last confirmed U.S. marshal for the state was Dan Mosteller. The position has been listed as “vacant” since January 2024, according to archived web data.
Another law enforcement nomination for South Dakota is pending in the U.S. Senate. Ron Parsons’ nomination as U.S. attorney — the top federal prosecutor in the state — was among a batch of nominees that advanced on a procedural vote Monday and is expected to receive a final confirmation vote soon. Parsons would succeed Alison Ramsdell, who was appointed during the Biden administration.

A dozen miles off Point Barrow, Alaska’s northernmost tip, the sea is still frozen except where inky tendrils of open water spiderweb across the pack ice. On the surface, the scene feels hushed by the cold. But if you were to dip a hydrophone beneath the ice — like biologist Kate Stafford did this past spring — you might be surprised by what you hear.

Underwater, a carnival of sound is unfolding, with bowhead whales the featured act. Somewhere, a mother calls to her newborn calf, guiding her young along a route she’s navigated dozens of times before. Several males compete for the season’s final serenade, singing, as bowheads do, with two voices at once. There’s a growl, a “gunshot,” a burp, a series of upsweeps and downsweeps — the phonemics of a language only these whales can understand.
Scientists like Stafford, a professor at Oregon State University, are eavesdropping on the action. With a toolkit of recording techniques, they’re tracking a dramatic story of change.
The underwater acoustic landscape defines the life of Balaena mysticetus, the bowhead whale. Imagine swimming in frigid, pitch-black waters beneath the ice of a frozen sea, using echolocation as your guide. Alaska’s bowheads migrate in the near-complete darkness of late winter and spring, traveling from their winter range in the Bering Sea to spend summer in the eastern Beaufort Sea, more than 1,500 miles away. To avoid becoming trapped in the ice, they negotiate this complex environment through sound, honing skills developed over more than 10,000 years in the Arctic.
For bowheads — Aġviq in Iñupiaq — sound is essential, not only for navigating but for finding food, connecting with mates, and even breathing. To surface, the whales must detect patches of open water or areas of thin ice, which they can break through — at thicknesses up to two feet — using their powerful heads. They listen for predators and home in on prey while mapping the subtle contours of the seafloor. Given bowheads’ reliance on sound, it’s no coincidence that these long-enduring, soniferous animals also sing some of the most complex and innovative songs on the planet.
Now, however, they face a new threat: Arctic waters are getting noisier, and fast.










For bowheads, sound is essential, not only for navigating but for finding food, connecting with mates, and even breathing.


BOWHEADS ARE THE only whales that live year-round in the Arctic. The ones that inhabit the waters around Alaska and northwestern Canada were spared from the slaughter of industrial whaling until the mid-19th century, several hundred years later than in other parts of their range. They now comprise the only stable — and perhaps growing— bowhead population, currently estimated at 12,000 to 14,000 individuals, and they remain an important subsistence resource for Alaska Native communities.
A bowhead can live to be well over 100 and, according to some estimates, as much as 200 years old. The species’ impressive lifespan has long been acknowledged among Indigenous residents and more recently confirmed by dating bone and ivory fragments from hunter-harvested whales and performing chemical analyses of whale eye lenses and reproductive organs. In theory, a bowhead living today could have witnessed the earliest commercial whaling ships sail into Alaska’s waters, lived through the latter part of the Industrial Revolution and heard the first oil drill boring into the Beaufort Sea.
Only later did biologists begin to listen in on their lives. Sonobuoys deployed from an aircraft in the late 1970s offered the first formal documentation of bowhead calls and songs. The resulting scientific report, published in the Journal of the Acoustical Society of America in 1982, marked just the latest technological advance in a longstanding field of study. In 1979, Christopher Clark, who conducted some of the earliest acoustic surveys in Arctic Alaska, noted that his Iñupiat colleague Benny Nageaq knew all the species at Point Barrow by voice. “(Nageaq) patiently explained how his ancestors had listened, too, not with a hydrophone, but with an oar paddle placed into the water with the butt of its handle against the jawbone.”
Even today, Arctic underwater soundscapes are, at a baseline, quieter than their temperate or tropical equivalents, not only because there are fewer sources of anthropogenic noise, but because ice acts as a powerful dampening force. It scatters sound waves that hit its underside, modulating the intensity and distance they can travel. Ice also limits vessel traffic, but as it recedes earlier and faster each season, open water routes are becoming more accessible.
Median noise levels will nearly quadruple across the pan-Arctic by 2030, relative to levels measured in 2019, according to a report produced by the Protection of the Arctic Marine Environment and the Arctic Council earlier this year. Because sound is not uniformly distributed, the rate and scale of the changes vary. In places with low ambient noise, small increases in vessel traffic can have a disproportionate effect. In the Chukchi Sea, for example, where Alaska’s bowheads spend part of their year, natural sounds like whales, walruses and wind currently have a greater impact on the soundscape than ship-driven noise. By 2030, however, that dynamic is expected to flip, with ship noise taking the largest share of the bandwidth.
Because bowheads’ home waters in Alaska and Canada are inaccessible much of the year, biologists’ ability to study these environments has also historically been limited. However, over the past four decades, improvements in acoustic technology and oceanographic monitoring, combined with a growing number of recording stations, have helped highlight the importance of sound in the underwater lives of Arctic animals.
Today, passive acoustic monitors help biologists estimate population sizes, track movements and identify feeding hotspots for bowhead whales and other marine mammals. These hardy devices return data in the form of spectrograms, colorful frequency charts showing patterns of scattered dots and vertical spikes. By reading what amounts to a series of Morse code patterns emerging from the seafloor, biologists can infer which species are in the area and what they might be doing.
Listening underwater also helps identify the potential impacts of noise pollution. A series of studies dating back to the 1980s augmented traditional ecological knowledge about bowheads’ sensitivity to vessel noise; it’s now well established that they will alter their course to avoid ships, or even aircraft. Airguns and other oil and gas activity can also affect whale dive cycles and vocalizations. During seismic surveys in the Beaufort Sea in 2007-2010, for example, Susanna Blackwell and her colleagues found that bowheads increased their calling rates in response to low decibel sounds, but at high noise levels they stopped communicating altogether. Marine mammals aren’t alone in feeling the effects of noise; many fishes and zooplankton are also sensitive to sound and, at acute decibel levels, can be injured or killed.
Even if decibel levels remain below directly harmful thresholds, increasing ambient noise can affect animals’ ability to communicate. Bowheads’ vocalizations, and their ability to perceive sound, may be drowned out by a phenomenon known as “acoustic masking” — the undersea equivalent of trying to hold a conversation in a windstorm. This sort of background interference with bowheads’ daily activities ranks among Stafford’s greatest concerns.

AS THE ARTIC HEATS UP, so too do sources of industrial noise pollution. Offshore oil and gas production has been underway in Arctic Alaska since the 1970s. However, the stakes of such development have recently risen with the implementation of several presidential executive orders. President Donald Trump’s January 2025 order “Unleashing Alaska’s Extraordinary Resource Potential” promised to unlock “this bounty of natural wealth.” What the fine print of this sweeping order doesn’t reveal is the potential collateral damage from increased offshore development, including its impact on some of the Arctic’s quietest soundscapes.
Warmer oceans have also spurred commercially valuable fish such as cod and pollock to move north, attracting new fishing fleets to the northern Bering and Chukchi seas. Another executive order calls for the rollback of fishing regulations and catch limits in U.S. waters. Meanwhile, political jockeying for potentially valuable shipping routes and greater militarization of this region will presumably draw even more traffic.
Anthropogenic sources of noise aren’t the only climate-related changes to bowhead soundscapes. As sea ice disappears, the ocean has greater fetch, allowing the buildup of waves. The same storms that hit land also make a ruckus underwater. Breaking surf, crashing ice floes and wind gusting across the water’s surface mean more ambient noise across all frequencies for bowheads to contend with. As Stafford explained, “Imagine a radio station that can’t be tuned in properly; you can hear that there’s music playing, but the static makes it hard to tell what is being played.”

Longer periods of open water in the Arctic also mean that new neighbors are moving in. Alongside the region’s usual underwater chorus — trilling bearded seals, knocking walruses, grunting Arctic cod and crunching krill — unfamiliar voices have begun to emerge. Over the past several years, acoustic monitoring has revealed the growing presence of orcas and humpback whales in the Pacific Arctic during summer and fall. In a study published in Polar Biology earlier this year, researchers from the University of Washington and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) determined that orcas are not only becoming more common in the region, they’re arriving more than a month earlier each year as the sea ice decreases.
For bowheads, these novel clicks and whistles signal trouble. A pair of studies published in Polar Biology in 2020 and 2022 documented 25 bowhead whales that were presumably killed by orcas during 2009-2019, with a notable spike in the western Beaufort Sea in 2019. This corroborated the evidence of subsistence hunters, who had harvested whales with scars indicative of orca attacks. In the presence of orcas, bowheads, especially mothers traveling with calves, may silence their calls to avoid predation.
Humpback whales are not a direct threat to bowheads, but their vocalizations overlap with bowhead frequencies, meaning there could be competition between the species for acoustic “space” and perhaps other resources. According to Stafford, who has been studying whales in the Arctic for two decades, bowheads are increasingly likely to feel the crunch as humpbacks move north. Her first sighting of a humpback in the Beaufort Sea was in 2021; she’s since dubbed the summer of 2024 a “humpbackpalooza,” with large numbers of humpback whales sighted in an area also heavily frequented by migrating bowheads.
The changes are happening faster than scientists can track them. Both sea ice melt and Arctic shipping have already exceeded most model predictions; the Arctic Council’s 2025 report, for instance, notes that its own previous projections for 2030 noise levels may have underestimated vessel traffic by as much as 40%. These models also assumed a pre-Trump regulatory framework and anticipated oil and natural gas leases. In other words, they didn’t factor in an aggressive push for offshore drilling and fishing or the potential reversal of major U.S. environmental regulations. Given the increase in commercial activity that the current administration is pursuing, acoustic impacts on bowheads and other species may be much more severe than the hypothetical accelerated scenarios.
At the same time, basic research on Arctic soundscapes is threatened. Many of the programs critical for deploying and maintaining acoustic monitors, including those overseen by NOAA, are at immediate risk of defunding. Decades of monitoring could screech to a halt, leaving some of the most urgent questions unanswered.
Even as funding from U.S. sources dries up, the Arctic Council, the Protection of the Arctic Marine Environment and other international working groups have emphasized the urgent need to develop real-time mitigation strategies in the region. Vessel speed limits, rerouting of ships and the establishment of “sound reserves” are among some of the measures proposed. Stafford also cites the need for better acoustic mapping in order to identify highly sensitive areas. Above all, increased collaboration between stakeholders — scientists, industry leaders, local communities and Indigenous-led groups such as the Alaska Eskimo Whaling Commission — will be essential to protect these rapidly changing acoustic habitats.











Median noise levels will nearly quadruple across the pan-Arctic by 2030, relative to levels measured in 2019.



IN SEPTEMBER, bowheads return to the waters around Point Barrow. This time, they aren’t dodging ice but gulping enormous mouthfuls of zooplankton, which are so dense they can be seen on satellite images as a brownish-pink smear across the water. Here, at the margin of the Chukchi and western Beaufort seas, a unique combination of bathymetry and winds coalesce each autumn to create what is known as a “krill trap.” For bowheads, this translates into a feast of whale-sized proportions.
Since its initial discovery via aerial surveys, biologists have been listening in on this fall feeding frenzy. Hannah Sawyer, a recent graduate student in Stafford’s lab, determined that when the krill trap is “on,” bowhead call rates increase in frequency by as much as 20 times; the whales also make more complex vocalizations that could signal cooperative feeding. No one knows exactly how bowheads detect this ephemeral food source, but sound likely plays a role. The krill trap is so critical for their late-season fattening that they will tolerate higher decibel levels from vessels and other sources just to keep feeding.
The question is how much noise is too much, and whether we humans can quiet our own activities enough to allow bowheads the acoustic space they need. For the bowheads, as for all of us, the ending is yet unsung.

Trump has lost the state three times, so Trump’s bombastic and divisive politics won’t win statewide elections, said former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty during a panel at a business summit hosted by the Minnesota Star Tribune.
The goal for Republicans, Pawlenty said, is to find a candidate who can satisfy the right-wing base while appealing to Independents and moderate Democrats. 
“That’s a tightrope walk … but that’s not something that’s easy to do in today’s Republican Party,” Pawlenty said.
The former two-term GOP governor said he had considered running for Sen. Tina Smith’s seat once she retires, but he would never get endorsed or win a primary today. Pawlenty represents the old suburban, pro-business Republican Party. He once called Trump “unsound, uninformed” and “unhinged,” which made his electoral prospects in the GOP largely untenable, absent the kind of groveling to Trump that Pawlenty isn’t likely to pursue. In 2018, when Pawlenty tried to come back, he lost the GOP primary for governor to Jeff Johnson.
Right-wing activists, who have endorsed far-right candidates like avowed antisemite Royce White for U.S. Senate, have emerged as a powerful force in today’s Minnesota Republican Party.
Minnesota Republican Sens. Julia Coleman and Zach Duckworth, who were also on the panel, agreed that candidates matter. Coleman and Duckworth both outperformed Trump in their districts in 2022.
“We’re not trying to be Donald Trump,” said Coleman, who has matched her image as a working mom to pro-family policies like a paid leave plan comporting with Republican economic philosophy.
Duckworth spent time on his local school board. Education is not usually friendly Republican terrain, but it could be a good issue next year with parents frustrated at Minnesota’s academic standing.
All GOP panelists agreed Republicans have a good shot to get a few wins in next year’s midterm elections. Fraud in state government has been all over the headlines; the majority of students aren’t meeting grade-level expectations; and Gov. Tim Walz’s bid for an unprecedented consecutive third, four-year term will all create a solid opportunity for Republicans to outperform expectations.
“(Walz’s) numbers are softer than they used to be, which sort of creates a window or a band of opportunity for Republicans if they nominate at least a serviceable candidate,” Pawlenty said.
But that is a big “if.” 
Mike Lindell, the right-wing influencer and pillow salesman is mulling a run for governor. If he wins the Republican endorsement, all of his baggage, including his years spent spreading disinformation about the 2020 election, will be fodder for the Democrats’ well-funded campaign.
Other major Republican candidates are 2022 GOP nominee Scott Jensen, a physician who served a term in the state Senate; Kendall Qualls, a failed candidate for Congress and governor, an Army veteran and former health care executive; and Rep. Kristin Robbins of the west metro.
It’s also not enough to criticize the state of the state, Pawlenty said. To be successful Republicans need to paint a positive vision for Minnesota’s future.
“You can’t just say, ‘They suck,’” Pawlenty said. “We have to say, ‘Here’s what we’ll do better.’”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_3664-1024x784.jpg,,,2025-10-07 15:56:48.180866

Hotter temperatures result in more workplace injuries, according to a new study. (Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)With hotter temperatures come more heat-related workplace injuries — about 28,000 injuries each year, according to a new study published Monday in the journal Environmental Health.
Scientists have long warned of climate change-driven extreme heat and its dangers to health. Studies have shown extreme heat can cause fatigue, poorer coordination and reduced attention. Put together, these physical and cognitive effects increase the likelihood of workplace injuries, wrote the researchers from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and George Washington University’s Milken Institute School of Public Health.
The researchers analyzed roughly 845,000 injuries documented by the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration across 48 states in 2023. They compared the likelihood of workplace injuries under different temperature ranges, looked at both indoor and outdoor industries and factored in state policies around workplaces and heat.
The researchers saw an upward trend in injury risks starting at about 85°F and steeper climbs when temperatures reached higher than 90°F — with greater risks in states without workplace heat rules.
At heat indexes of 110°F or higher, for example, the risk of injury increased 22% in states without occupational heat rules. But the risk increased by only 9% in five states that had workplace heat rules in 2023 (California, Colorado, Minnesota, Oregon and Washington).
To account for regional differences in climate, the researchers also compared four Western states with occupational heat rules (California, Colorado, Oregon and Washington) with seven Western states that don’t have them (Arizona, Idaho, Montana, New Mexico, Nevada, Utah and Wyoming) and found similar disparities.
New report ranks states on climate-related health risks, clean energy policies

In August of last year, under the Biden administration, OSHA proposed a new heat-related workplace standard. The rule would require employers to monitor heat hazards in indoor and outdoor workplaces and create clearer requirements for employers to protect their employees.
The agency held a hearing this summer and extended a comment period through the end of October for those who participated in the hearing.
The researchers found a high injury risk in both outdoor industries, such as waste management, agriculture and construction, and in indoor workplaces such as manufacturing and warehousing.
“The problem is only going to get worse with climate change,” Dr. Barrak Alahmad, senior scientist at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, told Stateline in a statement. “You can decide to ignore it and continue business as usual, but that will not only affect injured workers, it will also hit productivity and the bottom lines of employers.”

(Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)Justices of the U.S. Supreme Court appeared skeptical of a Colorado law banning conversion therapy for minors, which a counselor in the state says violates her First Amendment right to free speech.
The court heard oral arguments in the case Tuesday. Conversion therapy is the practice of trying to change a person’s sexual orientation, such as to eliminate same-sex attraction, or gender identity. Conservative religious law firm Alliance Defending Freedom represents the plaintiff, Kaley Chiles, a Colorado Springs counselor who argues the Colorado law violates her right to free speech by prohibiting certain conversations related to gender and sexuality.  
The Supreme Court has a 6-3 conservative majority. Most of the justices in their questions appeared to doubt that Colorado’s law satisfies the free speech provision of the First Amendment, noting that a counselor who would affirm a minor’s sexuality or gender identity would not be subject to the same restrictions as a counselor looking to change them.

Jim Campbell, chief legal counsel for Alliance Defending Freedom, said the talk therapy Chiles wants to offer is not considered conduct subject to regulation by the state because speech is the only aspect of the treatment. The state discriminates against Chiles based on her viewpoint because it would not prohibit a counselor from affirming a minor’s sexual orientation or gender identity, but it prohibits efforts to change them, Campbell said. 
“Aside from this law and recent ones like it, Colorado hasn’t identified any similar viewpoint-based bans on counseling,” Campbell said to the court. “These laws are historic outliers.” 
The court has deemed viewpoint discrimination a violation of free speech rights. 
Chiles’ petition to the Supreme Court says she is a practicing Christian who “believes that people flourish when they live consistently with God’s design, including their biological sex.” It says she views her career “as an outgrowth of her faith” and that many clients come to her because of her Christianity.
Chiles’ legal team frequently cited a 2018 case, National Institute of Family and Life Advocates v. Becerra, known as NIFLA, in which the court found that governments cannot require crisis pregnancy centers to post information about access to abortions under the First Amendment’s free speech clause. The case is the key precedent the team relies on, citing it about 30 times in its main Supreme Court filing. Alliance Defending Freedom represented the plaintiff in that case, too. 
“In this case, Colorado is violating the promise that this court laid out in NIFLA, which is that states should not manipulate private conversations between licensed professionals and clients,” Campbell said. 










A health care provider cannot be free to violate the standard of care just because they are using words, and a state cannot be required to let its vulnerable young people waste their time and money on an ineffective, harmful treatment just because that treatment is delivered through words.


– Colorado Solicitor General Shannon Stevenson


About 25 states have laws in place that ban or restrict the practice of conversion therapy, and a ruling in favor of Chiles could upend enforcement of those laws. 
Hashim Mooppan, an attorney with the U.S. Department of Justice, which requested to participate in the case, also spoke in support of the plaintiff’s arguments before the Supreme Court. He reiterated the argument that the talk therapy Chiles wants to engage in is strictly speech protected by the First Amendment and not conduct subject to regulation. 
Denounced by medical organizations
The 2019 Colorado law in question prohibits licensed psychiatrists and mental health care providers from “engaging in conversion therapy” with patients under 18 years old. Providers who conduct conversion therapy are subject to disciplinary action from the appropriate licensing board, though Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser said the state hasn’t taken disciplinary action against any providers since the law went into effect. 
The named defendant in the case is Patty Salazar, executive director of the Colorado Department of Regulatory Agencies. 
Conversion therapy has been denounced by major medical organizations including the American Medical Association, the American Psychological Association, the American Psychiatric Association and the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.
Colorado Solicitor General Shannon Stevenson argued before the justices that the law regulates medical conduct by a licensed therapist and concerns circumstances more narrowly defined than the professional conduct considered in NIFLA.
“The state cannot lose its power to regulate the very professionals that it licenses just because they are using words,” Stevenson said. “A health care provider cannot be free to violate the standard of care just because they are using words, and a state cannot be required to let its vulnerable young people waste their time and money on an ineffective, harmful treatment just because that treatment is delivered through words.” 
Chiles’ team offered no record of studies about, or mental health professionals willing to endorse, conversion therapy, Stevenson said. Unlicensed professionals like religious ministers and life coaches are permitted to conduct conversion therapy, Stevenson said, but therapists are not, because they offer a medical treatment regulated by the state.  
But even liberal Justice Elena Kagan suggested the state law comes across as viewpoint discrimination.  
“If a doctor says, ‘I know you identify as gay, and I’m going to help you accept that,’ and another doctor says, ‘I know you identify is gay, and I’m going to help you to change that,’ and one of those is permissible, and the other is not, that seems like viewpoint discrimination in the way we would normally understand viewpoint discrimination,” Kagan said. 
Stevenson pushed back on Justice Clarence Thomas’ notion that the state’s regulation is an illegal prior restraint on speech because, she said, it is not enforced unless someone files a complaint with the state licensing board. She said it “calls out a specific practice that violates the standard of care,” which she said has been done since the late 1800s. 
Several court cases related to LGBTQ+ discrimination in Colorado have made their way to the nation’s highest court. That includes one in which the Supreme Court said a Colorado web designer, who was also represented by Alliance Defending Freedom, does not have to make websites for same-sex couples, and another in which the court said a cake shop owner could deny a same-sex couple a wedding cake based on religious beliefs.
The court is expected to issue a ruling in the Chiles case in June.

The [[...]","YouTube screenshot of Seminole County Commission meeting from Sept. 23, 2025.Florida Chief Financial Officer Blaise Ingoglia took his statewide tour highlighting what he has labeled “excessive” and “wasteful” spending to Seminole County on Tuesday, where he alleged the GOP-controlled county commission had overspent to the tune of $48 million since 2019-2020 — and by even more when combined with a recently approved tax increase.
The five-member Seminole County Commission — all Republicans — voted 4-1 last month to increase the base property tax rate by 0.5 mills after facing a $35 million budget deficit, a 10% increase over the previous year. That move apparently triggered the CFO’s office to look into the spending of Seminole County, a Central Florida area with a population of approximately 484,000.
Unlike other reviews of local governments conducted by CFO Ingoglia’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) over the past several months, this review came from the Florida Agency for Fiscal Oversight (FAFO).
“What we’re doing is our FAFO audits, which are separate and distinct, but they work together,” he said at a press conference. “While DOGE is looking for specific examples, we are looking at high-level spending trends, to show you just how out-of-whack local governments are in relation to previous budgets and inflation and population.”
This audit alleges that since 2019, Seminole County has overspent and overtaxed residents by $48.4 million, a 46.7% budget increase.
“This is past accounting for growth in government with inflation, population,” Ingolia said. “It is past hiring fire and police. This is the number that the county has spent over and above what we believe should be a reasonable budget in order to deliver services.”
Ingoglia and Gov. Ron DeSantis have been campaigning since mid-summer for a yet-to-be officially proposed constitutional amendment likely to appear on the 2026 statewide ballot that will ask Floridians if they would like to see elimination or a substantial reduction in homestead property taxes. Ingoglia has said that the audits are a way of “laying a predicate to reducing property taxes.”
While some critics have accused him of being partisan by focusing on blue-leaning cities such as Orlando and St. Petersburg and blue-leaning counties like Broward and Orange, Ingoglia said Tuesday’s press conference showed that is not the case.
“Last time I checked there were four Republicans on the county commission here. Is it five?” he asked the audience before being informed that it was five Republicans. “Spending knows no partisan boundaries. Republicans and Democrats are spending us into oblivion. We are seeing at all levels of government.”
Ingoglia alleged that combined with the recent passage of a property tax increase, the amount of “wasteful” spending in Seminole County has increased from $44 million to $77 million.
Seminole County officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Commissioners said that the increase was necessary to pay for the rising costs of insurance, inflation, and law enforcement salaries, according to the Orlando Sentinel.
Local governments are pushing back
As Ingoglia and Gov. Ron DeSantis allege misspending on the part of local governments in other jurisdictions, they have begun receiving criticism for not being specific about what they define as “wasteful” spending.
In response, Gov. DeSantis and Ingoglia released a statement last week posting what they said were instances of “reckless spending and woke initiatives in cities and counties across the state.”
In the case of the city of Orlando, the report alleged that $460,000 had been spent since 2020 to count trees as part of the city’s “tree inventory,” and that the city spent $150,000 over three years to “help illegals evade deportation.”
In response, Orlando officials told the Phoenix that the city’s program to properly evaluate, maintain, and treat trees for damage and disease was not funded with property taxes. Instead, the program was funded through three separate state grants totaling $70,500, with the remaining funds coming from the city’s Street Tree Fund fueled by tree removal permits and mitigation fees paid by developers when new construction occurs.
With regards to immigration, the city said its Office of Community Affairs grants funds to non-profit organizations including the Orlando Center for Justice. That group, according to Orlando officials, aims to provide direct legal representation as well as educational Q&A-style workshops “to help people understand their rights and resources as not all legal concerns require representation and a free Q&A talk to address how and when to report to the court or ICE.”
Ingoglia and DeSantis called out Gainesville for spending $189,000 on a city director of Equity and Inclusion and that they mandated employee training on identity and culture, including a “wheel of power/privilege.”
In response, Gainesville Mayor Harvey Ward told the Phoenix he was “proud of our team at the City of Gainesville.”
“We continue to provide tremendous value to our neighbors and to represent their values,” he said in a statement sent to the Phoenix.
“We have driven down crime, we have made our streets safer for pedestrians, for cyclists, and for drivers, we have built hundreds of affordable homes, and we have worked side by side with our neighbors to improve the quality of life here in Gainesville for everyone. I’m going to keep delivering on the work I was elected to do by the people of Gainesville.”
The governor’s and CFO’s report criticized Hillsborough County for spending $572,000 for unconscious bias training and $950,000 for a county employee vehicle allowance.
A Hillsborough county spokesperson told the Phoenix that an “optional course on unconscious bias” is part of a program the county’s Human Resources Department contracted with FranklinCovey to provide leaders with access to an interactive leadership development portal. That portal contains more than 1,700 resources designed to enhance professional and leadership skills. Among those is that course on unconscious bias, “which employees may choose to take along with many other offerings.”
The spokesperson added that the county’s automobile allowance does provide employees a monthly stipend for using their own vehicles for county business. The policy covers employees who drive a minimum of 50 miles (on average) each month for work.
“The allowance is the most efficient way to reimburse employees who use their personal vehicles for county business to cut down on administrative costs, including personnel and check distribution,” said the spokesperson.
Meanwhile, back in Seminole County on Tuesday, the CFO said he’s just getting started highlighting what he says is “wasteful” spending.
“We’re not going away,” Ingoglia said. “We’re going to continue beating this drum from now up until the time that we get actual property tax reform on the ballot in 2026.”

,DC,2025-10-07 19:11:24+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,A combative AG Pam Bondi confronts US Senate Judiciary over Trump crackdown,Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/combative-ag-pam-bondi-confronts-us-senate-judiciary-over-trump-crackdown,,"WASHINGTON — U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi aimed heated rhetoric at Democratic senators on Capitol Hill Tuesday as she faced questions over the administration’s surge of federal agents to blue cities, as well as a litany of controversial issues surrounding the Department of Justice. In one fervid exchange during the routine oversight hearing before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Bondi lashed out at Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, “I wish you’d love Chicago as much as you hate President Trump.”“And currently the National Guard are on the way to Chicago — if you’re not going to protect your citizens, President Trump will,” Bondi continued, responding to a question from Durbin on whether she had any conversations with the administration ahead of a deployment of the National Guard to Chicago.“And by the way so is (FBI) Director Kash Patel and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche. You’re sitting here grilling me, and they’re on their way to Chicago to keep your state safe,” Bondi said.“Madam Attorney General, it’s my job to grill you,” Durbin responded.Battles with statesBondi’s hearing occurred after a whirlwind weekend of back-and-forth between a federal judge and the Trump administration over whether National Guard troops could be sent to Portland, Oregon, and were necessary to protect federal law enforcement engaged with Immigration and Custom Enforcement protesters.Illinois is now locked in a legal battle to block troops from coming to Chicago.Chicago is a month into a federal crackdown. One of the most high-profile raids occurred in the city’s South Shore neighborhood on Sept. 30 when dozens of federal agents, including from the FBI, overran a five-story apartment building with helicopters and flashbangs, ziptying adults and children, and detaining some U.S. citizens, according to multiple media reports. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security published a highly produced video of the raid on social media.Bondi’s voice grew hoarse during the hearing as she defended the administration’s campaign to arrest “countless” immigrants she described as “illegal aliens.”The attorney general was combative with Democratic senators throughout nearly five hours of questioning — telling Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, “Don’t you ever challenge my integrity” when he asked about DOJ’s recently dismissed antitrust lawsuit against American Express. Bondi later accused Sen. Mazie Hirono of supporting the loose political ideology antifa — which the White House is targeting as a cohesive body — when the Hawaii Democrat questioned a range of issues, including the department’s alleged consideration of a compensation fund for pardoned Jan. 6 rioters.Tom Homan troubles airedA laundry list of controversial incidents trailed Bondi into the committee room for the oversight hearing — including revelations of FBI agents handing $50,000 in a restaurant takeout bag to Tom Homan, Trump ally and now White House border czar, ahead of the November 2024 election in exchange for false government contracts.Bondi declined to answer Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse when he asked, “What became of the $50,000 in cash that the FBI delivered evidently in a paper bag to Mr. Homan?” Whitehouse, of Rhode Island, and other Democratic senators asked if Homan kept the money and if he claimed it on his income tax return.“The investigation of Mr. Homan was subjected to a full review by the FBI and the DOJ. They found no credible evidence of wrongdoing,” Bondi She then accused Whitehouse of corruption and accepting “dark money.”“The questions here are actually pretty specific, so having you respond with completely irrelevant far-right internet talking points is really not very helpful,” Whitehouse said.Comey indictment directed by TrumpLawmakers from both parties volleyed accusations of the department’s “weaponization” against the previous and current administrations. Bondi’s appearance came less than two weeks after a grand jury returned an indictment of former Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey. The indictment swiftly followed the administration’s ouster of interim U.S. Attorney Erik Seibert in Virginia after he resisted bringing charges against Comey and New York Democratic Attorney General Letitia James. The administration replaced Seibert with President Donald Trump’s former personal lawyer, Lindsey Halligan. Days before the Comey indictment, Trump directly appealed to Bondi as “Pam” on his social media platform Truth Social: “What about Comey, Adam ‘Shifty’ Schiff, Leticia??? They’re all guilty as hell, but nothing is going to be done.”Schiff, a California Democrat, sits on the Judiciary Committee. Late in the hearing, Bondi suggested Schiff should “apologize” to Trump for his past efforts in impeachment proceedings during the president’s first term. Bondi also attacked Schiff as a “failed lawyer.”Grassley Jan. 6 disclosureRepublicans seethed during the hearing at Monday’s disclosure by Committee Chair Chuck Grassley that FBI agents analyzed data on more than half a dozen Republican lawmakers’ phones during their 2023 investigation into Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election results.The FBI allegedly sought data from the days surrounding the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol attack from the phones of Sens. Josh Hawley of Missouri, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, Dan Sullivan of Alaska, Tommy Tuberville of Alabama, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming and Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, as well as Rep. Mike Kelly of Pennsylvania. Hawley likened the investigation of his colleagues’ phones to a “witch hunt” and called for a special prosecutor to “get to the bottom of” alleged Department of Justice activities under former President Joe Biden.“I find this breathtaking,” said Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana.At Kennedy’s urging, Grassley of Iowa said his staff is conducting an investigation of the possible collection of phone data and that he may schedule a separate hearing on the matter.Trump responded to the disclosure Tuesday morning on Truth Social: “Deranged Jack Smith got caught with his hand in the cookie jar. A real sleazebag!!!” Bondi also faced scrutiny from Democratic senators who rehashed her promises to release information on the federal probe of the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, only to be followed by an FBI memo denying the release of any further case files.A bipartisan effort is underway in the U.S. House to compel the release of the government’s investigative materials.",,,,2025-10-07 15:56:48.180866

(Roblox press kit)Republican Kentucky Attorney General Russell Coleman is suing the online gaming platform Roblox for allegedly failing to protect children from an “online environment in which child predators thrive, directly contributing to the widespread victimization of minor children in Kentucky.”
The 68-page lawsuit filed Monday in Madison Circuit Court alleges the Roblox Corp.’s online gaming platform is a “hunting ground for child predators” and that the company has failed to implement safety controls to protect children or inform children and parents of the dangers of Roblox’s platform. 
Coleman in a provided statement Tuesday said children were not safe on Roblox and that predators and criminals have been “allowed to commit their crimes out in the open.” 
“For years, Roblox has ignored this crisis so it could continue turning a profit. Our responsibility is to protect Kentucky children from online exploitation by these predators and the companies like Roblox that knowingly facilitate it,” Coleman said in his statement. 
The lawsuit alleges Roblox has become a “critical facilitator” for child predators to identify and groom children because of the platform’s ease of account creation including the lack of age verification; ineffective parental control and ineffective filters for chat rooms on the platform; and the failure to stop bad actors from creating multiple accounts on the platform. 
The complaint also details examples of predators using the platform’s digital currency system “Robux” to entice children into sending explicit photos. The “Robux” currency used on the platform can be bought as “gift cards” in major retailers such as Walmart. 
Roblox did not immediately respond Tuesday afternoon to an emailed request for comment on the lawsuit.
Roblox’s website states an age verification process — involving scanning a government-issued identification and capturing a selfie to compare with the I.D. photo — is “a new feature that is currently in testing on Roblox.” In early September, the company announced it was expanding the use of facial age estimation technology to all users, stating it had “shipped over 100 safety initiatives” since the beginning of the year. 
The Republican attorney general in Louisiana sued Roblox in August for similar reasons, citing an arrest in Louisiana this year where a suspect possesed child sexual abuse images, had regularly used the Roblox platform and used voice-altering technology to mimic a younger feminine voice, according to that separate lawsuit.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Roblox-Landscape-avatar-customization-on-mobile-1024x576.png,,,2025-10-07 15:56:48.180866

Here’s why,Ryan Sabalow,,,,,https://calmatters.org/politics/2025/10/netflix-hulu-loud-commercials-california/,Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill banning ads that are substantially louder than the shows on streaming services such as Netflix and Hulu.,"In summary
Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill banning ads that are substantially louder than the shows on streaming services such as Netflix and Hulu.


Even California’s governor is fed up with obnoxiously loud advertisements that pop on when he’s streaming his favorite shows.
Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill on Monday that bans streaming services such as Netflix and Hulu from playing advertisements substantially louder than the programming they accompany.
Newsom signs hundreds of bills each year with little fanfare, reserving bill-signing announcements typically for only the measures that he and his team find the most noteworthy or in which the governor is personally invested. 
He sent one out announcing he’d signed Senate Bill 576.
“We heard Californians loud and clear, and what’s clear is that they don’t want commercials at a volume any louder than the level at which they were previously enjoying a program,” Newsom wrote. “By signing SB 576, California is dialing down this inconvenience across streaming platforms.”
The law makes streaming platforms comply with the same standards as a 15-year-old federal law that limits how loud television and cable broadcasters can make their advertisements.
President Barack Obama signed the Commercial Advertisement Loudness Mitigation (CALM) Act in 2010, which gave the Federal Communications Commission authority to issue rules ensuring that the average volume of TV commercials does not exceed the volume of the shows they accompany. 
Streaming services were still nascent at the time. Members of Congress have since tried to add streaming platforms to the law, but two 2023 federal bills didn’t get hearings.
Lawmakers don’t like loud ads
The bill wasn’t a tough sell for its author, Democratic Sen. Tom Umberg of Santa Ana. It passed the Legislature with none of California’s 120 legislators voting against it.

 Thomas Umberg
 Democrat, State Senate, District 34 (Santa Ana)



Umberg told CalMatters this summer that he came up with the idea for the bill after his legislative director, Zach Keller, told him about how a loud ad woke up his infant daughter, Samantha Rose, while the adults were trying to relax and watch a show. 
“This bill was inspired by baby Samantha and every exhausted parent who’s finally gotten a baby to sleep, only to have a blaring streaming ad undo all that hard work,” Umberg said in a statement accompanying Newsom’s. “SB 576 brings some much-needed peace and quiet to California households by making sure streaming ads aren’t louder than the shows we actually want to watch.”
The measure faced opposition from California’s influential entertainment industry, including the Motion Picture Association of America, which has donated at least $204,000 to lawmakers since 2015, according to the CalMatters Digital Democracy database. 
The opponents argued that the measure would be difficult to implement since streaming services don’t have the same control over ad volumes as traditional broadcasters.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/100725-Netflix-REUTERS-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-07 15:56:48.180866

(Photo by Andrew Roth/Michigan Advance)Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, alongside a coalition of Democratic state attorneys general, are calling on the U.S. Supreme Court to take up a case surrounding an individual’s right to sue to enforce the federal Voting Rights Act.
In a brief dated Tuesday, Nessel and 22 other AGs asked the high court to review a lower court’s decision in Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians v. Howe, which would prevent individuals from suing to enforce the Voting Rights Act. 
In their brief, the attorneys general argue in support of the individual right to sue to enforce Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which bars state and local governments from enacting racially discriminatory policies, ensuring American citizens would not be denied or restricted from casting their ballot. 
While the U.S. Attorney General and private citizens have been able to file lawsuits to enforce this provision for nearly 60 years, a decision from the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit has called that practice into question. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians, Spirit Lake Tribal and three Native American voters filed a lawsuit under Section 2 in 2022, challenging North Dakota’s redistricting plan on the grounds that it diluted Native American votes. 
The U.S. District Court for the District of North Dakota held that the map discriminated against Native American voters. However, the Eighth Circuit reversed the decision, ruling that individual voters and organizations cannot sue to enforce Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. 
In their brief, the group of attorneys general argue that private enforcement of the act is essential, and has acted as the primary avenue for enforcing the law since it was enacted. They also argue that exclusively relying on the U.S. Attorney General to enforce the law would be insufficient to protect voters from racial discrimination. 
“If individuals are stripped of their ability to enforce the Voting Rights Act, everyday Americans will have little control in protecting their own right to vote,” Nessel said in a statement. “Relying only on the U.S. Attorney General to bring these cases puts communities at the mercy of political officials, and I urge the Supreme Court to review this decision to preserve the fundamental protections of our democracy.”
While private citizens account for 91% of the challenges under Section 2 between 1982 and 2024, the U.S. Attorney General accounts for 7.5% of challenges within that same time frame, the attorneys general wrote.
Alongside Michigan, the brief was joined by attorneys general from Minnesota, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington,Wisconsin and the District of Columbia.

(Photo by Johner Images/Getty)Florida’s top Medicaid official came before the Legislature Tuesday to update state senators on a pending legal battle with the federal government over expansion of the popular children’s health insurance program known as Florida KidCare.
But Brian Meyer couldn’t answer a simple question: How many children have been disenrolled from the program because their families haven’t paid the premiums, which is at the center of the tussle between the administration of Gov. Ron DeSantis and the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)?
Meyer couldn’t answer another question during a hearing before the Senate Health Policy Committee: How many children would have been enrolled had the expansion been implemented as planned to cover children living in families that earn up to 300% of the federal poverty level, which amounts to $96,450 annually. Now, only children living in families earning 200% of the federal poverty level qualify. The Legislature ordered the higher threshold in 2023 but the administration hasn’t complied.

“I don’t have that information handy, but I’d be certainly happy to work with our Florida Healthy Kids Corp. partners on that information,” Meyer said, responding to Boynton Beach Democrat Sen. Lori Berman’s questions.
The Florida Healthy Kids Corp. helps administer the state’s version of the federal children’s health insurance program, dubbed Florida KidCare.
The Florida Phoenix asked the state Agency for Health Care Administration, which administers the Medicaid program, and Florida Healthy Kids for disenrollment data but has received no response.

Florida Kidcare is the umbrella name for the federal subsidized children’s health insurance program, which allows families that earn too much to qualify for traditional Medicaid to access affordable health insurance. Florida Kidcare is an optional Medicaid expansion and families must contribute to the costs of care by paying monthly premiums.
 Legal wrangling

Meyer’s presentation largely focused on legal wrangling with CMS over expanding the program. The dispute began under former President Joe Biden but continues to linger under President Donald Trump.
The state sued the federal government in February 202 after being told the feds would approve the expansion but that the state would have to abide by a 12-month continuous eligibility requirement. That was dictated by the 2023 federal budget, as flagged in a “Frequently Asked Questions” document sent to Medicaid directors nationwide and later codified into rule.
It requires the state to keep eligible enrolled children in the program for a year even if their parents miss the state-mandated monthly premiums.
The DeSantis administration argued at the time that the federal government overstepped its authority with the requirement. Florida was the only state to challenge the rule.
The lawsuit has not moved much since first being filed. U.S. District  Judge Mary Scriven in July ordered the parties to provide an update on the legal challenge by September. That’s when attorneys for the U.S. Department of Justice asked Scriven to keep the case open.
“We are continuing to have conversations related to kinda settling this that will be an amenable position to the state and also to the federal government, so we are hopeful we get somewhere hopefully in the near future,” he said.

Meyer said it’s difficult to predict the timeline on the litigation. “We are certainly committed to finding alternative pathways forward to implement the legislation,” he said, adding that the state is in discussions with the “higher levels” at CMS.
Several members of the committee expressed support for the state’s position. Stuart Republican Sen. Gayle Harrell said she didn’t understand the federal government tying the 12-month continuous eligibility with expansion approval.
“We are essentially being held hostage on implementation of raising the income eligibility to 300% of the federal poverty level under the [Medicaid] waiver because of this lawsuit,” Harrell said.
The continued delay in expanding access to Florida KidCare comes with the number of uninsured children in the state on the rise, with a new study showing that 8.5% of children in the state are uninsured, up from 7.4% in 2024. That’s an increase bof about 67,000 uninsured children.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-07 18:49:17+00:00,CT Mirror,Trump gave the Labor Department more control over career-technical education. Will students benefit?,Kalyn Belsha | Chalkbeat,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/07/trump-labor-department-career-technical-education/,"Trump officials say the end goal is to boost  labor force participation, especially for the young adults who are not in school or working.","This story was originally published by Chalkbeat. Sign up for their newsletters at ckbe.at/newsletters
Career and technical education is a lot more than learning to weld or draw blood. 
It can expose kids to jobs they didn’t even know existed and help them figure out what they want to do with their lives. 
It can also teach students concrete skills they can use on the job right after they graduate high school. But high school programs haven’t always lined up well with what employers are looking for, or prepared students for jobs available in their communities. 
The Trump administration wants to see career and technical education, or CTE, focus more on preparing students for jobs. To do that, last month it took money and programs that have been under the Education Department’s purview for decades and moved them to the Labor Department, which has historically focused on short-term job training for unemployed adults.
Trump officials say the end goal is to boost participation in the labor force, especially for the millions of young adults who are not in school or working. The change, they say, will reduce the administrative burden on states and make it easier for states to centralize their own workforce development programs.
Jason Tyszko, a senior vice president for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation, said there could be some short-term disruption, as well as some hard questions to work through. But if the end result is more accountability for programs and more young people in jobs, that would be a “win for families and learners.”
“We think the more alignment, the better,” Tyszko said. 
But many career-technical education advocates, as well as Democrats in Congress, say this move is another step toward dismantling the Education Department. They fear there are simply too few staff in both the Education and Labor Departments to manage the transition, and they worry the change will end up steering kids toward short-term job training with fewer paths to advancement. 
High school CTE programs can help create “a springboard for lifelong opportunity,” said Amy Loyd, who served as the assistant secretary over career and technical education during the Biden administration. 
For example, students who take advanced manufacturing classes in high school can set themselves up for admission to a trade school, while teens who take college-level health care classes can often earn credit toward an associate or bachelor’s degree.
“One of the challenges that we in the career and technical education community have been working to combat is the still-pervasive stigma of career and technical education being for ‘those kids,’” she said. “I think by focusing on the shorter-term credentials we are again rebuilding this narrative that CTE is for kids who are not college material.”
Two agencies in charge of career-technical education
The Education Department says this change is in line with the president’s April 23 executive order calling for the consolidation of “fragmented Federal workforce development programs that are too disconnected from propelling workers into secure, well-paying, and high-need American jobs.”
In May, Trump officials signed an interagency agreement that maintains the Education Department’s oversight authority for career-technical education, but hands over the day-to-day operations to the Labor Department. That includes distributing over $1 billion to states in Perkins funding, which pays for CTE programs in K-12 schools and community colleges, making compliance monitoring visits, and helping states and schools with technical questions. 
High-ranking Democrats in Congress have said this transfer of funds and responsibilities is illegal, and the proposal should have gone to Congress. Others in the career and technical education field say the Education and Labor Departments already work closely together and this move isn’t necessary to improve collaboration.
Anna Chappelle, the executive director of the Alabama Workforce Board, hopes what happens at the federal level resembles the transformation happening in her state. The share of young people who were not working or in school in Alabama was the highest in the nation in 2019, according to a report by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. 
In recent years, Alabama has worked to align its education and workforce programs, and has seen the share of people age 16 or over who are employed or actively looking for work tick up. In June, the Trump administration tapped Nick Moore, who led that work under Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey, as the second-in-command for CTE at the Education Department.
Alabama launched a state apprenticeship agency that offers tools to connect young people to training opportunities. The state also developed a detailed system for identifying which job credentials and career pathways are most valuable in different parts of the state — whether that’s the space industry in the north or the maritime industry in the south. 
“When we have this separation, that keeps states siloed,” Chappelle said. “Being able to have credentials of value and workforce pathways in Labor, that is going to help people get the education and training that they need.”
She thinks the federal change will lead to more money for training and education programs, “rather than the bureaucratic red tape.”
But Loyd, who is now the CEO of All4Ed, a nonprofit that advocates for equity in education, worries there aren’t enough federal staffers left to provide the kind of “personalized and intensive” guidance her team of 80 once did.
The office “was really leaning into helping states think differently, to not just rubber stamp what always has been,” Loyd said. “I worry that all of that capacity-building, all of that partnership with the field, is ultimately hindered and gutted.”
The Education Department said it would send some staff to the Labor Department, but how many is unclear. The Education Department did not respond to questions. Chalkbeat received out-of-office automatic replies from multiple spokespeople due to the government shutdown.
Some advocates fear states and schools won’t get clear answers to questions about whether new ideas are allowable under the law or how to make sure CTE programs serve all students. 
“​​If we had a question about kids with disabilities and CTE, we knew where to go,” said Braden Goetz, who served in the CTE office during the Biden administration and is now a senior policy advisor at the Center on Education and Labor at New America, a left-leaning think tank. “I’m concerned that in the Department of Labor they won’t have those resources.”
Some fear overemphasis on short-term job training
The Education Department has said its agreement with the Labor Department will integrate education and job training programs “with an employment first perspective, which places employers at the forefront of workforce development programs.” The document mentions “upskilling” students — a term that’s typically used to refer to retraining adults in the workforce, not kids in K-12 schools. 
Some education advocates worry that sends the wrong messages to students about the purpose of career-technical education programs, and harkens back to a time when many low-income Black and Latino kids were tracked to lower-level vocational classes.
Loyd, the former Biden official, worries that folding CTE into the Labor Department’s work will lead to an overemphasis on helping students earn industry credentials that often don’t translate to higher wages in the workforce. 
Federal law requires CTE programs to prepare students for jobs that are “high-skill, high-wage, or in-demand.” A heavier focus on short-term job outcomes could steer more students toward in-demand jobs that don’t pay very well, Loyd said, such as certified nursing assistants or home health care aides. 
“I love programs like phlebotomy programs in high schools where students can earn meaningful certificates that can get them a job,” Loyd said. “But again, this should be a stepping stone,” she said, not the end game.
Tyszko, of the Commerce Foundation, says time will tell if kids get steered like that. He notes that the Labor Department does have experience connecting young people with apprenticeships, which generally do help workers earn more than their peers. 
“They’re very capable of supporting a set of activities in the field that promote career awareness and aren’t directly tied to job placement,” Tyszko said, adding it would be wrong to assume the Labor Department’s focus on short-term job training “would entirely consume” career-technical education. 
The Labor Department also may be better positioned to hold CTE programs accountable for their outcomes in the workforce, and whether they actually match what employers want and need, he said.
Chappelle in Alabama says what programs kids have access to also affects whether they can make an informed decision about their path. The kind and quality of CTE programs offered at schools varies a lot depending on where kids live, and states and businesses share in the responsibility of closing any gaps.
“We are all working together to make sure we have what’s available for our students and our citizens to go up in life,” she said. “We’re not trying to keep people down. That doesn’t serve anybody.”

Mikie Sherrill (D) has outraised former Assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli (R) so far this cycle, but both are set to max out their public matching funds.","Rep. Mikie Sherrill (D) reported about $6.5 million left in reserves on Oct. 3, compared to Republican Jack Ciattarelli’s nearly $4 million. (Amanda Brown for New Jersey Monitor)Democrat Mikie Sherrill held a cash and fundraising lead over Republican Jack Ciattarelli as this year’s gubernatorial election moved into its final month, according to new campaign finance reports.
Sherrill, a four-term congresswoman, raised $17.5 million since the end of June, edging out the $16.5 million brought in by Ciattarelli, according to disclosures filed with the New Jersey Election Law Enforcement Commission. Sherrill reported about $6.5 million left in reserves on Oct. 3, compared to Ciattarelli’s nearly $4 million.
“Jack is definitely raising quicker than he raised the last time, but that is not a surprise given he has the additional experience of having run before,” said Micah Rasmussen, director of Rider University’s Rebovich Institute for New Jersey Politics. “Mikie has had to raise before, so she’s got that going for her, but she’s also from the majority party in this state.”
Jack Ciattarelli speaks at a town hall in Pitman on Sept. 16, 2025. (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)
In 2021, when Ciattarelli was also the GOP nominee for governor, he reported having raised a little under $10.1 million 29 days out from Election Day. He lost that race to Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat who is leaving office after two terms in January.
For this election, Ciattarelli has spent more than his opponent, putting nearly $12.6 million into the contest to Sherrill’s roughly $11 million.
Both candidates have received similar amounts of public matching funds from the state. Through Oct. 3, Ciattarelli’s campaign had received $9.6 million in matching dollars, while Sherrill received $10.5 million, including $801,619 not reflected on her most recent campaign filing.

New Jersey’s gubernatorial public financing program offers eligible candidates matching funds at a rate of 2-to-1 for every dollar the candidates raise. In exchange, candidates for governor must agree to participate in debates hosted by the Election Law Enforcement Commission and observe spending limits.
This year, gubernatorial candidates can receive up to $12.5 million in matching dollars for the general election and must agree to spend no more than $18.5 million on the contest.
Both candidates have raised enough on their own to cap out their matching funds.

The overwhelming share of both candidates’ expenses went to media production, ad buys, campaign literature, and lawn signs. Those items accounted for roughly $11 million of Ciattarelli’s expenditures and $8.6 million of Sherrill’s spending.
The largest share of the Republican’s spending, just over $4.8 million, went to ads on network television.
He vastly outspent Sherrill on digital ads, putting $3.6 million behind internet messaging to Sherrill’s $970,645. Sherrill’s $2.8 million in spending on cable ads more than doubled the $964,494 Ciattarelli put behind them.
It’s not clear how much the congresswoman has spent airing advertisements on network television. Her latest report did not include any items with that purpose, though the $4.2 million she reported spending on mixed media could include television.
That total almost certainly included spending on internet ads, Rasmussen said.
“It would have to be,” he said. “It’s not like she’s absent on those digital platforms. She’s holding her own.”
Here’s how our next governor says they’ll make NJ more affordable

Candidates’ spending on radio advertisements was paltry. Ciattarelli put $121,772 behind radio ads, including a $1,000 ad buy on New Jersey 101.5, where Bill Spadea, who ran against Ciattarelli for the GOP nod for governor this year, has returned to airwaves following his primary loss.
Sherrill reported putting $314,058 behind radio ads.

Both candidates spent little on newspaper advertisements. Sherrill put $14,050 behind ads in Spanish-language and Jewish newspapers, while Ciattarelli made a single newspaper ad buy in the Italian Tribune, a West Orange-based weekly.",https://newjerseymonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/sherill5-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-07 14:58:09.182976

Gretchen Whitmer; Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks (D-Grand Rapids); and State Sen. Sarah Anthony (D-Lansing), chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee. Oct. 7, 2025 | Photo providedGov. Gretchen Whitmer signed Michigan’s state budget for Fiscal Year 2026 on Tuesday, following its passage through the state House and Senate early last Friday, Oct. 3. That followed legislators passing an eight-day continuation budget shortly after the constitutional deadline of Oct. 1. 
“I just signed my seventh balanced, bipartisan budget that delivers on kitchen table issues: costs, roads, safety and schools,” Whitmer announced in a video. “This budget is a testament to what we can get done when we work together,” 
Democrats touted the deal as “a bipartisan budget that fixes our roads, strengthens public schools, protects health care access, and insulates us from some of the toughest federal cuts,” as Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks (D-Grand Rapids) said in a press release from the Governor’s office. 
“Our number one priority is helping more people afford to stay and succeed in Michigan, by providing access to health, jobs, and safety for their families,” said Lt. Governor Garlin Gilchrist II. “This budget does just that.”
Meanwhile, Republicans, including Speaker of the House Matt Hall (R-Richland Township), focused on increased transparency and fiscal responsibility in the budget, including the elimination of around 2,000 unfilled government employee positions. 
“This budget makes a significant difference in eliminating waste, fraud and abuse to lower state spending and give the taxpayers better value for their dollars,” Hall said. “That’s how we were finally able to get our local roads fixed and pass the public safety trust fund, all while eliminating taxes on tips, overtime and social security.”
For the coming fiscal year, the Department of Health and Human Services will take a $7.6 billion cut, while the Department of Transportation’s budget increased by $1.08 billion. Other funding increases came for the State Police, Natural Resources, Military and Veterans Affairs and more. 
Funding for road improvements was a key priority for Whitmer’s office in budget negotiations. The budget includes, according to the press release, “Nearly $2 billion in ongoing resources for improving state and local roads when fully implemented over the next four years,” which is set to be funded by an increased tax on cannabis products. That tax, a key portion of the budget, passed by narrow margins in the Legislature.  
It also includes a $21.3 billion school aid package, including funding for K-12 schools, community colleges, and higher education. That package increases per-pupil spending to $10,050, as well as maintaining free school meals and increasing funding for at-risk students. 
Hall is scheduled to speak more in depth about the budget later on Tuesday.

(Photo by Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)A trial began Tuesday in a class-action lawsuit alleging Colorado is failing to comply with a 2018 constitutional amendment that banned involuntary labor in state prisons.
The case, Mortis v. Polis, was brought in Denver District Court by progressive legal advocates on behalf of two inmates who say the Colorado Department of Corrections is violating the law by punishing incarcerated people who refuse to participate in mandatory work programs. Judge Sarah B. Wallace granted class-action status for the case last year.
“This is a systemic issue that reflects the larger social neglect of incarcerated individuals,” Demetrius Somerville, an activist with the End Slavery Colorado campaign and a former inmate, said at a rally outside the court on Tuesday. “During my time in prison, I reported to work ill on many occasions, in fear of being punished by being sent to restrictive housing — which is similar to solitary confinement, with hours and hours in a cell by yourself — or fear of losing privileges, such as a precious communication with my family, friends and peers.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The End Slavery Colorado campaign successfully fought to repeal the state’s “exception clause” — a provision in the 13th Amendment and many state constitutions that banned slavery and involuntary servitude except as punishment for a crime. Nearly two-thirds of Colorado voters cast ballots in favor or 2018’s Amendment A, making it the first state in the nation to abolish its exception clause via constitutional amendment. The state constitution now simply reads: “There shall never be in this state either slavery or involuntary servitude.”
Seven years later, activists and state officials remain sharply at odds over whether the CDOC’s inmate work program — under which incarcerated people can lose privileges and “earned time,” which accelerates parole eligibility, for refusing to work — runs afoul of the new constitutional language. The suit names CDOC, its executive director Moses “Andre” Stancil and Gov. Jared Polis as defendants.
David Seligman, executive director of Towards Justice, one of the groups that brought the lawsuit, said at Tuesday’s rally that inmates still face “extraordinarily harsh consequences … for exercising their basic and fundamental right not to give away their labor.”
Seligman is a Democratic candidate for Colorado attorney general in 2026.










There shall never be in this state either slavery or involuntary servitude.


– Colorado Constitution


“The governor of Colorado and the Department of Corrections treat our Constitution and Amendment A like words on a page, like that’s all they are,” Seligman said. “They have changed absolutely nothing, even after Colorado voters expressed their will.”
A CDOC spokesperson said the department could not comment on pending litigation. In a 2022 filing in response to the plaintiffs’ complaint, the state argued that the passage of Amendment A did not require changes to the work program, because inmates do not “face legal sanction or lose access to basic rights, such as food, shelter, or medical care, if they refuse to work.”
“Prison privileges are just that — privileges,” state attorneys wrote. “Because inmates have no entitlement to these privileges, withholding them as a consequence of not working is not so coercive as to constitute slavery or involuntary servitude.”
The state’s filing acknowledged a variety of consequences that incarcerated people can face if they refuse to work, including removal from “incentive” living units; the loss of privileges like recreation time, personal electronics and access to snacks and other canteen purchases; and “fewer opportunities” for calls and visits from family members.
Minimum-wage laws do not apply to incarcerated workers in Colorado, who earn between $0.33 and $1.61 per hour, according to a 2022 report from the American Civil Liberties Union. Former inmates and family members of incarcerated people spoke Tuesday about being unable to take sick days, and Wynn Howell, state director of the Colorado Working Families Party, highlighted other workplace protections that don’t extend to incarcerated people.
“The other thing that doesn’t apply to incarcerated workers is basic OSHA laws, basic workplace safety protections,” said Howell. “So you have people working for pennies, or $1 a day, in giant industrial laundries, industrial kitchens, other places, without the most basic workplace safety protections. What would you call that?”

The case laid bare some of the secrets surrounding Torch, which began placing its games in convenience stores, fraternal halls and other locations starting in 2017. It is the first time any court decision has approached the question of whether Torch’s games violate Missouri gambling laws.

The jury found in favor of TNT Amusements Inc. of Sullivan and ordered Torch to pay $500,000. Jim Turntine, owner of TNT, has been fighting with Torch since at least 2020. He has a pending lawsuit in St. Louis County over some of the issues raised in the federal case.
Over the course of the trial in St. Louis, which consumed most of last week in front of Senior District Judge John Ross, jurors heard testimony about Torch’s claims its games are legal because there is no element of chance in the outcome and TNT’s arguments that those improper claims led retailers to replace its games with Torch games.
In his instructions to the jury, Ross told it to consider whether Torch made false statements to obtain business, including “this amusement device does not fit any definition of a ‘gambling device’ in the state of Missouri and is not prohibited for use.”
If jurors had found that the statement was true, the instruction told them to find in favor of Torch.
Richard Finneran, one of the attorneys representing TNT, declined to be interviewed because the case was not yet final. 
“We are grateful to the jury for seeing through Torch’s false advertising,” Finneran said in a statement to The Independent. “Now that the jury has rendered its verdict, we look forward to seeking an official judgment from the court as to the illegality of the Torch devices.”
Torch will appeal the verdict, spokesman Gregg Keller said. 
Torch has used high-profile lobbyists, large political donations, contacts with prosecutors and lawsuits against enforcement agencies to protect its market. In 2023, then-Attorney General Andrew Bailey pulled out of defending the Missouri State Highway Patrol in a lawsuit filed by Torch after accepting $14,000 in contributions for his campaign and another $12,000 for his PAC from committees funded by Torch.
So far this year, the company has contributed just under $600,000 to seven political action committees controlled by its chief lobbyist, former Missouri House Speaker Steve Tilley. In 2024, one of the company’s few donations outside the PACs controlled by Tilley was $250,000 to American Dream PAC, which backed Gov. Mike Kehoe.
PACs connected to Missouri lobbyist take in $530K from pair of companies

One of the secrets closely held by Torch has been how much it keeps of the money spent by players.
Games provided to retailers by Torch and its competitors are unregulated by the state, and no reports exist showing how much money is being spent on the games by consumers. The state’s 13 casinos, which must report monthly totals for taxation, reported taking in about $17 billion at slot machines in each of the past three fiscal years and paying out just over 90% as prizes.
By law, slot machines in casinos must return at least 80% of the money bet as prizes. Casino profits are taxed at 21%, bringing in $364 million for public schools in the most recent fiscal year.
The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported that at trial, Steve Miltenberger, owner of Torch, testified that the payouts of his games are about the same. 
Financial records obtained during the case, Ross wrote in a March order, showed that $32 million was spent from 2017 to 2023 at 20 locations, with about 100 machines, where TNT also had games. Torch split $11 million with retailers, leaving about 65% for prizes.
Unlike casino games, there is no special tax dedicated to education from Torch profits.
Evidence obtained for the case shows that Missouri Gaming Commission experts estimate there are about 15,000 Torch machines across the state.
Each one has at least five game themes, with multiple play levels, and whenever a player wants to see the outcome of the next play on that game theme and play level, a button is available to reveal it.
The outcomes are sequential, but with a random starting point whenever the game is first turned on or rebooted. 
Torch calls the games “no-chance games” because of the ability of players to view the next outcome and the sequential nature of the prize determinations.
But the number of possible starting points make it an illegal game of chance, according to an opinion of the state gaming commission cited by Ross.
No criminal court has reached a jury verdict on the legality of Torch’s games. But in the March ruling where Ross dismissed claims that Torch was a criminal conspiracy, Ross described the extensive history of criminal and civil litigation involving the games and wrote that it wouldn’t be unreasonable for a jury to find that Torch lied about the legality of its games.
But an opinion letter from a Chicago attorney that the games are legal, and the decision by some prosecutors to turn down law enforcement requests for charges, shielded Torch in the federal case, Ross wrote.
That was “evidence of ‘plausible deniability’ (that) does effectively negate the element of specific criminal intent,” Ross wrote.
The jury’s verdict of $500,000 is to compensate TNT for losses from the unfair competition. In the statement, Finneran said that is a starting point.
“Now,” Finneran wrote, “we will seek disgorgement of the millions in profits that Torch has obtained through falsely advertising its device as ‘no-chance’ games.”

The audience of mostly elderly, Black residents had heard Vaughan use the words before. Many of them have experienced what he described.
“I was sitting here thinking earlier … I remember back in the day when they [banks and businesses] were charging us Black people a lot more for interest rates on our homes, on our cars and this feels like the same thing,” said Regina Merritt, who lives in rural Councilville. “We’re getting taxed out.”
Vaughan called residents together to provide an update on the Orange County Property Tax Justice Coalition’s effort to bring tax fairness to about a dozen historically Black communities across Orange County. More than 160 residents and supporters attended the meeting held at the Whitted Human Service Building in Hillsborough.
The coalition is made up of community organizers from historically Black neighborhoods across Orange County including Councilville, Mars Hill, Fairview, Rogers Road, Piney Grove, Efland-Cheeks, Cedar Grove, Northside, Pine Knolls, Tin Top, and Glosson/Davie Rd.
Vaughan opened with good news. He said that of more than 220 residents the group helped file property valuation appeals, about 50 received “good reductions” in assessed property values of more than 10%. Four neighborhoods received land value reductions that will collectively save them $500,000 a year, he said.
Lower property valuation means lower property taxes for property owners. Low-income residents and those on fixed incomes said they are finding it difficult to pay the higher tax bills they received after the county’s recent property revaluation.
According to the coalition, Orange County data shows that historically Black neighborhoods were overvalued, which led to more than $2 million in unfair property tax increases.

“This is about the haves and the have nots,” said Horace Johnson, the son and namesake of Hillsborough’s first and only Black mayor who recently died. “Right now, it’s coming down to money. What’s a senior supposed to do? Decide whether to take their insulin, get their shots? Pay their water bill or light bill? Get the roof fixed or pay their taxes an end up in the street?”
Vaughan said residents provided the county with evidence-based appeals that included corrections about the condition of homes, challenges to lot assessments and neighborhood sales data residents used to justify lower value of homes and lots.
The residents’ advocacy also led the county to review all the neighborhoods the coalition deemed “problematic,” and prompted the establishment of a tax assessment work group to review and evaluate the policies, processes, and procedures used by the county tax office to assess property values. The work group will also examine how the tax office communicates with the public about assessments.
Still, Vaughan said, there is much work left to do.
Of the 220 appeals the coalition helped residents file, 60 were outright rejected or received tiny reductions, Vaughan said. He cited an example of one Black homeowner who found that her tax record included a bathroom she did not have. The homeowner filed an appealed and her property value was reduced by only $1,000, Vaughan said.
 “Can you believe that?” Vaughan asked. “Now, they [Orange County] claim that was an appeal that was granted but what I want to point out is how pathetic that response is. It is unjustifiable and unacceptable.”
In the Perry Hill community west of Mebane, Vaughan said every appeal for tax relief was rejected.
“All of those had comparable sales” of nearby homes to show the county, Vaughan said. “They showed the differences between the interiors of the homes and every one was outright rejected.”
Vaughan is doing similar work in Wake County, which he said is the best in the state in ensuing equity in property taxes.
“All but one of all of the appeals we submitted [in Wake County] got accepted, and the average was three times as much as we’ve seen here in Orange County,” he said. 
In an interview, Vaughan said recent revaluations have placed intense pressure on Black neighborhoods and long-term residents, many of who have lived in those communities their entire lives.
“We’ve had a lot of folks say that if they didn’t get reductions, they were going to have to sell their homes,” Vaughan said. “We’ve had people threatened with foreclosure as a result of the tax rises. We’ve had people paying as much as 80% of their income to property taxes.” 
He noted that renters and homeowners who spend more than 30% of income on house are considered cost-burdened.
“We’ve had some folks who are paying more than half of their income to just property taxes alone,” Vaughan said. “So those pieces make it very difficult to both stay in your home and to have money to do other things.”
Orange County tax administrator Nancy Freeman told NC Newsline in May that after a preliminary review of the information provided by Vaughan and the coalition, her office didn’t seeing any “prevailing issues” with properties it has been able to identify and review.
“That’s not to say there are not problems within that need some attention, but at this moment we’ve not completed a review and at this moment, the ones that we’ve looked at, there’s nothing that’s prevalent from all of them at this point,” Freeman said.

Orange County Commissioner Earl McKee and several other commissioners attended the event.
In an interview, McKee said resident’s stories about property tax disparities are disturbing.
“I don’t know that it was an intentional racial bias,” McKee said. “There is definitely a systemic issue. It seems to be creating a racial disparity. It creates a hardship on our less wealthy people.” 
McKee said he will petition commissioners at the board’s meeting Tuesday to hire more appraisers or contract with tax organizations to process property valuations “more credibly and thoroughly” to get true property values.
There’s “no excuse” for a new house with more square footage and more bedrooms and amenities being appraised for less than a much smaller house across the street, McKee said.
“I don’t care if it’s owned by a white family or a Black family … what I care about is what I see as a systemic issue where certain groups of people seem to be, and I believe are, being appraised at a higher value relative to other groups.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Image-1-1024x768.png,,,2025-10-07 14:58:09.182976

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)The state House Insurance Committee passed a measure Monday to protect vaccine access, regardless of the actions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which has recently hired a number of vaccine skeptics to lead its immunization recommendation panel.
The bill, introduced by Rep. Arvind Venkat (D-Allegheny), would require insurance companies in Pennsylvania to cover the full cost of any vaccinations that are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and recommended by medical professional societies like the American Academy of Pediatrics or the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.
It passed on party lines, with 14 Democrats in favor and 12 Republicans opposed. 
“For millions of Pennsylvanians who choose to receive vaccines, they have come to depend on insurance coverage without cost sharing,” Venkat said. “House Bill 1828 is absolutely necessary to meet that expectation.”
The proposal  also maintains Pennsylvania’s religious exemptions.

Historically, insurance companies that operate within the commonwealth have been required to cover vaccines recommended by the Centers for Disease Control’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). But with Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. appointing a number of vaccine skeptics to the committee, Pennsylvania officials and lawmakers have taken steps to bypass their advice.
In its most recent move, the panel changed its recommendation for the COVID-19 vaccine,  so that people should consult a doctor before getting one, as opposed to simply visiting a pharmacy for the shot. That follows an action last month to adopt a slightly more restrictive recommendation for the vaccination, advising its use in people 65 and older, children over six months old with health conditions, and other “high risk” individuals.
So far, the change  has not led to insurance companies widely dropping coverage for the vaccines, but many of them are required by state laws to follow ACIP’s guidance. It’s unclear what the more ambiguous recommendation allows.
Andrew Nixon, a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), said, “Democrat-run states that pushed unscientific school lockdowns, toddler mask mandates, and draconian vaccine passports during the COVID era completely eroded the American people’s trust in public health agencies. ACIP remains the scientific body guiding immunization recommendations in this country, and HHS will ensure policy is based on rigorous evidence and Gold Standard Science, not the failed politics of the pandemic.”
Venkat’s bill is just the latest effort in the commonwealth to ensure vaccine access amid shakeups at the Centers for Disease Control and HHS.
It follows a push from Gov. Josh Shapiro and his administration to ensure vaccine access in Pennsylvania, regardless of the federal agency’s recommendations.
Last week, Shapiro signed an executive order telling state agencies to ensure Pennsylvanians can have access to free vaccinations, regardless of ACIP’s guidelines.
The order directed the state Department of Health to do what it can to protect children’ s vaccine access, the state Insurance Department to ensure insurers cover vaccinations and the commonwealth’s Department of Aging to ensure vaccine availability for the elderly. It will also create an online information portal and establish a Vaccine Education Workgroup to combat misinformation.
Shapiro has also signed Pennsylvania up to the Northeast Public Health Collaboration, a public health body formed in the wake of shakeups in the U.S. Health Department. The collaboration will create its own vaccine recommendations and prepare for potential health emergencies.
And last month, the state Board of Pharmacy, at Shapiro’s recommendation, voted to follow vaccination guidelines from leading medical groups instead of the CDC’s immunization panel. The move was intended to allow pharmacists to continue providing vaccines to patients, despite the mixed signals from the U.S. Health Department on whether or not they would ultimately recommend the COVID-19 and other vaccines.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-1351333811.jpg,,,2025-10-07 14:58:09.182976

More than 40,000 votes were cast across multiple rounds that led to Monday’s reveal of the 2025 winner of the “Coolest Thing Made in Nebraska” competition: the AF Series Combines, produced in the Case IH plant in Grand Island. 
Case IH representatives called the AF series their company’s most powerful machines, able to cover more acres in less time with the power and efficiency to handle any crop conditions. Designed, engineered and built by farmers, the combines were said to be packed with the latest in automation and harvesting technology.

The champion was announced during the Chamber’s Manufacturing Summit in La Vista. Pinnacle Bank market president Chris Conrad made the presentation, culminating a monthslong, bracket-style contest that has become an increasingly popular part of a month aimed at recognizing the state’s manufacturing industry. 
Grand Island joined cities of Lincoln, Columbus and Valley as host cities of Coolest Thing winners. 
“Manufacturing isn’t just about making things — it’s about driving innovation, supporting growth and employing over 100,000 Nebraskans who do the work every day,” Conrad said of the award.
Dustin Alexander of Case IH said the recognition highlights his team’s innovation and hard work. He called the AF Series a cutting-edge lineup of harvesting machines engineered for global performance.
“These combines can handle more than 180 crop types, making them a trusted solution for farmers in diverse agricultural landscapes around the world,” he said.
Search is on for fourth annual ‘Coolest Thing Made in Nebraska’ 

The contest kicked off in July. A statewide panel of business and nonprofit leaders picked 16 products from among a larger pool of nomination entries, and then public voting began in August to narrow the field to a final winner.
All 16 products were invited to showcase their wares at the summit, which coincided with National Manufacturing Month in October. 
Last year, the Coolest Thing top honor went to Valley Irrigation’s center pivot irrigation machine. The year before that, the winner was Rocket Mobility’s all-terrain tracked wheelchair made in Columbus.
In 2022, the inaugural winner was Kawasaki’s subway car built in Lincoln to run on the rail tracks of New York City.
Also Monday, Lindsay Corp. was named Nebraska “Manufacturer of the Year” by the Chamber.

The award recognizes a company in the state that “pushes boundaries in manufacturing and enhances Nebraska’s competitiveness,” said Todd Bingham, chamber president and CEO.
“Being a global company, Lindsay Corporation still prioritizes its Nebraska roots,” he said of the company that started in 1955 as a farm equipment business in Lindsay, Nebraska.
“Whether it’s helping farmers conserve water through smart irrigation or protecting lives on the road with our infrastructure products, Lindsay is proud to make a positive impact here in Nebraska and globally,” said Rich Harold, Lindsay’s senior vice president of global operations.

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)Voices from South Dakota’s Legislature, judiciary, schools, law enforcement, mental health, tribal health and nonprofit spheres will pick up and carry on a conversation about rehabilitation and recidivism that began with a lawmaker-led summer study this year. 
Unlike that summer study group, whose members twice met to take testimony on repeat offenses and potential responses to them, the Correctional Rehabilitation Task Force is empowered with the authority to hire consultants to study the issue.
Governor Larry Rhoden established the task force through an executive order on Sept. 23. He signed the order on camera, surrounded by lawmakers and reporters, just moments after signing a bill authorizing the state to begin work on a new 1,500-bed, $650 million men’s prison in northeast Sioux Falls.
South Dakota lawmakers approve $650 million prison construction project in Sioux Falls

His office released the list of task force members on Tuesday. Among them is Rep. Greg Jamison, R-Sioux Falls, who co-led the summer study on rehabilitation.
Instead of producing a final report with findings from that group, Jamison said, the plan is to pass along the information gathered so far to the new task force at its first meeting later this month. 
“The idea is to hand our baton off to them so the new task force can finish it,” Jamison said.
Lt. Gov. Tony Venhuizen, who will lead the task force, confirmed in an email to South Dakota Searchlight that he aims to “find a way to coordinate our work with the summer study,” and that the details and dates for meetings are in the works.
From Jamison’s perspective, the new group’s membership across the executive, judicial and legislative branches and its inclusion of voices from outside the government means a wider range of institutional knowledge. The summer study group and the Project Prison Reset task force that voted to recommend the prison plan both heard from inmates and family members who asked for the inclusion of their perspectives.
Erik Bringswhite will offer a line to that community on the new task force. Bringswhite is founder and leader of a Rapid City-based nonprofit called I Am Legacy to help those returning to their communities from prison.

Bringswhite spent time in federal prison in the early 2000s, and others who work for or volunteer with his group have similar experiences. There are many barriers to reintegration, Bringswhite said, from housing to employment to things as simple – to those who’ve never been incarcerated, anyway – as getting an ID card or setting up appointments for medication.
“We know what that looks like and where those services are provided,” Bringswhite said.
The group has four reentry outreach workers to help on that side, and another four “violence interruptors” who aim to intervene in situations before a felony arrest might occur.
He’d like to see closer collaboration between law enforcement and nonprofits like his on the front end, because “incarceration isn’t strengthening our country.” 
“I’m hoping that this correctional rehabilitation task force is here to disrupt the cycle,” Bringswhite said.
On the day Rhoden announced the task force’s membership, Stateline published a story on incarceration, based on Bureau of Justice Statistics data from fiscal year 2023. It showed a nationwide increase in imprisonment over 2022, and that South Dakota had the third-highest increase in imprisonment during that time frame, behind Maine and New Mexico.
That data put South Dakota’s federal and state prison population at 3,764. As of Sept. 30 of this year, the South Dakota Department of Corrections was housing 3,839 inmates. The Federal Prison Camp at Yankton, the state’s only federal prison facility, listed a population of 495 on its website as of Tuesday.

(Photo by Alex Brandon - Pool/Getty Images)A new program touted to give $50 billion in federal funding to rural hospitals won’t necessarily keep rural hospitals from closing, according to several experts in rural health.
The funding is part of a compromise made in Congress to help rural communities after H.R. 1, the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” now being rebranded as the “Working Families Tax Cuts Law,” eliminated more than $911 billion from Medicaid. At the time, opponents to the bill argued it would hurt rural hospitals and force many already at risk to close.
In July, Congress members argued the compromise — $50 billion in temporary funding — would be a solution to ensure that rural communities have the funding they need to access care. Critics now say the funding won’t help rural hospitals stay open and won’t come close to the amount of money they will lose.
Because of the cuts from the Trump tax-cut plan, federal Medicaid spending in rural areas is expected to drop by $155 billion over 10 years, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, or about $15.5 billion per year. The Rural Health Transformation Program will provide $50 billion over five years to help offset those losses, or about $10 billion per year. Many industry experts say that’s not enough.
“Fifty billion dollars over five years does not equate to $155 billion over 10 years,” Alan Morgan, president and CEO of the National Rural Health Association, said in an interview with the Daily Yonder.
“This particular issue was almost a shell game aspect of the legislation. It was put into the bill recognizing that rural hospitals could potentially close. The whole discussion on Capitol Hill was about ‘We’ve got to keep rural hospitals open.’ But the legislation itself specifically says (RHTP funds) cannot be used as an offset for Medicaid. And the administration in multiple avenues has specifically said this cannot be used to keep rural hospitals open, period.”
In fact, the legislation is quite clear. The $50 billion will be allocated to qualifying states, which can then disburse them, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Half of the funding each year will be distributed evenly between states that qualify for the funding, and half will be provided proportionally to states that show the greatest need.
First, that means that $25 billion per year will be split evenly between the states. So, Connecticut, with four rural hospitals, two of which are at risk of closing, would get the same amount as Kentucky, with more than 60 rural hospitals, 35 of which are at risk of closing. And that’s if either of the states qualifies.
To qualify, states would have to present a “rural health transformation plan” that outlines how the state plans to improve health care access and outcomes, prioritize the use of new technologies, initiate collaboration between rural health care providers, improve the rural workforce pipeline, and outline strategies for the long-term financial solvency of rural hospitals while identifying risk factors for rural hospital closures.
Additionally, if a state is selected to receive funding, it will also be assessed for additional funding based on its population, the number of rural health facilities it has, and the situation of the hospitals in the state to receive additional funds. Those additional funds would also be allocated based on “how well state applications align with program strategic goals,” according to a statement provided by the HHS. Those goals include – “Making Rural America healthy again and supporting rural health initiatives to promote preventative health and address the root causes of diseases”, among others.
“They are pushing this legislation to be used to improve the health of communities. They’re talking about improving veterans’ care and improving emergency medical services. It’s the whole ‘Make America Healthy Again,’ preventive services. And that’s all great. At NRHA, we support that. We love the fact that we are focusing on the rural community,” Morgan said.
“But you can see there’s a huge disconnect here. The $50 billion cannot by legislation (and is not by the administration) going to be used to help rural hospitals keep their doors open. This $50 billion is about sustaining healthcare for the future. It has nothing to do with maintaining access today.”
For its part, HHS said the funding was intended to help rural communities in the long run, not provide just short-term solutions.
A spokesperson for the department wrote in an email to the Daily Yonder that the program is designed as a “catalytic investment” to support reforms and innovations that would strengthen rural health care systems beyond the life of the program.
“The Rural Health Transformation Program is designed as a catalytic investment,” the statement said. “The goal is to support reforms and innovations that strengthen rural health care systems — including hospitals, clinics, and providers — beyond the life of the program, creating models that are sustainable and better serve their communities in the long-term.”
Jason Griffin, managing director of digital health strategy and cybersecurity at Nordic Global, a healthcare staffing and technology solutions company, said what it all means and how it will all play out is still up in the air.
“I think we’re all still trying to figure that out, to be quite frank,” Griffin said in an interview with the Daily Yonder. “There’s a lot that foundationally could happen with those funds. Infrastructure is going to be key. I’m still hearing from organizations that just stable access to the internet is a problem. I’m hoping that’s where these funds go first — to attract and retain staff and establish a foundational infrastructure.”
Still, states aren’t even sure how to qualify for the funding, he said.
“There was no clear criteria for approval,” Griffin said. “That’s what makes me nervous, is that, in our political climate, we don’t start to pick and choose our favorites. I would hope that gets cleared up pretty quickly.”
The American Hospital Association (AHA) asked for as much in a letter to HHS in August.
As part of a letter to Mehmet Oz, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services administrator, on August 11, 2025, the AHA asked that the RHTP funding prioritize payments to rural hospitals, as well as using the funds on workforce development and for infrastructure and telehealth services.
“Aging rural hospital infrastructure is a pressing challenge that threatens the quality and availability of health care in many communities,” the AHA wrote.. “Most rural hospitals were constructed decades ago, often with funding from now-outdated federal initiatives like the Hill-Burton Act, and their physical plans have not kept pace with modern standards. Several are in need of significant maintenance, renovation, or even complete replacement, but rural hospitals face unique difficulties accessing capital for such investments since they operate on narrow or negative margins and are frequently excluded from traditional lending markets.” 
“Moreover, rural hospitals have emerged as leaders in advancing telehealth and remote patient monitoring technologies that bring care closer to patients’ homes,” the AHA letter continued.
“These innovations not only expand the reach of skilled clinicians but also reduce unnecessary hospital admissions, improve patient satisfaction and help patients maintain better health outcomes in their own communities. With additional funding, more hospitals could invest in telehealth and digital health infrastructure to ensure that even those in the most remote areas receive timely, high-quality, and convenient care.”
Still, Oz, and HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., said the money in the RHTP will change rural health for the better.
“This program is a historic investment that will catalyze needed change in rural health systems and improve lives for generations to come,” Oz said in a press release. “For too long, when it comes to health care access and infrastructure, we’ve left behind the backbone of America. That stops now with this program that will spark real change for rural health care.”
Applications from states for the funding are due on November 5, with announcements regarding which states have been awarded funding expected on December 31, 2025.

Great Stuff Savvy Resale & Home isn’t your typical resale shop
WILMINGTON — Shoppers, supporters, and survivors are invited to celebrate the grand reopening of Great Stuff Savvy Resale & Home this Friday, Oct. 10, from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. at the Talleyville Shopping Center on Concord Pike and Silverside Road.
The event marks a major milestone for one of Delaware’s most beloved, mission-driven boutiques — the official debut of a newly expanded retail space that doubles the store’s size and strengthens its role as a lifeline for breast cancer patients and their families, supported by the Delaware Breast Cancer Coalition (DBCC).
Guests can browse designer fashion, unique home décor, and vintage finds while enjoying light refreshments and reconnecting with the volunteers and survivors who have made Great Stuff a symbol of hope and resilience.
A Mission Born of Hope
Great Stuff Savvy Resale & Home isn’t your typical resale shop. Since opening in 2010, it has served as a financial engine for DBCC, helping fund free mammograms, survivor mentoring, and education programs across Delaware.
Every gently used blouse, handbag, or lamp sold supports DBCC’s mission to empower women through early detection, access to treatment, and compassionate care. Because all merchandise is donated, nearly every dollar from sales goes directly into programs that save and change lives.
Over the past 15 years, the stores — Great Stuff Savvy Resale and its sister shop, Great Stuff Home — have raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for DBCC. Together, they’ve built a loyal following of shoppers, donors, and volunteers who see every purchase as a small act of love.
The Pandemic Setback and the Community Comeback
When the pandemic forced retail closures in 2020, Great Stuff’s future was uncertain. The announcement of its permanent closure felt like the end of an era — and a devastating loss for DBCC’s funding stream.
But the community refused to let it happen. Loyal patrons, volunteers, and breast cancer survivors rallied to save the store, pouring in donations, advocacy, and heart. Within months, the shop reopened — not as a business comeback story, but as a symbol of how compassion and determination can triumph over hardship.
Why It Matters to Breast Cancer Patients and Families
The impact of Great Stuff extends far beyond its racks and displays. For breast cancer patients, survivors, and their families, the shop represents hope in very real, tangible ways.

Financial Relief:Proceeds help fund DBCC’s financial-navigation program, which connects patients to resources that offset medical bills, transportation to treatments, and essential living costs — easing the economic strain that often follows a diagnosis.
Emotional Support:Revenue from Great Stuff also sustains DBCC’s Peer Mentor program, which pairs newly diagnosed patients with survivors who offer empathy, guidance, and reassurance. For many, it’s the first time they speak with someone who truly understands what they’re feeling.
Education and Outreach:Funds raised in the store enable DBCC to deliver free mammogram screenings, bilingual education materials, and workshops throughout Delaware, especially in underserved communities where access to care remains a challenge.
Healing Through Service:For many volunteers — survivors, family members, and caregivers — working in the shop is a form of therapy. Sorting donations, styling displays, or simply chatting with customers gives them a sense of purpose and peace.

“It’s a circle of compassion,” said Vicky Cooke, executive director of DBCC. “Someone donates an item out of kindness, someone else buys it because it’s beautiful, and a woman in Delaware receives help when she needs it most. That’s the power of Great Stuff.”
A Double Dose of Hope
Now, five years after nearly closing its doors, Great Stuff is thriving again — expanding into the neighboring space to nearly double its footprint. The new layout offers more room for donations, merchandise, and community events like private “Sip & Shop” evenings that connect shoppers with DBCC’s mission in an engaging way.
“This expansion is more than square footage,” said Cooke. “It’s proof that this community believes in what Great Stuff stands for — hope, healing, and helping others.”

The PED submitted a 70-page remedial plan for providing at-risk New Mexico students with an equitable education over the next three years to the First Judicial District Court, meeting the Oct. 1 deadline set by District Court Judge Matthew Wilson earlier this year. The court previously identified at-risk students at those with disabilities, from low-income families, English language learners and Native American students. 
However, plaintiffs in the case and other advocacy organizations state they are disappointed in the draft, claiming the wording is too vague and doesn’t include enough details and metrics. The New Mexico Center on Law and Poverty, which represents the lead plaintiffs in the case, also said in a news release it is concerned that comments from stakeholders and members of the public are not adequately represented in the plan.
“A lot of effort went into providing very specific stakeholder input. Not just in this last round of stakeholder input, but over some years of trying to assist the state with this task,” Laurel Nesbitt, senior attorney for Disability Rights New Mexico, told Source NM. “The elements of the plan, they are so generally worded that the only way to make real sense of them and to get anything meaningful out of these elements is to try to fill in the blanks with one’s own hopes about what the language could mean.”
Nesbitt pointed to one component of the plan addressing “high-quality, inclusive education with sufficient supports” for students with disabilities. The plan first highlights the need for the state Legislature to permanently establish the Office of Special Education within the PED. The office was created in 2023 through an executive order signed by Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham. The first step also states that training, resources and accountability are needed for special education. Nesbitt questioned who would receive the training and what the training and resources would look like.
“That is just making official an office that already exists,” Nesbitt said. “And there’s no indication in there about what that would mean in terms of the office…Is there going to be greater capacity? Is there going to be greater expertise within the office?  Is there anything substantive about that that’s going to lead to positive change for students with disabilities?” 
The plan goes on to state that between July 1, 2026 and June 30, 2027, the PED and the Early Childhood Education and Care Department will expand efforts to comply with the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act by quickly identifying and evaluating students with disabilities; providing adequate services; reducing restraint and seclusion and disciplinary removals; increasing parent participation in the Individualized Education Program (IEP) process and college or career transitions. 
“In and of itself, that is not a comprehensive list, but that list includes general thoughts, general ideas that were contributed,” Nesbitt said. “It’s a list that includes elements that are important, but each one of those elements in that list should have its own plan.”
She told Source that the draft plan is riddled with such examples of components that need further expansion, details of action and metrics, not only for students with disabilities, but for all at-risk students. 
“It’s disappointing, but it kind of goes beyond disappointing to being kind of offensive that students with disabilities would need to wait, first, for an entire year for the passage of legislation, which may or may not pass,” Nesbitt told Source. “Not to mention the fact that these are already activities that are required by IDEA for the state to do…whether the [Office of Special Education] exists or not.”
She told Source that she only sees stakeholder input included in the draft in a general sense, such as identifying areas of action, but she said the plan does not include “concrete” steps to address or improve these areas. She said there are not enough details about training, for example, to see if they were heard by the PED.
Nesbitt added that stakeholder engagement has been happening for many years, not just over the summer since the court ordered the remedial plan. “And it’s not clear that any of that is really captured in the plan,” she said. 
Source reached out several times to the PED for comment, but did not receive a response.
Wilhelmina Yazzie (Diné), one of the lead plaintiffs in the case, who has been involved for over 10 years, told Source that she was disappointed that the PED’s draft plan did not include the nine components her legal team outlined earlier this year.  
“I just feel like it’s just the same…old process that has been taking place over and over,” Yazzie told Source. She said she and other advocates promoted the community input session that were held over the summer months, assuring people that their voices mattered. “They take time out, they drive out here to these sessions and…it’s so disappointing that I just feel like those still have been dismissed.”
The PED is asking for the public to provide feedback on the draft plan online through Oct. 17. The department then has until Nov. 3 to provide a final draft to the court, after which the plaintiffs can file formal objections to the plan.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Wilhelmina-Yazzie_DP-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-07 13:57:54.442787

(Photo by Kirsten Strough/USDA)A shortage in rural veterinary care for big animals across New Mexico raises the risk for animal disease outbreaks and food safety threats according to agriculture officials, but the state is hoping to take the sting out of carrying hundreds of thousands in school loans to try to shore up the workforce.
The state higher education department is putting the call out to veterinarians with bovine, porcine or poultry patients to apply for up to $80,000 for veterinary loan repayments, in exchange for four years of work in New Mexico.
“Many New Mexicans, especially in rural areas, lack access to veterinary care,” Higher Education Secretary Stephanie Rodriguez said in a statement. “This program helps fill that gap while supporting livestock health, food production, and rural communities statewide.”
The program comes via Senate Bill 8, passed by lawmakers and signed by Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham earlier this year. The law provides $1.55 million for the state’s higher education department to offer debt relief directly to veterinarians who practice on livestock animals. On average, the cost of attending school often totals $200,000 or more, according to a fiscal analysis report. 
“We’re expected to award 10 veterinarians for the program in the first year,” Higher Education Communications Director Auriella Ortiz told Source NM. Ortiz said the department would request additional funding to add new awards in coming years. Applications for 2025 will be accepted through Nov. 1.
Ortiz said that 15 counties are considered “in need of food animal veterinarian care,” by the committee reviewing the applications. Those include the counties of  Bernalillo, Catron, Chaves, Cibola, Doña Ana, Grant, Hidalgo, Lea, Luna, McKinley, Rio Arriba, Sandoval, San Juan, San Miguel and the northern portion of Santa Fe.
Samantha Holeck, the New Mexico state veterinarian, told Source NM in a phone call the program is needed to retain and recruit people to do the work of examining cows, sheep and pigs — noting that it’s often smaller salaries, long hours and commutes compared to veterinarian work in cities.
“If you’re working in a rural community, a 30 to 40 hour workweek, that’s not realistic,” Holeck said. “You’re going to be working long hours and you’re gonna be taking emergencies and you just can’t generate the type of income that a corporate practice would make.”
In reports to lawmakers during the January session, the New Mexico Department of Agriculture wrote the “shortage heightens concerns for a number of risks, including food safety threats, animal disease outbreaks, the potential risk of zoonotic diseases, and decreasing rural economic growth,” and noted the emergence of avian influenza in dairy cows for the first time.
Holeck said there’s no prohibition on the type of animals the vets treat, but noted a percentage of what they do needs to be food-animal oriented.
“If they’re in a rural community, for example, where they’re the only veterinarian they don’t have to turn away the dogs, cats and horses,” Holeck said. “They just need to demonstrate that they are providing a service to those livestock animals in that area.”

Sanders declares vacancy to replace Arkansas Rep. Carlton Wing, now Arkansas PBS CEO

Republican Party of Arkansas Communications Director Maya Harvey said Tuesday morning that the GOP had no announcement at this time. 
The special election’s winner will replace Rep. Carlton Wing who vacated his seat last week to become Arkansas PBS’ new CEO and executive director. The agency’s governing board recommended the North Little Rock Republican for the job on Sept. 17, and he had to resign from the Legislature to accept the appointment. 
Wing, who served five terms in the Arkansas House, is a former broadcaster and owns a production company with his wife. The Arkansas PBS Commission approved an annual salary of $206,000 for Wing on Sept. 26. 
Bo Renshaw, a business owner and physical therapist, has announced his intention to seek the Republican nomination for House District 70 . Two candidates are seeking the Democratic nomination so far — Cordelia Smith-Johnson and Alex Holladay. Smith-Johnson is a U.S. Air Force veteran and prevention coordinator for the Arkansas Army National Guard. Holladay is a health care professional who lost to Wing in the 2024 general election.
Arkansas Democratic Party Chair retired Col. Marcus Jones noted in a press release that District 70 was “the most closely contested” House race in the 2024 general election, with Wing defeating Halladay by just 286 votes. 
“Given that Democrats have overperformed by 18% in Special Elections since Trump took office, we feel confident that we can deliver another seat for Democrats in our State House,” Jones said. “We’re looking forward to letting voters in House District 70 decide in both the primary and the general election. And to Gov. Sanders, let’s make sure that we schedule the general election within 150 days this time.”
Daughter of deceased Arkansas state senator calls for an election sooner than later

State law requires a governor to call a special election to fill a vacant legislative seat within 150 days, unless it’s impractical or too burdensome to do so. Sanders received bipartisan pushback last week for scheduling a special election in November 2026 to fill the Senate District 26 seat left vacant when Branch Republican Sen. Gary Stubblefield died in September.
Sanders revised the general election date to June 9 after receiving criticism that delaying the general election until November would leave District 26 voters without representation for more than a year. Republican lawmakers and Stubblefield’s daughter continued to criticize the new election date for leaving district residents without representation during next year’s fiscal session. During the session, which starts in April, lawmakers are expected to consider approving funding for construction of a prison in Franklin County, a project that has been controversial among elected officials and local residents. 
Stubblefield, whose family has land located near the proposed prison site, was a staunch proponent of the project. The late state senator was also one of a handful of legislators who blocked a $750 million prison appropriation bill from advancing out of the Senate during the legislative session this spring.

Oct. 6, 2025 | ScreenshotLocal leaders, public health groups, and student athletes met Monday at The Corner Ballpark, the former Tiger Stadium, to support a new rule that would ban smokeless tobacco in Detroit’s professional stadiums.
The event, called “Knock Tobacco Out of the Park,” is part of a national effort to protect kids and send a clear message that tobacco doesn’t belong in sports.
Speakers included Minou Jones from the Detroit Wayne Oakland Tobacco-Free Coalition, Kevin O’Flaherty from the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, Detroit City Councilman Fred Durhal, Pershing High School baseball players, and several health experts. Among the topics discussed were the harm caused by products like tobacco chew and dip and how seeing players use them can influence kids to start.
Jones said this issue is both professional and personal for her.

“Tobacco is the number one preventable cause of death and disease in the United States,” she said in an interview. “In Michigan, we lose over 16,000 people every year to tobacco. I lost my father to COPD [chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]. He was a huge sports fan, but he started using tobacco when he was a kid. Most smokers and vape users start when they’re young.”
When asked what she’d say to young people who already use tobacco, Jones added there are healthier ways to cope.
“A lot of youth go through stress like adults, and we need to help them handle it in better ways. Tobacco leads to so many health problems. My message is simple: don’t let the devil hook you. Nicotine is more addictive than crack cocaine or heroin — and just because it’s legal doesn’t mean it’s good for you.” Jones said.
Right now, many stadiums already ban cigarettes and cigars, but not smokeless tobacco. If passed, Detroit’s new rule would fix that and make the city one of about 18 with full smokeless-tobacco bans in Major League Baseball stadiums.
Supporters said this change would help protect players, fans, and especially young athletes from addiction and health problems. Councilman Durhal said the city has a chance to set a strong example for the next generation.
The Detroit City Council is expected to vote on the proposal soon, after Durhal said the Public Health & Safety Committee passed the proposed ordinance, moving it forward to a public hearing.

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced recently that the Medals of Honor awarded to U.S. soldiers for their actions at Wounded Knee Creek on Dec. 29, 1890, will not be rescinded.
His decision was based on the October 2024 recommendation of a five-member special review panel that voted 3-2 for the medals to be retained. At that time, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin did not announce the panel’s vote or his decision.
Hegseth, in announcing his decision, said, “This decision is now final,” and said of the soldiers, “their place in our nation’s history is no longer up for debate.”
Hegseth’s decision may indeed be his final one, but his proclamation that the medals will never be rescinded betrays a lack of awareness of how fast attitudes can change. As Defense secretary, he can essentially prevent the medals from being rescinded during his tenure. But his decision is not binding on future secretaries or presidents. His undoing of decisions by his predecessors, such as their removal of Confederate statues, illustrates the temporary nature of such decisions.
Focus on individual conduct instead of massacre doomed Wounded Knee medals review, panelist says

Public debate on this issue is entirely beyond the control of Hegseth or any future Defense secretary. People will continue to uncover new evidence and propose different interpretations.
Here are some facts we have so far.
When the Department of Defense created the review panel last year, it said there were “approximately 20” Medals of Honor awarded. There is disagreement in historical sources about the exact number, because records associated with some medals are incomplete or unclear.
Thirty-four members of the Army’s Seventh Cavalry, plus one member of the Hospital Corps, died at Wounded Knee Creek or later from wounds suffered there, according to the book “Surviving Wounded Knee” by David Grua. It’s likely that many of them were killed by friendly fire because of how the commanding officer arranged the troops.
The U.S. side consisted of soldiers. The Lakotan side consisted of men, women and children who constituted a village in transit from the Cheyenne River Reservation to the Pine Ridge Reservation. Their leader, Spotted Elk (also known as Big Foot), was gravely ill.
U.S. soldiers separated the men from the women and children. Then the men were surrounded and disarmed. The women, in their lodges, were searched and disarmed.
A deaf Lakotan’s rifle accidentally discharged while soldiers were trying to take it from him. No one was hit by the bullet. In response, the U.S. soldiers fired their rifles at the men, and the Hotchkiss guns atop the adjacent hill were fired indiscriminately into the village.
U.S. soldiers killed children, women and men, even miles from the village. The Hotchkiss guns were relocated several times to fire on Lakotans sheltering in a twisted gully. U.S. soldiers continued shooting until sundown, then left Wounded Knee and returned to Pine Ridge Agency with wounded soldiers and Lakotans.
A blizzard blew in with snow and freezing temperatures on the afternoon of Dec. 31 and raged into the night. The next morning, New Year’s Day, Dakotan physician Charles Eastman asked for and received permission to return to Wounded Knee with about 100 men, including two photographers, to search for survivors. They found 11 children, women and men, who they took back to Pine Ridge.
Civilian contractors were hired by the U.S. government to bury the Lakotan bodies they could find on Jan. 3 and 4, 1891. They were paid $2 per body. For this reason, we know that they buried 18 children, 44 women and 84 men. They dug a 5-foot-deep, 6-foot-wide and 72-foot-long trench atop the hill where the Hotchkiss guns originally were located. The bodies were thrown into the trench and tramped down. The mass grave was left unmarked.
The names of the persons buried in the trench grave are not known. Survivors of the massacre recalled the names of nearly 200 missing persons. But how many of these include the 146 people buried in the grave is unknown.
On Oct. 25, 1990, the U.S. Congress issued a joint resolution expressing its “deep regret on behalf of the United States” for the Wounded Knee Massacre, and expressed its “commitment to acknowledge and learn from our history, including the Wounded Knee Massacre, in order to provide a proper foundation for building an ever more humane, enlightened, and just society for the future.”
In contrast, Secretary Hegseth appears determined to do exactly the opposite.

(Photo by Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)Virginia’s bipartisan Joint Commission to Oversee Transition of the Commonwealth into a Retail Cannabis Market spent Monday afternoon plowing through several dense presentations that, taken together, underscored the stakes of moving from legalization on paper to a functioning, regulated marketplace in the real world. 
With retail sales still blocked after Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s 2025 vetoes, speakers pressed commissioners to leverage Virginia’s medical system, clamp down on illicit storefronts, and design rules that avoid corporate capture and keep wealth — and safety — inside the state. 
The meeting at Richmond’s state Capitol built on earlier sessions in July and August as the commission readies recommendations for the 2026 session. Background from those hearings and the state’s maturing medical market framed Monday’s debate.
Virginia’s seed-to-sale tracking via Metrc is now live; patients report stronger oversight but still worry about access and affordability. Lawmakers have publicly weighed a 2026 start date if a retail bill can clear the governor’s desk.
 Strong medical framework, but bad labeling and delivery gaps

JM Pedini, executive director of the Virginia chapter of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML), told lawmakers that the commonwealth “is already regulating cannabis,” tracing a decade-long buildout from the 2015 launch of tightly controlled “pharmaceutical processors” to today’s vertically integrated medical operators with pharmacist consultations at the counter. 
“Our program requires pharmacists … that is a serious added value that most medical cannabis programs in the nation do not have,” Pedini said, arguing Virginia’s consumer-safety regime — third-party testing, PMP reporting and recent adoption of Metrc — is among the nation’s strictest.
Pedini asked the commission to fix the code holes created when a bipartisan “boring, technical” operations bill was vetoed, leaving outdated percentage-based labeling rules for edibles and topicals and no clear legal definition for “delivery agents.” 
“We will need to address this in 2026,” Pedini said, noting that patients need milligrams-per-dose front and center, as with Tylenol, not hard-to-parse percentages. Pedini added that medical dispensaries are secure, ID-gated spaces — “very nice, but also very boring” — and that clearer statewide language would help patients shopping online avoid allergens and dosing confusion.
The comments track with recent reporting that Virginia’s medical program is generating significant sales while tightening oversight through Metrc, even as patients flag affordability and access concerns — the very frictions that clean labeling and delivery rules could ease. 
 Clarity and patient safeguards remain crucial

Policy strategist Ngiste Abebe of the KND Group argued the key question is no longer if Virginia legalizes retail, but how — and warned that today’s half-legal landscape invites confusion and crime. 
She urged the state to apply routine consumer-protection tools  such as truth-in-advertising and label accuracy, consider a state-issued decal to distinguish licensed shops and rethink local opt-outs that strand large populations far from legal stores while illicit delivery fills the void. 
Citing California and New York, Abebe said broad local bans have made enforcement harder and squeezed licensees into a smaller map, driving up rents and limiting competition.
On patient access, Abebe pushed back on the idea that adult recreational use cannibalizes medical programs. During Massachusetts’ pandemic shutdown of recreational sales, medical registrations surged, she noted; many adult-use consumers still seek help for insomnia, pain and anxiety, making co-located medical/adult-use dispensaries valuable for both cost and counseling. 
Abebe recommended protecting pediatric access, prohibiting separate “certification fees” in health care settings, and studying paths to insurance reimbursement — an affordability frontier other states have begun to test via workers’ compensation.
Her message dovetails with Virginia’s recent commission hearings, which emphasized learning from neighboring Maryland’s rapid 2023 rollout and New York’s slower equity-driven approach — two models commission members have studied since July. 
 Corporate dominance looms over market design

Cannabis operator-turned-analyst Max Jackson warned that giving medical incumbents an automatic head start is a policy choice with predictable outcomes: concentrated ownership, higher prices and a stubborn illicit market. 
He contrasted “Path A,” a limited-license model seen in states like Illinois and Arizona, with a competitive phased rollout designed to seed many independent businesses from day one. In his telling, multistate operators openly tell investors they target oligopolistic environments — and Virginia’s vertically integrated medical structure already mirrors the “walled garden” some companies prefer.
Jackson pointed to bottlenecks and high prices where processing or retail licenses were scarce at launch, arguing that expensive legal cannabis simply can’t displace illicit sales. 
“Arizona is perhaps the most direct example of regulatory capture,” Jackson said. “The incumbent’s own industry association was responsible for both bankrolling the campaign and drafting the language of the law itself. Then they launched sales in a record 79 days — a timeline that was logistically impossible for any new business to meet.”
Jackson advised lawmakers to separate medical incumbency from adult-use market power, curb vertical integration and time the rollout so new cultivators can get product to shelves.
Those warnings echo national reporting around Virginia’s stalled retail push. Supporters say equity and small business should be central, while opponents, including Youngkin, cite public health and safety risks and argue retail won’t kill the illegal market. 
 Lab tests expose risks in unregulated market

VCU forensic toxicologist and Cannabis Control Authority (CCA) board member Dr. Michelle Peace presented early results from “surveillance shopping” across Virginia’s health districts, building on a completed sweep in Washington, D.C. 
Peace told the panel that her team has begun visiting “clubs,” vape shops and head shops marketing themselves as “dispensaries” — a term she said misleads consumers into assuming regulated, tested products. 
In multiple visits, she reported lax ID checks, cash-only ATMs, staff giving “patently false” pharmacological advice, unlabeled vapes, and even a store requiring a customer to “take a hit” to try the product before leaving because returns weren’t allowed.
Back in the lab, untargeted and targeted analyses found products widely off-label, with many lacking any label at all. 
Microbiological plates showed thriving mold and, in one “freebie” sample, coliform “indicative of fecal contamination.” A vape purchased as “Farm Bill compliant” tested at roughly 30% delta-8 THC and about 4% delta-9 THC; others contained purely synthetic cannabinoids with little known about toxicology. 
Peace also described Virginia-code-defying THCA flower marketed as “legal,” and an adverse-event case where a pre-roll later tested with heavy microbial loads after a consumer suffered seizures at a concert.
Peace cautioned that until the state draws bright lines around licensing and labeling — and clarifies total-THC calculations already in code — consumers will be exposed to products that are mislabeled, adulterated or contaminated. That finding echoes commission testimony in August and broader coverage of Virginia’s muddled gray market amid continued retail delays.
 What comes next

At its upcoming meeting in December, the commission is expected to translate these themes — consumer protection, medical-program integrity, competitive market architecture and illicit-market enforcement — into legislation text for the 2026 legislative session. 
If lawmakers again send a retail framework to a newly elected governor, they’ll do so with fresh data, including the medical market’s performance under Metrc, fiscal estimates showing hundreds of millions in potential revenue over time and a growing record from other states on how design choices affect prices, equity and safety.

(Photo courtesy of Des Moines Public Schools)The lesson of the hot stove emerged again last week.
That is the lesson toddlers learn early and smart ones retain for a lifetime. Touch something hot and you know not to touch it again.
Educator Ian Roberts delivered a new rendition of the lesson over the past fortnight. Time will tell whether government officials take to heart the learning moment offered by the Roberts train wreck.
You may recall how Des Moines Public Schools officials effusively welcomed Roberts to Des Moines in the summer of 2023. He quickly impressed state officials, parents and their kids, and his bosses, with his charisma, enthusiasm, a can-do message and foot races with kids.
Roberts also knew how to write a convincing resume — with its references to impressive awards and honors, and a Ph.D. dissertation titled “Teachers and School Leaders’ Perspectives on the Efficacy of Culturally Responsive Inclusion and Self-Contained Settings.”
What the public did not know at the time — and what the school board should have learned had it done its homework — has grabbed the nation’s attention: Roberts lacked immigration eligibility to work in the United States.
Accompanying him to Des Moines were enough half-truths and outright lies to make Pinocchio take notice. So many that the executive recruitment and screening company that vouched for him now stands embarrassed by facts learned since U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents jailed him on Sept. 26 after pursuing him in his school vehicle and then on foot.
The superintendent formerly known as Dr. Roberts now awaits deportation to Guyana, where he was born and grew up. There is little chance he will be able to pack his flashy track shoes or his collection of guns before he goes.
Meantime, Des Moines school board members will not see calls for accountability and change disappear. They have yet to acknowledge they should have recognized the red flags about his past before hiring him two years ago. They have tried to shift blame to Roberts and the contractor hired to recruit and investigate the backgrounds of candidates for the superintendent’s job. But the school board alone acted in May to extend his contract and increase his salary.
So, continuing demands for accountability may provide a hot-stove education for the seven current members of the school board, four of whom served when Roberts was hired. At a minimum, the chaos Roberts and the search firm and the board brought to Iowa’s largest school district teaches four valuable lessons:
Lesson 1 — Trust but E-Verify
Iowa’s public-school districts and other state and local government employers, as a matter of policy, should use the federal government’s E-Verify+ system to confirm the employment eligibility under federal immigration laws.
E-Verify+ is not problem-free, but its use might help avoid a mess like that revealed after Roberts tried to outrun law officers last month.
When the Legislature convenes in January, lawmakers should consider requiring government employers in the state to use E-Verify+.
Lesson 2 — Liars seldom stop at one fib
The school board has admitted it knew before it hired Roberts that despite the claim on his resume, he did not receive a Ph.D. from Morgan State University in Maryland. True, he later “amended” his resume to show, instead, his claimed doctorate came from Trident University International, a for-profit online school.
This after-the-fact rationalization of an “error” should have tipped Des Moines school officials that all with Roberts was not as he tried to portray. In the days after his arrest, journalists also confirmed he had never received some awards and honors listed on his resume.
If journalists can substantiate these lies with a few Google searches and phone calls, surely a professional search firm like JG Consulting could have learned about these misstatements, too — especially considering how Des Moines paid the company $35,000 for short-term work supposedly enabled by its special expertise.
But rather than relying solely on outsiders to find any lies or factual errors, the school board should remember, once someone smoothly tells you a falsehood, be on the lookout for more lies that may follow. If people are willing to lie when details can be easily verified, what won’t they lie about?
Lesson 3 — The public can help inform boards
Iowa’s sunshine laws do not require governments to disclose the names of finalists for key jobs like university president, school superintendent, city manager or police chief. Nothing in the law prohibits a government body from telling applicants and the public that it will release the names and resumes of a short list of candidates before final interviews and a hiring decision.
Des Moines made such a list public when the school board hired Roberts’ predecessor, Thomas Ahart. But when hiring Roberts, the board kept the finalists’ names secret and did not identify Roberts until he was hired.
Nothing guarantees that releasing those names before the board picked Roberts would have ferreted out the phony resume claims. But it is a certainty the public cannot reveal facts about a candidate, good or bad, when the names remain secret.
Lesson 4 — Check it out
John Bremner, a legendary professor at the University of Kansas, reminded generations of journalism students, “If your mother says she loves you, check it out” — meaning journalists need to verify everything.
In the context of hiring, if a search company tells you something, check it out. If a candidate tells you something, check it out. If an anonymous tipster passes along a rumor, check it out.
Most of all, when it comes to entrusting the education and nurturing of children to a person, check the applicant out no matter how trustworthy, respectable or likeable the person seems.
You can learn these lessons by touching a hot stove that Ian Roberts just ignited or simply by watching others scorch their fingers.

“This is a pivotal time for our nation,” Kaul said in a written statement. “Some of our most basic rights are under threat. Severe cuts have been made to programs that provide opportunities and have helped communities move forward. It’s critical that we continue to have an AG who will stand up for our freedoms and the rule of law.”
Kaul was first elected to the office in 2018, when Tony Evers won his first term as governor. Both won second terms in 2022, although Kaul by a narrow margin.
After Evers announced in July that he would not seek a third term, turning the 2026 race for governor into a wide-open contest, Kaul was among the Democrats who were widely assumed would seek the nomination to succeed him. In his first press conferences after the Evers announcement, Kaul demurred when asked about his plans.
In the months since Evers said he would step aside, more than a half-dozen Democrats have announced they would campaign to be the state’s chief executive, while Kaul remained on the list of “potential” candidates.
“In Wisconsin, we’ve made meaningful progress, and we need to build on that progress,” Kaul said in his announcement statement. “As my track record shows, I’m committed to working to protect public safety and to looking out for the interests of Wisconsinites.”
 So far the Democrats who have announced they will run for the open governor’s seat include former economic development CEO Missy Hughes, Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley, state Sen. Kelda Roys (D-Madison) and state Rep. Francesca Hong (D-Madison). Milwaukee factory worker and baseball stadium beer vendor Ryan Strnad and former state Rep. Brett Hulsey.

Free.,Trump deployment of troops to Democratic states targets Illinois,Jacob Fischler,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-deployment-troops-democratic-states-targets-illinois,,"A federal judge will hear arguments Thursday in Illinois over Chicago’s lawsuit challenging President Donald Trump’s deployment of National Guard troops to the state before deciding whether to block the move, the judge wrote in an order.In a one-paragraph order, U.S. District Judge April M. Perry, whom Democratic President Joe Biden appointed to the bench, set an 11:59 p.m. Wednesday deadline for the Trump administration to respond in writing to the suit filed by the Democratic leaders of Illinois and its largest city, which they filed Monday morning. Perry did not immediately grant the restraining order Gov. JB Pritzker and Mayor Brandon Johnson sought to block the deployment at the outset of the case.Perry said she expected the federal government’s response to include evidence about when National Guard troops would arrive in Illinois, where in the state they would go and “the scope of the troops’ activities” once there. She set oral arguments for 11 a.m. Central Time on Thursday.The suit seeks to stop Trump’s federalization of Illinois National Guard and mobilization of Texas National Guard troops to the state. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, has also agreed to send Guard troops to Portland, Oregon, at Trump’s request.Pritzker and Johnson’s complaint calls the federalization of state National Guard troops “illegal, dangerous, and unconstitutional.” The Democrats added that the move was “patently pretextual and baseless,” meaning it could not satisfy the legal requirements for a president to wrest from a governor control of a state’s National Guard force.Insurrection Act cited by TrumpTrump has said the extraordinary use of troops, which raises serious legal and constitutional questions about the line between military forces and domestic law enforcement, is necessary to control crime in some Democrat-led cities, including Chicago and Portland. State and local leaders in those jurisdictions, as well as Los Angeles, have said military personnel are not needed to supplement local police. Pritzker called the proposed deployment to Chicago an “invasion.”Trump indicated Monday he may seek to further escalate the push for military involvement domestically, saying he would have no qualms about invoking the Insurrection Act, which expands presidential power to use the military for law enforcement.“We have an Insurrection Act for a reason,” he told reporters. ""If I had to enact it, I’d do that. If people were getting killed and courts were holding us up or governors or mayors were holding us up, sure, I’d do that.”Dems in Congress question raidTrump’s use of National Guard troops is in part a response to protests in Democratic cities over this administration’s crackdown on immigration enforcement.Trump has surged immigration enforcement officers to certain cities. Those agents have pursued sometimes aggressive enforcement, including a Sept. 30 raid on a Chicago apartment building that has been criticized for using military-style tactics.A group of eight U.S. House Democrats wrote Monday to Attorney General Pam Bondi and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem calling for an investigation into that raid.The members were Homeland Security Committee ranking member Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, Judiciary Committee ranking member Jamie Raskin of Maryland, J. Luis Correa of California, Pramila Jayapal of Washington, Shri Thanedar of Michigan, Mary Gay Scanlon of Pennsylvania and Delia Ramirez and Jesús “Chuy” Garcia of Illinois.“We write to express our outrage over the immigration raid,” they said. “Treating a U.S. city like a war zone is intolerable.”",,,,2025-10-07 11:58:31.814556

Outside, on a few occasions, bricks have fallen from the 130-year-old building. Built in 1897, it is Lynn’s oldest school, and one of 19 elementary schools in the district that are in similar shape.  
Every day, nearly 240 students – more than half of whom come from low-income households, and nearly 40 percent of whom are English language learners – file into the small building.

“The majority of our elementary schools don’t have art rooms, music rooms, gym spaces, or a cafetorium,” said Superintendent Evonne Alvarez, severely limiting the district’s ability to provide the kind of enrichment activities taken for granted in suburban schools.   
It’s hardly a problem unique to Lynn, the state’s fourth largest school district, with 16,000 students.  
The overcrowded and antiquated building conditions in the low-income, majority Latino school district are a testament to an inequitable state reimbursement process that disadvantages urban districts when it comes to school building projects, according to a new report by the MassINC Policy Center. (The policy center is based at MassINC, the nonprofit civic organization that also publishes CommonWealth Beacon.) 
Boston and the Gateway Cities have been significantly underrepresented in the Massachusetts School Building Authority’s Core Program, which distributes large grants to help communities build new schools or fully replace or renovate existing buildings.  
Together they make up nearly a third of all schools in Massachusetts, yet they have received less than 19 percent of invitations to the Core Program since 2015, the report says. Suburban projects accounted for 57 percent of Core Program invites, despite accounting for just 43 percent of schools in the state. 
As a result, the report says, despite efforts by the Legislature aimed at adequately funding school building projects, “students in Boston and the Gateway Cities continue to learn in buildings that are deteriorating, lacking in basic features, and often cramped and overcrowded.”

School construction projects are funded with a combination of state and local dollars through the MBSA, an independent state agency. It was formed two decades ago and charged with implementing a progressive funding formula in which state funds would cover up to 80 percent of construction costs for the lowest-income communities.  
But it often hasn’t worked out that way, according to the report.  
Not only have wealthier districts accounted for a disproportionate share of school building projects approved over the last decade, when projects in lower-income urban districts have been authorized, the state often ends up paying far less than the 80 percent share of costs laid out in the funding formula.  
The report says a big reason for that is the school building authority’s cost-control policies, which were intended to create a more accountable system for financing school projects, don’t account for many of the construction challenges unique to dense urban settings. As a result, the reimbursement formula has become “regressive rather than progressive,” according to the new report.  
The MSBA did not respond to a request for comment on the study. 
Eligible project expenses in Boston and the state’s Gateway Cities are reimbursed by the MSBA at roughly 60 percent – a rate that is, on average, nearly 20 percentage points lower than the 80-percent reimbursement rate outlined in state law. That difference can represent tens of millions of dollars amid heightened construction costs, often making extensive renovations and new school construction a pipe dream in cities lacking the economic base to pay for it.  
A Boston Globe investigation two years ago called attention to the stark racial disparities associated with the school construction aid process, but the Legislature has yet to act.  
“We’ve known that these ground rules take all the progressivity out of the statute, so there certainly could and should be legislative oversight,” said Ben Forman, research director at the MassINC Policy Center, which carried out the study in conjunction with the Worcester Regional Research Bureau.

State Sen. Jason Lewis, co-chair of the Joint Committee on Education, has introduced legislation that would establish an oversight commission to review the MSBA’s funding formulas. The Senate has passed versions of the bill several times, most recently last summer, but it has yet to be taken up by the House.  
House Speaker Ron Mariano’s office did not respond to questions about where the bill stands in his chamber. Rep. Ken Gordon, co-chair of the Education Committee, declined to comment.  
The state formula sets reimbursement rates for communities based on their ability to pay. While all districts in the state received less than the statutory reimbursement rate for projects approved between 2008 and 2015, the average reduction in Boston and the Gateway Cities was 34 and 19 percent compared to a reduction of 12 percent in suburban districts.    
That disparity, the report says, is largely due to the fact that MSBA’s cost-control efforts fall more heavily on urban districts. 
Urban districts struggle with the MSBA’s cap on how much it will reimburse per gross square foot. Construction is more expensive in congested urban communities, and having to build vertically requires more steel, elevators, and other expenses – all factors that end up leaving urban districts on the hook for more of the cost of school projects.  
Lynn needs to build at least two large elementary schools to consolidate students from their existing, dated facilities, Alvarez said. The MSBA grants percentage-point increases to the statutory reimbursement rate for newly formed regional school districts to incentivize these kinds of projects, but urban districts that want to close and consolidate schools have little financial incentive to do so.

Meanwhile, demolition costs are only reimbursed by the MSBA when replacing a school on its existing site, and many cities must consolidate schools on other land that is large enough for a bigger facility and has adequate outdoor space for more students. 
Since 2015, schools with the best building condition ratings have received nearly two-thirds of the MSBA’s Core Program invitations to help underwrite major renovations or replacement.   
The MSBA approved Core Program awards for an average of 17 projects each year between 2008 and 2024. There are 276 high-need schools in Massachusetts that have well below-average facility condition ratings or operate significantly over capacity, and 60 percent of these are in Boston or the Gateway Cities. With the current funding model and pace of 17 projects a year, the report says it would take nearly 50 years to rebuild those schools, during which time other buildings in those districts would likely deteriorate.  
Schools with low learning environment and building condition ratings – those missing essential learning features, such as auditoriums, gyms, and libraries, and those with overcrowding – were two and five times more likely to be in Boston and the Gateway Cities than elsewhere in the state, according to the report. Black, Hispanic, and low-income students are more likely to attend overcrowded schools, buildings lacking essential learning spaces, and facilities with other deficiencies.  
In Lynn, nearly 60 percent of the district’s 26 schools are missing three or more essential learning features, such as gyms and libraries, nearly 20 percent have low building condition ratings, and 15 percent are over capacity, according to the report. Despite the city’s efforts, the district has only received one Core Program invitation since 2015.  
That award will help fund a new Pickering Middle School, which is currently 109 years old. Construction is expected to be completed in just over a year, and the new facility will double capacity to alleviate overcrowding.   
“The need is so much greater than this one school, and without serious reform, we don’t have a path to be able to get to all the other schools that we need to,” said Mayor Jared Nicholson.   
At Pickering – a facility of about 540 students – violin lessons are taught in the cafeteria. There is no space for band and instrument classes, because their auditorium had to be converted into additional classroom space to alleviate overcrowding.

Lynn is home to nearly a dozen schools that are over 100 years old. In contrast to other Massachusetts districts where enrollment has been flat or even declined, its student population has increased by more than 20 percent since 2010.  
“Where are we going to physically put students?” asked Alvarez, the district superintendent.  
The city applied to the Core Program for the Pickering School project in 2018 but was initially rejected. In 2023, local leaders called attention to the MSBA’s 42 percent reimbursement rate for the newly planned project, which resulted in a change that increased the rate to just over 60 percent.   
“It’s still not 80 percent, but it was a $30 million swing, and it was the difference between being able to do this project and not,” Nicholson said. “All of our debt service capacity is going to be going to this middle school for the foreseeable future.”   
Nicholson pointed to the state’s progressive funding formula for school operating costs, an approach that was further bolstered by the Student Opportunity Act in 2019, which increased aid for districts educating a high number of low-income students, English learners, and students of color. “That same thinking is needed on the capital side, on the long-term investment in the education of the students,” he said of the school building program.   
The MassINC report recommends several steps the state can take, including increasing MSBA funding and prioritizing buildings in the worst shape, and rethinking reimbursement policies governing land acquisition and site preparation, which currently disadvantage urban districts.  
Despite the district’s building conditions, Nicholson said teachers in Lynn work miracles with what little they have. Aborn Elementary School was one of the highest performing schools in the district on the 2025 MCAS exams, and students performed better than the statewide average in all three testing areas – English language arts, math, and science.

Forman, the MassINC research director, said school building conditions are clearly a factor in statewide MCAS exam scores that consistently show large gaps in achievement between white students and students of color.   
“How about thinking about the dramatic difference between the buildings that those kids are learning in?” Forman said. “It makes a huge difference when a kid goes to a school where they don’t have a cafeteria, and their classroom is in the basement with no light, and they don’t have a chance to go to a music room, or an art room, or a gym.”

Cities like Lynn more often rely on the MSBA’s Accelerated Repair Program, which provides more modest grants for maintenance projects, because they cannot afford complete renovations or new construction and receive limited Core Program invites. Although it is one of the few resources they have, Alvarez argued that further investments in buildings that are clearly outdated is a Band-Aid solution, and an inefficient one at best.  
“That’s literally what we’ve done over the years to try to mitigate the real problem. But at some point, it’s just not sustainable,” she said. “There’s only so many times you can fix things or repaint things.”

MSBA reimbursements do not cover land acquisition costs or site remediation expenses, which is also challenging for cities. Larger parcels of land that are municipally owned are rare and often unavailable. In a former industrial city like Lynn, the cost of abating and removing hazardous materials could also kill a project. Those costs are often unpredictable and can soar after a project begins, meaning the risk falls on the municipality, Nicholson said.    
“The communities that can afford to take that on do, but the communities that don’t have that ability can’t, and then get further and further behind,” he said. “That’s the position we find ourselves in.”   
Without changes to the state funding formula, Nicholson says Lynn will continue “hitting a wall.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/outdated-class-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-07 11:58:31.814556
,DC,2025-10-07 15:14:30+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Trump floats plan to deny back pay to furloughed federal workers after shutdown,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-floats-plan-deny-back-pay-furloughed-federal-workers-after-shutdown,,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration may try to interpret a law enacted during his first term in office differently than it did following the last government shutdown, potentially denying back pay to hundreds of thousands of furloughed federal workers. The change in stance, outlined in a memo from the Office of Management and Budget that was first reported by Axios and confirmed to States Newsroom by a White House official, would drastically change the stakes of the ongoing funding lapse, which began Oct. 1. It also goes against guidance the Office of Personnel Management released in late September, which stated that after “the lapse in appropriations has ended, employees who were furloughed as the result of the lapse will receive retroactive pay for those furlough periods.”Following the 35-day shutdown during President Donald Trump’s first term, Congress approved a bill titled the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019 that guaranteed back pay for both exempt and furloughed federal workers. Trump signed the legislation into law himself. Before the law, Congress typically voted following each funding lapse to ensure back pay for all federal employees. The Congressional Budget Office projected 750,000 federal workers would be furloughed in the current shutdown. Democrats on Capitol Hill rebuffed the memo on Tuesday, arguing it is another example of Trump attempting to circumvent the law. “The letter of the law is as plain as can be—federal workers, including furloughed workers, are entitled to their backpay following a shutdown,” Senate Appropriations ranking member Patty Murray, D-Wash., wrote on social media. “Another baseless attempt to try and scare & intimidate workers by an administration run by crooks and cowards.”‘That should turn up the urgency’Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., asked about the memo during a morning press conference, said he hadn’t seen it or spoken with anyone in the White House, but he didn’t seem to take issue with its change of course. “I’m sure there will be a lot of discussion about that. But there are legal analysts who think that is not something that government should do,” Johnson said. “If that is true, that should turn up the urgency and the necessity of the Democrats doing the right thing here.” Pressed by another reporter about the principle involved with possibly not adhering to the law, Johnson said he hopes that furloughed federal workers do receive their back pay.“I can tell you the president believes that as well. He and I have talked about this personally. He doesn't want people to go without back pay,” Johnson said. “And that's why he pleaded with Chuck Schumer to do the right thing and vote to keep the government open. We don't want this to happen.”

Johnson didn’t clarify why — if Trump believes furloughed workers should receive back pay consistent with the 2019 law — the White House budget office prepared a memo stating the opposite.Johnson’s official House website explains that during a shutdown “federal employees will either be furloughed, or in some cases required to work without pay. Under federal law, employees are entitled to back pay upon the government reopening.”Democrats call for negotiations on shutdownSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said during a morning floor speech that Johnson “has become a massive roadblock to progress,” though he didn’t address the possibility of no back pay for furloughed workers. “Ending this shutdown will require Donald Trump to step in and push Speaker Johnson to negotiate because without the president’s involvement, Speaker Johnson and MAGA Republicans in the House are increasingly dug in,” Schumer said. American Federation of Government Employees National President Everett Kelley wrote in a statement the ""frivolous argument that federal employees are not guaranteed backpay under the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act is an obvious misinterpretation of the law. “It is also inconsistent with the Trump administration’s own guidance from mere days ago, which clearly and correctly states that furloughed employees will receive retroactive pay for the time they were out of work as quickly as possible once the shutdown is over.” Shauneen Miranda contributed to this report.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/themes/custom/sn/images/icons/No_image.svg,,,2025-10-07 11:58:31.814556

So far, more than 14,000 people on the USC Columbia campus have signed up for the free service, according to Brice Bible, the schools IT chief. USC Upstate is approaching 1,200 users.
In all, USC has about 40,000 students enrolled at its Columbia campus and more than 8,000 employees, including about 1,780 full time teaching faculty.
USC signs $1.5M contract with OpenAI to train students, faculty on responsible use

“There are a lot of companies out there that have tools emerging,” Bible said. “With this we get to be at the ground floor, helping to analyze those tools and find the best way that it works for a university … We’re at the front edge of this, and we’re getting a chance to be a part of creating it as much as using it.”
The paid version of ChatGPT, which USC students and employees can access for free, usually costs $20 per month.
The technology has limits on the number of questions or prompts a user can input per hour, Bible said. With the paid version, USC and Clemson students and staff will be allowed a higher number of uses before bumping up against the limit.
The education version also allows users to upload large amounts of data that the tool can help analyze. And written into the contract are clauses that OpenAI can’t use any of the universities’ data to train or strengthen its AI capabilities, protecting professors’ and researchers’ intellectual property, USC spokesman Jeff Stensland said.
“Think about graduating today with a great degree from USC, and you’ve got knowledge and working experience on how to use a variety of AI tools and how to use them in your business,” Bible said. “You were already marketable with your USC degree, but now you add that skill set to it.”

How USC is using ChatGPT
USC faculty are reporting using the technology a number of ways.
The student center has customized it to act as a digital tutor, known as Cocky Scholar, on a number of subjects for when students can’t make it in to the center for help, Bible said.
“At three in the morning, I have questions. I can ask this those questions and and it’s almost as good as having the (expert) person live in the chat,” he said.
Real estate and finance professor Ozgur Ince has used ChatGPT to stage mock economic debates in the classroom, asking the technology to generate opposing viewpoints on complex financial principles and argue them back and forth for the students, according to the USC Provost’s Office
A German professor, Lara Ducate, and Nina Moreno, a Spanish professor, have used the technology to create robots that can mimic native speakers, allowing students to rehearse conversations, practicing grammar and vocabulary in real time, before they encounter real life native speakers.
And Juan Caicedo, a civil and environmental engineering professor, customized his ChatGPT so students can ask it a question and the robot will guide the students through the mathematical equations they might use to come up with an answer without giving the direct answers on how to solve the problem.
“We’re not telling faculty what to think, but what to think about,” said Lara Lomicka Anderson, the school’s dean of undergraduate studies. “So we’re really encouraging the use of AI as a tool, thinking about how it can help students to brainstorm, to summarize, to serve as an assistant or as a tutor, which can really help promote some of that more critical thinking and higher level thinking that we want all of our students to be developing as they are here with us at the university.”
As demand for AI rises, so do power thirsty data centers

Lomicka Anderson also said a faculty panel has developed university-wide guidelines for the technology’s use, including the suggestion that professors include a policy for their classrooms.
“Because if you’re not putting any guidelines out there, it’s free game for whatever the students decide to do,” she said.
Bible also foresees USC using the technology for university operations.
For example, USC’s many science labs have large cylinders that store gas needed to run Bunsen burners and other lab tools. A researcher could use ChatGPT to set up a process that would reorder gas automatically when the supply is running low, taking one less task off the researcher’s to-do list.
Clemson considering contract
At Clemson, the school is “investing in deeper, custom AI capabilities that go beyond what other universities have purchased, positioning the campus to lead in teaching, operations, and research innovation,” according to a filing with the state’s procurement office.
If a deal is signed, the technology would be available to the college’s 37,000 students and employees.
It is unclear why Clemson would have to pay twice what the technology company is charging USC.
As for why ChatGPT and not another technology, such as Microsoft Copilot or Google Gemini, Clemson said the service is the most widely used and offers a larger suite of tools at the scale the school needs.
Clemson pointed to a recent survey on AI usage by Elon University in North Carolina that showed, of those that have used the technology, 72% have used ChatGPT, while 50% have used Google’s Gemini, 39% have used Microsoft’s Copilot, 20% have used Meta’s LLaMa, 12% have used xAI’s Grok, 9% have used Anthropic’s Claude.
“This puts ChatGPT as the far leader in the field and we would assume would reflect similar usage here at Clemson,” according to a statement from Clemson.
Free AI testing platform rolled out to federal employees

ChatGPT in education
OpenAI has been on an education-related expansion spree, signing various deals with more than a dozen colleges across the globe.
Arizona State University, California State University and Oxford University all have so-called ChatGPT Edu accounts.
And OpenAI also invested $50 million in a partnership, which it calls the NextGenAI consortium, to help speed up the research process. California State and Oxford are part of that group, as are:

California Institute of Technology (Caltech)
Duke University
University of Georgia
Harvard University
Howard University
Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)
University of Michigan
University of Mississippi
The Ohio State University
Texas A&M University

“So we’re in good company,” Bible told members of USC’s governing board at its September meeting.

(Photo by Getty Images)In 1953, at the height of the McCarthyist red scare, the American Library Association and the Association of American Publishers issued a Freedom to Read Statement. The organizations expressed concerns about the rising public sentiment that it was worth violating core First Amendment freedoms to keep certain ideas from reaching American readers. 
The statement, last updated in 2004, begins: “The freedom to read is essential to our democracy. It is continuously under attack. Private groups and public authorities in various parts of the country are working to remove or limit access to reading materials, to censor content in schools, to label ‘controversial’ views, to distribute lists of ‘objectionable’ books or authors, and to purge libraries.” 

Banned Books Week resources
More information on Banned Books Week is available here. 
Visit Unite Against Book Bans for information on book bans. 
If you need support around a library materials challenge, you can find help through the New England Intellectual Freedom Helpline, which will connect you to a volunteer in Maine.

That statement is unfortunately as relevant today as it was then. Censorship and book challenges have risen sharply in Maine in recent years. Between 2010 and 2020, few or no formal challenges were reported each year. But in 2023, there were 16 challenges in school districts across the state, covering more than 30 individual titles. 
The majority have been in school libraries, with many challenges naming multiple titles on gender and sexuality. Following national trends, Maia Kobabe’s “Gender Queer” has been the most challenged book in Maine, and it has been removed from at least one school library. Though challenges are waning for now — with only three reported to the Maine Library Association in 2024 — more subtle forms of “soft censorship” have arisen. These include policy changes and pressure to preemptively exclude books from collections, demonstrating the long-term chilling effect of book challenges, even when they are unsuccessful.
Book banning and censorship are often attempts to hide information, erase cultures, and alter the historical record. Bans are not just about one title or idea — they are systematically employed to limit the ways people are able to see and understand the world, and themselves. While many recent book challenges are framed within a context of “parents’ rights,” we believe each family should have the right to access collections that both reflect and challenge their experiences and values.  
James Baldwin, speaking to LIFE magazine in 1963, said, “You think your pain and your heartbreak are unprecedented in the history of the world, but then you read.” 
Books and other forms of free expression offer us windows into worlds we have never personally experienced, allowing us to develop empathy and curiosity about others. They provide mirrors to see pieces of ourselves that we might otherwise not recognize, and offer ways to connect with ideas and identities that might be pushed to the margins in our own communities. Limiting what our children or our neighbors can read leaves us more isolated and less able to relate to one another.
Exposure to new ideas is critical and it is essential libraries hold diverse collections, even when readers may find some materials distasteful. Someone who finds an author or book objectionable might be interested nonetheless in learning more about ideas they don’t like, to better understand and oppose them. Or they may find that the ideas are not as objectionable as they assumed. No patron is going to enjoy or agree with every item in their library, but every patron must enjoy the freedom to choose what appeals to them.  
Libraries offer much more than books, but books and ideas are foundational to our First Amendment freedoms, and we should all rally to protect these freedoms before they are gone. 
The Freedom to Read Statement continues: “The answer to a ‘bad’ book is a good one, the answer to a ‘bad’ idea is a good one.” For Maine libraries and the ACLU of Maine, it is a core belief that “bad” speech is best met with “good” speech. Justice can only prevail when all people, regardless of their point of view, are granted the right to express themselves freely.  
As the statement concludes, “We do not state these propositions in the comfortable belief that what people read is unimportant. We believe rather that what people read is deeply important; that ideas can be dangerous; but that the suppression of ideas is fatal to a democratic society. Freedom itself is a dangerous way of life, but it is ours.” 
We heartily reaffirm this sentiment and encourage you to pay attention to the threats to First Amendment freedoms happening in libraries and schools in your community. It takes all of us to protect our freedom to read.

The panelists will be University of Mississippi professor R.J. Morgan, Mississippi Today’s Jerry Mitchell and Reena Evers-Everette, Medgar Evers’ daughter. The event will not be streamed live, but can be viewed in the coming days at https://youtube.com/@overbycenterforsouthernjou1739?si=zKUdKg3AIv4L_nzs.

Friends, let me just tell you, becoming a Bob Dylan scholar is not how I planned to spend my life.
In my previous careers, I was a sports journalist and a high school history teacher. I went to school to become an academic administrator. I teach media classes at the University of Mississippi, run two very successful scholastic press associations and serve nationally in a number of other capacities. I am deeply proud of this work. But unless you’re really into high school yearbooks and helping young adults find their voice (quick plug — you should be!), the story I’m about to tell is probably more interesting. 
I was a casual Dylan fan in college. Like many folks, I knew he was important, and mysterious, and his lyrics definitely helped me make sense of many social injustices and get over many lost loves. As a young history teacher, I assigned some of his protest songs to my students for projects, but personally I was more into Johnny Cash and what the Drive-By Truckers’ Patterson Hood calls, “the Southern Thing.” Dylan was too New York City, too distant. I was fascinated by New York, too, but I lived in Mississippi. The South was my home. 
By 2015, I was teaching at the University of Mississippi. Sensing time might be running out to see a legend live, I bought tickets for a series of Dylan shows, mostly just to pay my respects and visit a few friends spread out across the South.
I had low expectations. It was an excuse to travel. 
What I discovered instead was an artist who was still very much alive and vibrant. Most of the songs he performed were from recent albums, so I understood very little of what was being mumbled into the microphone, but when I dug into the songs later, many struck me as even more stunning, and scholarly in their depth, than his well-known masterpieces from the 1960s and ’70s. When he won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2016, I realized this wasn’t just a popular American artist. This was a cultural icon who would one day be studied alongside Faulkner, Whitman and Hemingway.
I know that sounds a bit hokey. 
But I work on a college campus, and when I hear visiting Shakespeare scholars talk about the importance of preserving the Bard’s “First Folios” (the 235 surviving copies of the first collection of Shakespeare’s plays, published in 1623), it sounds a lot like the reverent whispers I hear “Dylanologists” use to discuss bootlegs of a pre-New York recording at a friend’s Minneapolis apartment or the marked-up pocketsize notebooks he used to sketch out lyrics for “Blood on the Tracks.”

Both camps analyze these artifacts as if they’re the Dead Sea Scrolls. That’s what scholars do. Every scrap of information preserved can offer new ways of seeing and understanding a historical figure, even one who does not want to be seen or understood, like Dylan.
Around this time I also ran across the short, famous video clip of Dylan performing in a cotton field outside of Greenwood “Only a Pawn in Their Game,” his song about the assassination of Medgar Evers.
The novelty of it caught my attention first. I was well acquainted with Evers and his heroism. I’d taught Mississippi studies. Now here was this song, and this poignant performance. I needed to know more. 
So I began casually accumulating any information I could find. The event turned out to be the Delta Folk Jubilee, a voter registration rally put on by the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee in July of 1963.
Folksingers Pete Seeger, Theo Bikel and Dylan — all white — came down and performed with the Freedom Singers as a way to show support for local Black people, who were fighting for the right to vote, and to help export their story back to the rest of America by generating news coverage.
SNCC’s press release claims it was the first integrated public gathering in the history of the Delta.
Future congressman John Lewis was there as SNCC’s newly-elected chairman. Local law enforcement put up “No Parking” signs along the road to deter attendance, then stood hovering across the street, armed, while sharecroppers traded stories of police brutality. 
Dylan played just two songs. “Pawn” was one, and this was its debut. Evers’ body had been buried for less than three weeks. The other song was “Blowin’ in the Wind.”
The whole affair was bold, risky and dangerous. The more research I accumulated, the more my reporter’s brain activated. This was a major historical event, not just for Dylan but for Mississippi. So I set out to try to document my little sliver of “Dylanology” by tracking down those who were there and recording their stories.
Among others, I’ve interviewed Courtland Cox, the SNCC worker who picked up Dylan at the airport in Jackson; Bob Moses, leader of the Greenwood movement and architect of Freedom Summer; and Dorie Ladner, who dined with Evers the night he was murdered and later became friendly enough with Dylan that he spoke of her in song:
I got a woman in Jackson
I ain’t gonna say her name
She’s a brown-skin woman, but I
Love her just the same
Both Moses and Ladner have now passed on, but my interviews are ongoing. If you know anyone who attended this event or has any information that might be useful, please reach out. 

Researching Dylan’s Greenwood trip led me to dig deeper into the rest of his career and catalog. He may be from Minnesota, but his roots run almost immediately to the South.
In addition to Lead Belly, Woody Guthrie and Hank Williams, Dylan cites Robert Johnson and other Delta Bluesmen as major early influences. According to my colleague Jason Cain, the radio waves carrying all that music up the Mississippi River to Dylan in Hibbing were the same ones falling on Turkey Scratch, Arkansas, and a young Levon Helm, Dylan’s future bandmate.

Beyond Evers, Dylan penned civil rights anthems about Emmett Till and James Meredith. He cut major, career-defining records in Nashville, Muscle Shoals and New Orleans. His latest studio album, “Rough and Rowdy Ways” (2020), is named after a song by Meridian’s Jimmie Rodgers. 
He wrote a song called “Mississippi” in the late 1990s that was first cut by Sheryl Crow. The hook comes from a 1947 prison work song on Parchman Farm:
Only one thing I did wrong
Stayed in Mississippi a day too long
I grew up just outside of Jackson in the tight-knit, working-class community of Pearl. As a native, these legacies are very important to me. Mississippi is the birthplace of America’s music, and as such, I believe it should be a leader in the study of America’s most consequential musical artist, which is Bob Dylan. 
So, I developed a course called “Bob Dylan and the South” last year for the School of Journalism and the Center for the Study of Southern Culture. It was extremely well-received, and faculty voted earlier this fall to make it a permanent part of the catalog. Registration for next spring’s section begins later this month.
Dylan has been the topic of academic study for more than 40 years. Harvard, Penn, Texas, Berkeley and countless others offer courses on him. The University of Tulsa houses the Institute for Bob Dylan Studies. But no other college campus in America could give its students a better education on Dylan’s southern connections than the University of Mississippi. 
We have Greg Johnson and the Mississippi Blues Archive, one of the largest collections of Blues holdings in the world. We have Scott Barretta, whose award-winning “Highway 61” Blues show airs every week on the Mississippi Public Broadcasting radio network. We have David Swider, the insanely knowledgeable musicologist who owns End of All Music record stores in Oxford and Jackson’s Fondren neighborhood.
We have professors Mark Dolan and Vanessa Charlot, who’ve researched Dylan’s lyrical and cultural connections to Florida and the Caribbean, respectively. Jacob Justice in the Department of Writing and Rhetoric presented his research on Dylan’s relationship with the Beatles at the World of Bob Dylan academic conference in Tulsa this summer, alongside myself and some 300 others.
Our very campus is tied to Dylan, who wrote “Oxford Town” about the riots resulting from Meredith’s enrollment as the first Black student in 1962. He sings: 
Two men died ’neath a Mississippi moon 
Somebody better investigate soon 
One of the two men who died was Paul Guihard, a French journalist. He was the only journalist, in fact, to die covering the Civil Rights Movement. My retired colleague Kathleen Wickham spent the bulk of her career researching Guihard and the integration riots. In 2010, the Society of Professional Journalists declared the Ole Miss campus an historic site in journalism. The plaque stands outside my building. 
Guihard’s murder has never been solved, but Wickham quite literally became the “somebody” Dylan called for in song back in 1962. When she shared her work with my students last spring, they could look down from our classroom windows at the riot site below. 
Everyone else mentioned above spoke with my students, too. The course culminated with students having to produce their own podcasts, with original interviews and research, on a Dylan-related topic. We aired their work on campus radio over the summer. Collectively, we used Dylan as a throughline to explore a variety of topics, crisscrossing disciplines and lenses. The contours of Bob Dylan and the American South are those of America itself. 
The music tells the story. 

At a time when the public is openly questioning the value of higher education, courses like this speak to the relevance of scholarship in everyday life. Where else and when would students, especially out-of-state students, learn this cultural heritage? 
And if they have fun along the way, so what? Universities shouldn’t only have fun on Saturdays.
College students are often painted as flighty and entitled (and some of them are). But those enrolled in my course last spring, hailing from more than a dozen majors across campus, were thoughtful and inspiring. 
In her final reflection essay for the semester, one student wrote:
“I was born and raised in Hernando. I wasn’t always proud of that fact. … I never even knew the culture that surrounded me before I made it to college. Mississippi is one of the most historically rich places in the entire country, and nobody talks about it. So much music originated here. It is the state of American Music. Where would we be without Mississippi musicians? There is so much new gained respect I have for this place, and I am lucky to have been born here.”
Mission accomplished.

Elected to the Indiana House in 2018, she served on three House committees: Environmental Affairs, Elections and Apportionment and Natural Resources. In the 2025 session, Boy passed House Enrolled Act 1376 to expand access to opioid overdose reversal medication and House Enrolled Act 1380, which exempts motor driven cycles and lightweight electric vehicles from supplemental fees.
Advancing those bills “was a milestone,” Boy said, reminding her “how collaboration and persistence can lead to real results for our communities.”
“Although I am stepping away from elected office, my heart will always be with the people I had the privilege to serve. I wish my colleagues in the General Assembly continued success and thank them for their friendship and partnership throughout the years. I will be spending more time with my family and my cat, tending to my long-neglected garden and staying engaged in the community that has given me so much. I look forward to watching the next public servant continue this important work with the same care and determination that has always inspired me. Thank you, House District 9.”
Boy’s departure mid-term means that the local Democratic party will schedule a caucus to choose a successor to finish her term. Boy was up for reelection, along with the rest of the House, in 2026.
House Minority Leader Phil GiaQuinta, of Fort Wayne, thanked Boy for her service over the last seven years.
“Before coming to the Statehouse, Rep. Boy served her community as a union worker, a small business owner and as a member of the Michigan City Common Council. Her adult life has been dedicated to giving back to her community and creating a better state for all Hoosiers to thrive in,” he said. “While House Democrats will miss serving alongside Pat, she has certainly earned a relaxing retirement with her family.

The crab species are related, but snow crab generally dwell in farther-north and colder waters. State officials are allowing a bigger snow crab harvest than last year's very small allowable catch. But an unprecedented spike in the number of snow-tanner crab hybrids is affecting the rules for the upcoming harvest. (Photo provided by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Alaska Fisheries Science Center)Snow crab stocks in Alaska’s Bering Sea, which crashed a few years ago, have recovered enough to allow a modest harvest starting in mid-October.
The Alaska Department of Fish and Game on Monday announced that fishers will be allowed to harvest 9.3 million pounds of Bering Sea snow crab from Oct. 15 to May. The harvest cap is about twice the 4.72 million pounds allowed in the past season, which followed an unprecedented two-year period of closed harvests.
The Bering Sea snow crab harvest closures came after catastrophic losses that scientists have attributed to an intense, multiyear marine heatwave that started in 2018.
The 9.3-million-pound total harvest cap set for the coming season is much smaller than past harvests that, at their peak, reached hundreds of millions of pounds in the early 1990s.
The harvest cap was set by the state based on biological parameters approved by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council. Bering Sea crab harvests are co-managed by the state and federal governments.
The Department of Fish and Game on Monday also announced a Bristol Bay red king crab harvest cap of 2.68 million pounds, up slightly from the 2.31-million-pound allowable catch set last year. The red king crab harvest will run from Oct. 15 to Jan. 15, the department said.
Like snow crab, Bristol Bay red king crab, known for their huge size and the high market prices they fetch, suffered a recent crash. Harvests were closed from 2021 to 2023; it was the first two-year stretch without a Bristol Bay red king crab harvest.
There will also be an increase allowed in the harvest of Bering Sea tanner crab, a species related to snow crab but less sensitive to heat. The department on Monday announced a combined 11.25-million-pound harvest cap spread across western and eastern areas of the Bering Sea. That is nearly twice the allowable Bering Sea tanner crab catch the department set last year.
The increased harvest limits follow scientific surveys that found increases among all three types of crab typically harvested in the Bering Sea.
“It’s getting better. It’s a slow and steady increase here,” Katie Palof, an Alaska Department of Fish and Game researcher, told the North Pacific Fishery Management Council on Monday.
Palof is part of the state-federal team studying and monitoring Bering Sea crab; she presented survey findings on Monday without any of her National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration colleagues because of the federal government shutdown.
For harvesters, the signs are welcome, said Cory Lescher of Alaska Bering Sea Crabbers, an industry group of independent harvesters.
“As crab harvesters and industry, we’re really encouraged by the positive signals that we saw come out of the bottom trawl survey with regards to crab, particularly for snow crab,” Lescher told the council. “We’re still concerned that all the stocks are low, but we’re seeing at least a step in the right direction with some of these results that we saw.”
Hybrids, crab sizes and long-term concerns
There is a twist to this year’s snow crab harvest: 1 million of the allowable catch is to be composed of snow-tanner crab hybrids.
That is due to a boom in such hybrid species.
In the past, such hybrids have existed in varying but relatively small numbers. When harvested, they were usually counted as snow crab, Palof said. Up to now, hybrids were considered too insignificant to be counted in the harvest recommendations or limits.
But this year, scientists conducting Bering Sea snow and tanner crab surveys found that about 20% of the males that were big enough to be harvested – about 4 inches across – were hybrids, Palof said.
“This is unprecedented,” she said.
Exactly why the hybrid boom happened is unclear, but it coincides with the recent collapse in the snow crab population and the past year’s delayed maturation of female snow crab, Palof said.
In the future, fishery managers want to learn more about the snow-tanner hybrids, she said. If hybrids continue to be important parts of the total Bering Sea crab population, there may be a need to formally include them in stock and harvest calculations, she said.
While short-term signs are encouraging, there are signs of potential long-term problems.
For Bristol Bay red king crab, there have been no jumps in the population of immature crabs since 2015, Palof said. That raises concerns about future population sizes, she said.
“While we’re seeing a steady slow increase in biomass, we’re not expecting to see any large increases in biomass without recruitment,” she said, referring to the growth of juvenile fish into adulthood.
There are concerning signs for king crab in the Bristol Bay marine environment as well, Palof said. More wind meant poorer feeding conditions for larvae, she said. Waters were warmer than in the past four years, and there are continued corrosive conditions at depth with lower pH levels that affect shell growth.
For snow crab and tanner crab, there are concerns about the shrinking size of adult males, as the industry prefers to harvest big adult male crabs. Unlike king crab and some other shellfish species, which continue growing and replacing their shells throughout their lifetimes, snow crab and tanner crab have limits to their growth.
“Once they molt to maturity, they stop growing,” Palof said.
Also for snow crab, there is a continuing threat of new marine heatwaves like the 2018-2019 event that scientists blame for the recent crash.
A new marine heatwave has developed in the North Pacific off the coast of California. Though that has not extended north of the Aleutian Islands, sea surface temperatures in the Bering Sea are well above normal as of Monday, according to NOAA.
Mark Stichert, the Alaska Department of Fish and Game’s Kodiak-based groundfish and shellfish management coordinator, said the possibility of future heatwaves could factor into future harvest decisions.
“Most of the climate projections suggest that these blobs of warming, marine heatwaves, they’re more likely to occur more often,” he said on Friday. That leaves managers with the question of how to account for factors like this that are out of their control, he said.
“We do know that snow crab, as their name implies, like cold water. Absences of cold water, their stock does not do well,” he said.

(Photo by John Moore/Getty Images)The nation’s prison population grew for the second consecutive year in 2023, reversing more than a decade of steady decline.
A new prison population report from the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics, released before the federal shutdown, shows that 1,254,224 people were incarcerated in state and federal prisons on the last day of 2023 — an increase of 24,081 people from the year before, or about 2%. 
It follows a rise in 2022, which marked the first uptick since 2010, when prison populations began a gradual decline after peaking in the mid 2000s.
Even with recent increases, the prison population in 2023 was still about 20% below the 2013 level.
The latest figures show that women remain a small share of the prison population, but their numbers are growing faster than men’s. 
Between 2022 and 2023, the female prison population rose nearly 4%, from 87,800 to 91,100. The male population increased by nearly 2% during the same period. Thirty-eight states saw growth in their male prison populations, while 41 states reported increases among women.
New Mexico, Maine and South Dakota recorded the highest growth rates in their prison populations. 
Seven more populous states — Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, New York, Ohio, Texas and Wisconsin — added more than 1,000 people to their prison rolls during the same period. New Jersey, Alaska and Hawaii had the largest decreases in rates.


The growth comes as prisons are grappling with another demographic shift: a rapidly aging population. In 2023, nearly 1 in 4 prisoners were 50 or older. That trend is expected to continue, some experts say, with projections that by 2030 as much as one-third of the U.S. prison population will be over 50.
Correctional systems, many of which already face staffing shortages and overcrowding, are under growing pressure as prison populations rise. In recent years, some prisoner advocates and state legislators have pushed for measures such as “second look” laws or expanded parole eligibility that would release people deemed low risk for reoffending. Those could older adults, people with serious medical needs and those convicted of nonviolent offenses.
The idea has gained traction as a way to lower prison operation costs and ease strain on correctional staff, but it remains controversial. Supporters say targeted decarceration can improve safety inside prisons and save taxpayer dollars, while opponents argue it could jeopardize public safety and that such releases may not significantly lower taxpayer costs. if

(Photo illustration by Getty Images)I read the recent Reformer article about how many Minnesota school districts still haven’t recovered their test scores after the pandemic.
The piece mentioned Eastern Carver County Schools using Building Thinking Classrooms — or BTC — and “inquiry-based” math instruction as a strategy to improve math proficiency.
I want to flag this because BTC and inquiry-based math are already promoted widely and used across the state — and the results are not promising.
Many Minnesota districts already use some version of BTC, “thinking” classrooms, or inquiry/discovery math. In my district, Hopkins, and the district where I work, Anoka-Hennepin, BTC and similar methods have been in place for years. Other districts using these methods include Minneapolis, St. Paul, Osseo, Eden Prairie, Faribault, Prior Lake, Monticello, Central Public Schools, and Wayzata. The Minnesota Council of Teachers of Mathematics also features many sessions on BTC and inquiry math at its annual conference.
If BTC actually worked, we would see statewide gains in math achievement. Instead, only a few districts, including Eastern Carver County, show negligible gains. Most districts have remained stagnant in their math outcomes since 2018.
This situation is very similar to the reading crisis Emily Hanford describes in “Sold a Story.” Schools widely adopted “balanced literacy” without strong evidence, and doing so left many students behind. In math, BTC and inquiry-based methods have the same effect. Of particular concern: Students of color, English learners, and low-income students are often the most affected when classrooms over rely on inquiry methods instead of clear instruction and practice.
The good news is that there are research-based approaches to math instruction that work, and schools should be using them to improve math scores. Families, educators, and policymakers need to know which approaches are actually effective.
I hope future coverage of math achievement in Minnesota includes this context. BTC and inquiry math is not new, and the evidence shows it is not the solution we need.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2201804138-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-07 09:57:19.051471

The plant is not on schedule to reach full production, but the city is moving forward with plans to accommodate the rapid development surrounding the plant. (Sara Maloney for Kansas Reflector)DE SOTO — This small town is moving forward with plans for major developments even though Panasonic may delay full production at its new electric vehicle battery plant.
The newest developments include plans for hundreds of housing options with apartments, homes and a hotel, in addition to the opening of a data center and an expansion to Merck Animal Health’s facility.
De Soto is a town of about 6,500 people, so the planned hiring of 4,000 people at Panasonic, in addition to new housing and other businesses coming to town, means at least an additional 60% of people spending time at local businesses and using roads and other town infrastructure. Some residents are coping with the changes to the town’s character and desire for more information about environmental impacts from new development.
De Soto Mayor Rick Walker said he is confident Panasonic will meet its obligations and this his opinion about the project hasn’t changed.
“It was good for the city when we first saw it. It’s still good for the city,” he said. “I mean, it’s a generation worth of improvements that were built in a span of three years, and that’s just completely unimaginable that we would have been able to do that. But it’s happened and it’s here and no regrets, no second thoughts.”
The $4 billion Panasonic plant was expected to reach full production by March 2027 but reports suggest that goal has been delayed due to the dropping electric car sales and federal policies that don’t support green energy.
Sarah King, Panasonic Energy chief people officer, and Panasonic spokesperson Alison Klooster did not respond directly to questions about when full production would begin but said they are still planning to reach the original planned output.
“I think it’s something similar to how we opened in July, like yeah, I believe our initial goal was quarter one of 2025. It was a few months later, but we did open and we’re up and running,” Klooster said.
Many factors are at play, making it difficult to provide a specific timeline, she said. Hiring sustainability and construction timing are some of those factors, Klooster added.
She said the plant just sent out its millionth battery last month.
“People want things to happen on different timelines sometimes, but it’s happening on the timeline that we can sustain in the community and make sure that we make a lasting, positive impact,” Klooster  said. 
The factory has hired just over 1,200 employees, including production workers and support staff, and is still on track for 4,000 total employees, King said. 
It’s also dependent on apprenticeship programs and time needed to get workers ready, she said. 
“We’re finding that these programs are so strong that people are able to actually come in and get to work faster than what we really thought that they were going to be,” she said.
King said employees are still being hired from within a 50-mile radius of De Soto.

Panasonic’s impact
De Soto’s 2023 Panasonic development agreement included a tax increment financing district for the company, which uses property tax collected from the increased value of the development to pay for costs associated with needed infrastructure improvements. 
The agreement provided about $229 million for public infrastructure projects like roadway construction, water treatment storage, sewer treatment and fire safety projects. 
Most of the infrastructure projects included in the agreement are either almost done or will be done in early 2026, Walker said.
The agreement also noted that in order to receive the tax increment financing funding, Panasonic must invest at least $1 billion and operate the facility that employs 2,500 full-time employees. 
Walker said he’s spoken with Lt. Governor David Toland and others from the Kansas Department of Commerce about what De Soto projects mean for the greater Kansas economy. De Soto remains a key part in attracting business to Kansas, he said. 
“When you’re sitting on the sidelines and you’ve adjusted maybe to Panasonic coming and then another big project comes, that seems like whiplash,” Walker said. “But these projects have been a long time coming.”
De Soto City Council President Rob Daniels said community response to all the developments is mixed, but most residents acknowledge that change was coming. 
Development on the former Sunflower Ammunition Plant was going to happen with or without Panasonic, Daniels said. 
“You don’t spend a billion dollars or more cleaning up a site for it to sit and be nothing,” he said. 
He said the development is good for the community, and also noted that EV sales slowing doesn’t mean the industry is dying off. 
All these projects are to the benefit of the community, whether it’s getting a new community center without having to raise taxes or continuing to lower the city’s portion of property tax bills, he said.

Future data center
The city council recently approved a development agreement with Mount Sunflower LLC for a $3.1 billion data center at Flint Commerce Center south of Kansas Highway 10, which runs through De Soto’s south side. 
The four buildings would total approximately 1.14 million square feet with construction targeted to start this spring, Walker said. The project won’t be completed until around 2035. 
The project will use industrial revenue bonds, which enable property tax abatements and construction sales tax exemptions. 
The center itself won’t bring a lot of jobs, but construction will bring workers to the area, which will increase retail activity, Walker said. 
The city will also receive franchise fees from the center’s electricity use once it is up and running, he said. 
Walker said that although data centers are not the right fit for everywhere, this spot was already appropriately zoned and will be a “less intense use” than previously envisioned. Originally, the plan was to have another 8 million square feet in addition to the already existing building, with possibly 1,000 employees and truck docks, he said. 
The data center will ultimately be around 100 employees and will have significantly less traffic and noise impacts than previously planned for, he said. 
Residents spoke at a city council meeting in August expressing concerns about the project’s environmental impacts, especially water use. 
Martin Boyda, a resident of Kansas City, Kansas, said he has concerns about the water and electricity usage necessary for a data center. 
He said he has wondered if the city has the infrastructure necessary to make this center possible. He also said he is an avid user of the river and has concerns about ecological impacts of increased water being pulled from it. 
“We hear about the millions of gallons a day that these data centers use, and that brings concern to me, and it would be nice to get some information about whether we have the capacity ecologically to support a situation like this,” he said. 
Walker said Kansas is one of the greener power producing states in the country, making it a better place for this type of center. He also said this project would have less storm water runoff because of less impervious surfaces with this development. The city will work with the Kansas Department of Health and Environment throughout the process to ensure they are abiding by state environmental standards, Walker said. 
“Data centers are a necessary part of the infrastructure,” Walker said. “There are environmental issues associated with it, but it’s true for any development, and I think that given what this project brings, the environmental concerns can be planned in the process, mitigated. We rely on our planning process, along with KDHE and their permitting to ensure that we’re not creating an adverse impact for our community.”
Residents have shared concerns about the electricity and water needed for the data center, but the facility will not make residents’ bills higher, he said.
Walker said the city will work to make sure the facility is using best practice for efficient water use, but also said it is in their best interest to use less in order to spend less. 
Evergy has planned for the power necessary, and the Kansas Corporation Commission has instituted rules that say heavy users that put strains on the system will pay more, Walker said. 
The city has the capacity to provide the water necessary without causing adverse impacts on the area, he said. 
De Soto resident Dally Holloway said with all the growth in De Soto, many residents feel as if they weren’t getting clear answers about what was happening. More people started wanting more information about development, she said. 
“They don’t seem to like the idea of a multibillion dollar corporation that we don’t even know who it is receiving what citizens feel is tax-free opportunities to build on land without citizen input,” Holloway said.
Pam and Doug Ebert, De Soto residents and owners of the Cedar Lane Bed and Breakfast, described their feelings toward recent development as “cautiously pleased.” 
More people and more businesses coming to town is a plus, but there’s a way to expand while keeping the small town-feel and keeping any strain off the existing community, they said. 
Doug Ebert said he is glad to see other industries go into the area in case EV sales slow. His other concerns are about increased traffic in town, but said the additional money for road upkeep and other ancillary businesses coming to town are a positive.
“Well, when you’ve got more people working in an area, the infrastructure around that area does get built up,” he said. 
 
Other development
Merck Animal Health announced earlier this year a $895 million expansion with plans to create 200 new jobs. 
Merck will invest $860 million in its existing facility and another $35 million its research and development lab. It’ll be about 200,000 square feet once expanded. 
Walker said Merck has submitted construction documents to city staff for them to review and seem to be on track to get permits completed for construction to start in the spring, he said. 
De Soto is also continuing to plan for GRATA Development’s Limestone project. The mixed-use project has gone through the first step after the city council approved an incentive package and new zoning for the area. 
The project includes a new hotel with 75% tax abatement for 10 years, and around 100 homes part of a reinvestment housing incentive district. The additional homes will help with the city’s limited housing supply, Walker said. The project also includes a 350-unit multifamily residential development that will also receive 75% tax abatement for 10 years, according to the meeting agenda. 
De Soto resident Toni Caldwell said she tries to look at development from both sides — but ultimately is sad to see the changes coming to town. She also has concerns about transparency surrounding the projects, traffic and tax abatements, she said. 
Caldwell said she knew the town was struggling economically, and had problems keeping up with infrastructure needs. That’s something that Panasonic has helped with, she said, but she still has concerns about its environmental impacts. 
She said it’s disappointing to see changes to the community she’s lived in for so long but that she knows change was inevitable with the open land. 
“You really have to look at both sides of it, and it’s hard to do when it’s a community you love and it’s changing, and so it makes it very difficult,” she said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_0135-1024x563.jpg,,,2025-10-07 09:57:19.051471

San Diego and its new $3.8 billion airport terminal have shown signals of a resurgence.,"In summary
California tourism numbers have dipped because of decreases in foreign travel and worsening international exchange rates. San Diego and its new $3.8 billion airport terminal have shown signals of a resurgence.



On the last day of summer, San Diego International Airport’s new Terminal 1 opened with an airy, white concourse, local eateries and new flight routes.
Passengers arriving on the first Southwest Airline flights on Monday, Sept. 22 deplaned to applause through balloon arches over the gates.
“That was fun to cheer them on,” San Diego County Regional Airport Authority Chair Gil Cabrera said the next day. “They were very confused when it was happening.”
That opening date – the fall equinox – was fixed years earlier, when airport officials set a strict construction schedule to launch the new terminal before the end of summer. Now they’re counting on the breezy, new $3.8 billion facility to attract visitors amid a statewide tourism slump. 
“We have the right airy space, with lots of light coming in, and our goal was to reflect the San Diego community, and I think we’ve done a really good job of doing that,” airport CEO Kim Becker said at a ribbon-cutting ceremony last week.
California has braced for a setback this year, as Trump administration policies on tariffs, immigration and gender identity have chilled some foreign travel, and international exchange rates have made it pricier to visit the U.S.
In May, Visit California, a nonprofit tourism marketing agency, projected a 1% drop in visits to the state, in the first year-over-year decline since the pandemic. San Diego tourism experts similarly predicted that visitation would flatten this year, as trade wars and market fluctuations lead people to pull back on travel spending. 
But San Diego airport officials hope to weather that downturn with a welcoming facility and new domestic and international flights. 
“The mix has sort of helped us out a little bit in the sense that where it’s dipped in one place it has sort of increased in other places,”  Cabrera told CalMatters.

Economic headwinds
It’s a tricky time to open a new airport facility. California tourism had bounced back from the pandemic by 2024. But this year the industry faces a perfect storm of economic and political upheaval that leaves it flying into what industry analysts call “headwinds,” or obstacles to business growth.
A big part of that is the change of heart among Canadian travelers.
“We see a 40% decrease in travel from Canada to the U.S. for the first half of the year”  among leisure tourists, Amra Durakovic, a spokesperson for the Canada Flight Centre Travel Group, told CalMatters. 
Business trips to the U.S. have remained steady, she said. But many Canadians have switched their personal travel to Europe, the Caribbean and South America.
They cite steep U.S. tariffs, aggressive border checks and President Donald Trump’s annexation threats as reasons to stay away. Canadian bookings to the U.S. dropped sharply in February after the first round of tariffs, and have remained consistent since then, Durakovic said. There are also pocketbook issues at play.

“We do have a weak dollar,” she said. “I really think that’s a massive factor that dictates where Canadians travel. Everything in the US is getting more expensive, costs are rising. So when you add that together you do get a huge sticker shock in travel to the U.S.”
Canadian air travel to California slipped nearly 38% between August, 2024 and 2025, according to data from Visit California. That prompted Gov. Gavin Newsom to mount a marketing campaign to woo back those visitors with promises of warmth and welcome in the Golden State.
“Sure, you-know-who is trying to stir things up back in D.C., but don’t let that ruin your beach plans,” Newsom’s office stated.
Canadians aren’t the only tourists taking a pass. Visits from Japan have dropped 20% and from Australia by nearly 15%. Forecasts for 2025 predict a 9.2% decline in international trips to California.
Los Angeles International Airport saw a 2.4 percent drop in passengers between June, 2024 and 2025, following the catastrophic fires in January and immigration raids in June. San Diego International Airport saw a smaller decline of .6% for that time period, with about 25 million passengers per year.
San Diego bucks the foreign travel trend
While foreign air travel is dwindling throughout California, San Diego International Airport shows the opposite trend. It saw a 5.5 percent boost in global passengers over the past year, with the addition of more international flights.
In May the airport launched direct flights to Amsterdam through KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, and in June it introduced Copa Airlines, with a flight to Panama that opens South America to West Coast travelers.  Last year it bumped its nonstop flights to London from once to twice daily. 
Plus, the strong dollar means that more San Diego travelers are flying to destinations such as Europe and Canada, offsetting losses from incoming international flights, said Hampton Brown, vice president of revenue for the airport.
“Right now, we’re noticing that a lot of the international services that we have, actually are being carried by U.S people going abroad, rather than foreigners coming here,” he said.
The $3.8 billion terminal project was funded primarily through airport bonds, with $3.2 billion in bond debt to be repaid through airline revenue, parking and concessions income, and other fees. Another $300 million each came from the Biden-era federal infrastructure act, and Airport Authority cash.
The airport authority expects the new terminal and earlier improvements to generate $7.4 billion in sales and $127 million in local tax revenues between 2010 and 2029.
A unique quality of light
The new Terminal 1 replaces the old facility, which was built in 1967 to accommodate 2.5 million passengers annually but squeezed in 12 million people last year, Cabrera said. 
The first thing visitors driving into the airport will see is a 21-foot tall, fuschia jellyfish by artist Matthew Mazzotta. The “larger-than-life kinetic sculpture” portrays the Pacific species Chrysaora colorata and serves as a reminder of the changing climate, Mazotta stated.
Inside, the new concourse offers open space and subtle features designed to relieve the hassles of air travel. Staggered wooden ceiling tiles over the security checkpoint mimic water at a shoreline, “to create a sense of calm, because going through security can be stressful,” said Amiel Porta, director of airside and terminal operations.
Artist James Carpenter created an 800-foot span of floor-to-ceiling windows called the “Luminous Wave,” with curved, textured glass that lets sunlight enter while reducing heat and glare.
The installation captures the “unique quality of San Diego light” to create “this giant lantern that’s illuminated by the sun during the day and by architectural lighting at night,” said Anthony Hedayat, project design manager at San Diego County Regional Airport Authority.
Local eateries include The Taco Stand, Mediterranean-style Luna Grill, Better Buzz coffee and Cutwater Spirits. Skateboarder Tony Hawk and San Diego chef Claudette Zepeda collaborated to serve cross-border cuisine in a food stand with a roof made of skateboard ramps. In another nod to San Diego’s virtually year-round sunshine, there’s an outdoor eating area.
When the final phase of the new terminal is finished in 2028, there will be 30 gates, compared to 20 at the old facility..
“It’s excellent,” said Manuel Pagador, who flew to Denver through Terminal 1 last week. “It’s twice the size, very clean.”
But he found the crisp white interior to be stark, comparing it to Anchorage International Airport, with its tribal artifacts and grizzly bear mounts. Pagador suggested adding artwork representing surfboards or California poppies.
Steve Ponce flew from Oakland to San Diego through the old Terminal 1, and returned home via the new terminal last week, “which was much nicer, roomier, with better food and better seats,” he said.
For San Diego travelers who have gritted their teeth through construction traffic and a crowded terminal for the past few years, there’s a payoff already.
“It’s one of those experiences that you really do not get very often,” Cabrera said at the ribbon-cutting ceremony. “Everybody at the airport is happy.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/092325_SD-Airport-Terminal_KC_CM_04.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-07 09:57:19.051471

A celebration of Jon’s life will be held next summer.


Jon Fox died at home in Waterville, Vermont on September 23, 2025. His final days were sweet and full of laughter. Friends and family traveled to see him from near and far, as if beckoned by his call.
Jonathan Dean Fox was born in New York City on May 27, 1949, the second child of Sherwood Dean Fox and Marcia Seidenbond Fox. Throughout his life, he continued to share a close bond with his two sisters, Janaki Costello and Deborah Fox, who both traveled to Vermont to be by his side when he passed.
An independent thinker and a willful spirit, Jon traveled to California after high school to attend San Francisco State University. It was there that he met his match in Adrianna, who was his equal in passion and vision. Eager to make a better world, they migrated to Vermont in the early 70’s and settled in Waterville. The home they built at the top of the steep hill became a true haven for family, friends, and many German Shepherds.
Jon and Adrianna raised three daughters on the hill. Jon taught Lissa, Molly, and Jill to be fierce and strong and caring. He taught them how to properly stack wood, do the New York Times crossword puzzle in pen, and throw a softball. As kids, they jokingly referred to him as The Almighty Patriarch, but he truly was. He could be gruff and ornery, but underneath that imposing exterior was a deep gentleness. Jon’s natural generosity extended to the girls he coached in softball over two generations, many of whom he stayed in touch with years after he stopped coaching. As a craftsman and builder, he gathered around him a vast community of tradespeople, and helped mentor a new generation of builders. He was a source of comfort to anyone who needed a helping hand or a shoulder to lean on.
A lifelong baseball fanatic, Jon loved the Boston Red Sox, which really means he hated the Yankees. His love for the game manifested itself most strongly in his grandsons Jasper and Rowan. Jon’s happy place was on his front porch in the sunshine, holding Adrianna’s hand, watching their grandsons toss a baseball on the front lawn.
Jon held his memories close throughout his 76 years, even when dementia made it harder for him to find words or names. Late in his life, he would sit in his shop, surrounded by tools he could no longer use, everything organized and smelling of oil, of summer days spent at the job site, of leather toolbelts and iron nails. He never forgot that he made things with love and care, things that were meant to shelter and nurture, and he knew that he had built much more than houses.
Jon kept his loved ones safe in the world. He was a provider and a protector, and the home and community he built with Adrianna was a refuge for those who knew and loved them.
Jon is celebrated by his wife and partner of 55 years, Adrianna Wood Fox. His spirit lives on in his daughter Lissa Fox and her partner James Nagle (Montpelier, VT), and James’s daughter Juna Nagle (Washington, DC); daughter Molly Fox Zhu, her husband Kit Zhu, and their sons Jasper Fox Zhu and Rowan Fox Zhu (Portland, OR); and daughter Jill Fox (Montpelier, VT). Jon is loved by his sister Janaki Costello and her husband Heine Costello (El Cerrito, CA), their sons Josh Costello (Berkeley, CA), Adam Costello, (New York City), and Jamie Costello (El Cerrito, CA), along with their families; sister Deb Fox and her husband Ron Epstein (Rochester, NY), their children Eli Fox-Epstein (Los Angeles, CA) and Malka Fox-Epstein (Rochester, NY), and their families; dear cousin Karen Mullarkey (New York City); and his best friend Kent’s daughters Maia Corduan and her husband Jess Canty (Hardwick, VT), and Hiata Corduan (Rockland, ME), who held a special place in Jon’s heart.We would like to thank Lamoille Home Health & Hospice for their exceptional care. Every aspect of it, from intake to nursing to personal care, was skilled, sensitive, and sincerely concerned about Jon and our family. We especially thank our nurse, Chantal, who is an angel. Please consider making a donation at lhha.org/donate.
A celebration of Jon’s life will be held next summer.

A bill would help by making more midwives and doulas accessible.,"Guest Commentary written by

Erica Moore-Smith
Erica Moore-Smith is a therapist and licensed clinical social worker in Riverside County


In 2018 I walked into my doctor’s office, newly pregnant and excited to hear my baby’s heartbeat for the first time. I left feeling ashamed of my body.
The doctor didn’t ask about my medical history, my lifestyle or my goals for birth. She didn’t even take blood tests. Instead, she looked me up and down and said I would probably develop gestational diabetes and high blood pressure and would likely end up needing a C-section. 
None of these predictions were based on facts — only on how I looked. (I’m a Black woman with a smaller than average build.) What should have been one of the most joyous milestones of my life was replaced with fear, sadness and disappointment. 
As a medical social worker, I knew her words didn’t have to become my story. But I couldn’t shake the thought: How many other women — especially women who look like me — walk out of medical offices believing those words and internalizing fear and shame, because the doctor is considered the expert?
Too many women — especially Black women — enter pregnancy carrying fear. 
We read the statistics: In California, a woman dies every five days on average, either during or after childbirth, but Black mothers are nearly four times more likely to die than others. African Americans account for 5% of pregnancies but 21% of pregnancy-related deaths.
Black women also have heard stories about celebrities like Serena Williams nearly dying after childbirth because her concerns weren’t taken seriously. We wonder: If they didn’t listen to her, why would they listen to me?
That’s why alternatives like midwifery and doula care aren’t just “nice extras” for well-off expectant parents. They are lifesaving, cost-effective health care options that should be covered and accessible to every woman, especially Black women, who could use some peace of mind.
My search for better pregnancy care
My fears came early in my pregnancy. I used to tell myself that if I died in childbirth, at least I made it to 30. It sounds dramatic, but for many women of color it feels like reality. That first obstetrics appointment only reinforced those fears. 
I turned away from traditional obstetric care, and my husband and I researched alternatives and chose a midwifery birth center. That meant paying $9,000 out-of-pocket, when my insurance would have covered hospital care for free. But for me, safety meant being respected, listened to and cared for as a whole person.
The difference was transformative. The midwives never rushed me. They invited questions and explained every option, they prioritized my voice and they prepared me and my husband through prenatal classes.
The research is clear: When women have access to midwives and doulas, outcomes improve. There are fewer unnecessary interventions, fewer complications and more positive birth experiences.
Hospitals will always have an important role in maternity care, but birth should not be limited to them. For women who are good candidates for out-of-hospital birth, midwifery and doula care should be encouraged and supported by our health system.
Instead, half of California’s birth centers have closed in recent years. Midwives say it’s partly because the state makes getting and keeping a license too difficult. Recently lawmakers passed a measure that would eliminate some of those barriers. Assembly Bill 55 awaits — and deserves — Gov. Gavin Newsom’s signature.
Certain Medi-Cal health plans cover doula and midwifery services, but they shouldn’t be the exception. All health insurance plans should cover these services.
Equally important, physicians need better training in how to talk to patients. The way medical providers speak to women early in pregnancy can shape their entire experience. Instead of fear-based predictions, women deserve informed, respectful conversations that empower them to trust their bodies and their choices. 
In 2020, California began requiring hospitals to train labor and delivery staff in unconscious bias. Many hospitals have yet to begin the training.
In my case, my doula provided emotional support and advocacy. She and the midwife gave me confidence and peace, treating me like a person, not a checklist of risks.
I gave birth to my first daughter in four hours, without developing high blood pressure or gestational diabetes or needing a C-section. When I got pregnant again, I chose a home birth. The first hands to touch our second daughter were my husband’s. 
It was calm, beautiful and healing — everything I had once been told wasn’t possible for me.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/032324_MLK-Maternity_JAH_CM_14.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-07 08:57:39.184439

Why are there no penalties?",Malena Carollo,,,,,https://calmatters.org/economy/2025/10/rooftop-solar-hookups-miss-deadlines/,"PG&E and Southern California Edison routinely blow their deadlines to hook up new solar panels, an advocacy group says. But after years of complaints they have not been punished.","In summary
PG&E and Southern California Edison routinely blow their deadlines to hook up new solar panels, an advocacy group says. But after years of complaints they have not been punished.


The state’s two largest utilities routinely drag their feet connecting solar panels to the electric grid, missing state-mandated deadlines as much as 73% of the time, according to a complaint filed to regulators by solar advocates.
The complaint filed by a solar energy advocacy group urges the California Public Utilities Commission to hold utilities accountable when they fail to meet such deadlines. The commission is formally reviewing it. 
The advocates have complained for years that such delays hinder California’s transition to renewables. State utility regulators are separately revisiting the process for connecting rooftop solar to the grid, including examining whether and how the utility commission should require utilities to comply with the timelines it established years ago.
But the commission has yet to reprimand utilities for regularly missing these deadlines.
“The rule is there, but the commission hasn’t chosen to enforce [it],” said Kevin Luo, policy and market development manager for the California Solar & Storage Association, a group advocating for the adoption of solar energy that filed the complaint.
“The rule is there, but the commission hasn’t chosen to enforce [it].”Kevin Luo,  California Solar & Storage Association
When Californians add solar panels to their rooftops, they begin a complex “interconnection” process led by the utilities to ensure the array is correctly installed and able to provide power for both the customer and the grid, which receives power the customer does not use. For each interconnection step, the utility is allotted a certain amount of time, ranging from five business days to 90 calendar days.
The timelines for several of the more extensive steps – including design, construction and installation – were clarified in a 2020 decision after solar panel owners complained that California’s major investor-owned utilities were blowing their deadlines. 
The delays can have significant financial consequences for panel owners, widening the period after they have laid out money for solar cells but before they see a reduction in their power consumption or payments from selling excess solar power back to utilities.
Pacific Gas & Electric, Southern California Edison, and San Diego Gas & Electric all report their compliance with these timelines on a quarterly basis. The reporting is for projects over 30 kilowatts, which are often for businesses, not residential homes, and account for the majority of solar projects.
These data show that PG&E and Edison routinely exceed the allotted windows. 
In the complaint, filed in late August, the California Solar & Storage Association noted the utilities take longer than permitted to connect customers between 19% and 73% of the time, depending on which stage of the process is examined. 
For example, the utilities are given 10 business days to acknowledge someone’s request for interconnection – PG&E’s median time for this step was 20 days, with its longest being 245 days. One of the most crucial steps is a system impact study, which looks at how the addition of a customer’s solar array will affect the grid and identifies any potential issues with hookup. PG&E kept to its timeline 49% of the time, while Edison met its deadline 43% of the time, according to the complaint. 
San Diego Gas & Electric typically meets its deadlines and wasn’t included in the solar association’s complaint about timeliness.
PG&E spokesperson Mike Gazda responded to the complaint by stating that “PG&E is a strong advocate for solar energy and has interconnected nearly 900,000 solar customers—more than any other U.S. utility—to support customers who have made the choice to go solar, strengthen California’s energy grid and reduce our state’s carbon footprint. We look forward to addressing the latest claims made by the solar gorup through the appropriate regulatory channels.” 
Edison spokesperson Jeff Monford said the company takes “complaints seriously and [is] working with the California Public Utilities Commission to thoroughly address any issues related to our interconnection processes.”
Utilities have previously said that delays can be caused by permitting issues, unfamiliar new technologies, or other agencies needing to be involved. 
So what happens when they break the rules? 
The utilities commission declined to lay out specific penalties when it clarified the timelines in 2020. It rejected a recommendation from a working group including industry representatives and consumer advocates to “clearly indicate that financial penalties” could happen if a utility fails to meet the timelines on 95% of projects.
“The commission must first determine whether timeline certainty is improving,” the decision said. Regulators could set out penalties in the future “if it determines such a construct would support timely interconnection.” 
The commission declined to comment because the case is an “ongoing adjudicatory proceeding,” Adam Cranfill, spokesperson, said.  
Without some kind of punishment, advocates argue, there’s not only no incentive for utilities to follow the rules, there’s a disincentive because of how the money flows.
“From their perspective, solar and storage is competition for them,” Luo said. “Having people with their own solar and storage reduces the need to continually expand the grid and build out transmission lines.” 
California’s rooftop solar industry has been mired in controversy in recent years because of the state’s “net energy metering” program, which governs how much utilities are required to pay solar customers for extra energy their panels generate. The program is meant to incentivize adopting renewable energy sources and offset the significant cost of rooftop solar, but utilities argued it creates an unfair cost burden for those without solar who pay more for costs such as grid maintenance. As a result, the current iteration of the program pays out significantly less than prior versions.
Three environmental groups sued over the change, and the California Supreme Court ruled last month that the lower courts should reexamine the case’s details instead of deferring to utility regulators.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/102621-Renewable-Energy-AP-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C676&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-07 08:57:39.184439

The Sonoma County company Resynergi says it will depart the state, just as Gov. Newsom sends CalRecycle back to the drawing board on potentially nation-leading rules governing plastic waste and plastic products. 


The plan sounded like a magic bullet from the future to solve one of the world’s most vexing environmental waste problems. 
In Rohnert Park, just north of San Francisco, a startup company called Resynergi planned to use a form of “advanced recycling” to reuse plastic. Its process would chemically transform old plastic, blasting bits of it with microwaves until they turned into an oil that could then be used to make new plastic. 
But the process – known as pyrolysis – was a hard sell to Sonoma County neighbors, who protested so much that the company withdrew its application and now plans to move out of state. 
The fight that boiled over in Rohnert Park in recent months is a window into the tensions ahead for California as the state overhauls nation-leading regulations governing plastic pollution and packaging. (CalRecycle, formally known as the Department of Resources Recovery and Recycling, will hold a public hearing about those rules Oct. 7.) 
While California is establishing some of the most forward-thinking plastic responsibility and recycling rules in the country, a dirty secret is that most plastic recycling methods are ineffective at best and illusory at worst. 
Millions of tons of plastic go to the state’s landfills each year, and millions more are shipped to Southeast Asia, where plastic is rarely recycled. Instead it is illegally dumped, and often burned.
Last year, Attorney General Rob Bonta brought suit against ExxonMobil for “perpetuating the myth … that you can recycle plastics, including single use plastics, and that it’s sustainable and good for the environment … It’s not true. It’s a lie.” ExxonMobil has since countersued Bonta for defamation.
California’s regulators, meanwhile, are working to implement a 2022 state law that moves the state toward a circular economy for plastic – by making companies that produce packaging and single-use plastic items responsible for what happens to them after people throw them away. Those companies, along with environmental groups, have been weighing in as CalRecycle has been writing regulations, now years in the making.  
Recent comments by Gov. Gavin Newsom suggest the state is aiming to strike a balance, finding a way to encourage recycling companies while hitting the state’s goals – all while avoiding more air pollution or other environmental impacts. 
As for Resynergi, local and environmental advocates say that the way local, county, and regional regulators handled the company points up the challenges the state will face as it regulates plastic and defines whether and how it can be recycled. 
“It does make me nervous, since it took seven years to get any enforcement on a facility that’s a two hour drive from the Capitol,” said Nick Lapis, advocacy director for Californians Against Waste. 
A credible solution to plastic waste? 
Resynergi’s departure came as Sonoma County officials began to ask more serious questions about its operations, almost a decade after the company first arrived. 
In 2017, company founder Brian Bauer chose Rohnert Park, a small, middle-class community surrounded by farmland, to develop and test his process.
He set up shop in a development called SOMO Village – a 200-acre neighborhood with homes, a high school, and commercial space. Developers market it as a climate-conscious place, built to be carbon-neutral, which Bauer said was a draw for Resynergi.  
In early conversations, according to Bauer, Sonoma County officials “suggested” his business could follow simpler recycling guidelines. Sheri Cardo, a spokesperson for Sonoma County’s Department of Health Services, confirmed the department had talked with Bauer about its operations as a recycling research and development site, and that his characterization was accurate.  
In 2023, when Bauer sought to expand operations, he approached the city of Rohnert Park’s planning division for permits. 
Officials told Bauer his facility was considered a heavy manufacturing site, and that Resynergi’s location – 600 feet from a school – demanded an environmental review, according to documents obtained by residents through a public records request. In a response late last year,  Resynergi argued that such a review could take too long, and moving quickly “could make or break substantial investment from a large strategic investor.”
Within a month, planning officials had flipped and were now siding with Resynergi, granting it a more flexible, less burdensome administrative use permit. The decision avoided additional public review. 
But to operate legally, Resynergi had to secure approval from county officials and the regional air district.
In California, pyrolysis is classified as a type of incineration, associated with toxic and hazardous waste. Businesses must obtain a solid waste permit from local authorities, who enforce the state’s public resources code. In the past, three facilities have received permits to use pyrolysis, two for the purpose of destroying medical waste. All are now closed, according to CalRecycle.
California counties issue waste permits on behalf of CalRecycle. The Bay Area Regional Air Quality Management District permits and controls pollution that microwaving plastic could produce.

County officials started looking into the company when they realized Resynergi’s plans would make the company a fully operational and “fixed component in the county’s waste system,” said Cardo, the county spokesperson. 
“Although your facility might be considered a recycling facility in vernacular language, it is not under state law,” wrote Christine Sosko, Sonoma County’s director of environmental health.
CalRecycle spokesman Lance Klug said in an email that Sonoma County’s response followed state standards.
But environmental advocates say the way city and county officials handled Resynergi reflects regulators’ confusion about the processes for advanced recycling  – confusion fueled by the plastic industry.  
Jane Williams, director of California Communities Against Toxics, argues that federal and state law make it clear that pyrolysis facilities have to follow rules as incinerators. “It’s really interesting for me to see, having worked on these incinerators for so long, how these guys pulled strings,” Williams said. “They pulled whatever out of their pockets so they could convince people this is a recycling facility.” 
The American Chemistry Council, a trade group supporting the plastic industry, disagrees. And Resynergi’s Bauer said he doesn’t think his company’s process counts as incineration. 
“Communities across California and the country are searching for credible solutions to plastic waste,” Bauer wrote in an open letter to the community. “This city has the chance to lead by example.” 
Community fears toxic air pollution 
People living in and near SOMO Village found out that Resynergi planned to burn plastic on a larger scale when the Bay Area Air Quality Management District notified the public of the company’s permit application.
The community protested, filling city council rooms at each meeting and waving signs depicting polluting smoke stacks. Some parents spoke through tears to their city leaders. “Our air is not your experiment,” one poster read. 
Among the local opponents of Resynergi was Stephanie Lennox. She lives about 20 minutes from Rohnert Park in rural Forestville, but her two daughters go to Credo High School right next to the facility. She wondered about emissions and the risk of an explosion. 
“My Lord, don’t we need a solution to our global plastic pollution,” Lennox said. “But my daughters’ lungs are not part of your beta testing phase for your ‘world’s global plastic solution.’”

Local organizers said they wanted city and county leaders to follow state law and the federal Clean Air Act.  
When plastic is burned, additives like flame retardants or other chemicals that don’t break down can create toxic emissions, said Veena Singla, a researcher at the University of California San Francisco.
Resynergi applied to the regional air district to obtain a permit for pollution control equipment in April, after the company had already begun operating their technology.
In August, the air district issued three notices of violation to Resynergi for constructing and operating without a permit. 
Bauer admitted to operating the equipment without a permit. The company never burned plastic in Rohnert Park he said; it did burn plastic at “prototype levels” in Santa Rosa.
But, Bauer added, Resynergi was trying to follow the rules as he understood them. As a startup, he said, “you don’t even know if you will get a prototype to work. You’re also trying to figure out how the permitting process works.” 
Millions spent to sway regulations 
Resynergi’s departure wasn’t because of a community outcry, Bauer said. The turning point, he said, was “the pull from other states; how they treated climate technologies such as ours …combined with the overall culture of accepting what we’re doing.”
Plastics manufacturers and industry advocates like the American Chemistry Council have campaigned to redefine terms and loosen environmental regulations for the process Resynergi is developing. After the lobbying, 27 states have reclassified pyrolysis as manufacturing instead of solid waste operations, said Davis Allen, a researcher for the Center for Climate Integrity. That classification helps operators get around federal air requirements, he added. 
Resynergi’s Bauer told CalMatters that “one of those (states) is a candidate,” and that the company will move out by the end of the year.   
An analysis by the climate accountability newsletter HEATED found the chemistry council and groups aligned with it have spent as much as $30 million to promote the concept of advanced recycling as a mainstream and established one. That language aims to sway not just state laws, but federal clean air policy as well.  
Between 2021 and 2022, when lawmakers were discussing plastic producer legislation, the American Chemistry Council spent more than $1.6 million on lobbying state legislators, according to publicly available data published by the Secretary of State.
The American Chemistry Council’s Ross Eisenberg says that pyrolysis and other chemical recycling processes do work. These processes turn “hard-to-recycle plastics into the raw materials for high-quality products while reducing greenhouse-gas emissions and fossil energy use during production compared with virgin production,” he said. 
“America’s plastic makers are investing billions of dollars to modernize and expand recycling capacity and improve efficiency,” Eisenberg said, adding that the companies are “advocating for smart policies that enhance collection and sorting so more plastics can be remade into new products.”
This year, the Environmental Protection Agency said it isn’t taking further action on the matter, but industry representatives said they’ll continue to lobby at the federal level.
Ambitious rules and tough realities for plastic
California’s goals to reduce plastic pollution and make producers responsible for plastic waste are ambitious in size, scope, and speed. Within seven years, state law seeks to reduce plastic packaging by 25%, make single-use plastic packaging 100% recyclable or compostable, and divert most of that packaging into recycling. 
Allen, from the Center for Climate Integrity, says laws like this can be a good idea – as long as regulators focus more on reducing plastics and less on recycling them. 
“Almost any solution that is based on the idea that plastics can widely be recycled just isn’t really going to work,” Allen said. “There just aren’t easily available solutions to a lot of the problems that limit the effectiveness of recycling.”

But in March, regulations aimed at achieving the state’s goals were dealt a setback after two years of hearings. The day they were due, Gov. Newsom directed CalRecycle to start the regulatory process over. 
The governor asked for changes “to minimize costs for small businesses and families – while ensuring California’s bold recycling law can achieve the critical goal of cutting plastic pollution,” said Daniel Villaseñor, a spokesperson for the governor, in an email to CalMatters.
The Plastics Industry Association and the American Chemistry Council hailed the governor’s announcement as an opportunity. “We believe California’s regulations should be clear, technology-neutral, and performance-based,” said the council’s Ross Eisenberg.
According to Klug, the CalRecycle spokesman, the state “remains committed to fostering business innovation that promotes a safe and clean future for all Californians.” 
But environmental organizations like the Monterey Bay Aquarium and Surfrider called the decision disappointing. 
Williams, the California Communities Against Toxics activist, said she’s concerned that more recent draft language may encourage pyrolysis facilities like Resynergi, which, she says, don’t belong in the state.   
If California “rolls out the red carpet,” she said, “The only thing that will stop a whole new fleet of incinerators being built in California now is open, persistent community opposition.” 
Resynergi also took part in CalRecycle workshops for the regulations. The company’s departure announcement praised the “innovative spirit of California … instrumental in the company’s growth.” 
Brian Bauer said he’s hopeful the state plastic regulations will ease regulations for companies like his, but he plans to return to California either way. 
“So it might be a couple years,” Bauer said. “We’ll be back to California in due time.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/082725_Rohnert-Park-Incinerator_CS_CM_06.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-07 08:57:39.184439

(Anna Barrett/Alabama Reflector)In the wake of a Montgomery shooting that left two dead and 12 injured, elected Republican officials accused city leaders of ignoring the problem. 
“These events underscore, once again, that our capital city is in crisis. Though the blame lies with those who carelessly pulled the triggers, I continue to be troubled by the city leadership’s stubborn refusal to acknowledge they have a serious problem,” Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall wrote Sunday. “While I believe that local law enforcement is doing the best they can, the people of Montgomery deserve leaders who are competent, accountable and committed to restoring law and order.”
At a press conference Sunday afternoon, Montgomery Mayor Steven Reed said that Marshall is welcome to meet with him to share solutions, and noted the state Legislature in 2022 had effectively ended concealed carry permit requirements for firearms.

“I don’t know that one could look at our record objectively and what we’ve done with our city council and say that there’s a refusal to acknowledge crime is an issue in the city of Montgomery,” Reed said Sunday. “I need solutions, and he’s willing to offer some solutions around bail and bond reform. I’m open. We’ve been talking about that for several years. So offer some solutions around permitless carry, I’m open.”
The Metro Area Crime Suppression (MACS) Unit was created in 2024 to help reduce crime in Montgomery, and decreased violent crime by 30%, according to a June press release.
Gov. Kay Ivey in a statement Monday morning said more will be done, threatening intervention in the state’s capital. 
“To start, in addition to our active MACS Unit, I have asked my ALEA Secretary Hal Taylor to extend the patrol area for our Capitol Troopers to include other key downtown areas,” Ivey said. “I will plan on asking the Legislature to support additional resources to allow our state law enforcement presence to be more effective in downtown Montgomery.”
Chip Hill, Reed’s former chief of staff, said in an interview that while he was on staff from January 2020 to October 2024, the city did as much as it could. He said as soon as Reed took office, they replaced all out-of-date police cars, rearmed the police and invested more money in the police department. The Montgomery Police Department got $49.3 million from the city budget in fiscal year 2020; MPD is scheduled to get $62.2 million in the 2026 fiscal year, which began last week, an increase of about 26% over 2020. 
“So everything we had the power to do something about we did,” Hill said.










We tried to pass an ordinance and we tried to restrict guns altogether, because our thought was, if we have a restriction on an area, then you're able to guard that area and check people as they come in. So then you're able to limit it and check it. It was just frustrating when people constantly criticize, but they don't want to give you the tools.

Montgomery City Council passed an ordinance in September 2024 that required those that carry weapons to also carry a photo ID within the city’s entertainment district, which includes the part of downtown where the mass shooting happened Saturday. The state forced the city to repeal the ordinance, Hill said, under a law that prohibits local governments from restricting the state’s gun laws.
“We tried to pass an ordinance and we tried to restrict guns altogether, because our thought was, if we have a restriction on an area, then you’re able to guard that area and check people as they come in. So then you’re able to limit it and check it,” Hill said. “It was just frustrating when people constantly criticize, but they don’t want to give you the tools.”
Alabama’s high gun violence rates
Alabama has long had some of the nation’s highest gun violence rates. The state had the fourth-highest firearm death rate in the nation in 2023, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, at 25.6 deaths per 100,000. More people died by gunfire in Alabama that year than in New York State, which has nearly four times Alabama’s population.  
Weak state regulations contribute to Alabama’ ranking by the Giffords Law Center, an organization that tracks gun laws and violence in the United States, as some of the weakest gun laws in the country. 
Reed said in a statement Monday afternoon that while there is no law that could have prevented the shooting, legislation could help.
“But real safety requires more than additional troopers or task forces—it requires the courage to confront the culture of easy access to guns and a lack of responsibility among those who carry them. Montgomery is strong, and we will continue leading from the front to make our capital city safer for everyone,” Reed said.
Hill said the city tried to work with the Legislature for years to limit the number of weapons in Montgomery, but never passed a law. The only gun safety law the Legislature has passed since 2010 is a ban on Glock switches, a modification that makes a hand gun fire like a machine gun, which passed this spring.
Miguel Diaz-Lucier, the city’s communications director, said in an interview Monday that there is no current law that could have prevented Saturday’s mass shooting.
“If you’re in public, anybody can have a gun, and police can’t check you. If you’re on the streets, they can’t do anything to you,” Diaz-Lucier said. “I’m not sure what you do, except for the Legislature, maybe they can come up with a law that’ll do something.”
Diaz-Lucier said that even if the city had more authority to prevent gun violence, the capital is at a disadvantage in revenue compared to other major Alabama cities due to not being able to use property taxes on state buildings in the city for its budget. 
“The Legislature decided that they were not going to allow any cities to have an occupational tax at the same time that we passed it, so even though our council passed it, it made it a moot point,” Diaz-Lucier said. “The occupational tax would have given us some extra funds that we don’t have access to. So it’s kind of the situation we are in as a city.”
Messages seeking comment from Rep. Tashina Morris, D-Montgomery, and Sen. Kirk Hatcher, D-Montgomery, were left Monday morning. Rep. Phillip Ensler, D-Montgomery, said in an interview Monday afternoon that there is no single solution to gun violence.
“I think it has to be an all of the above approach of willing to look at different solutions from a family and individual level all the way up to certain things the state can do,” Ensler said. “Just acknowledge that none of those things alone is going to stop every situation, but collectively, it can make a difference, and people need to be open minded to that.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_0565-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-07 08:57:39.184439
,California,2025-10-07 12:01:00+00:00,CalMatters,Refinery fire spotlights California’s gas supply crunch and high prices at the pump,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/10/refinery-fire-gas-prices-california/,Damage from the Chevron El Segundo refinery fire hasn't been tallied yet. But gas prices are likely to soar anyway because two other refineries are closing.,"Thankfully, last week’s explosion and fire at California’s second largest refinery, Chevron’s El Segundo plant, was not an environmental catastrophe. But it could have serious economic and political impact.
It occurred as Gov. Gavin Newsom and other Democratic figures were in the midst of a 180-degree political pirouette: a shift from denouncing makers of gasoline as price gouging polluters, to beseeching them to continue production.
California once had dozens of refineries, but today nine are still producing gasoline, diesel fuel and jet fuel for airlines and military warplanes. Two have announced plans to shut down within a few months.
Valero’s refinery and the Phillips 66 plant in Southern California together represent about 17% of the state’s refining capacity, according to the California Energy Commission. State legislators reportedly have offered Valero state subsidies to keep its Benicia refinery in operation, fearing closure would raise Californians’ already high gas prices.
Chevron’s damaged El Segundo plant, if closed, would double the loss in refinery capacity to more than a third of the state’s total, causing a supply crunch that would assuredly result in higher pump prices.
California’s 30-million-plus cars and light trucks average 340 billion miles of travel each year and burn 13 billion gallons of gas, all but a trickle of which comes from the nine refineries. There are no pipelines to bring in fuel from other states, and importing gasoline from Asia or the Middle East via tankers is fraught with uncertainty and high costs.
Newsom, backed by fellow Democrats in the Legislature, spent months excoriating refiners for high prices, even though the state’s very high fuel taxes create much of the gap between prices in California and those in other states. Newsom called a special session of the Legislature to pass legislation that he said would penalize profits deemed to be too high.
The official criticism seemed to meld with the state’s declared intention to phase out gasoline-fueled cars in favor of those powered by electricity, thus shutting down oil production and gasoline refineries. Newsom’s administration has said that by 2035 the sale of new gas-powered cars would be banned.
The evolution Newsom envisions, however, also requires the state to continue some refining until the last of the state’s gasoline-powered cars are permanently parked, raising questions about how the change would be managed.
The Phillips 66 and Valero announcements forced the issue. The state’s politicians realized that a rapid decline in refinery capacity could send gas prices soaring, thereby creating a political backlash. Newsom’s evident presidential ambitions would be hammered by a sharp price spike.
Accordingly, in the last days of the legislative session, Newsom and legislators backtracked, passing measures to boost petroleum production. More recently, Newsom signed legislation to make gas with 15% ethanol available, saying it would lower prices by up to 20 cents a gallon. Apparently, legislators also have been feeling out Valero about some state subsidies for its Benicia plant, but so far they’ve had no success.
Chevron, whose refineries in El Segundo and Richmond have about a third of the state’s refining capacity, moved its headquarters from California to Texas last year and has made no secret about its disdain for California’s anti-petroleum policies, while dropping hints that it may close one of its two plants.
The extent of fire damage at Chevron’s El Segundo refinery, and the effect on gasoline supply and prices, are still unclear. However, it’s a reminder of how tight California’s gas supply has become and how cataclysmic the closure of its refineries could be — economically and politically.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/100225-El-Segundo-Fire-AP-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-07 08:57:39.184439

From kiosks designed to speed customer check-in to vibrant casino games, Nevada’s tourism industry is putting artificial intelligence to work.  But one of AI’s potential best uses – its ability to assimilate massive amounts of data and identify patterns that could detect fraud and money laundering – is taking a back seat to automating table games and replacing bartenders.  
“AI is being used on the operations side, but not necessarily on the compliance side,” says attorney Michael Beckwith of Dickinson Wright, who is speaking Tuesday at the Global Gaming Expo in Las Vegas about maximizing the ability of AI to analyze massive amounts of data, discern patterns, and detect other cues valuable to casinos in preventing fraud and money laundering. He says casinos are already employing AI technologies for those purposes “but not on the large scale, and not the most cutting edge technology.”
The hang up, according to Beckwith, is a perceived lack of profitability in ferreting out fraud. 
“There just isn’t that much money in it,” he says, adding investment in AI is likely “to go to the operation side of casinos first. Eventually, if there’s a benefit there, maybe it filters back to compliance.” 
A study published by MIT found most efforts to grow revenue via AI are a bust, with only about 5% of AI pilot programs driving substantial increases in revenue. 
“Most projects die in pilot purgatory. Meanwhile, headlines are warning of an ‘AI bubble,’ and some investors are shorting AI stocks on the idea that generative AI’s big enterprise moment is already stalling out,” Forbes reports. 
AI, and its subfield, ML (machine earning), a form of AI that uses algorithms to learn from data, recognize patterns, and make predictions, are used by some casinos. Their use by compliance executives and crooks remains a double edged sword for the gambling industry. 
In casinos, AI can speed up ‘Know Your Customer’ protocol via biometrics and rapidly analyze identification sources. It can identify customers with a history of criminal activity. Additionally, it can monitor transactions to flag efforts to avoid cash reporting thresholds, and large cash deposits that are cashed out in casino chips after minimal play. It can also reduce work for compliance executives by automating Suspicious Activity Reports.
Criminals, on the other hand, are upping their game through the use of AI. 
In Vietnam, a gambling ring evaded biometric ID measures by generating deep fake videos courtesy of AI, and online gamblers have been known to create fake identities, complete with forged documents, for the purpose of opening accounts.
The International Gaming Institute at UNLV intends to “explore everything from the opportunities of the technology for the industry to the risks of the technology as well,” says Kasra Ghaharian, IGI’s Director of Research. “How is the industry currently using AI? How are they thinking about using it? What do they think is going to be the impact on the workforce? Where are they seeing significant returns on their AI investments?”
Additionally, IGI wants input from policy makers and regulators to learn if gambling regulation is equipped to deal with the technology in “upholding regulatory principles such as keeping gambling safe and protecting the public from potential harms,” Ghaharian says. He warns that operators must be deterred from crossing ethical lines in which AI is used to exploit vulnerable gamblers. 
IGI’s findings are expected to be released in a report to be presented next year at the International Conference on Gambling and Risk Taking. 
“While AI is still a developing technology, its capability to identify behavioral patterns and transactional anomalies in real-time could potentially help analyze betting trends and movement of funds across platforms that could be beneficial in combatting (sic) money laundering,” Nevada Gaming Control Board chairman Mike Dreitzer said via email. 
Crime pays 
Despite the potential assistance from AI, not all casinos are eager to throw out ‘undesirable’ players. 
“it’s the casino’s job to make sure that they keep unwanted people out. And if they’re not, it’s almost like they’re letting tainted money come in,” illegal bookmaker Matt Bowyer told the Current last week, just days before he is scheduled to report to prison to serve a one-year sentence for money laundering.
Bowyer, an associate, and another illegal bookie, Damien LeForbes, lost close to $24 million in ill-gotten gains at Resorts World in a little more than two years. The casino, which intentionally altered records to conceal Bowyer’s source of income, according to a complaint filed against the casino by regulators, incurred a $10.5 million fine from the Nevada Gaming Commission.
“Resorts World made $14 million but I’m going to prison,” Bowyer observed.” I was committing a different crime than they were, but what they did is still a crime. Let’s be real. They were definitely allowing money laundering. They were allowing illegal bookmakers to play.”
Dreitzer of the GCB declined to comment when asked whether the state’s fine was sufficient to deter licensees from allowing gamblers to play with dirty money. 
Under President Donald Trump’s administration, an anticipated non-prosecution agreement between Resorts World and the DOJ has yet to materialize. 
Beckwith, a former prosecutor for the Eastern District of California, acknowledges AI “is only as good as the humans overseeing it. And we want human oversight. Red flags may come up and they may be ignored, but there’s going to be a history of them. The records are easily attainable, like a bank record. Using AI would likely encourage better behavior.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2210332783-1024x540.jpg,,,2025-10-07 08:57:39.184439

(Ralph Chapoco/Alabama Reflector)Michael Moss got a certificate on Friday and was freed from confinement after spending about  eight years in prison.
“I still didn’t think I was going to make it,” Moss said about his parole application. “It was my fourth time going up and I finally made it,”
But as a condition of  release, the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles required Moss to complete the Perry County Parole and Probation Reentry Education and Employment Program (PREP), a 90-day residential curriculum to assist with the transition back into the community.

“I had a bad drug problem, and it led me to prison,” he said. “I made bad choices. Coming here and into this program, it turned my whole life around. I got a job waiting for me. This is as long as I have been sober. I have gotten a lot of support.”
Moss, along with roughly 50 of his colleagues, is one of more than 400 people who have graduated from the PREP Center over the last five years.
The recidivism rate for those who have completed the program thus far is zero, which means that no one who has gone through the training and classes has been reincarcerated.
The re-entry program was established by Cam Ward, director of the Alabama Bureau of Pardons and Paroles, who was looking for a way to enhance public safety and assist those who are considered a higher risk to reoffend because of their background and criminal histories.
“I saw this work in other states,” Ward said. “I was actually in Michigan and saw it. I have seen it in other place, and my vision was, ‘We have day reporting centers now, we are about to open up our 13th one in Shelby County, but if we had a residential, we could do really intensive job training program that some people need, high risk individuals.’”
Given its success, the Perry County PREP center has become a cornerstone of the effort by Ward and staff at the Alabama Bureau of Pardons and Paroles to continue to draw down the state’s recidivism rate by drawing lessons from both its successes and its failures.
The individuals ordered by the parole board to complete rehabilitation at the center are transported to the facility once they are released from the custody of the Alabama Department of Corrections. They are taken through intake and checked for contraband and processed before getting escorted to the dormitories where they will remain for the next three months.
The PREP center operates in a similar way to a college, complete with classes and workshops hosted by organizations that the Alabama Bureau of Pardons and Paroles partnered with to oversee specialized parts of the curriculum. The goal is to provide students with the skills they need to successfully reenter into their communities.
Each weekday, students are transported to a campus in Thomasville where they will attend a variety of courses for the day. Among them classes related to substance abuse and cognitive behavioral therapy.
Jeremy Grant, who graduated alongside Moss on Friday, spent three years in prison for a parole revocation. He won parole in June.
“My stepfather was abusive, and there was unforgiveness and things in my life that I had to let go of and understand the core reason why I was addicted to drugs,” Grant said. “Drugs are really just a symptom of the problem, and unless you get to the bottom of it, you will never know what the real problem is.”

Grant completed the rehabilitation program like Moss and he has lined up two jobs in construction.
Program participants also enroll in career and technical training programs.
The results garnered by the residential rehabilitation program are a factor in reducing the state’s recidivism rate, which went from 34% to 29%, placing it 12th in the country.
Alabama participates in Reentry 2030 with the stated goal of reducing recidivism in the state to less than 15%. This rehabilitation program, given what the graduates have accomplished, will set the foundation for that goal.
“If we replicate this, and do this kind of programming, we will get there,” Ward said.
The key will be to apply lessons from the residential program to other people who have been paroled but report to the other centers in Alabama.
“Some people require more intensive supervision,” Ward said. “You have to check on them in their home. You do more drug testing. Accountability is the key.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_7451-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-07 08:57:39.184439

Dean Plocher, a Republican from Des Peres, is among the 17 applicants for the circuit judge vacancy in St. Louis County created when Thomas Albus was appointed U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Missouri. A judicial commission will interview the candidates, narrow the field to three nominees and then submit those names to Gov. Mike Kehoe for consideration. 
If he makes it through the process and is appointed to the job by Kehoe, it would be a return to the bench for Plocher. In 2005, he was appointed to serve as a municipal judge in the 21st Judicial Circuit in St. Louis County. He ran successfully for the House in 2015, replacing Republican John Diehl after he was forced to resign for sending sexually charged text messages to a 19-year-old House intern.
Plocher eventually rose to become speaker of the Missouri House, the most powerful job in the legislature. 
Records show Dean Plocher charged the state for travel already paid for by his campaign

During his time as speaker, Plocher was accused of trying to steer an $800,000 software contract for the House around the standard bidding process. It was later revealed he’d illegally sought taxpayer reimbursement from the legislature for airfare, hotels and other travel costs already paid for by his campaign.
He also faced criticism for spending $60,000 remodelling his office and turning another office into a makeshift storage room stocked with liquor, beer, wine and soda.
Plocher denied any wrongdoing, but the allegations sparked a months-long ethics investigation. Though it was ultimately dismissed, the Republican legislator leading the investigation said Plocher pressured potential witnesses and used his office to obstruct the inquiry. 
The scandals that plagued Plocher’s final year in the legislature also inspired a pair of whistleblower lawsuits. 
One, filed by the former chief clerk of the House, alleged harassment and intimidation during battles with Plocher over ethics charges and hiring decisions. It was dismissed in December, though that decision has been appealed. 
The second, filed by a current legislative employee, alleges retaliation, threats and abuse after reporting alleged illegal behavior and mismanagement of public resources to the ethics committee. The employee also alleges being pressured by a lawmaker to violate the Missouri Sunshine Law to keep public documents out of the hands of the media. 
That litigation is ongoing with a hearing on a motion to dismiss scheduled next month. 
Plocher ran unsuccessfully for Missouri secretary of state last year, finishing third in the GOP primary. In his final weeks in the legislature, Plocher attempted to make last-minute hires, change House ethics policies and refused to sign off on legislative pay raises.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/031424_Plocher1-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-10-07 07:59:30.869928

(Photo by Ariana Figueroa/States Newsroom)President Donald Trump set the tone for his second term by issuing 26 executive orders, four proclamations and 12 memorandums on his first day back in office. The barrage of unilateral presidential actions has not yet let up.
These have included Trump’s efforts to remove thousands of government workers and fire several prominent officials, such as members of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and the chair of the Commission on Civil Rights. He has also attempted to shut down entire agencies, such as the Department of Education and the U.S. Agency for International Development.
For some scholars, these actions appear rooted in the psychology of an unrestrained politician with an overdeveloped ego.
But it’s more than that.
As a political science scholar who studies presidential power, I believe Trump’s recent actions mark the culmination of the unitary executive theory, which is perhaps the most contentious and consequential constitutional theory of the past several decades.
 A prescription for a potent presidency

In 2017, Trump complained that the scope of his power as president was limited: “You know, the saddest thing is that because I’m the president of the United States, I am not supposed to be involved with the Justice Department. I am not supposed to be involved with the FBI, I’m not supposed to be doing the kind of things that I would love to be doing. And I’m very frustrated by it.”
The unitary executive theory suggests that such limits wrongly curtail the powers of the chief executive.
Formed by conservative legal theorists in the 1980s to help President Ronald Reagan roll back liberal policies, the unitary executive theory promises to radically expand presidential power.
There is no widely agreed upon definition of the theory. And even its proponents disagree about what it says and what it might justify. But in its most basic version, the unitary executive theory claims that whatever the federal government does that is executive in nature – from implementing and enforcing laws to managing most of what the federal government does – the president alone should personally control it.
This means the president should have total control over the entire executive branch, with its dozens of major governmental institutions and millions of employees. Put simply, the theory says the president should be able to issue orders to subordinates and to fire them at will.
The president could boss around the FBI or order the U.S. attorney general to investigate his political opponents, as Trump has done. The president could issue signing statements – a written pronouncement – that reinterpret or ignore parts of the laws, like George W. Bush did in 2006 to circumvent a ban on torture. The president could control independent agencies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Consumer Product Safety Commission. The president might be able to force the Federal Reserve to change interest rates, as Trump has suggested. And the president might possess inherent power to wage war as he sees fit without a formal authorization from Congress, as officials argued during Bush’s presidency.
 A constitutionally questionable doctrine

A theory is one thing. But if it gains the official endorsement of the Supreme Court, it can become governing orthodoxy. It appears to many observers and scholars that Trump’s actions have intentionally invited court cases by which he hopes the judiciary will embrace the theory and thus permit him to do even more. And the current Supreme Court appears ready to grant that wish.
Until recently, the judiciary tended to indirectly address the claims that now appear more formally as the unitary executive theory.
During the country’s first two centuries, courts touched on aspects of the theory in cases such as Kendall v. U.S. in 1838, which limited presidential control of the postmaster general, and Myers v. U.S. in 1926, which held that the president could remove a postmaster in Oregon.
In 1935, in Humphrey’s Executor v. U.S., the high court unanimously held that Congress could limit the president’s ability to fire a commissioner of the Federal Trade Commission. And in Morrison v. Olson the court in 1988 upheld the ability of Congress to limit the president’s ability to fire an independent counsel.
Some of those decisions aligned with some unitary executive claims, but others directly repudiated them.
 Warming up to a unitary executive

In a series of cases over the past 15 years, the Supreme Court has moved in an unambiguously unitarian, pro-presidential direction. In these cases, the court has struck down statutory limits on the president’s ability to remove federal officials, enabling much greater presidential control.
These decisions clearly suggest that long-standing, anti-unitarian landmark decisions such as Humphrey’s are on increasingly thin ice. In fact, in Justice Clarence Thomas’ 2019 concurring opinion in Seila Law LLC v. CFPB, where the court ruled the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s leadership structure was unconstitutional, he articulated his desire to “repudiate” the “erroneous precedent” of Humphrey’s.
Several cases from the court’s emergency docket, or shadow docket, in recent months indicate that other justices share that desire. Such cases do not require full arguments but can indicate where the court is headed.
In Trump v. Wilcox, Trump v. Boyle and Trump v. Slaughter, all from 2025, the court upheld Trump’s firing of officials from the National Labor Relations Board, the Merit Systems Protection Board, the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the Federal Trade Commission.
Previously, these officials had appeared to be protected from political interference.
 Total control

Remarks by conservative justices in those cases indicated that the court will soon reassess anti-unitary precedents.
In Trump v. Boyle, Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote, “whether this Court will narrow or overrule a precedent … there is at least a fair prospect (not certainty, but at least a reasonable prospect) that we will do so.” And in her dissent in Trump v. Slaughter, Justice Elena Kagan said the conservative majority was “raring” to overturn Humphrey’s and finally officially embrace the unitary executive.
In short, the writing is on the wall, and Humphrey’s may soon go the way of Roe v. Wade and other landmark decisions that had guided American life for decades.
As for what judicial endorsement of the unitary executive theory could mean in practice, Trump seems to hope it will mean total control and hence the ability to eradicate the so-called “deep state.” Other conservatives hope it will diminish the government’s regulatory role.
Kagan recently warned it could mean the end of administrative governance – the ways that the federal government provides services, oversees businesses and enforces the law – as we know it:
“Humphrey’s undergirds a significant feature of American governance: bipartisan administrative bodies carrying out expertise-based functions with a measure of independence from presidential control. Congress created them … out of one basic vision. It thought that in certain spheres of government, a group of knowledgeable people from both parties – none of whom a President could remove without cause – would make decisions likely to advance the long-term public good.”
If the Supreme Court officially makes the chief executive a unitary executive, the advancement of the public good may depend on little more than the whims of the president, a state of affairs normally more characteristic of dictatorship than democracy.

(Photo by New Jersey Monitor)On Monday night in Nutley, Republican gubernatorial hopeful Jack Ciattarelli pitched his gubernatorial candidacy to more than 100 people crowded inside Mamma Vittoria banquet hall.
Ciattarelli, who is making his third bid for the state’s top job, opened his remarks by referencing a group of protestors gathered outside on Franklin Avenue in this Essex County town.
“How disappointed are they going to be in 28 days?” Ciattarelli said to applause from the crowd of his supporters. “Because I’m here to tell you right here, right now, in 28 days, we’re declaring victory. We’re winning this race.”
It’s now four weeks until New Jersey voters decide whether Ciattarelli, a former assemblyman, or Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill, will become our next governor in a race that has become increasingly bitter as both sides claim the other is lying about their record. Rising costs, immigration, Sherrill’s military record, and Ciattarelli’s support of President Donald Trump have dominated the campaign in its most recent weeks.
The two are competing on Nov. 4 to replace outgoing Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat who is wrapping up his two terms as governor in January and cannot seek a third term this year. Vic Kaplan, a Libertarian, and Joanne S. Kuniansky, representing the Socialist Workers Party, will also be on the ballot.










We’re not playing tiddlywinks here. This is New Jersey politics. It’s a rough-and-tumble sport.


– Ben Dworkin, director of Rowan Institute for Public Policy and Citizenship


Sherill told reporters during a campaign stop at Kean University Monday that the large turnout for June’s six-person Democratic gubernatorial primary indicated how eager the party is to remain in power for a third straight term.
“That’s the kind of enthusiasm we’re seeing on the ground. We are working to get that, take that enthusiasm and ensure that every single person gets to the polls,” she said.

Polling edge
Since polling ramped up at the start of September, surveys of the contest have usually shown Sherrill with a sizable single-digit lead.
Though some polls have suggested a closer race — including a tied result from an Emerson College poll released last month — Fairleigh Dickinson University Poll director Dan Cassino believes Sherrill has the edge.
“I think we do see Democrats freaking out and getting worried and being nervous because they’re Democrats in New Jersey and that is their species’ being,” Cassino said. “I don’t think we have any particular reason for them to be nervous, but I think they very much are.”
An Axios report cited private conversations with unnamed Democrats to say the party is increasingly concerned that Sherrill could lose the race. Sherrill brushed the criticism off on Monday, suggesting national Democrats “are in a different place.” 
“This is just the kind of, I think, electorate that is ready to fight hard for the things we care about, and I think we’ll see those results in November,” she said. 
Ashley Koning, director of Rutgers University’s Eagleton Center for Public Interest Polling, warned the race would come down to turnout — something next to impossible to forecast.
“Turnout has never been something that’s predictable, but it certainly is not predictable now, and when you overlay the national political context on top of our race in this state, it is incredibly difficult to get a good handle on where this actually is, other than of course it’s close,” Koning said.
Polls of New Jersey’s 2021 gubernatorial race — when Murphy faced Ciattarelli — mostly missed the mark. Though Real Clear Politics’ polling average showed Murphy up 7.8 points over Ciattarelli, the governor won reelection by just 2.8 points.
Pollsters have made some changes to prevent another miss. Fairleigh Dickinson University’s poll began weighting its results by education and region to more accurately reflect attitudes across the state, Cassino said, though the effect of such changes is so far untested.
There are other reasons to think the race will be close, and the candidates’ increasing acrimony numbers near the top of the list.
Sherrill and Ciattarelli have launched ads seeking to tar their opponent in what Cassino said is a bid to drive down turnout among their rival’s base.
“The fact that it’s turned negative tells you both candidates think this race is up for grabs,” Cassino said, later adding, “This is trying to winnow the electorate down to just the most committed voters because both sides think they have an advantage there.”

Rough and tumble
Turnout in this year’s governor’s race is expected to be low, as is typical for the state’s odd-year elections. In 2021, just 40% of the state’s eligible voters cast ballots in the general election.
But the campaigns’ turn toward mudslinging could also just reflect the growing bitterness of American politics.
“I think that’s what politics is nowadays. I think we have seen more and more nationalized campaigns, including here in the Garden State,” said Koning. “This is just what politics is. This is what it’s expected to be, and that civility and decorum that used to once, potentially, accompany it is gone.”
Ben Dworkin, director of the Rowan Institute for Public Policy and Citizenship, said this year’s negativity hasn’t reached any high-water marks.
“Negative campaigns, contrasts over policies happen all the time. Personal attacks are unfortunate, but they happen in this game. We’re not playing tiddlywinks here,” he said. “This is New Jersey politics. It’s a rough-and-tumble sport.”
Trump could also prove an unpredictable variable in the race.
Sherrill has invoked him often on the campaign trail, hoping to tap the same animus that helped propel her to her first congressional term in 2018. On Monday, she criticized the effect of Trump’s tariffs and the continued federal government shutdown, which Democrats blame on Republicans and Republicans blame on Democrats.
“Voters are seeing Trump is costing them an incredible amount of money, and every time they go to Jack to say, ‘What are you going to do about it?’ his response is largely, ‘I agree with it,’” she said.
Ciattarelli’s mentions of Trump have largely been to mock Sherrill for her focus on him.
“If you get a flat tire on the way home today, it’s President Trump’s fault,” Ciattarelli joked in Nutley. “There’s nothing this woman won’t blame on President Trump.”
Historically, New Jersey backs the governor who doesn’t share the president’s party affiliation. Murphy bucked that trend to win reelection in 2021, but at least some of that win can be attributed to the pandemic, Dworkin said.
The state also rarely selects a governor from the same party three times in a row. New Jersey last did so when Gov. Richard Hughes was elected to succeed Gov. Robert Meyner in 1961.
“I think the fact that we’re really not sure which one of these kinds of trends is going to be dominant reflects the closeness of the race,” Dworkin said.

OAK GROVE — Alabama officials charged with protecting residents from surface impacts of underground coal mining have notified the federal government that they’ve suspended plans to require that expanding mines monitor for potentially explosive methane gas.
The decision is a reversal of the state’s previous agreement with federal regulators spurred by a fatal home explosion above the expanding Oak Grove mine here in rural Jefferson County.
After months of pressure from local residents and close media scrutiny, primarily a lengthy investigation by Inside Climate News, federal officials had issued Alabama a Ten Day Notice, a regulatory action meant to force state officials to address the risks of methane escape from active coal mines.

Longwall mining, fairly common in Alabama’s coalfields, releases methane gas. That risks explosions if it escapes to the surface through cracks in land disturbed by the mining method.
Within days of that December 2024 notice, state officials agreed to require that coal mining companies launch methane monitoring programs across Alabama, giving the operators 90 days to file updated plans outlining how they planned to comply. Later, at the request of the coal lobby, the state’s top mining regulator extended the deadline by six months, giving coal companies until Sept. 30 to file their updated plans.
When that extension was announced, officials with the federal Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement told the state they believed the delay was “excessively lengthy.”
“If your original … response had contained an eight-month response time with little information/justification,” OSMRE’s Birmingham Field Office director wrote to Alabama regulators in March, “it is unlikely that your … response would have been deemed adequate.”
Now, as that extension has come to an end, the state regulator, Alabama Surface Mining Commission director Kathy Love, has notified OSMRE that she has “indefinitely suspended” any requirement for methane monitoring plans.





In a letter obtained by Inside Climate News, Love wrote to the federal agency that she is requesting a formal review of the Ten Day Notice sent to Alabama, which she argued may have been improperly motivated by “media pressure and a citizen’s unknowledgeable complaint.” The Ten Day Notice, Love wrote, was “not warranted or adequately supported and therefore should be withdrawn.”


Though the March 2024 home explosion was an “unfortunate” incident, Love wrote, her agency did not and does not believe that the expanding longwall mine poses an imminent risk to public safety.
Jack Spadaro, a West Virginia-based former top federal mine safety engineer, said that Love’s conclusion could not be further from the truth.
“Shame on her for making that statement,” Spadaro said. “If someone gets blown up and burned alive, that appears to me to be a danger to the health and safety of the public.”

D. Leon Ashford is an attorney representing the family of W.M. Griffice, the grandfather who lost his life as a result of the March 2024 explosion. In a statement, Ashford wrote that Love’s letter contains “factual inaccuracies and misleading statements.” Regulators have known for decades that fugitive methane poses a risk to citizens living above mines and should work to mitigate them, he wrote.
“It is deeply troubling to read what appears to be a complete abandonment by ASMC of its responsibility to protect Alabama citizens from known and preventable harm from the release of fugitive methane,” he wrote. “The Griffice family, along with all the residents of the Warrior River Basin, deserve better. We urge the ASMC to rescind its request for OSMRE to ‘withdraw’ the Ten-Day Notice and implement the actions it previously represented it would take to protect the health and safety of the public.”
The ASMC and its director did not respond to a request for comment on this story.

An ‘unknowledgeable’ citizen

Eighteen months ago, Lisa Lindsay watched as her neighbor stumbled up to her home in rural Alabama. His body, covered in soot, was still smoking. Moments before, she’d felt the shockwaves of a nearby explosion surge through her body.
Tim Griffice, still in shock, told Lindsay and her husband that the explosion at the next-door home of his brother, W.M., had knocked him out of bed. He ran out of the house to the sound of his nephew’s screams, he told them: “Help me! Help me!”

Tim and his nephew, who was inside the home when the explosion occurred, went back into the structure to retrieve W.M. from the flames. About a month later, W.M. Griffice would die from the injuries he suffered that day. His grandson remained in hospital for weeks, recovering from injuries that are expected to impact him for the rest of his life.
Members of the Oak Grove community, including Griffice’s family and the Lindsays, are all certain of what caused that explosion: the coal mine slowly expanding beneath their homes. Griffice’s family has filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the owners of the Oak Grove mine, alleging that their negligence in allowing the escape of explosive methane gas into the Griffice home was to blame.
In court filings, Oak Grove has denied responsibility for the explosion and the resulting loss of life. The mine did not respond to a request for comment on this story.
In the months that followed the explosion and Griffice’s death, neighbors including Lisa Lindsay repeatedly expressed their concerns about their own safety to state and federal officials, begging regulators to implement meaningful reforms that would prevent another tragedy in their community.
In an interview with Inside Climate News, Lindsay said she’s likely the “unknowledgeable” citizen referenced by Love in her letter to OSMRE.
Love’s statement that “there was no imminent danger to the health and safety of the public,” Lindsay said, was “absolutely inaccurate and infuriating.”
Before moving to her current position as ASMC director, Love worked for years at a public accounting firm conducting internal financial audits for coal companies across the state.

Lindsay said she doesn’t claim to be an expert on coal mining, but she added that it only takes common sense to know that what happened to her neighbor has the potential of happening again.
“I admit to being an ‘unknowledgeable citizen.’ I am not a coal mine expert. I do not have years of working relationships in and with the coal mining industry, like many in this situation do have,” Lindsay said. “I just have the privilege of being a citizen of this state and country that gives me the right to ask questions, observe, learn and voice my opinion, even if, and when, it earns me a target on my back. That is part of serving your state, country and fellow citizens that anyone can, and should, do.”

The experts’ view

While Lindsay may not be an expert on coal mining safety, Spadaro has spent years in coal fields across the country, first as a federal coal regulator and now as an expert who consults on cases involving coal mine safety, including methane-related explosions.
He said that without additional regulations requiring methane mitigation and monitoring above the Oak Grove mine, which continues to expand, residents’ safety is at stake.
“There are still hundreds of people at risk in the areas underlying this mine, and they’re all at risk of having something similar happen to them,” he said.
In the absence of state action to address the hazards from the escape of methane, Spadaro believes the federal government should revoke the state’s ability to regulate its own mining and take over the job of keeping residents safe themselves.

“The state of Alabama has failed its mandatory requirement under federal law to protect the public from danger,” he said. “We’ve already had one house explode—a man who caught on fire and died and another person that was severely injured with burns. So the Alabama officials who are not going to require methane monitoring are in violation of federal law.”
Spadaro also balked at Love’s suggestion in the letter to federal officials that implementing methane mitigation and monitoring would be financially prohibitive for coal operators.
“That’s just bulls—,” he said. “It’s not expensive to install methane monitors and venting devices to alleviate these hazards.”
Eva Dillard, a staff attorney for Black Warrior Riverkeeper, a nonprofit environmental organization, called the state’s decision to roll back the monitoring requirement “both astonishing and reckless.”
“Now Alabama mines have been given a pass by the ASMC and can delay indefinitely the enhanced subsidence and methane monitoring requirements that OSMRE imposed to safeguard the public from similar harm,” Dillard said.
She said that federal officials have relied on the anticipated implementation of these safety guardrails in approving other mine expansions in the state. Now, however, these projects will move forward in the absence of meaningful safeguards for residents living atop active mines. Rolling back these reforms, Dillard said, places the finances of coal companies “over the safety of surrounding communities.”
Spadaro said he believes that ASMC’s decision to ask the federal government to withdraw its regulatory action eight months after state regulators agreed to make necessary reforms is happening now simply because they believe the Trump administration will be more likely to side with coal companies over residents who fear for their lives.
“It’s just opportunistic,” Spadaro said. “That’s all there is to it. Alabama wants to defy longstanding regulations and law, which seems to go hand in hand with what the Trump administration does.”
Reading the letter made Spadaro sick to his stomach, he said.
“It’s disgusting that these people who run the Alabama program care so little about the individual who has already been killed and the public that is still facing these kinds of hazards.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/W.M.-Griffice-home-for-March-24-2025-story-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-07 07:59:30.869928

What is the state’s plan for shelter starting now, to ensure people stay alive?
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Isaac Evans-Frantz: Gov. Phil Scott should work with people providing services to unhoused Vermonters — not just provide recommendations.","This commentary is by Isaac Evans-Frantz, of Brattleboro. Evans-Frantz is the clerk of the Brattleboro Selectboard and the director of Action Corps, a nationwide organization that campaigns for U.S. policies to save the lives of people affected by climate disasters and violent conflict. He wrote this commentary as an individual selectboard member — the views represent his own.


On Sept. 10, Gov. Phil Scott announced plans to deliver recommendations for how Burlington can tackle the homelessness crisis. Along with his recommendations, he should take responsibility for the problem in a collaborative fashion, not simply telling one municipality what to do.
In August, Scott came to Windham County. On his itinerary were visits to Grafton Village Cheese, Jelly’s Deli in Londonderry, Jamaica State Park and the Vermont EMS Academy in Newfane. Missing was a visit to a local agency that supports people who are unhoused. 
The day before Scott’s visit to Windham County, President Donald Trump wrote on social media, “The Homeless have to move out, IMMEDIATELY.” He deployed the National Guard to Washington, D.C. and vowed to forcibly remove unhoused people from our nation’s capital.
This summer, here in Vermont, we have seen our state government remove families with young children and senior citizens with oxygen tanks from motels without a plan for a safe place for these Vermonters to go, let alone even a tent, sleeping bag or place to camp. This has stretched social service agencies beyond capacity, and municipalities have struggled with the fallout. 
Since 2020, Vermont’s homeless population has more than tripled in size, the largest increase in any state. A top driver of homelessness here is our housing shortage. A study a few years ago found that my town of Brattleboro, for example, was over 500 housing units short of the need. There’s been important progress, but much more is needed. 
On May 30, the Brattleboro Selectboard voted against urging a veto of H.91. With this decision, a majority of our selectboard voted in support of the legislature’s forward-looking proposed solution to move away from the state-run motel program and to regionalize homeless services. In speaking directly with Brattleboro residents across neighborhoods earlier this year, I heard a consistent message: residents want to see adequate shelter for our neighbors experiencing homelessness. This means planning shelter — including non-congregate options — with plenty of lead time, and in collaboration with our municipality, local service providers and people with lived experience.
I was heartbroken on April 1 when many of our vulnerable neighbors lost access to shelter in motels without the provision of even a tent and sleeping bag. That day, I spoke with Mark Caslin, a lifelong Vermonter and military veteran who had recently survived a serious medical event, who was staying at the Econo Lodge by Exit 1 off of I-91. I have not been able to locate him since, and I fear for his well-being.
This happened again on July 1, when 107 children and medically vulnerable adults in Brattleboro were required to leave their motel rooms. That day, I spoke with several of these individuals. Larry Jones was one. Mr. Jones, who has lived in Windham County for 20 years, relies on an oxygen tank, insulin pump, and walker. He told me he was afraid he would die in the woods. This is not an irrational fear, as he requires electricity to survive, and already we know of a death in neighboring Windsor County as a result of people being required to leave the motels because their annual 80 nights of allotted shelter are up.
We are heading into colder months, with freezing weather just around the corner — well before the December 1 start date for the State of Vermont limited cold-weather provisions. For medically vulnerable people and families with children, survival between now and December 1 will be difficult, and harm will be irreparable. Loss of life among unhoused Vermonters has become far too common. Now is the time to prepare. What is the state’s plan for shelter starting now, to ensure people stay alive?
While there may be differences in approach, there is widespread support for the common goal of ensuring no one in our community dies for lack of shelter.
In past instances, the Scott administration has rushed to stand up emergency shelters, including one last year in Brattleboro that no one used and that wasted Vermonters’ taxpayer dollars. Advanced planning with input from local providers could make a world of difference. We have skilled and knowledgeable organizations here in Brattleboro and around the state; these organizations, and others, have the expertise, data and lived experience to guide more effective solutions.
Along with issuing recommendations for Burlington, the governor should retrace his steps from his 14-county tour and this time speak directly with the social service providers, town staff and people with lived homelessness experience, listen to their recommendations and work collaboratively with a humane and effective approach to ensuring all of our safety in these coming colder months.

(Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)New data show Indiana’s entries into the state’s foster care system increased by 30%, from just over 6,000 children to nearly 7,900 children, between 2023 and 2024 even as the national average fell from 2%. 
The Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System defines an entry as a child who “began an out-of-home care episode” during the time period, which follows the federal fiscal year from Oct. 1 to Sept. 30. 
Between 2023 and 2024, the overall number of children in foster care, measured by those children in care on the last day of the fiscal year, grew from 10,500 children to nearly 12,000 children — a 13% increase.
Nationally, the number of children in foster care during the time fell 3%.
Indiana Department of Child Services Director Adam Krupp called the statistic a “snapshot in time,” noting that rates steadily decreased to a historic low in 2023. 

“That historic low generated a lot of questions,” said Krupp, who was appointed in January by Gov. Mike Braun. “… questions like, ‘Are we doing enough to keep children safe?’”
Krupp emphasized before an interim legislative committee that the safety of children would be the first priority under his leadership. Speaking to the Indiana Capital Chronicle, he noted that a 2023 Evansville neglect arrest made national news after authorities discovered a baby with over 50 rat bites. DCS had been monitoring the family for months but ultimately decided the children should stay in the home.
Three DCS staffers were fired over that case and later sued the state. 
“… that gets national recognition, and there is an expectation and a predicted outcome that you’re going to see an uptick in cases because we need to look at things a little bit differently,” said Krupp. 
He noted that CHINS cases, or Children in Need of Services, had been steady during his tenure, starting at 13,657 in January and falling slightly to 13,510 in August, according to the DCS dashboard. Likewise, the number of children with DCS cases has remained steady during that time, from 16,748 to 16,393.
“It’s hovered in that range for the better part of the last year coming out of what very clearly was an all-time, historic low,” said Krupp. “We’re not going to do anything to swing the pendulum one direction or the other too far. We’re going to prioritize keeping kids safe. And if that means there are 13,510 kids in the system, then that’s what it is.”
 Criticisms of DCS

Even in those years when cases were declining, critics flagged concerns about DCS “tear(ing) apart families at rates well above the national average.” 
With the 30% increase, the National Coalition for Child Protection Reform noted that families were separated at the sixth-highest rate in the country, specifically saying Indiana’s caseworkers “confuse poverty with neglect,” citing an IndyStar story about “missed red flags” in a foster home.
Nearly four out of every five Black Hoosier kids will experience a maltreatment investigation during their childhood, higher than the statewide average for other races and above the national average of 53% for all Black children. 
The 2023 study, spanning from 2015 to 2019, analyzed state-level differences in child welfare agencies. In response to the study, DCS noted that its care rate for Black children had fallen in the following years.
Black Hoosier children top the nation for likelihood of DCS investigation

Richard Wexler, the executive director of the National Coalition for Child Protection Reform, calls child protection agencies “state family police,” and flagged the new foster care entry data in a blog post. 
“None of this is because Indiana is a cesspool of depravity with vastly more child abuse than the national average,” said Wexler in the post. “In fact, in Indiana in 2023, 86% of the time, when children were thrown into foster care, their parents were not even accused of physical or sexual abuse. Forty percent of the time, there wasn’t even an allegation of drug abuse.”
Krupp said that, in response to that criticism, he’d explicitly told DCS employees, “we’re not policing poverty.”
“It’s about safety. And just because a home that you walk into to perform an assessment for a report that came through the hotline — that home might look very different from what you grew up in or what you are familiar with,” said Krupp. “That does not mean they are neglecting their child in that home. It’s just different.”
Upon seeing a home with no functioning plumbing or without heat, “an overzealous individual” might try to remove a child, said Krupp. 
“Whereas we can remedy that situation either same day, overnight or the next day because we (can) call up a community partner,” he added. “We don’t want that child taken away from their home to become part of the child welfare system for something that is very fixable and solvable in an immediate or short-term situation.” 
However, Krupp did say that Indiana’s cases are “much more heavily on the neglect side,” as opposed to abuse.

Fines to be determined.,Wesley Muller,,,,,https://lailluminator.com/2025/10/07/atalco-on-notice/,"A River Parishes refinery is under heightened scrutiny from state regulators after it unlawfully discharged industrial waste containing arsenic, cadmium, chromium and other toxic heavy metals into public areas and waterways.  Atlantic Alumina, also known as Atalco, is facing dozens of environmental violations stemming from  breaches that occurred last year i[...]","The Atalco alumina refinery in Gramercy suffered numerous levee breaches around its red mud waste lakes, sending arsenic, cadmium, chromium and other toxic chemicals into public areas and waterways for a period of several months. (Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)A River Parishes refinery is under heightened scrutiny from state regulators after it unlawfully discharged industrial waste containing arsenic, cadmium, chromium and other toxic heavy metals into public areas and waterways. 
Atlantic Alumina, also known as Atalco, is facing dozens of environmental violations stemming from  breaches that occurred last year in the giant levees of its waste containment lakes at its aluminum oxide refinery near Gramercy. The facility is the only one remaining in the United States that refines alumina, a process that produces a caustic red slurry the company stores in several manmade lakes near the St. James-St. John the Baptist parish line.
In August, the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality issued the company a “Notice of Potential Penalty” compliance order that detailed the violations state officials documented during a series of inspections that began over a year ago. Now, the company must also address a slate of new requirements LDEQ has tacked onto Atalco’s solid waste permit renewal application, records show.
Federal and state inspectors first noticed the pollution discharges from Atalco’s “red mud” lakes over a year ago, according to a 606-page LDEQ inspection report finalized in March. The report details how a slurry of corrosive waste cut erosion channels through the giant levees around the waste lakes and escaped into the public drainage system that flows to the Blind River Swamp of Lake Maurepas. 
In June, an Illuminator investigation into thousands of pages of state and federal documents and interviews with scientists and area residents indicated that Atalco polluted public land and state waterways with toxic waste for months — never notifying the neighboring community.   
Atalco has not responded to multiple requests for comment. 
In an effort to prevent future incidents, LDEQ is now requiring Atalco to provide more detailed maps and engineering drawings of its drainage systems and the perimeter ditches they flow into surrounding the facility’s “red mud” lakes.
The agency also wants the company to provide an updated, more detailed plan to address levee erosion and leaks from the waste containment lakes. The plan must include more details on how Atalco inspects its levees daily, the training requirements for its inspection personnel, how leaks are documented practices and who’s notified when leaks are discovered. It also must include a slope stability analysis, an assessment that shows if the levees were constructed at the most optimal angles to prevent erosion.
Atalco has not yet responded to LDEQ’s latest request, which it received on Sept. 17. The company has 60 days from that date to file a response. 
A Louisiana refinery spilled toxic waste into the community and knew about it for months

In the meantime, Atalco is grappling with an LDEQ notice issued Aug. 22 that laid out violations stemming from last year’s levee breaches and subsequent waste pollution discharges that have occurred since then. 
The notice recaps the incidents and regulatory violations described in the Illuminator’s initial reporting and a follow-up report about a repeat of the levee breaches this summer. LDEQ singled out Outfall 003, the public drainage ditch that flows into the Blind River Swamp. 
“On or about May 29, 2025, inspectors from the Department observed four (4) erosion channels or breaches along the … levees near Outfall 003, where reddish-orange caustic material/liquor was seeping into the receiving ditch for Outfall 003,” the notice stated. “Additionally, the Department observed several of the receiving streams within the Blind River Swamp further downstream from the facility’s outfalls to be turbid, objectionable in color (reddish-orange), and have a caustic odor.” 
The four breaches from May 29 are just some of the violations for which Atalco has been placed on notice. On the same day, LDEQ found an unauthorized discharge of “unknown origin” that formed a “stagnant red pool” within a marshy area past the facility’s outer fence. Then, on June 11, inspectors discovered another off-site discharge of pollution coming from the opposite side of Atalco’s property.
“The Department observed the discharge resulting from a break within the containment ditch levee near a hole in the facility’s fence,” the notice states.
Atalco has responded to LDEQ’s notice, indicating the company intends to comply with the agency’s orders and take corrective actions to address the violations. 
“Respondent will develop a Red Mud Lakes Integrity and Operational Workplan,” Atalco wrote in its response. “Respondent will provide supplemental information to the Department, as additional details become available … Respondent has taken immediate correction actions to control discharges to waters of the state.”
The company attached more than two dozen photos to its response showing construction and repairs it has made to its levees and other areas of the facility. 
The LDEQ notice states that Atalco could face up to $32,500 per violation for each day it goes unaddressed. The agency routinely includes such stipulations in its violation notices but almost never levies maximum penalties. 
For instance, following a 2017 compliance inspection, LDEQ cited Atalco for 78 violations mostly related to the company’s air pollution permit and allowed the company to pay a fine of $75,000 without admitting to any wrongdoing.  
For the latest violations against Atalco, LDEQ has invited the company to make a negotiated offer to settle the case. Attached to the agency’s notice was a form that Atalco can fill out and submit with a settlement offer for an amount the company thinks is fair.  LDEQ does not have to accept the offer, however. 
The agency did not respond to detailed questions the Illuminator submitted regarding its latest notices to Atalco.

This has Washington officials trying to improve the state’s already well below-average error rate in providing benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. Ideas include increasing case reviews and establishing a new team focused on reducing mishaps.
The so-called “big, beautiful bill” that congressional Republicans passed in July is set to reduce federal spending on nutrition programs nationwide by an estimated $186 billion over 10 years. 
This could cost over 130,000 enrollees their food benefits due to more stringent work requirements, according to state officials. And it stands to shift tens of millions in administrative costs from the federal government to the state.
But Washington could face many tens of millions more in new costs if it doesn’t address its error rate. 
While the federal government funds SNAP benefits, states run the program for low-income residents. The two levels of government share administrative expenses. In May, the most recent month for which data is available, over 905,000 Washingtonians received a total of $167 million in SNAP benefits.
Under the new law, states will have to cover between 5% and 15% of food stamp benefits usually paid for by the feds, depending on how often they make mistakes doling out payments. 
Those with error rates between 6% and 8% would pay for 5% of benefits, amounting to around $100 million in Washington. Between 8% and 10% would cost the state about $200 million. And anything over 10% will force the state to shoulder a staggering $300 million in new costs.
“This change is a completely fundamental shift in the responsibility of the federal government to the states,” said Claire Lane, director of the Seattle-based Anti-Hunger and Nutrition Coalition. 
States will have to start paying those shares in October 2027, as part of the Trump administration’s self-described crusade against waste, fraud and abuse.
The costs could force some states to limit enrollment or doom their food stamp programs altogether. 
“There are a lot of states concerned that this is not sustainable,” Lane said. “Making states pay enormously to feed a lot fewer people is going to be tragic for many hungry people.”
Luckily, Washington is ahead of the pack on this issue. Its error rate in the 2024 federal fiscal year was 6.06%, just above the minimum threshold. Most of those mistakes were overpayments. The national average is just under 11%. 
For federal fiscal year 2025, Washington’s SNAP program, known as Basic Food, was trending toward an error rate over 8%, according to the state Department of Social and Health Services, which runs the program. This would put its penalty at $200 million annually. 
Before this, Washington had been on the right track, reducing its rate from 9.33% in fiscal year 2022.
States have the option to choose between their 2025 and 2026 fiscal year error rates to decide how much they’ll pay. Federal fiscal years start Oct. 1. In subsequent years, penalties will be based on the rate from three years earlier. 
But with major changes to eligibility on the way, officials fear the state will slip up more often, not less. 
Preventing mistakes
The Department of Social and Health Services wants a half-dozen new full-time employees to increase case reviews and monitor error trends. 
It’s looking to establish a small data-driven team with the sole mission of minimizing mistakes. The department also proposed expanded reviews of cases handled by staff with above-average error rates. Money to use artificial intelligence that can automate some of the process would also help, the agency said. 
The Department of Social and Health Services is seeking nearly $1.7 million to bring the ideas to fruition. The agency recently submitted a request for supplemental funding to the governor’s office. Gov. Bob Ferguson in December will propose to state lawmakers a budget tweaking the two-year spending plan he signed in May. 
In its request to the governor, the department described the ask as the “bare minimum,” as it continues to develop other plans.
“We will continue to ensure accuracy while we work with Gov. Ferguson’s office and the Legislature to find solutions that avoid or reduce increased costs to an already strained state budget,” Department of Social and Health Services spokesperson Norah West said in an email. “This makes good fiscal sense and provides additional support to DSHS employees and the Washingtonians they serve when they get the correct benefit amounts the first time.”

Other states are taking similar action. Oregon, for example, has created a dedicated team focused on finding ways to reduce its 14.06% error rate. 
Some states with particularly high error rates, like Oregon, could get an extension before they have to pay benefit costs. That provision was added to win over Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, the key vote to get President Donald Trump’s megabill through the U.S. Senate. Alaska’s error rate is highest in the nation, at nearly 25%. 
The Department of Social and Health Services also wants $4.6 million for information technology upgrades to respond to changes in the new federal law. And $2.1 million is sought to join a national clearinghouse to avoid duplicate benefits across state lines.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/snap-ebt-food-stamps-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-07 07:59:30.869928

It’s just two blocks from the Sun Fresh grocery store that operated at 31st Street and Prospect Avenue until it shut down in August.
The retired Army veteran and Purple Heart recipient has lived in the neighborhood for 35 years. He’s seen the area when it was a food desert before and is troubled by the desert’s return.
Ramsey is trying to do his part by growing and giving away more than 1,000 pounds of produce. But he knows that’s only a bandage for a bigger wound. He is worried for his neighbors — often elderly or low-income — who will now have a harder time finding nutritious food.
“I’ve seen an uptick in neighbors needing the service of the community garden,” Ramsey said. “The impact of the store closing is being felt throughout the neighborhood, and we’ll get by because we always get by. But I’m beginning to see resentment set in, and that scares me.”
The Sun Fresh closure is just part of a growing urban food desert and food insecurity problem in the area. Six miles away in downtown Kansas City, Kansas, the Merc Co+op will close at the end of the year, returning that area to food desert status after just five years of operation.
“I live in a food desert if I am not able to get to a full service grocery store easily,” said  Kristina Bridges, a research assistant professor in University of Kansas Medical Center’s department of family medicine and community health. Food insecurity is defined as whether “in the past 12 months, have you run out of food before you could get more? If the answer is yes, you have food insecurity.”
Together, the two grocery store closures will hamper thousands of residents in low-income and low-food-access areas that Dina Newman from the Center for Neighborhoods calls “communities of concern.”
Tight profit margins at grocery stores mean that grocers often avoid the risk of investing in these communities of concern. As a result, food desert maps follow disinvestment patterns that resemble historic redlining.
Those living in a food desert or experiencing food insecurity have measurably worse health outcomes including a life expectancy shortened by 2.29 years, according to American Cancer Society researchers. While some like Ramsey work to provide short-term community-level solutions, Bridges says broader long-term approaches are also needed.
 Logistics of a food desert

With the two local grocery stores closing, new food deserts will emerge.
In the late 1980s, Newman was a single mother without a car. She knows the struggle of navigating a food desert firsthand.
“So if I’m working … I have to plan it out to get to the bus to get over to a store. Then l’m waiting at the bus stop, which is sometimes just a patch of dirt,” Newman said. “Then I have to transfer buses with a full load of groceries. What about my child, are they with me? Am I safe alone after dark? You are juggling all this just trying to get to the grocery store, that’s the challenge.”
She recalled one incident during the winter when an ice storm came while she was shopping. Out of necessity, she put her socks over her shoes in an attempt to get some traction and not fall and spill her groceries.
“This is all your hard-earned money in these groceries, you’ve got to get them home,” she said.
Ramsey says that many people in his neighborhood now have to walk up to a mile or take the bus to get fresh food at places like Aldi or Happy Foods. He says the effort required to get nutritious food means that many with limited means will just turn to more convenient options like corner stores and gas stations.
“I can’t throw a rock without hitting a fried chicken spot,” Ramsey said. “So we’re eating processed food, cheap food that we can get our hands on, because access to fresh healthy food is not an option for us.”
 Historic patterns with current consequences

While food deserts and food insecurity touch both urban and rural populations, there is a racial disparity. According to a 2024 USDA report, 8% of white households face food insecurity while the number is 21% for Black households and 16.9% for Hispanic households nationwide.
Notably, that report is the last USDA survey on food security for the foreseeable future. The Trump administration has labeled the report “redundant, costly, politicized, and extraneous.” 

If a census tract was redlined as “declining” or “hazardous” in the 1930s Home Owners’ Loan Corp. maps, that translated into a 107% and 149% increase in the likelihood that the same census tract would be a food desert today, according to a 2022 study covering 102 U.S. cities.
“It just feels like this is all intentional,” Ramsey said.
Bridges says KU Medical system has been mapping food insecurity among patients since 2017 and sees a strong correlation between rates of Type 2 diabetes, modern food insecurity and historic redlining.
“It’s really no surprise that the bubbles (on the map) overlapped,” said Bridges. “We have big food insecurity bubbles, big Type 2 diabetes bubbles. … They were north, where downtown KCK and the Merc is, and the east side where the Sun Fresh was. …If we pull out our old redlining maps, it’s exactly the same pattern.”
The seemingly structural nature of the problem has led many advocates to use the term “food apartheid” instead of “food desert,” since a desert occurs naturally while food insecurity appears to occur as the result of man-made systems.
“I knew what food apartheid was before food apartheid was a phrase,” Ramsey said. “You go to certain places and the quality of the food is vastly different. … We’re forced to take the scraps and it’s an affront to our personhood.”
The lack of access to nutritious food has hurtful consequences. Chronic diseases like obesity, hypertension and Type 2 diabetes become more common, but so do complications from deficiencies in fiber and good gut bacteria that are primarily found in fresh fruits and vegetables.
Bridges says understanding these connections between food deserts, food insecurity and chronic disease is something that even some doctors need education on. She recalls speaking to a practitioner who said they didn’t believe there was a problem with food insecurity because “his patients were all fat.”
“That completely misses the mark,” Bridges said. “Just the long-term chronic stress of being food insecure or living in a food desert releases cortisol in your body that can cause a host of things … including obesity.”
 Economic reality of grocery stores closing

Both the Prospect Sun Fresh and the KCK Merc Co+op faced the economic headwinds of operating a grocery store in a historically disinvested neighborhood. While each faced unique issues with their locations, they shared similar challenges.
The Prospect Sun Fresh’s former operator — nonprofit developer Community Builders, which also runs Sun Fresh at 4209 E. 50th Terrace  — said they faced a litany of operating challenges at the Prospect location and lost approximately $5 million trying to keep the store open from February 2022 to August 2025.
“We stepped up to fill a void that no one else was going to fill,” said Community Builders CEO Emmet Pearson at an Urban Summit meeting after the Prospect Sun Fresh closed. “The previous operator reached out to us because he tried to get other operators to come forward and no one else would.”
The city had previously invested $17 million to $18 million into shopping center infrastructure at Linwood Boulevard and Prospect Avenue and was the landlord of the Sun Fresh location. Pearson says that meant Community Builders couldn’t fully control the environment around the store due to limitations in their lease. Board of directors member Kiki Curls says that directly hurt business.
“It’s the element that’s outside the store that impacted us doing business,” said Curls at the Urban Summit meeting. “When you have open prostitution, open drug use and drug sales, when you have folks that pull down their pants and defecate in front of the door when people are coming in store, people do not come back.”
Community Builders themselves received $750,000 in direct cash subsidy from the city to help at the Prospect Sun Fresh in May 2025 along with $161,500 in rent relief. Pearson and the board of directors say that was a drop in the bucket compared to their operational challenges.
Security was $5,000 to $6,000 a week with the cost of a single off-duty police officer paid between $60 and $90 an hour. The store had a “persistent sewer smell” for months that they say stemmed from infrastructure issues. Community Builders said these issues combined to drive sales down and customers away, which ultimately led to taking a loss and closing the store.
Across the state line, the Merc Co+op is in its waning days. The Unified Government of Wyandotte County and Kansas City, Kansas, had invested approximately $7 million to bring in the Lawrence-based fresh grocer.
After three years of planning and five years of operation the Merc announced in June that it would close at the end of this year. Merc cited poor financial performance at the downtown KCK location and that operating it further could hurt the long-term viability of the cooperative, which has operated in Lawrence for 50 years.
Contributing to the closure was the failure of promised nearby redevelopment, which was intended to increase population density, median wages and foot traffic in the area, needed to help support the grocer. A $25 million redevelopment of the Reardon Convention Center across the street from the Merc never came to fruition after several extensions. And a nearby $145 million Minnesota Avenue Triangle mixed-use project fell through, with developers citing funding gaps.
Patrick Shabram, a location research consultant with G2G analytics who helps grocers identify viable locations by projecting future sales, says there are many considerations to determining whether a grocery store will succeed. He said the top three indicators that most grocery stores look for are population density per area competitor, income level and the education level of a neighborhood.
As a general rule, Shabram said a grocery store targets $100,000 in sales per square foot in the first year of operation. Notably, the net profit margin for grocery stores nationwide is just 1.7% according to FMI, a food industry association, which means that even a slight dip in sales could doom a store.
Shabram said the challenge grocers face in opening in an underserved area is balancing the social good of opening a store in an area that needs it while also maintaining profitability.
“I provide the most accurate sales forecast I can so that there can be the proper expectations,” Shabram said. “Then I’m basically saying do what you can to make it work.”
He says that often means looking into grants and incentives to make it through the first couple of lean years while the store establishes itself. He says other ways grocery stores look to improve profitability are pulling in shoppers from neighboring areas or selling higher-margin items like prepared meals or retail. But he says visibility, access, parking lot size, the store’s fit in the neighborhood and size of the store are all major determinants of grocery store success.
“There’s no one answer for every scenario. But a lot of times I’m encouraging people to open smaller stores,” Shabram said. “That might mean it won’t have all the items needed for weekly shopping at the store, but you can provide access to fresh foods that weren’t available at the dollar store.”
 Community solutions and addressing root causes

The local governments on both sides of the state line say that they are working to attract grocery stores to replace the recently shuttered locations.
In the meantime, stopgap solutions are being pursued.
Newman — in her capacity as founder of the Kansas City Black Urban Growers — partnered with area urban farmers and the Kansas City Defender to create the Hamer Free Food Program. They will give out monthly food boxes to residents within one mile of the closed Sun Fresh. The program is in the pilot phase, and 50 household slots were filled in a matter of hours.
Ramsey works with the nonprofit Urban Green Dreams and will continue to manage community gardens as he hopes to give away 2,000 pounds of food this year. He also works to help educate students in nearby classrooms about growing food.
“I’m running into kids who don’t know that potatoes come from the ground or that peaches come from trees,” he said. “They know every flavor of Takis, though.”
Throughout the metro area, nonprofit Kanbe’s Markets place coolers and tiered baskets of fresh produce in independent corner stores on a consignment basis. The idea is to bring fresh produce to where people shop in low-food-access census tracts. Kanbe’s has joined with 50 community partners to place fresh fruits and vegetables in 100 corner stores, including one five blocks from the soon to close Merc Co+op.
“All these downstream things, just to feed people today, are essential,” Bridges said. “But we also need to be thinking of upstream and long-term solutions.”
Bridges said that the root causes of food deserts and food insecurity are a tangled web of health care, agriculture, education and economic factors. She believes a shift to viewing nutritious food as medicine could bring about a drop in chronic disease. That drop in preventable disease could also save the public and insurers money in the form of reduced insurance premiums, fewer claims and fewer overwhelmed emergency rooms.
“It wouldn’t obviously be a quick fix,” Bridges said. “But if you are going to do things like subsidize a building, but then not also address all the other things creating this poor economic situation like jobs, mental health, transportation access and quality of schools, then of course we’re not going to have an environment where a grocery store would survive.”
She points to some smaller programs that offer medically tailored groceries, ready-to-eat meals or fruit and vegetable vouchers. Bridges does say that getting multiple sectors to cooperate presents a sizable challenge in upscaling programs like those. But it’s a challenge that she says must be taken on to truly address the issue.
“Even though they (local governments) tried to be intentional in supporting the two grocery stores in these areas,” said Bridges, “it takes a bigger commitment from multiple sectors to really reinvest in the neighborhoods that have been divested from to address the root cause.”

(Photo by Jane Norman/States Newsroom)The voting rights focused firm Law Forward and former Democratic U.S. Sen. Russ Feingold filed an amicus brief Monday in a lawsuit brought by the National Republican Senatorial Committee to strike down a law that limits the amount of money political parties can contribute to individual candidates for office. 
The lawsuit was initially brought in 2022 by two Republican candidates, including then-Sen. J.D. Vance. The 6th Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the Republican argument and now that decision is being appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. The Court is expected to hear the case during its 2025-26 term, which began on Monday. 
In the amicus brief, Feingold and Law Forward argue that the weakening of campaign finance laws over the past few decades has deeply harmed American democracy — making elected officials more responsive to the needs of their wealthiest donors, in or out of their states and districts, rather than their constituents. 
“We don’t have to guess what will happen if additional campaign finance rules are torn up, we’ve already witnessed it in Wisconsin. Striking down these federal limits will remove guardrails that are necessary for a representative democracy to thrive,” Feingold said in a statement. “The erosion of regulations is responsible for an alarming increase in the amount of money flowing through elections, giving wealthy donors an outsized voice in the political process, reducing the public’s faith in their elected representatives, and diminishing voters’ willingness to continue participating in the political process.”
During his 18 years in the Senate, Feingold regularly focused on campaign finance issues, including the passage of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act, which is commonly known as McCain-Feingold and instituted a number of rules guiding the use of “soft money” by outside groups running ads to influence elections.
The Supreme Court’s decision in Citizens United v. FEC decision in 2010 weakened the law and the brief filed Monday argues the erosion of campaign finance rules has damaged the country’s politics and made its government vulnerable to corruption. 
“For a representative democracy to thrive, elected officials must be responsive to their constituents and avoid even the appearance of corruption,” the brief states. “Campaign finance regulation exists to reinforce these guardrails. Yet, for years, opponents of regulation have persistently chiseled away at the limits established to prevent excessive campaign cash from corrupting our elections.” 
The brief uses Wisconsin as an example, which since 2015 has not placed a limit on the amount political parties can give to candidates. That change has resulted in wealthy donors from Wisconsin and across the country giving maximum contributions to candidates’ campaigns while giving much larger donations to each candidate’s party — essentially using the party committee as a middleman to funnel millions of dollars into candidate accounts. 
“With each election cycle, the total contributions made, especially for statewide candidates, grows at a shocking rate, incentivizing candidates to court the wealthiest donors,” the brief states. “And, as Wisconsin elections have drawn more and more national attention, the pool of prospective donors has expanded to include increasing numbers of millionaires and billionaires residing in other states. Thus, the cycle continues. The flood of money into Wisconsin’s elections has bred accusations of corruption and threatens to drown out — if not completely silence — the voices of average voters.”
The brief argues that the decision by Wisconsin Republicans in 2015 to weaken the state’s campaign finance laws resulted in a downward spiral that opened the floodgates to money pouring into high profile races — most notably campaigns for governor and state Supreme Court. 
“Wisconsin’s experience shows exactly what happens when we eliminate these crucial guardrails,” Law Forward attorney Rachel Snyder said. “The wealthiest donors route massive contributions through political parties, effectively buying themselves significant access to and influence with both political parties and elected officials. This isn’t about partisan politics — it’s about preserving a democracy where average citizens’ voices aren’t drowned out by billionaires’ checkbooks.”

Since Sept. 30, a team of about 25 Idaho State Department of Agriculture staff members and another 15-20 contractors have been applying a copper-based chemical called Natrix to every nook and cranny of a 3.5-mile section of the Snake River, as well as injecting the chemical into some of the underwater pools of the Snake River. 
Not only is the Snake River the longest river in Idaho and a source of irrigation and drinking water, but it is also a major tributary of the Columbia River, which empties into the Pacific Ocean. 
State officials’ goals are to stop the mussels from spreading beyond the infested area into other parts of the river system and to completely eradicate all of the mussels that have been detected here so far.
“We’re throwing everything at it as if this is the last time we would ever have to, want to or be able to do a treatment,” Idaho State Department of Agriculture Deputy Director Lloyd Knight said.
 Quagga mussels were first discovered in Idaho in 2023

Quagga mussels are a nonnative, invasive species that was first detected in water samples taken from the Snake River near Twin Falls in September 2023. 
Officials again identified quagga mussels in some of the same parts of the river in 2024 and again this September, although officials said the area of the Snake River infested with mussels has decreased from 7.2 miles of river in 2024 down to 3.5 miles of river this year. 
Idaho State Department of Agriculture officials said one breeding pair of adult quagga mussels can produce more than 1 million offspring in one year – reproducing so fast they threaten irrigation, drinking water, agriculture and recreation. Infestations of quagga mussels can clog pipes used for irrigation or drinking water and damage dams or boats, officials said. 
Additionally, quagga mussels are filter feeders, and they can disrupt the food web by taking up a huge chunk of the food and nutrients that native species are competing for, officials said.

“That’s why it’s important we throw everything we can at trying to eradicate these things,” Knight said. 
Knight estimated this year’s treatment plan could cost $2.5 to $3 million. 
But Idaho State Department of Agriculture Director Chanel Tewalt said the department is not asking for any additional state general fund money to fight the mussels at this time. Between $6.6 million that state legislators approved to fight quagga mussels in 2024 to funding taken from the sale of invasive species stickers, Tewalt said the department is not seeking additional general fund money. 
 What does Idaho’s plan to kill the quagga mussels look like?

The infestation of quagga mussels appears to be limited to the stretch of the Snake River right around Shoshone Falls, a large scenic waterfall that is higher than Niagara Falls. 
On Friday, the Idaho State Department of Agriculture invited the Idaho Capital Sun and other reporters from around Idaho to observe the treatment program and tour the infested portion of the Snake River by boat. 
In an effort to completely kill all of the quagga mussels, contractors are applying a copper-based chemical called Natrix in concentrations of one part per million to the Snake River.
The copper is designed to flow over the quagga mussels’ gills, suffocating and killing the mussels, Knight said. 
The copper chemical also suffocates and kills fish and other aquatic life with gills, officials said, though some species of fish and aquatic life appear resistant to the copper. 
Officials said they have seen fish killed this year by the copper treatment, but not as many as were killed during the first year of treatment in 2023, when tons of fish died and floated to the surface of the Snake River. 
“There is some additional take that occurs on other organisms (besides the mussels that are targeted), but the nice thing about this river run environment is there’s a good, healthy populations (of aquatic life) up river from where our treatment area is and we expect rehabilitation to occur (after treatment ends),” said Jeremey Varley, southern chief treatment engineer for the Idaho State Department of Agriculture.
This year, crews are using some tools and equipment that has been commonly used in irrigation systems in an attempt to apply the copper chemical to hard-to-reach parts of the Snake River.
Gravity boxes attached to canyon walls above shore help mix river water with the copper chemical near the surface of the water. 
And new this year, Varley, who is a certified scuba diver, rigged a new system that uses buoys, a diaphragm pump and a manifold to pump the copper chemical into pools of water 20 feet below the surface of the river to target mussels below the water.
To connect and rig the system, Varley donned a full wet suit and dove down under water, where the visibility was less than 5 feet and water temperatures were a chilly 62 degrees.
“That’s something that Jeremey came up with,” Knight said. “It’s something that is very unique to here. Nobody else has tried it anywhere else.”
Knight said the Natrix treatment being applied to the Snake River is the largest treatment of its kind in the United States and has never been attempted at such a large scale anywhere else in the U.S.

Meanwhile, as contractors are applying the copper chemical, crews are also collecting water samples in the same stretch of the Snake River. The samples are stored on ice and analyzed in a lab located at College of Southern Idaho in Twin Falls. 
On Friday, Michelle Jakaitis, the principle microbiologist for the bacteriology and parasitology lab at the state’s animal health lab, said she had not seen any live quagga mussels in water samples since the treatment program began Tuesday.
“Since treatment has occurred, we have seen much fewer (quagga mussel) veligers, and all of them have been dead, which is exactly what we expect, and we’re very glad,” Jakaitis said Friday.

During the treatment program Jakaitis and the team at the lab are using microscopes to analyze water samples from 10 a.m. until 8:30 p.m. each day. 
“It is quite a time commitment, but it is very important, and it has been very useful and informing (us) that the treatment is doing exactly what we’re expecting it to do,” Jakaitis said. 
It may be too early to tell if the treatment was totally effective. 
Following previous years’ rounds of treatment, crews did not detect the quagga mussels in samples taken earlier this year and during the early summer months of 2024. 
But officials did detected the mussels again in early September in 2024 and 2025
Knight said the department’s crews will continue sampling and testing the water for five more years to continue to monitor for the invasive mussels.
Although all Idaho state departments and agencies other than public schools are having to implement budget holdbacks of 3% to cover for state revenues shortfalls, Knight said the Idaho State Department of Agriculture officials decided to prioritize the quagga mussels response and are cutting other areas instead. 
“No, this is obviously a priority that we are throwing everybody and everything at,” Knight said.

Mallory McMorrow (D-Royal Oak) addresses a rally on the second anniversary of a Supreme Court that overturned the federal right for abortion in Clawson on June 24, 2024. | Lucy ValeskiYet another Michigan Democratic candidate seeking statewide office has called the situation in Gaza and the Israeli military offensive against the Palestinian people there a genocide – this time from U.S. Senate hopeful Mallory McMorrow.
McMorrow was pressed with a question on Gaza and accepting money from the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the largest pro-Israel lobby in the United States. 
The state senator from Royal Oak said plainly that she would not be accepting money from AIPAC, not now or in the future, nor was she seeking its endorsement.
She also called the war and the strife there a moral abomination. When asked if she would call it a genocide, McMorrow, after a deep breath and long pause, said it was by definition a genocide.
“We have Benjamin Netanyahu trying to tell us what we’ve been seeing with our own eyes is not true,” McMorrow said of the Israeli prime minister, whose government has been at the forefront of the military action against Palestinians in Gaza. “It is true. And two things can be true at once.”
McMorrow noted that there has been a disturbing loss of life on both sides of the conflict, including the inciting Oct. 7, 2023 inflection point when Hamas terrorists attacked multiple settlements in southern Israel, including a music festival, murdering more than 1,000 civilians and taking hundreds of hostages. 
She also said her husband is Jewish and that her daughter, Noa, has an Israeli name. Both of those aspects of her public and private life garnered death threats against her after the Oct. 7 attack, which she said was the most horrendous affront to Jews since the Holocaust.
But the response from the Israeli military and the Netanyahu government was just just as horrendous, McMorrow said.
“[The war and genocide] has to end immediately,” McMorrow said. “The position of the United States should not be that we support Netanyahu with no check and balances … as an ally gone rogue, by a leader who, in their own country, is deeply unpopular. If there was an election to be held today in Israel, he would no longer be the prime minister. We have to end the war now.”

McMorrow said she supported a resolution put forward by U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont) calling for the nation to cut off offensive arms sales, which in her estimation was the most effective leverage the United States had to end the war.
The candidate also called for flooding the Gaza region with humanitarian aid so as to make those shipments valueless – outside of their intended purpose – to Hamas, which could potentially steal those supplies.
“We cannot be bombing Gaza to the point where it is unlivable, uninhabitable,” she said. “We have to negotiate a permanent ceasefire, and the release of all hostages. Hamas apparently agreed to that yesterday.”
McMorrow added that it was her belief that the U.S. needed to get to a place where it was brokering a real two-state solution with Israel and Palestinian leaders to secure a lasting peace between the two parties.
“My view on this is that we have completely lost the humanity in the issue,” McMorrow said. “It is talked about as like a third-rail litmus test, without acknowledging that these are human beings. They’re people, and our position should be that there is no individual life that is worth more than another individual life.”
As to the debate on whether the situation should be called a genocide, McMorrow said she doesn’t care what you call it.
“There are members in the Jewish community [to whom] it means something very different to them. That if you’ve lost family in the Holocaust, it means the specific medical testing, gas chambers, being put on a train,” McMorrow said. “I don’t want us to get lost in, ‘do you agree with this definition or not?’ I want to get to the solution.”
Although the commentary was likely encouraging for pro-Palestinan Michigan voters, Dropsite News – a Substack blog produced by journalist Ryan Grimm – reported last month that McMorrow had privately produced an AIPAC position paper that at least one pro-Israel donor said was “outstanding.” Those details came from a donor call obtained by Drop Site news, which was also published online.
The paper was never made public and the McMorrow campaign denied that that the candidate filled out any AIPAC questionnaire. The campaign also noted that the the donor did not speak for the campaign.
McMorrow’s campaign did not respond to a question on the position paper when asked by a Michigan Advance reporter.
Still, of the three top candidates in the race, McMorrow now positions herself with Abdul El-Sayed, who has plainly called the situation in Gaza a genocide and has been adament that he would not take money from AIPAC.
U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens (D-Birmingham), has called for an end to the conflict but also has a strong pro-Israel record. AIPACTracker, which tallies money spent on candidates through the PAC, lists Stevens as having received a sum total of $5.17 million from the organization.
A request for comment from the Stevens campaign, and for clarification on the amount of money the representative has received from AIPAC, was not returned at the time of publication.
Stevens told Punchbowl News in August that she opposed the Sanders resolution. Stevens clarified that she didn’t believe an arms blockade would end the war, nor would it build a lasting piece or get Hamas to surrender.
Aside from McMorrow and El-Sayed in the U.S. Senate race, at least one gubernatorial candidate has made his stance on the Gaza genocide clear – Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist II.
The candidate, speaking to the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee’s national convention in Dearborn, also known as ArabCon, issued his support for Palestinians facing hunger and strife in the Israel-Hamas war, saying that the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was committing a genocide
“This is not a matter of opinion. It is a matter of fact,” Gilchrist said.

After years of legal wrangling in public, the case pitting access to public lands against trespass laws enters a sometimes-veiled arena.
The post Early career clerks, not Supreme Court justices, will first review Wyoming corner-crossing case appeared first on WyoFile .","After four years of legal battles, Fred Eshelman’s trespass lawsuit to block people from corner crossing to reach public property will land Oct. 17 on the U.S. Supreme Court conference table, where justices will likely consider a recent law-school graduate’s recommendation whether to take up the case.
The nine justices won’t necessarily be the first ones to scan the 388 pages filed in the case titled Iron Bar Holdings vs Bradley Cape. A clerk — an early career lawyer — will review the file initially, soon joined by two other clerk colleagues.
Before the justices mull Eshelman’s petition, these “three smart kids in their mid to late-20s are conducting the closest and most important reads,” according to Dan Schweitzer, an expert in Supreme Court processes.
If the high court follows its typical routine, one of the clerks will write a short memo that recommends whether the Supreme Court should take up Eshelman’s case, according to Schweitzer’s 2019 guide for state lawyers. Justices review these “critical initial assessments” and “may take a closer look by reading some or all of the briefs” and perhaps the opinion that is being challenged and appealed.
Before Eshelman’s case made its way to 1 First St. NE, Washington, D.C., the corner-crossing legal wrangling involved four misdemeanor citations, numerous motions, affidavits, depositions and testimonies, two trials plus deliberations, opinions, orders and two appeals.
“[T]hey don’t have a great deal of experience, particularly in some specialized areas of the law.” Dan Schweitzer
All this debate must now pass through a checkpoint at one clerk’s desk and computer.
If it seems counterintuitive that the gatekeepers at the court’s portico of 16 Corinthian Italian marble columns appear wet behind the ears, Schweitzer and others provide some insight.
“These are individuals who, fairly recently, graduated from law school, typically, at the top of their class from the best schools,” according to the court’s own description. “Often, they have served a year or more as a law clerk for a federal judge.”
Schweitzer recognizes clerks’ likely youth and inexperience — more as a warning to petitioners to be clear and concise in their pleadings than as any dig at clerks’ capabilities or intellect. That clerks make an initial review “puts a premium on clarity,” for the writers of any petition, Schweitzer wrote.
“They are very bright young people,” Schweitzer wrote. Nevertheless, “they don’t have a great deal of experience, particularly in some specialized areas of the law.”
Top of the class
For the Court’s October term, seven clerks each came from the University of Chicago, Harvard and Yale; five from Stanford; two each from Michigan, Notre Dame, the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Virginia; and one each from Columbia, Georgetown and George Washington. Of the 38 clerks, 53% are men, 47% women, according to David Lat, who assembled the roster for his substack column Original Jurisdiction.
Together, the clerks have served 71 clerkships before being selected by one of the justices and have collectively served in those positions under 39 different judges, Lat wrote.
Iron Bar is the name of Eshelman’s company that owns the Elk Mountain Ranch in Carbon County. Cape is a Missouri hunter and fence builder who, with his friends, corner-crossed in 2020 and 2021 to hunt on public land surrounded by Eshelman’s ranch. The Wyoming chapter of Backcountry Hunters and Anglers supported the four Missouri men with fundraisers to ensure they would be heard in court.
Wildlife-rich Elk Mountain rises from the checkerboard landscape of property ownership in southern Wyoming, a pattern that’s a vestige of the railroad-grant era of the mid-1800s. Alternating square-mile sections of public and private ownership characterize the area.
Corner crossing is the act of stepping from one piece of public land to another adjacent public parcel where they meet at a common corner. Eshelman’s lawsuit seeks to defend what he believes is a private property right to block people from passing through the airspace above his land, exposing such folk to potential trespass charges even though they do not set foot on his land.
If corner crossing is illegal, the public can’t reach property owned by all Americans; Eshelman essentially reaps the bounty of that land for himself, the hunters contend. The case has implications for public access to 8.3 million acres of public land across the West.
The 10th Circuit Court of Appeals decided that the 1885 Unlawful Inclosures Act conditionally allows corner crossing in the checkerboard area of Wyoming and five other states. That court noted that corner crossing is the only way for the public to access its public land on Elk Mountain without using an aircraft, suggesting that its ruling applies only to landlocked public property.
Eshelman has petitioned the high court to hear his appeal, asserting that the 10th Circuit functionally allowed trespassing that could affect 150 million acres of private land. Among his claims is that the 10th Circuit unconstitutionally allowed for the taking of private property without compensation.
Eshelman wants the justices to hear his arguments that the 10th Circuit got it wrong when it decided he couldn’t block Cape and his buddies. That would, for the first time, establish that corner crossing is illegal, experts say. The hunters say the Supreme Court doesn’t need to consider Eshelman’s case, but they are prepared to defend their 10th Circuit win.
Eshelman’s case is one of approximately 7,000-8,000 petitions the court expects to receive this term, which runs from now until October 2026. The court will grant certiorari and hear oral argument in about 80 cases.
For Eshelman’s case to advance on Oct. 17, four of the nine Justices must vote to accept it. The justices could instead reject it, in which instance the 10th Circuit ruling for Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, New Mexico, Kansas and Oklahoma would stand.
No reasons given
For four years, the Elk Mountain tumult has taken place in the public arena. Fifty-eight citizens of Carbon County assembled for potential service on a six-person jury in the hunters’ misdemeanor trial, where they were found not guilty of trespassing. Courts have published lawyers’ motions and transcripts and have distributed their own findings and orders freely.
Only nine people, however, will be in the Supreme Court conference room on Oct. 17, and its doors will be closed. It is a room “as secret as any in government,” the Supreme Court Historical Society states.
“No outsider enters the room during conference,” the historical society explains. “The junior Associate Justice acts as ‘doorkeeper,’ sending for reference material, for instance, and receiving it at the door. The Court keeps private matters private.”
Justices do not have to give a reason when they accept or reject Eshelman’s appeal. Alternatively, the court also could “relist” Iron Bar v Cape for more discussion later. Experts say that’s an indication that at least one justice is interested in pursuing the issue.

An official will summon the justices to the conference room five minutes before the long discussion starts Oct. 17. The justices will shake hands.
The 36 ritual handshakes are a reminder “that differences of opinion on the Court did not preclude overall harmony of purpose,” the Supreme Court states.
The historical society explains the apparent paradox of secrecy at the highest level of public interest.
“[I]n light of the complete confidentiality of the conference, the Supreme Court is one of the most open of government agencies and one of the most public of courts,” the group explains. “It acts only on matters of public record; it hears counsel’s arguments in public; all its orders and opinions are on the record; all materials presented to the Court for reaching its decisions are available to the public.”
The court usually releases a list of the cases the justices will take up within days of the conference.

Republicans own this closure and all health care harm caused by allowing enhanced tax credits to expire, columnist Kerry Drake opines. 
The post Barrasso wrongfully pins blame for government shutdown on Dems appeared first on WyoFile .","The day after Halloween, the “Obamacare” enrollment period begins, and this year, Wyomingites signing up may find that U.S. Sen. John Barrasso played a costly trick on them instead of the health care treat he promised.

Opinion

Barrasso, an orthopedic surgeon before he began his political career, likes to tout his credentials as “Wyoming’s Doctor” each campaign. It’s a reminder of his days dispensing medical advice on TV.
But he’s got a big credibility problem after the Oct. 1 federal government shutdown, which he’s blamed on the Democrats’ “idiocy” for not averting the closure by compromising with Republicans.
Barrasso, the No. 2 Senate Republican as majority whip, helped push the incredibly misnamed “One Big Beautiful Bill” across the finish line without passing a single one of the Democrats’ nearly 50 amendments. So much for that bipartisan spirit the GOP always says it wants.
There are many reasons for Americans to hate the bill, which does more damage to health care access than any piece of federal legislation I can recall.
For starters, the Congressional Budget Office estimates the measure will reduce Medicaid spending by $793 billion over the next decade to pay for tax cuts that benefit the nation’s wealthiest citizens. But that’s not the “trick” I referred to above.
The bill will cause skyrocketing health insurance premiums in the federal marketplace under the Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare. This is due to the GOP’s insistence that the enhanced tax credits that helped make health insurance affordable for many Americans must expire at the end of the year.
The enhanced tax credits started in 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic. At the time, 11.4 million people were enrolled in the ACA marketplace. Today, participation has more than doubled to 24.4 million, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid.
“This government shutdown is all about whether Republicans will get away with raising healthcare premiums by 75% for 20 million Americans and throwing 15 million people off their [Medicaid insurance],” Independent U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont wrote on X.
Those numbers may be even bigger, according to KFF, a health policy research organization. The group says consumers getting subsidies through the marketplaces will see an average increase of 114% in 2026. KFF also predicts many healthier enrollees on marketplaces will simply drop their coverage because they can’t afford it, leaving them fiscally vulnerable if they need medical care.


Low-income workers will be hit hard if the enhanced tax credits expire. The Urban Institute estimated ACA premiums may jump 400% for people who make between $23,000 and $30,000 annually.
The last thing Barrasso wants is for voters to connect the dots when they find out their health insurance premiums are soaring and blame him. Personally, I’d like every Wyomingite who will have higher ACA health premiums to get a bill with a photo of Barrasso proudly standing next to President Donald Trump, so they know exactly who to “thank.”
A photo of U.S. Sen. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyoming, is also in order because she’s playing the blame game, too.
“It’s time for Senate Democrats to stop these political games and join Republicans in doing the right thing for the American people by voting to keep our government and our national parks funded,” Lummis said in a statement.
Republicans aren’t stopping with attacks on Democrats for not agreeing to a continuing resolution to keep spending limits on contested issues at their current level while both parties negotiate an agreement. No, they’ve got a dirty trick that the GOP has perfected: If you say something loud enough and keep repeating it, people will believe it’s true. Like “clean” coal.
And it works. Last week, after the shutdown began, an acquaintance asked me if it happened “because Democrats want to give money to illegal aliens.”
In late September, Republican officials like Vice President JD Vance debuted a new rallying cry: “Democrats are about to shut down the government because they demand we fund health care for illegal aliens.”
Republicans ridiculously manage to tie every controversial issue they encounter to imaginary hordes of illegal immigrants crossing the southern border and demanding everything Americans have, pillaging cities and towns all along the way.
“We’ll probably have a shutdown because one of the things [Democrats] want to do is they want to give incredible Medicare, Cadillac, the Cadillac Medicare, to illegal immigrants,” the verbally fumbling Trump said.
It doesn’t seem to matter how often Democratic officials like U.S. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-New York, condemn these outright lies; the charges are difficult to shake.
“Federal law prohibits the use of taxpayer dollars to provide medical coverage to undocumented individuals. That’s the law,” Jeffries told CNBC the day before the shutdown. “And there is nothing in anything that we have proposed that is trying to change that law.”
Trump counters truth with threats, because that’s how he does business. The president warned ahead of the last Senate vote before the shutdown that his administration and the Office of Management and Budget could do things “that are irreversible,” like mass firings and cutting programs favored by Democrats.
Allowing enhanced tax credits to expire will likely ignite a chain reaction of negative results. People who can’t afford marketplace premiums will obtain inadequate insurance with high deductibles or go without any at all. Because they don’t see doctors regularly for preventive care, their health risks will increase.
People with private insurance will also be affected. Companies are already planning to increase rates because they anticipate a drop in healthy enrollees and a rise in the average cost of claims. 
Hospitals will have higher uncompensated care costs because sick people tend to go to emergency rooms as a last resort. Hospitals will make up the loss by charging those who can afford private insurance more for services, or discontinue certain care, like the five maternity wards that have closed in Wyoming in the past 12 years.
Wyoming Democrats, instead of letting Barrasso and Lummis paint them as villains, should make it clear that the blame for all of the health and financial pain caused by ending the tax credits — including the high cost of the government shutdown itself — rests with Republicans.

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN –  Nebraska Secretary of State Bob Evnen last week weighed in on the latest request from the U.S. Department of Justice for the state’s voter registration data — showing a willingness to fulfill the request.
Federal officials have asked states for detailed information from their voter rolls, including names, dates of birth, driver’s license numbers and the last four digits of voters’ Social Security numbers, saying they want the information to ensure accurate voter registrations. Democratic-led states and some led by Republicans have declined or are pushing back against federal efforts to gather the data over state laws protecting data and privacy concerns. 
Critics have questioned the safety and potential national security risks of letting any administration consolidate such voter data in one place.
In a Sept. 29 interview with KFAB, Evnen, after seeking guidance from Attorney General Mike Hilgers, said he was “fine” with handing over the voter data because the state’s maintenance practices are “complete and proper.” 
“I don’t have any problem with [the DOJ request] … I’m glad that they’re looking at other states, because while I’m very confident about Nebraska, questions have been raised about some other states,” Evnen said.

The Justice Department sent a letter to Nebraska’s secretary of state on Sept. 8 with a Sept. 22 deadline to provide the data. A voter advocacy group sued to block the request, asking a Lancaster County District Court to find that the DOJ request violates Nebraska law protecting data privacy.
Evnen’s comments followed Hilgers’ saying during a press conference last month that he would be open to turning over the voter data to the DOJ. The federal government has sued two Democratic-run states for the data, the first legal challenge the department has brought against states to obtain the records.
The secretary of state, in his KFAB interview, again employed framing based on the “myth” of widespread voting by non-citizens, a notion that some election experts have warned could undermine trust in elections. The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, analyzed elections from 2003 to 2024 and found 24 instances nationally of noncitizens voting out of millions of votes cast.

“The reason why this is all front and center now is because over the last four-plus years prior to this administration, 10 or 15 million people walked across the border of the United States without the legal right to do so,” Evnen said.
Evnen is balancing defending the state’s elections, which his office administers, and echoing the concerns of some Republicans and President Donald Trump over election integrity since the 2020 presidential election, as the secretary looks to quash any challenger from his right flank in his 2026 re-election bid.
When asked by the Examiner earlier this year how many non-citizens had been removed from the state’s voter rolls or voted in past elections, a Secretary of State’s Office spokesperson said the agency had not “removed anyone due to their status as a non-citizen, nor do we believe that there are many such people registered to vote.” 
Evnen also said he has been in touch with the DOJ to get clarification on how the voter data would be used and how it would be protected. 
Fulfilling this request from the DOJ would be a reversal of the state’s stance from a similar request made to then-Secretary of State John Gale in 2017 during the first Trump Administration. 
Gale declined to turn over Nebraska’s full voter information because it wouldn’t comply with state law. He expressed concerns about data privacy. A public and more limited version of Nebraska’s voter file, including names and addresses, is available as a public record for a fee.

Facing criticism from a top state official in his final days on the job, Metro Nashville’s chief development officer defended an agreement with Boston-based Fallon Company for a massive project on the Cumberland River’s East Bank.
Bob Mendes, a former Metro Council member who headed up Mayor Freddie O’Connell’s efforts for projects citywide, told the Lookout the mayor considers the master plan with Fallon “unprecedented in how good it is for Metro.” The contract achieves 99 years of “guaranteed affordability” for nearly 700 housing units on 30 acres of city-owned land the company is developing, he said.
The contract also contains a provision under which Metro will receive rent payments of up to 1% of the gross sales prices on every building on the property each time it changes hands for 100 years, Mendes said.
“There’s a lot of aspects of it that broke new ground as far as modernizing development deals for the city,” Mendes said.
Mendes made his comments in response to criticism from Republican House Speaker Cameron Sexton, who recently told reporters Metro has to spend $3 million to run the East Bank Authority because Mendes negotiated a contract with Fallon that keeps Metro from collecting rent until after a building on city property is complete.

“If I was a taxpayer in Davidson County, I’d be pissed that I’m having to supplement something that I should not have to supplement because Bob Mendes worked out a contract that Fallon probably agreed to before the ink was dry because it was so good for them,” said Sexton, a member of the East Bank Authority.
Sexton’s comments are a recent example of state legislators scrutinizing the decisions and governance of Nashville’s leaders and locally elected officials. Tennessee officials have been vying for more control over the state’s top-earning county, seeking greater influence over the authorities and boards that oversee the Nashville International Airport, Sports Authority and the Music City Convention Center.
The Metro Nashville Council unanimously approved the 99-year lease deal for 30 city-owned acres in April 2024. 
City planners had been working on plans to redevelop Nashville’s East Bank — riverfront land that was mostly devoted to parking lots — for years, publishing a vision plan for the transformation in August 2022 under former Mayor John Cooper’s administration. Cooper, who had experience as a developer before entering politics, negotiated a deal with the Tennessee Titans to build a new $2.1 billion stadium on the East Bank with the help of at least $1.26 billion in public funding. 
Nashville’s council approved that deal in April 2023 after substantial opposition from members of the public and about a third of the council’s 40 members. The state authorized $500 million in bonds for construction of the new stadium for the Titans, and Metro Nashville is putting in $760 million toward the stadium project.
Cooper’s administration selected Fallon as the master developer for the first 30 acres of Metro-owned land shortly before his term ended. Cooper ultimately decided against seeking re-election, leaving the mayor’s race open to a slate of fresh contenders.
O’Connell, who represented Nashville’s downtown district for two terms, highlighted his opposition to the stadium deal in his mayoral campaign to set himself apart from other candidates. When O’Connell successfully secured the seat, he and Mendes, who both staunchly rejected the stadium deal, were positioned to steer negotiations for the land surrounding the new stadium.










If I was a taxpayer in Davidson County, I’d be pissed that I’m having to supplement something that I should not have to supplement because Bob Mendes worked out a contract that Fallon probably agreed to before the ink was dry because it was so good for them.


– House Speaker Cameron Sexton


While not on board with the public financing in the stadium deal, the pair embraced many facets of the overall East Bank vision plan, including affordable housing, enhanced public transportation and more pedestrian infrastructure. Mendes did not have development experience prior to taking his post in O’Connell’s administration, but his career as an attorney in the private sector has concentrated on business transactions and commercial litigation.
Sexton, a Crossville Republican who also owns a home in Nashville, has focused on negotiations between Metro and the Tennessee Performing Arts Center, which is slated to move to the East Bank from its longtime home at Deaderick Street across from the War Memorial Plaza in downtown Nashville. 
The speaker said he believes O’Connell took the “reins” from Mendes and inserted himself into the talks, meeting recently with Gov. Bill Lee to keep TPAC in the East Bank equation.
Besides TPAC, the new Titans stadium will take up a large part of the 100-plus acre portion of the East Bank owned by Metro. Tech giant Oracle is set to build a campus on 60 acres along the banks of the Cumberland River after receiving a $175 million economic incentive from Metro. It is slated to bring in 8,500 jobs as the company makes a $1.2 billion capital investment.
The East Bank’s infrastructure is estimated to cost $147 million with Fallon’s share of the expense at $72.6 million, TPAC’s at $67.6 million and Metro’s at $6.8 million. Fallon is to build 1,550 residential units, 695 of which are to be designated as “affordable.” 
East Bank developer proposal hints at potential struggle to keep revenue, housing promises

Besides his concerns about the Fallon deal, Sexton isn’t enthused with the way the East Bank Authority operates, calling it more of an oversight committee than an “authority.” The speaker said he believes it should operate more like the Metro Airport Authority, which makes independent decisions,  rather than being required to send all of its decisions to the 40-member Metro Council for final approval as the East Bank authority does.
The state is tied up in lawsuits with Metro over its effort to cut the council down to 20 members and a move to give the state more control over appointments to the airport authority.
State Rep. Bob Freeman, a Nashville Democrat who sponsored the private act setting up the East Bank authority, said he told House members that East Bank Authority decisions would have to go to the full Metro Council for approval, since the city owns the property.
Any changes in the authority’s power would have to go back to the Metro Council and, likely, to the legislature as well.
The mayor’s office believes the East Bank development plan is still in its infancy, and O’Connell hasn’t wavered in his commitment to bring TPAC to the area.
Besides the affordable housing, Metro plans to create a Nashville campus for youth empowerment on Brick Church Pike to replace the existing juvenile justice center located on the East Bank. 
For his part, Mendes, whose last day was Wednesday, said he understands Sexton’s frustration but pointed out the contract is complicated. He said the speaker’s criticism isn’t the reason for his departure after two years in the post.
Fallon is on track to break ground by the end of 2026 on a hotel and the affordable housing building, he said, about the same time the Titans stadium is ready to open.
Mendes recalls how people felt about the Gulch in the late 1990s when development started taking place there, transforming it into one of Nashville’s liveliest areas.
“I think the East Bank’s going to be the same way,” Mendes said.

In rural areas, the odds of finding an open slot at a high-quality center can be even greater. Photo: Getty ImagesErin Trant is the mother of three small children and the owner of a small business with one very big problem.
The child care program she relies on — the only one on Hatteras Island — informed her they will close their doors at the end of the year.
It’s not an uncommon scenario. In August, the state Division of Child Development and Early Education saw 47 child care programs shutter with only 22 new programs opening.
On Monday, Trant shared her story with the North Carolina Task Force on Child Care and Early Education. Gov. Josh Stein tapped the group in March to identify solutions to expand access to affordable, high-quality child care.
Trant said her 5-year-old and 2-year-old twins benefited greatly from Little Sprouts Child Care in Frisco. But staffing shortages and an unsustainable financial model forced their hand. She received word of the closure in a note, tucked into her child’s backpack in July.
“I was distraught, and I was pissed off to be frank,” said Trant. “My husband and I don’t have family around us to be able to help or lean on. I sell real estate. I work full time.”
But with the only licensed child care center on the island closing, her family is facing a tough decision.
“We’re faced with the choice of do I quit my job, which frankly pays our mortgage and buys groceries, or do we close our business that has sort of become a staple in the community, or do we move?”
Trant said her twins were born prematurely and having them in a structured childcare facility has been tremendously beneficial. An unlicensed facility is not a tenable solution.

On average, there is only one licensed child care slot available for every five families who need one in North Carolina. In rural areas like Hatteras Island, the odds of finding an open slot at a high-quality center can be even greater.
Cassandra Brooks is the owner and operator of Little Believer’s Academy, which runs two child care centers serving Garner and Clayton.
She said many child care providers are finding that the money coming in doesn’t cover the amount they need to cover their lease, their staffing and supplies.
“It just does not equal up. So you have to say, is this worth it? And a lot of them have said this is not worth it,” Brooks told the panel.
Brooks said she knows child care providers are making the difficult decision now whether to stay in business in North Carolina another year.
“No one wants to feel like a failure in any business that you start, especially many small businesses. This is like their heart. This is like their baby. But at the end of the day, if you can’t operate and you can’t pay your staff, then you don’t have a viable business,” said Brooks.
Parents are also doing the math. Few can afford to pay more.
The average annual cost of infant care in NC is $11,720, according to an interim report released this summer by the task force. For two children in child care, the average annual cost is nearly $19,500.
Angelia Shipp, who operates the Doletta Learning Center, said her licensed center in Forsyth County has seen enrollment decline as state and federal stabilization funding approved during the pandemic has sunsetted.
“Stabilization was very good when we had it, but now the stabilization is gone. It has caused a lot of the providers here to close their centers. And I am one of them. I am on the brink of making that decision to close my doors,” said Shipp.
Shipp said she’s proud of those who have graduated from her program, but with just one child in her child care center now, the finances no longer work.
“Without funding, we cannot sustain our homes. Our children are going to fall through the cracks,” Shipp worried.
Brooks said high housing costs have also hurt her employees. One worker, a single mother who recently split from the child’s father, had just ten days to find a new place to live or face eviction.  She felt blessed when a person at her church agreed to rent her “a little shack” for $800 a month.
“My teachers are already struggling. They’re going to struggle even more. They’re on food stamps. They’re on Medicaid. They’re on all these things,” confided Brooks.
A 2024 study found 42% of early childhood teachers rely on public assistance to meet their basic needs.
Like Shipp, Brooks benefited from stabilization grants to provide her workers with higher wages. But without support from the state, that could change.
Brooks was asked Monday what advice she would give to her younger self or someone who is considering opening a childcare facility in North Carolina.
“I would say don’t do it,” answered Brooks, thinking of her own daughter. “Utilize your resources, your talents in a different way.”

Lt. Governor Rachel Hunt, who co-chairs the task force on child care and early education, said lawmakers must take seriously that the industry is an essential service facing a real crisis.
“We need every business, and every county commission, legislator, every branch of government to understand that and that moms and dads are not going to be able to go to work. And then we are not going to be the number one place for business,” said Hunt.
A recent study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation found that 35% of parents who experienced disruptions to their employment in 2024 reported leaving the workforce due to issues with child care.
The state task force is slated to issue a final report with recommendations to strengthen public and private investment in child care infrastructure by the end of this year.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/gettyimages-2219362965-child-care.jpg,,,2025-10-07 06:57:24.854597

Patrick Morrisey announced Medicaid rate increases for home and community‑based services providers who take care of individuals who are elderly and disabled, those with intellectual and developmental disabilities and individuals living with traumatic brain injuries. 
West Virginia uses state and federal money from Medicaid to reimburse county senior centers and private companies that employ direct care workers who help low-income residents remain in their homes.
“This rate increase reflects our commitment to protect and uplift West Virginia’s most vulnerable residents,” Morrisey said in a news release Oct. 3. “My administration will continue making investments in our state’s health care system to increase access and improve outcomes for West Virginians.”
The rate increase is meant to improve pay for direct care workers, who currently earn around $13 an hour, but there is no requirement on how providers spend the money. 
Brad Story
Brad Story, CEO of the West Virginia Behavioral Healthcare Providers Association, said that West Virginians with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) “deserve the opportunity to live, learn, work and thrive in their communities.” 
Without the rate increase, Story said that services that help them do that would be at risk.
“We are extremely grateful to Gov. Morrisey and his administration for the rate increase and investment in our community and home-based providers,” he said on Monday. “This is a great step in the right direction to lessen the strain on our providers and families across the state. We look forward to continuing to work collaboratively with the state to strengthen every corner of behavioral health in West Virginia.” 
Former Gov. Jim Justice announced a similar rate increase last year in hopes of increasing the number of in-home caregivers. The state has dealt with a shortage of workers who can help seniors or people with developmental or intellectual disabilities remain in their homes, which is also a cost-saving measure for the state compared to institutionalized care.
A 2023 survey said West Virginia needed to increase its rate of reimbursement and the worker salary range to $15.50-$18.60 per hour; Justice’s rate increase reflected the study’s recommendations. 
The state Department of Human Services oversees several waiver programs that allow adults and children using Medicaid to remain home with family, and caregivers can receive help with care services.
In a news release, human services Secretary Alex Mayer said Morrisey’s rate increase ensured providers would “have the resources to deliver high-quality services, helping individuals live with dignity and independence. These investments are vital to the health and future of our state.”
“West Virginians deserve care that allows them to remain in their homes and communities, supported by family and providers they know and trust,” Mayer said.

(Photo by Dan Koeck/For the North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota won’t get federal disaster relief for communities affected by the June 20-21 storms until after the government shutdown ends, according to the state Department of Emergency Services.
President Donald Trump last month approved Federal Emergency Management Agency disaster relief to help communities damaged by the severe weather repair and replace infrastructure. The storms included several tornadoes, as well as large hail and heavy wind, which caused significant damage to the state’s agricultural industry.
The state will not be reimbursed for any damages while the shutdown is ongoing, but officials will continue working on reimbursement requests to submit to the federal government in the meantime, according to the North Dakota Department of Emergency Services.
The presidential declaration, which did not include a dollar amount, makes federal assistance available to 19 counties.
Trump approves federal disaster relief for June storms in North Dakota

A preliminary estimate of the damages submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency in July exceeded $11.4 million.
The Department of Emergency Services in a September Emergency Commission meeting said it expects to receive about $16 million in relief money from the federal government. Officials said they expect the state to provide about $2.5 million in assistance.
The 19 counties eligible for relief under the presidential declaration are Barnes, Burleigh, Cass, Eddy, Emmons, Foster, Grant, Griggs, Kidder, McLean, Morton, Oliver, Ransom, Sheridan, Sioux, Steele, Stutsman, Traill and Wells.
The National Weather Service on Monday announced that a tornado that touched down in Enderlin on June 20 had been upgraded to an EF5, the most severe category of tornado. EF5 tornadoes have top wind speeds exceeding 200 mph.
The Enderlin tornado is believed to be the first EF5 in the United States since 2013, according to the National Weather Service website.
The Governor’s Office in September submitted a separate request for federal disaster relief for August storms, which is still under review. The storm caused an estimated $6 million in damage, especially to electrical infrastructure. The state has requested assistance for Barnes, Grand Forks, Griggs, Kidder, Nelson, Steele and Stutsman counties.
The federal government shut down on Wednesday after Congress failed to adopt a budget or stopgap funding, resulting in hundreds of thousands of federal employees being put on furlough and others working without pay. North Dakota agencies last week said that they expect federally funded services provided through the state to be largely unaffected by the shutdown.

Jeff Landry to announce the opening of Camp 57, a facility at the prison that will house immigrant detainees. (Photo by Piper Hutchinson/Louisiana Illuminator) Civil rights advocates say a Honduran man is being held illegally at Louisiana State Penitentiary’s new immigration detention facility because he’s under an order that protects him from deportation, according to a lawsuit filed in federal court Monday.  
Oscar Amaya, 34, also served his criminal sentence for a past conviction, according to the suit filed Monday in the Baton Rouge federal court district by the American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana and Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights. 
The groups have called for the Trump administration to provide valid reasons why Amaya continues to be held.
“Our Constitution is clear: no person can be punished twice for the same offense,” Alanah Odoms, executive director of the ACLU of Louisiana, said in a statement. “Amaya already served his time for his criminal convictions. Keeping him locked up indefinitely in one of the most notorious prisons in America amounts to a de facto life sentence without any due process. That’s unconstitutional and cruel.”
U.S. authorities granted Amaya protection from deportation when he fled Honduras 2005 at age 14 after he demonstrated that he would face torture or death if forced to return to his home country. The violent MS-13 gang had started recruiting him at age 12, according to court records.
Amaya lived and worked in the U.S. without incident until 2016, when he was arrested and convicted of attempted aggravated assault. He was sentenced to four years in prison and released into ICE custody after two years for his record of good behavior. 
The Trump administration issued a deportation order for Amaya earlier this year and has tried to deport him multiple times to countries other than Honduras, according to Monday’s court filing. He had been held at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Pennsylvania before being transferred to Louisiana State Penitentiary.
Amaya arrived at Angola sometime after Sept. 4, when ICE placed the first 51 detainees at the newly renovated Camp J segment of the prison. Calling it Louisiana Lockup, the governor said it would house the “worst of the worst” violent criminal offenders. It has the capacity to hold 400 people, though officials have not shared its current population.
U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi was with Landry and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem at the state prison last month to mark its unveiling. Reached for comment Monday, a Justice Department spokesperson had no comment on the Amaya lawsuit, instead referencing Bondi’s remarks from the Sept. 4 ceremony at Angola. 
At the time, she touted joint efforts among federal, state and local law enforcement targeting “dangerous illegal aliens” allegedly involved in “drug and human smuggling.” 
Bondi thanked Landry “for your use of this incredible facility, locking them up and keeping them here where they will be prosecuted … and they won’t go anywhere,” she said, standing in front of the updated prison wing.
Two weeks ago, Louisiana officials were met with reports that immigrant detainees at Angola were conducting a hunger strike. They were foregoing food to protest a lack of medical care, prescription medication, toilet paper, hygiene products and clean water, according to immigrant advocacy groups.

(Photo by Marga Buschbell-Steeger/Getty Images)Colorado businesses, universities and state agencies say they have been left in the dark about the Trump administration’s cancellation of half a billion dollars in federal clean energy grants following the federal government shutdown.
The terminated grants include over $300 million to Colorado State University, $70 million for Xcel Energy and $50 million for the Tribal Energy Consortium.
“The attempt to use a government shutdown to unlawfully rescind already appropriated funds and terminate federal employees is illegal, pure and simple,” U.S Rep. Joe Neguse, a Democrat, said in a statement Friday. “These acts of retribution are intended to stoke fear, and Democrats must use every legal and legislative tool to reverse these decisions and hold the administration accountable — which is exactly what we intend to do.”

The U.S. Department of Energy announced last week the cancellation of about $7.5 billion in funding for over 200 clean-energy projects across the country. Many of the awards came from the Biden-era Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act.
In a social media post last week, Russell Vought, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, wrote that the cuts targeted “Green New Scam funding to fuel the Left’s climate agenda,” referring to the proposed framework to address climate change championed by progressive Democrats called the Green New Deal. Vought then listed affected states, most of which are led by Democratic governors and voted for Kamala Harris in the 2024 election.
President Donald Trump told reporters in the Oval Office last week that the administration “can do things during the shutdown that are irreversible, that are bad for them,” as reported by NPR. The federal government shut down last Wednesday as congressional Republicans and Democrats grappled over how to fund the government and whether to extend expiring health care subsidies.
“While we have not formally received any official federal notices of termination, we understand that two Colorado projects that total $5 million are on DOE’s list, which specifically targets states where a majority of Americans cast their votes in favor of the Democratic nominee for President,” Ari Rosenblum, a spokesperson for the Colorado Energy Office, wrote in an email. “This clearly politically motivated targeting of grants by the Administration will balloon energy costs, threaten grid reliability, increase pollution, and create instability in our business community.”
CEO has two grants on the termination list, each for $2.5 million. One funds local governments to support work to implement new building energy codes and another provides technical assistance to building owners to comply with standards.
The affected Colorado grants are in five of Colorado’s eight congressional districts and include $2.9 million for a Denver company to study how barges off the coast of Louisiana could transport carbon dioxide, $5 million for a solar thermal energy company in Broomfield and $27 million for Westminster-based Tri-State Generation and Transmission to enhance electric grid flexibility against extreme weather.
“We had been working with DOE over the last two years on the award, after being selected in October 2023,” Tri-State CEO Duane Highley said in a statement. “Over the next few days, we will review our appeal options. While disappointing, the withdrawal of this award does not change our plans to increase grid resiliency and reliability in the most affordable manner for our rural members in Wyoming, Nebraska, New Mexico and Colorado.”
Amanda Bybee, the CEO of Amicus O&M Cooperative in Boulder, called the grant cancellations politically motivated. The company’s three-year, $1.5 million grant was meant to help develop a standardized training process for solar operation and maintenance technicians. It has technically been on pause since February, when their continuation application did not get processed by the new presidential administration, but Bybee said the company has not received an official termination notice following last week’s announcement.
“We had spent about a third of the money, so we had a million dollars to go, and the sad truth is that we will not be able to make that up with other sources,” she told Newsline. “I really don’t see what we’re doing as political. We’re trying to train the technicians who are out here maintaining energy assets, and making sure that they are safe and efficient in the way that they do this work.”
Hank Price, the managing director of SolarDynamics in Broomfield, said the company was also waiting for DOE to approve the next phase of work for two projects under the grants — combined at about $5 million — when the presidential administration changed. That put the projects in “limbo,” Price said.
“As a result, we were expecting this outcome. So, in some sense it is good to have DOE make a decision so we can move on. We can at least contest the decisions now, not that we are optimistic that it will make a difference,” he wrote in an email.
The funding to CSU was awarded to research and create methane-cutting technologies and prevent leaks from oil and gas operations. That contract had been delayed already in January, according to Colorado Public Radio.
“These seven projects support critical research that directly serves the oil and gas industry, energy companies, and energy-producing communities nationwide,” Tiana Kennedy, the university’s associate vice president for communications, wrote in an email. “The cuts would eliminate research positions at the university and halt collaborative work that provides industry and policymakers with trusted data and develops technologies to make the nation’s energy infrastructure safer, more efficient, and competitive.”
The Colorado School of Mines had about $48 million worth of grants canceled, and the University of Colorado system lost about $8.3 million.
Award recipients have 30 days to appeal the decision to the Department of Energy.

(Photo by Perry Bennett/West Virginia Legislative Photography)Del. Kathie Hess Crouse, a “school choice” advocate in the Legislature, is working with the state Department of Education to create a “school choice portal,” along with the state’s first School Choice office. It may be housed in the state education department. 
Hess Crouse, R-Putnam, is wanting the state to more efficiently assist students who are exiting the public school system to enroll in homeschooling, private schools, microschools and more.
The school choice portal, as she called it, would allow parents who are homeschooling to submit the required applications and find a certified teacher who could approve a homeschool student’s portfolio of schoolwork.
“The catalyst is just that we need to move into this century … A school choice portal was a way that I thought maybe we can have it all in one place, easy for parents to access,” Hess Crouse explained Monday at a meeting of the Educational Choice Subcommittee in the House of Delegates. Hess Crouse serves as chair of the subcommittee.
Homeschool students are required to submit a portfolio each grade level. State law doesn’t require a certain type of teaching certification or experience to review the students’ portfolios. 
Parents could also submit a students’ scores onto the portal.
“Right now, parents have to either email or mail their paperwork to the county boards of Ed and then the boards have to put all that within the system,” Hess Crouse said.
The technology would have been mandated in a House bill from earlier this year, but the measure failed to get through the Senate. 
Education department Deputy Superintendent Sonya White told lawmakers that the department is working on implementing the portal sans the legislative mandate. 
“Sometime before the end of this month, we expect to have the site ready for initial review and testing,” White said.
The technology could reduce county school boards’ workloads when assisting families who need information from the public school system to change to homeschooling or private school. The information would now be maintained in the portal operated by the WVDE, which the department is developing in-house at no extra cost to the state. 
Students are assigned a unique school identification number, known as a “WVEIS number,” in the public school system, and families need this number in order to apply for the Hope Scholarship, the state’s school voucher program.
Hess Crouse also said there will likely be legislation next year to create a state Office of School Choice. 
White said the education department is exploring possibly running the office at the estimated cost of $500,000, which includes paying for a manager and four program assistants to work around the state.
“It would be contingent upon appropriation,” she said. 
Hess Crouse said she’d prefer it to be housed elsewhere outside of the state department of education.
“It was something that just started with a conversation, and my vision for it may be a little different than the state board’s vision for it, but it’s basically to give parents a place to go to ask the questions and get the truthful answers on school choice,” Hess Crouse said, adding that she is told parents often receive conflicting information from school boards about their students’ options and records. 
“I wanted our parents to have the correct information to where they could go and they knew the information they were going to get would be unbiased, and that they would know what they had to do, what was required for them by law, whatever choice it was they made,” she said.
State School Board President Paul Hardesty said last week that lawmakers’ focus on school choice has resulted in tens of thousands of students leaving the public school system, prompting statewide school consolidations and closures. Under the current school funding formula, counties receive state funding based on the number of students.  
Sixteen public schools closed in 2024, up from nine in 2023, according to the WVDE.
“The financial instability of the system continues to grow and continues to grow and gets worse and worse,” Hardesty said, adding that the state schools were bound by many regulations while private schools and homeschools are subject to limited state guidelines. 
In response to his comments, Hess Crouse put out a statement on Monday, pointing to West Virginia’s nearly-bottom ranking nationally in education outcomes. 
“Parents deserve to decide what works best for their children, whether that is homeschooling, private school, microschools, charter schools or the Hope Scholarship,” she wrote. “At the end of the day, education belongs to parents, not the state. The school boards can no longer bully families into staying in a system that does not serve them.”

(Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)Early in 2024, during the Biden administration, U.S. Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, had a chance to provide the world with financial information about disgraced sex trafficker and financier Jeffrey Epstein. 
It only recently became known that Crapo was asked to join the senior Democrat on the U.S. Senate Finance Committee in a subpoena for the Epstein material held by the Treasury Department. For some reason he refused.
For years, and particularly before it became standard practice to refuse to work on virtually anything with anyone in the other party, Crapo and Ron Wyden, the Oregon Democrat now the ranking member of the Crapo-led Finance Committee, have annually teamed up to pass legislation to provide funding to rural schools. They did so again in June in an increasingly rare example of bipartisan legislating. 
But bipartisanship clearly doesn’t extend to information the government, particularly the Treasury Department, has on Jeffrey Epstein. Crapo, it seems clear, has been stonewalling any effort to force release of material that members of his staff reviewed more than 18 months ago. 
One of many mysteries about Epstein, who was in prison in 2019 awaiting trial at the time of his death, was how the guy amassed a fortune estimated at $550 million, as well as several lavish estates and a private island. 
Where all that money came from and for what purpose are central questions in understanding Epstein’s crimes. Wyden has been on the case for months. When he asked Crapo to help him Crapo refused. 
After the New York Times recently reported that JP Morgan Chase, “arguably the world’s most prestigious bank,” had long treated Epstein as a “treasured client,” while essentially ignoring mounting questions about the vast sums of money flowing into and out of his accounts, Wyden insisted the bank provide information. The Oregon senator demanded an explanation as to why the bank continued to cover up Epstein’s “suspicious transactions for six years after firing him as a client.” 
Earlier Wyden introduced legislation that would compel Treasury Secretary Scott Bessett to turn over his department’s Epstein record, while Crapo voted against a separate effort to compel release of Epstein documents.

But before Wyden introduced his Epstein legislation a curious thing happened, way back in February 2024, while Joe Biden was still president. As the Oregon Capital Chronicle reported earlier this month: 
“For several hours on Valentine’s Day in 2024, staff from Oregon U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden’s office and the Senate Finance Committee sat in a room in the U.S. Treasury Department reviewing, thousands of suspicious financial transactions made by deceased and disgraced financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
“The transactions totaled more than $1 billion and included payments to women from eastern European countries where many of Epstein’s alleged victims are from. Along with Wyden’s team, staff from the offices of Republican Sens. Mike Crapo of Idaho and Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee reviewed the documents, according to Wyden. Spokespersons for Crapo and Blackburn did not respond to requests for comment from the Capital Chronicle.
The Senate staffers we allowed to look at document and take notes but not allowed to make copies. 
“And because you can’t take that stuff out of the room,” Wyden said, “I asked, particularly, if the Republicans would be willing to join me in a subpoena that would get the rest of the information that was crucial, and they wouldn’t do that. And that was during the Biden years.”
In a Sept. 2, 2025, letter to Bessent, the Treasury secretary, Wyden elaborated on one document his staff and Crapo’s reviewed in 2024. 
“One of the documents,” Wyden wrote, “indicates that between 2003 and 2019, there were more than 4,725 wire transfers totaling $1.08 billion involving Jeffrey Epstein and his associates … These documents also contain details of hundreds of millions in payments to Epstein from Wall Street financiers, including $170 million Leon Black paid Epstein for purported tax and estate planning advice.” 
Leon Black is a billionaire private equity investor. In 2023 Black reached a $62.5 million settlement with the government of the U.S. Virgin Islands that, as the Times reported, released Black “from any potential claims arising out of the territory’s three-year investigation into the sex trafficking operation” of Epstein. Black contends he did nothing wrong, but he sure did pay a lot of money to avoid further investigation of ties to Epstein. 
“Furthermore,” Wyden wrote to Bessent, “records show that Epstein used correspondent accounts at multiple Russian banks, to process hundreds of millions of payments related to potential sex trafficking. Several of these Russian banks are now under U.S. sanctions and many of the women and girls Epstein targeted came from Russia, Belarus, Turkey and Turkmenistan. These records outline specific names of women and girls, correspondent bank account numbers in Russia used to process the payments, as well as details on Epstein associates who had signatory authority over Epstein’s accounts and signed off on payments related to sex trafficking.”
So why hasn’t Mike Crapo joined Ron Wyden in a quest to get this information from the Treasury Department? Why has Crapo put on ice his committee’s oversight jurisdiction over the Treasury Department? Why wouldn’t he pursue Epstein documents while Biden was in office? 
I emailed Crapo’s press office, as well as person who handles communication for the Finance Committee. No response. Nothing. 
Specifically I asked: 
– Did Crapo’s staff review the Epstein documents? 
– Who specifically was involved in the review? 
– Why has Crapo not joined Wyden in pressing for the release of these materials? 
I wanted to know – perhaps his constituents would like to know – why Crapo wasn’t demanding answers about Epstein’s finances. Opinion polls clearly indicate the American public, people in both parties, believe answers are necessary. 
There are at least three plausible reasons Crapo refused when he had the chance to get Epstein information to the public. 
Perhaps he thinks it’s not important. 
Perhaps he thinks there is some privacy question involved, even though Epstein is long dead and his chief accomplice is in jail. 
Or perhaps those records Crapo’s staff saw in 2024 get too close to someone Crapo doesn’t want to offend, a big campaign contributor or Wall Street banker or CEO. 
Had Crapo agreed to that subpoena last year we’d likely know a whole lot more about Jeffrey Epstein today.

The resolutions could signal a lack of support for school choice among everyday Mississippians, something opponents have previously noted. 
Municipal boards in Clinton, Pearl, Florence and Jackson all adopted anti-school choice resolutions in September, citing constituents’ disapproval.
READ MORE: Lawmakers want to expand ‘school choice’ in Mississippi. Here’s what it looks like in neighboring states
School choice refers to a number of policies that give more educational options to families outside of traditional public schools, often allowing them to use public dollars to fund this education. Despite the recent success of the state’s public education system, powerful state lawmakers such as House Speaker Jason White say the issue will headline the upcoming legislative session.
Gov. Tate Reeves has been a vocal supporter of increased school choice, which proponents say parents across the state have been demanding. 
But Nancy Loome, executive director of the public school advocacy organization The Parents’ Campaign, said the local ordinances are a testament to the opposite, and the role public schools play in Mississippi communities such as Clinton, where Loome lives. 
The Clinton Board of Aldermen adopted a resolution on Sept. 2 opposing school choice initiatives that “redirect critical public funds away from local public school districts and instead subsidize private, unaccountable education providers.”
“The board members believe, rightly, that it is one of the biggest threats to their communities — not just their public schools, but their whole communities,” Loome said. “They’re not going to sit by in silence while the folks we elect on the state level push through something that would be very detrimental to their cities.”
The Clinton resolution also notes that in other states, voucher programs often have not improved academic outcomes and that, in many cases, families with students who already attend private schools are the main beneficiaries. 
In Mississippi, school-choice advocates say the policies will improve access to quality education — in most cases, this means private schools or homeschooling — for low-income students. House leaders have insisted they will create a program that caters to the neediest students in Mississippi, and that it will be regulated, so it won’t bankrupt the state’s public schools. 
But Chip Wilbanks, a Clinton alderman, doesn’t think expanding school choice will have that outcome. 
He and his wife, like many of their neighbors, moved to Clinton to raise their family because of the strong public-school system, Wilbanks said. The district is consistently one of the highest rated in the state.
Wilbanks
Wilbanks said he hasn’t yet encountered a Clinton resident who supports expanding school choice. 
“The public school district is the epicenter of our town, and the success of our city is tied to it,” he said. “I know there’s no current bill on the table, but we wanted to get out in front of it and say we’re not for this as a concept.”
Wilbanks said his main concern with school-choice policies is the diversion of funding from public schools. He hopes the city’s resolution will encourage more voters to inform themselves about the issue and investigate beyond party lines. 
“Clinton votes very Republican, and this is a Republican-pushed issue,” he said. “I just want people to look at the issue for themselves and see how they think it would affect small towns like Clinton that are dependent on public schools.” 
Florence, another conservative Jackson suburb, adopted an anti-school choice resolution for similar reasons, said Mayor Pro Tempore Brian Grantham. 
While he was campaigning for his seat on the Florence Board of Aldermen over the past few months, school choice kept coming up, Grantham said. 
“A lot of people I talked to were concerned about the impact on our schools in Rankin County and in Florence,” he said. “Most people really like the school system, and they really don’t want to see any major changes. When you have something good going, you want to keep it that way.” 
The story is more complicated in the state’s capital city. 
Jackson Public Schools, the only urban district in the state, most recently received a “C” rating from the state Department of Education and has struggled more than its neighboring districts.
Still, Jackson Councilman Kevin Parkinson, a former charter school administrator, helped lead the effort to adopt the Jackson City Council’s resolution, which he says is “anti-privatization,” rather than “anti-school choice.” 
Parkinson
Charter schools fall under the “school-choice” umbrella, but Parkinson said there’s a difference between supporting charters and supporting vouchers that use public dollars for private education, which Mississippi lawmakers are considering. 
Vouchers, he said, are not supported by his constituents in Jackson. Still, Parkinson is nervous it will happen anyway because of aggressive efforts from state lawmakers. 
“We’re not perfect, but for the first time, other states are modeling their education on what Mississippi is doing,” he said. “This would be a generational step backwards.”
The Board of Aldermen in Pearl adopted an anti-school choice resolution on Sept. 16. Board members did not respond to repeated requests for comment.

Martin Thielen
Martin Thielen stated the above pre-election, in February of 2024.
As a Methodist pastor in Arkansas and Tennessee, his view is that religion is being waylaid by the right to promote a philosophy which is the opposite of what Jesus preached. He decries religion’s use as a political tool. Thielen details his views in a Methodist publication.
A Pew Research Center study analyzed how religion was changing in West Virginia and the U.S. The findings were somewhat surprising in view of the way that the MAGA movement is marketing itself as bringing religion back, especially in red states like West Virginia.
Religion is generally falling in importance for West Virginians, 70% deeming it important in 2023 versus 89% in 2007. Even more interesting is the data regarding observance — 51% of West Virginia’s adults seldom or never attended services in 2023. That is significantly more than 2007, when only 41% did not attend. The figures for the U.S. overall were telling, with nearly half (49%) stating that they did not go to services in 2023.
In 2007, 78% of adults in West Virginia indicated that they were Christians. But in the short space of 16 years, that figure had fallen to 64%. And only 62% in the U.S. identified as Christian in 2023. In 2007, there were only 2% of West Virginia residents identifying as “other religions;” half of these were Jewish. By 2023, that figure had risen to 3%, with 1% being Buddhist.
In 2023, 86% West Virginians believed in God. But the number was even higher in 2007 — 93%. And the number who were “absolutely certain” in God’s existence dropped tremendously from 76% to only 56% in 2023. The 2023 figure was even lower for all U.S. residents, only 54% were certain. 
There was also a major change in the number of residents who classified themselves as “religiously unaffiliated.” The figure for West Virginia was only 19% in 2007, but it grew to 31% by 2023. That figure was slightly lower for the U.S. — 29%.
Views are also changing regarding some items which have religious aspects. For example, in 2007 much less than half (38%) of state residents believed that abortion should be legal in all or most cases. That figure had risen significantly to 54% in 2023 for West Virginians, and 64% nationally, which brings into question the popularity of the extreme MAGA anti-abortion position.
In 2014, more than half of West Virginians (51%) opposed same-sex marriages. That figure fell to 44% for the state and 32% for all Americans.
The bottom line is that both the U.S. and West Virginia are becoming less religiously oriented, despite MAGA politics. Along with that change, our residents’ views on key social issues are becoming more progressive versus past years. It also reinforces my own view that the GOP did not win the presidency based on their opposition to “wokeness.” The 2024 election was won due to inflation and economic issues, as well as former President Joe Biden’s failure to control the southern border. Plus, Biden’s failure to resign back in 2023 and hand the reins of government over to former Vice President KamalaHarris.

(Photo by Megan Henry, Ohio Capital Journal).With legal clarification from Republican Attorney General Russell Coleman in hand, the Oldham County Board of Education is poised to consider offering Bible education classes to students in the public school district. 
Ohio-based nonprofit LifeWise Academy offers off-campus instruction to public school students around the country and has pending requests before school boards across Kentucky. The Oldham County request could be discussed during a special meeting on Wednesday. 
The attorney general’s office released an opinion in late September on a law that allows school boards to accept proposals for “moral instruction” from third party groups. The legislature changed the law earlier this year. 
Oldham County Board Chair Carly Chem said in an email to the Kentucky Lantern that the reasoning behind requesting the opinion was to “ensure that the board was following the law with this particular statute.” An attorney for the board, Rudy J. Ellis III, requested the opinion along with Republican state Sen. Lindsey Tichenor, who represents Oldham County. 
“The statute is written so loosely that we needed clarification on what we needed to do in order to confirm we were following the law,” Clem said. “The opinion gave us just that.”
The attorney general’s opinion addresses several points, including advising school boards that they may reject proposals but not without supplying a reason. A school board is “not required to approve a request submitted by a qualified provider to provide moral instruction to students, provided that a board’s decision to deny a request is not arbitrary or motivated by ‘animosity to religion.’” The opinion also says a school board that denies a request “must disclose to the applicant the ‘substantial evidence’ it relied on” and disclose to the Kentucky Department of Education all reasons for denying the request. 
With the moral instruction law passed by the Kentucky General Assembly in the spring, LifeWise Academy has formed planning teams in school districts across the state to propose programs to local school boards. The proposals typically say that LifeWise employees and volunteers will transport students off school grounds for Bible-based character instruction during school hours with parents’ permission. 
The Warren County Board of Education narrowly rejected a LifeWise Academy proposal. Meanwhile, the McCracken County Board of Education approved a request. Marshall County Schools has had an active LifeWise program since 2023. 
The Heritage Foundation awarded LifeWise one of its Innovation Prizes earlier this year, which included a financial award. LifeWise reported in its most recent IRS filing that its revenue exceeded expenses by $17 million. The organization reported its revenue grew from $13.8 million to $35.3 million from 2023 to 2024.
In Oldham County, LifeWise Academy’s proposal is for one hour of Bible-based character education weekly, starting with students at Locust Grove Elementary School in third to fifth grades.
Kentucky Citizens for Democracy, a group of Oldham County residents, has opposed the LifeWise proposal over the summer. Anita Davis, the group’s associate director, told the Lantern that she felt the attorney general’s opinion “does clarify” the law and supports that “school boards have the independence and authority to make those decisions locally.” 
Davis, formerly Oldham County Schools’ chief academic officer, said “the loss of instructional time is substantial evidence” for school boards statewide to reject these programs. 
A  rejection based on students losing time in the classroom wouldn’t be based on religion, she added. 
School boards could get requests from faith groups of any religion.
“You have to be very, very careful as a school board that if you’re going to do this, you can’t say one can come in and one cannot based on the religion that they represent,” Davis said. 
In a statement, LifeWise founder and CEO Joe Penton told the Lantern, “LifeWise welcomes the opportunity to work with communities that want to make Bible-based character education during school hours available to students. It is up to each school district in Kentucky to determine the released time religious instruction policies for their area. It is our hope that school boards ensure that parents who want Bible education during school hours for their children have the freedom to choose that option, given that religious release time has been legal for over 70 years.” 
In 1952, in a 6-3 decision, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld New York City’s “released time” program that allowed students to leave school to participate in religious instruction.

Breckinridge appear to have little in common. Breckinridge was the Democratic Party's nominee in 1860, losing to Republican Abraham Lincoln. Breckinridge went on to become a Confederate general. (Liam Niemeyer, National Endowment for the Humanities)While some Kentucky Democrats are pulling for Andy Beshear to run for the Senate next year, others want him to toss his hat in the ring for their party’s 2028 presidential nomination.
Evidence suggests that our two-term governor is more inclined toward the latter option. And he’s attracting national attention. NPR’s Steve Inskeep interviewed Beshear on “Morning Edition” last week. Washington Monthly just published an article headlined “Why Andy Beshear Is a First-Tier Presidential Contender.” 
If he were to win the Democratic nod, Beshear would be the first lifelong Kentuckian to top a major party’s ticket in 168 years.
That gap underscores Kentucky’s declining prominence in national affairs since the Civil War. “Between 1824 and 1860, there were 10 presidential elections,” explained James Klotter, Kentucky’s official state historian, in an email. “A measure of Kentucky’s importance in the nation is that the state had a candidate running for president or vice president in eight of the 10 races.”
When our nation was young, not many states had a greater impact on national politics, the economy and society than Kentucky.
“Kentucky was the breadbasket for the nation as late as 1840, when it ranked first or second in the production of corn, wheat, hemp, tobacco and bourbon, and fourth in rye, and was a leader in the horse and mule industries,” Klotter said. “Louisville was the third largest city in the South, after New Orleans, and Baltimore, and Lexington’s cultural strengths earned it the title of ‘the Athens of the West.’”
In addition, Kentucky, the first state admitted to the Union west of the Appalachian Mountains, was the gateway to our first West — the vast territory from the Appalachians to the Mississippi River. After the Revolutionary War, thousands of westward-bound migrants trekked through the Cumberland Gap or floated down the Ohio in flatboats and other vessels.
Many who stopped in Kentucky later moved on to other states. Volume I of Lewis and Richard Collins’ 1874 “History of Kentucky” lists more than three dozen Kentuckians who became governors, acting governors, lieutenant governors or secretaries of state elsewhere. Another 28 became diplomats.
Kentucky emigres sometimes transplanted Kentucky place names to other states. Elizabethtown is the seat of Hardin County in southern Illinois, which also includes the towns of West Frankfort and Eddyville.  
Anyway, the last major party presidential nominee from Kentucky was Democrat John C. Breckinridge in 1860. Elected vice president in 1856 and sworn in at age 36, the Fayette countian still ranks as the youngest vice president.  
Breckinridge was born near Lexington. Beshear is a Lexington native. Other than birthplace and party label, Breckinridge and Beshear apparently have nothing in common. 
Beshear is arguably the most progressive governor in Kentucky history. Breckinridge ran for president in 1860 as a pro-slavery Southern Democrat.
In a four-way race, Breckinridge finished second to Kentucky-born, anti-slavery Illinoisan Abraham Lincoln, a Republican. Breckinridge was also runner up in slave state Kentucky but to Constitutional Unionist John Bell, not to Lincoln, who trailed Northern Democrat Stephen A. Douglas. One of our greatest presidents-to-be managed just 1,366 votes in the Bluegrass State. .
While most Kentuckians stuck by the Stars and Stripes in the Civil War, a minority, including Breckinridge, favored the Confederacy. He was a Confederate general and the last Confederate secretary of war.
Virginia native Henry Clay, Kentucky’s greatest statesman, spent much of his political career trying to stave off disunion and civil war. He thrice sought and lost the presidency as a Whig — in 1824, 1832 and 1844. Ashland, Clay’s Lexington home and estate, is preserved as a museum. 
Elevated to the White House in 1848, Whig Zachary Taylor, an American hero of the Mexican-American War, was born in Virginia. But he lived most of his life in Louisville, Klotter pointed out. “Old Rough and Ready” is entombed in the Derby City’s National Cemetery which bears his name. (Springfield, his home, is preserved as a private residence near the burial ground.)
In 1952, Graves County-born Democratic Vice President Alben Barkley of Paducah tried for his party’s presidential nod, but only briefly. Gov. Adlai Stevenson of Illinois, Barkley’s distant cousin, got the nomination and came up short against Republican Dwight Eisenhower.
Not only did Kentucky lose political and economic clout after the Civil War, its population also dwindled. “Kentucky was a populous state, in the top fifth among the states,” Klotter said.
In 1860, Kentucky and Tennessee had 12 electoral votes each — more electoral votes than 25 of the Union’s 33 states. (Today Kentucky has eight electoral votes, Tennessee 11.)
 “After the Civil War, Kentucky didn’t keep pace — falling to the lower half in population,” Klotter said. “And instead of a diversified agriculture, it put its faith more into one crop, tobacco. Now, less than 5% of the state’s GNP comes from agriculture.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/13-e1759778455983-1024x565.jpg,,,2025-10-07 05:56:13.464233

“Boy, we sure hate what they’re doing to our country,” goes the thinking that one often hears expressed, “but we wish that our side could stop pussyfooting around and learn a thing or two from the right about doing what it takes to win!”
In some ways at least, it’s an understandable sentiment. Over the last several years, progressives have watched in horror as a determined minority movement has seized control of and radicalized the nation’s laws and governmental institutions in unprecedented ways. In numerous areas – public and higher education, personal bodily autonomy, the role and rights of corporations and workers, racial and gender equality, the distribution of the nation’s wealth, separation of church and state, gun ownership, combating the climate crisis, and even America’s role in the world – the right has succeeded in overturning decades of slow but mostly steady progress and imposing a series of dramatic policy 180’s.
What’s more, to add to the frustration, the change in no way reflects any kind of significant shift in public opinion or popular values.
Rather, like so many past authoritarian movements that seized upon narrow electoral victories and, either by hook or crook, converted them into massive power shifts and policy sea changes, modern American conservatives have used passion, large doses of cynical pragmatism and an unapologetic willingness to shatter legal and societal norms to secure their objectives.
Think about it – the proof of this reality is in the numbers. Donald Trump lost the popular vote in two of the last three national elections and won less than 50% of the vote in his 2024 victory. Congress has been divided by the narrowest of margins for years. In North Carolina, registered Democrats still slightly outnumber registered Republicans and as multiple razor-thin Supreme Court races demonstrate, it remains a deeply “purple” state.
If ever there was a time in which public attitudes would seem to demand divided, middle ground government, this is it.
Instead, of course, we have the opposite. Rather than generally staying the course or pursuing incremental change, Republicans in Washington, DC and several states like North Carolina have repeatedly swung for the fences and moved with all the speed they can muster to roll back past progressive wins and lock in unpopular, ultra-right policies – like slashing taxes on the rich, disempowering workers, undermining reproductive freedom, abandoning efforts to combat climate change and militarizing law enforcement.
Will they succeed in effecting a lasting overhaul of American society?
Maybe.
While it’s true that many, if not most, hard right and authoritarian regimes in modern times have eventually foundered, Trump and company have taken some steps – perhaps most notably in the courts – that will make rooting out some of their changes quite difficult.
That said, a recent public opinion poll in North Carolina helps shine a light on what could be an important Achilles’ Heel.
The issue is gerrymandering – the drawing of political maps to rig elections for partisan purposes.
As has been well-publicized, Republicans have been moving aggressively at Trump’s specific direction of late to further gerrymander already rigged electoral maps in a handful of states they already control in hopes of retaining their narrow control of the U.S. House in the 2026 elections. This includes North Carolina, where it appears Republican legislative leaders are likely to pass legislation later this month that would eliminate chances for Democrats to prevail in the First Congressional District – a region in the state’s east that takes in most of the so-called “Black Belt,” currently represented by Democrat Don Davis.
If this effort succeeds – and some reports indicate that Senate President Pro Tem Phil Berger has pledged to do the deed in exchange for a Trump endorsement in his 2026 GOP primary, although Berger has denied this — the state’s already rigged U.S. House map would shift from 10-4 Republican to 11-3.
As a new poll conducted by a GOP polling firm and released by the good government nonprofit Common Cause demonstrates convincingly, however, such a move will be enormously unpopular. The poll found that 84% of voters – including 78% of unaffiliated voters and 65% of Republicans – said gerrymandering maps for partisan advantage is “never acceptable.” Two-thirds of GOP leaders said the practice should be illegal and nearly half conceded that the current already rigged maps were likely unfairly drawn.
Could this remarkable consensus in public opinion ultimately help give rise to a shift in attitudes and behavior among enough voters (and help anger enough progressives) to help swing upcoming elections against Trump and set the nation on a different path? In such closely divided times, it certainly seems possible.
Whatever the case, the blatant and desperate nature of the scheme provides a strong indication that, like many other authoritarian fear-dependent regimes down through human history, the Trump movement is grappling with some significant fears of its own.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Redistricting-Daniel-1024x766.jpg,,,2025-10-07 05:56:13.464233

(Stock photo by Greenleaf123/Getty Images)After a lower court ruled that the state had violated indigent criminal defendants’ constitutional rights by failing to provide them legal representation, Maine officials will argue before the Maine Supreme Judicial Court on Tuesday in an effort to appeal orders to temporarily release people and drop charges while they wait for an attorney.
Maine’s lack of representation for indigent defendants — those who can’t afford their own counsel and have to rely on the state for a public defender — has been deemed a constitutional crisis after the American Civil Liberties Union sued the state and the Maine Commission on Public Defense Services, which is responsible for providing representation. 
Last month, the commission reported that more than 400 defendants were still waiting for attorneys. At the same time, the public defense system is stretched thin and facing a $13 million shortfall which means it will soon be unable to compensate contracted criminal defense attorneys. 
Budget shortfall, burnout strain attorneys in Maine’s indigent defense system

In January, the Kennebec County Superior Court ruled the state’s failure to provide timely counsel to defendants who can’t afford an attorney a constitutional crisis. Two months later, Maine Superior Court Justice Michaela Murphy ordered the state to address the issue. If not adequately resolved, Murphy also said the state must start conducting hearings to release indigent defendants who have been jailed without legal counsel for at least 14 days, and to temporarily dismiss charges against defendants without representation for more than 60 days after their initial court appearance.
But the state appealed that decision and those hearings, which were slated to start in June, have been on pause until Maine’s highest court weighs in. As a result, no defendants were released or had their charges temporarily dismissed, according to the ACLU. 
In an August brief urging the Maine Supreme Judicial Court to uphold the lower court decision, the ACLU wrote, “after a painstaking review of the caselaw and the record, the trial court correctly concluded that the [commission and State of Maine] had violated the Sixth Amendment by failing to provide counsel at critical stages of pretrial proceedings.”

(FatCamera/Getty Images)Virginia’s Maternal Mortality Review Team will continue its operations until August of next year. The future of the team, however, will depend on future congressional action and Virginia’s willingness to continue it. That’s because federal funding to support the cohort’s work had already been allocated before it was recently cut from the pending national spending plan.
When Congress shut down the government last week amid stalemates on annual appropriations bills, an effort to extend funding that Virginia uses to address maternal deaths was left out of the legislation. Dubbed the Enhancing Reviews and Surveillance to Eliminate Maternal Mortality, or ERASE MM, nearly $90 million has gone towards state committees around the country that review birth-related deaths and analyze the causes. Committees’ findings have helped spur protocols aimed at preventing hemorrhage, sepsis or suicide of new parents. 
The Virginia Department of Health confirmed that Virginia’s team will continue its data collection until August 31, 2026, since the 2025-2026 funds had already been allocated. U.S. Rep. Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond told The Mercury ahead of the shutdown that she “absolutely” plans to work on legislation to reauthorize the funding in the future. 
While Virginia collects a variety of maternal health data, the “Pregnancy-Associated Deaths” dashboard  is bolstered by the ERASE MM funding, a spokesperson from VDH said, and is slated to conclude by next year. 
According to VDH, the dashboard takes into account a “woman’s life, health, and healthcare utilization in the five years before death.” 
The review team explores the factors that contribute to someone dying during or after pregnancy, whether related to their community, their health before pregnancy, patients’ health care provider, or the facility where they gave birth. According to data collected between 2018 and 2022, 34% of pregnancy-related deaths in Virginia happened during pregnancy and 27% occurred within 42 days of giving birth. Accidental overdoses, cardiac-related incidents and infections were the top three causes that were identified. 
Despite white women outnumbering Black women in Virginia by roughly five to one, Black pregnancy-related deaths nearly doubled that of white women.
‘Momnibus bill’ plans announced at Virginia’s Black Maternal Health Summit

Virginia’s review team fits into the slate of recent state efforts to improve maternal health. A series of related bills called the “Virginia Momnibus” — a riff on the term omnibus — passed the legislature this year and were signed into law by Gov. Glenn Youngkin. The bills adjusted Medicaid reimbursement rates for midwives and established pilot programs to remotely monitor hypertension. 
Not every bill passed, however, like an effort to require unconscious bias training for health care worker license renewal. If passed, it would help target one aspect of why Black women are more likely to die in childbirth, in which the National Institutes of Health have noted health care workers’ racial bias can play a role. Virginia’s own data collected also shows higher death rates for Black parents. That measure, which has been carried by members of both political parties, passed the legislature before meeting Youngkin’s veto for the second year in a row. 
More broadly, maternal mortality-related data collection has helped inform policies in recent years and garnered the bipartisan support ERASE MM had when then- President Donald Trump signed it into law seven years ago. Earlier this year, Youngkin signaled support for Virginia’s continued work on enhancing health outcomes for new parents. 
While Democrats led on addressing maternal health issues in the state in recent years, Del. Candi Mundon King, D-Prince William, emphasized the bipartisan work in a recent call with The Mercury and stressed how Virginia’s next governor will need to sign a budget that takes broad health care needs into account next year. 
“We’ve worked really hard to say that maternal health, it doesn’t matter if you’re a Democrat or Republican,” she said. “If we really want to be a strong, growing commonwealth, we have to take care of our moms.”

Sargent Reynolds Community College in Henrico. (Photo courtesy WWBT)The number of students registering for dual enrollment and career and technical education continues to grow in the commonwealth, but simultaneously, student enrollment at Virginia’s community colleges has declined by 7% over nearly a 10-year period, creating a financial strain on the system and negatively impacting smaller colleges, state researchers revealed Monday. 
Results from a study conducted by researchers for the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission, presented on Oct. 6, come as lawmakers weigh policy decisions, including funding support  for the Virginia Community College System (VCCS), ahead of the upcoming General Assembly Session beginning Jan. 14. 
Researchers recommended that the state Board for Community Colleges initiate a strategic review and propose a plan for how the system can more efficiently deliver services, especially in regions with smaller colleges.
David Doré, VCCS chancellor, said at Monday’s presentation that he supports the report, which aligns with the system’s Accelerate Opportunity strategy plan to increase dual enrollment access, improve efficiency and enable stronger student outcomes.
“The importance of an efficient, transparent and unified community college system cannot be overstated,” said Doré. “As we look ahead, the Virginia community college system remains steadfast in its commitment to continuous improvement and accountability, always striving to meet the needs of our students, employers and communities.”
Researchers found that dual enrollment has increased at VCCS, growing by about 13,000 from 2021-22 school year to last school year. The state’s dual enrollment program allows students to earn college credits before graduating from high school with school divisions and colleges picking up the costs.
Virginia’s community colleges also relied more heavily on state funds in fiscal year 2024, with a 12% increase over the previous seven years. Declining enrollment and fixed costs, such as infrastructure and staffing, were contributing factors.
CTE programs are also being subsidized by community colleges with excess revenue from academic transfer programs, according to researchers. CTE programs typically cost VCCS more than academic transfer programs, at $466 per credit hour compared to $242 per credit hour. 
Smaller colleges with fewer than 1,000 students are also spending more per student, around $21,000. Schools with 10,000 or more students spend $13,000.

VCCS informed researchers that the system has established a periodic review of individual colleges and implemented budget reductions in response to revenue declines, including staff layoffs. 
Researchers also found that data predicts a reduction in the number of high school graduates in the future because of declining birth rates, changing opinions about the value of a college degree, growing interest in technical and career-focused training and the increased enrollment in online courses, which are impacting enrollment and costs.
The number of students taking online courses more than doubled, from 17% in the 2015-2016 school year to 41% in the 2024-2025 school year. In-person courses dropped from 39% to 11% during the same time period.
Researchers also found that students tend to be “less successful” in asynchronous courses, or those that allow students to complete their coursework on their own schedule, but the differences are not substantial. Success was defined as a student earning a “C” grade or above, or passing a pass/fail course.
The research team recommended VCCS require students retaking an asynchronous course that they failed or withdrew from to meet with an advisor, monitor their success and work with individual colleges to determine the root causes.
Researchers also found that CTE enrollment grew by 8% from the 2015-2016 and 2024-2025 school years. Most of the growth is attributed to the short-term training program Fast Forward, which is designed to prepare students for careers in high-demand fields, including health care, information technology and skilled trades.
VCCS should try to identify opportunities to improve the program, researchers recommended, including by evaluating whether completers obtain and keep their jobs in the field for which they are trained, and whether wages increase three to five years after a program’s completion.
Senate Subcommittee Chair on Higher Education Mamie Locke, D-Hampton, who sits on the commission, said she agrees with the recommendation and the effort by VCCS to review the trends and propose a plan to deliver services more efficiently. 
With the financial strain on VCCS, she said, consolidating the 23 schools is not the best plan for the schools, students or communities, she said.
“There are some people who think that 23 is too many, but I don’t agree because some of these community colleges are kind of like the lifeblood of these communities,” Locke said to the Mercury. “All 23 need to remain, but with this, they can see how they can more effectively use the system.”

(Photo by Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)Unless you’ve been in a coma or a cave since Friday morning, you probably know about the bloody fantasy that Jay Jones, the Democratic nominee for state attorney general, shared in 2022 with a Republican House of Delegates member.
The lurid anger Jones’ comments reveal is as clear as it is sobering. His message was unmistakable.
‘Beyond disqualifying’: Jay Jones controversy jolts Virginia’s pivotal 2025 elections

What baffles me is why Jones — a lawyer, a former delegate, and a highly educated guy — would knowingly, freely entrust such career-killing collateral in writing to an elected officeholder of the opposition party.
As first reported by the National Review, Jones mistakenly sent to Del. Carrie Coyner, R-Chesterfield, a text venting his resentment over eulogies being made for a moderate Democratic former delegate from southwestern Virginia. But when he became aware of the misdirected missive, he unspooled a hypothetical scenario to Coyner in which he held a gun with two bullets, and before him stood Todd Gilbert, then the Republican speaker of the Virginia House, and two of history’s most genocidal despots — Adolf Hitler and Pol Pot, who was behind Cambodia’s killing fields.
To the question of which of the three he would shoot, he didn’t mince words.
“Gilbert gets two bullets to the head,” Jones texted. “Spoiler: put Gilbert in the crew with the two worst people you know and he receives both bullets every time.”
Just a bad joke, right? If only.
Jones then doubled down on the depravity, telling Coyner that he hoped Gilbert’s wife, Jennifer, would one day hold her child as it died so she and her husband would know the anguish that parents of children killed by gun violence feel, according to the report.
Most everyone with a platform — from the president to editorialists to ordinary folks posting on social media — has already sounded off.
Jones, for his part, released statements admitting his words, saying they made him “sick to my stomach,” that he had apologized to the Gilberts, and that he takes “full accountability.” In a televised interview Friday night, he said, “I wish that it hadn’t happened, and I would take it back if I could.”
His Democratic ticketmates, Abigail Spanberger in the governor’s race and Ghazala Hashmi, who is running for lieutenant governor, issued statements distancing themselves from Jones but didn’t call for his withdrawal from the ticket. Jones said he intends to remain in the race.
Now, the damage is done. It is significant, and it has legs in a nation still reeling from the assassination of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk — killed at an event on a Utah college campus by a single bullet in an instant that was captured on amateur video in gory, unexpurgated detail. In minutes, it trended worldwide on social media.
Jones faces an aggressive reelection bid from incumbent GOP Attorney General Jason Miyares. A statewide poll of likely Virginia voters by the Washington Post and George Mason University’s Schar School of Policy and Government, published in the Post on Friday, showed Jones with a 6-percentage point edge over Miyares, which is within the poll’s margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.4 percentage points. I doubt the same poll, conducted now, would be so charitable to Jones.
Set aside the uncommon cruelty Jones’s texts express and the fact that he persisted after Coyner expressed her disapproval and asked him to stop.
It’s troubling that Jones knew he had given a sitting Republican state legislator firsthand, game-changing material to use against him should he seek future office, yet he accepted money from donors and the nomination from his party only to have this scandal blindside them.
Jones should be better than this. He is descended from Democratic Party royalty with an honored legacy of advancing civil rights. His grandfather, Hilary Jones, was the first Black member of the Norfolk School Board and the Virginia Board of Education. His father, Jerrauld Jones, was among the first African American students to integrate Norfolk’s Ingleside Elementary School as Massive Resistance collapsed in Virginia. He was a passionate and extraordinarily eloquent delegate whose legendary 1999 House floor speech defeated a bill on track for final passage that would have authorized Confederate flag license plates. He finished his distinguished public service career as a Circuit Court judge in Norfolk.
An appreciation: Jerrauld C. Jones

Jay Jones knows the blood sport elective politics has become since his father’s time. Why, then, would he presume that his 2022 texts would remain confidential between himself and Coyner? As it turns out, the National Review reported, she made screen shots of the texts and promptly forwarded them to Gilbert.
Many want Jones to quit the race, but I agree with him that this is a decision for the voters. After all, we live in a time of coarse and even violent rhetoric between the hostile tribes that American culture is increasingly becoming. New York billionaire Donald Trump once famously bragged that he could “stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody, and I wouldn’t lose any voters.” Since then, he’s been elected president. Twice.
For some voters, what Jones wrote, compounded by the mystery of why he let his campaign get this far as a malignant secret waited in ambush, constitutes a disqualifying lapse of accountability and judgment.

Photo via Getty ImagesHow much does it cost to run for the U.S. Senate in Georgia? Millions of dollars are already pouring into the coffers of Republicans hoping to claim the office – and of Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff, who is fighting to hold onto it.
In dueling Monday morning press releases, Republican Congressman Mike Collins and former football coach Derek Dooley each touted sums approaching $2 million in direct contributions over the last three months.
The candidates were referring to third quarter reports filed with the Federal Election Commission. Those reports count donations made through Sept. 30, but are not due to the FEC until Oct. 15. As of Monday evening, none of Georgia’s major Senate candidates’ reports had been posted to the FEC’s website.
Collins’ campaign boasted raising $1.9 million from more than 40,000 donors, with an average contribution of $47.31. The campaign said donations came from all of Georgia’s 159 counties and all 50 states plus Guam, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
“There is no denying this is a movement growing stronger every day, and people are voting with their wallets,” Collins said in a statement. “I am amazed and truly grateful for the trust so many have put in this effort. Ours is a campaign fueled by the hardworking people of this state who are energized, mobilized, and ready to fire Jon Ossoff and send an America First conservative workhorse to the U.S. Senate.”
Collins also reported transferring just over $1 million from his congressional campaign and said he ended the quarter with $2.4 million cash on hand.
Dooley’s campaign said the former University of Tennessee Coach and attorney brought in just over $1.85 million, though did not provide details about the source of the contributions, and entered the last quarter of the year with $1.7 million cash on hand.
“This incredible, early support for our campaign proves that hardworking Georgians want a political outsider with common-sense leadership representing them in the U.S. Senate,” Dooley said in a statement. “For the past eight weeks, we’ve hit the ground running at full speed in order to build the operation needed to win this seat back for the people of Georgia. I’m deeply honored by everyone who has joined our campaign, and I am greatly humbled by the trust they have instilled in me.”
Carter was the first major Republican to enter the race, tossing his hat into the ring in early May – Collins and Dooley entered in late July and early August, respectively – and Carter has used his head start to amass a healthy nest egg.
Carter’s second quarter report ending in June showed just over $4 million cash on hand, including a $2 million loan from himself.
Whichever Republican emerges victorious from the May primary is likely to be on the receiving end of a flood of GOP money. Ossoff is the only Democratic senator running for re-election in 2026 in a state won by President Donald Trump in 2024, making his seat in Georgia a top target.
But Ossoff has also been busy filling his campaign coffers. Ossoff’s campaign has not yet released his latest numbers, but his June filings show the senator ending that month with $15 million cash on hand.
Democrats are hoping a close fundraising race for the GOP side portends an ugly primary fight that will damage the eventual winner.
“Mike Collins and Derek Dooley’s neck-and-neck fundraising reports further underscore that Georgia Republicans are in a messy, chaotic U.S. Senate primary for the long haul,” said Democratic Party of Georgia Senior Communications Advisor Devon Cruz.

A new analysis of Federal Reserve data shows that young adults across the country are carrying dangerous levels of credit card debt, with higher-than-average levels in Ohio.
The news comes as inflation continues to grow, consumer sentiment worsens, and student debt continues to balloon.
Austin-based Upgraded Points studies ways consumers can maximize benefits from their credit card points and miles. But it also conducts other analyses.
For the consumer debt project, it looked at data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. It identified cardholders aged 18-34 with debt that was more than 90 days delinquent and broke the data down by state and metro area.

“For millions of Americans, credit cards have become a lifeline for groceries, gas, and other essentials amid the aftershocks of historic inflation and the highest (annual percentage rates) in decades,” a statement accompanying the analysis said. 
“The strain is hitting young adults hardest: earlier in their careers with thinner savings, facing a tough entry-level job market, and budgeting around the return of student loan payments, a growing share of 18- to 34-year-old cardholders now face serious delinquency.”
In July, the Trump administration paused a program in which 2 million were able to repay student loans at rates based on their income. 
There are also concerns that other repayment programs are being phased out and payments will go up.
For Ohio’s young people, the findings of the Upgraded Points analysis weren’t great. 
The Buckeye State ranked 16th for severe delinquency, with 17.1% of young people having that status in the first quarter of 2025. 
That compares to 12% in 2022.
The average credit card debt among all young Ohioans was $3,352, and 35.5% of them were at or above 75% of their credit limits.
Among large cities, Cleveland came in 10th in the nation, with 18% of its young people seriously delinquent. 
Columbus came in 28th (15.3%) and Cincinnati came in 30th (14.7%) out of 55 large cities.

Out of 100 mid-sized metros, Youngstown came in 12th (22.4%), Toledo came in 31st (19.6%), Dayton came in 45th (17.9%), and Akron came in 46th (17.8%).
With spiking utility costs and deep cuts coming to the social safety net, the credit numbers appear to mean more economic stress for the masses in a state where more than 25% are already so poor they qualify for Medicaid.
It makes for a difficult future for young people, the Upgraded Points report said.
“Younger Americans are more likely to overuse their credit cards and rack up lasting debt for several key reasons,” it said. “They are earlier in their careers with less accumulated savings to fall back on, and they face a particularly challenging job market for entry-level workers.”
 The fact that federal student loan payments have recently resumed has only compounded these financial challenges, squeezing monthly budgets even tighter, the analysis said. 
“As a result, more and more young adults are delinquent on their credit card payments, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, signaling a growing crisis for the nation’s youngest adults.”

The animals, which are smaller than a fingernail and invasive in the Northeast, are often transported between water bodies on fishing tackle. (Photo by Emily DeBolt/New York Department of Environmental Conservation)To track the arrival of invasive species in their beloved lake, the Newfound Lake Region Association monitors data from two sources: water samples, which they pull directly from the lake’s blue depths and preserve carefully in a refrigerator, and Facebook posts from observant anglers. 
This September, the latter source turned up something the association had for years been hoping they wouldn’t see: a photograph of a tiny, free-floating crustacean whose smaller-than-a-fingernail body consists mostly of a long, delicate tail. 
When Newfound Lake Region Association Conservation Program Manager Paul Pellissier first saw the photo, he confirmed the creature was a spiny water flea, an invasive species first spotted in New Hampshire two years ago. The discovery wasn’t exactly a surprise, but it was distressing: the spiny water flea is very hard to eliminate once it arrives in a water body, Pellissier said, and though it’s harmless to humans its presence can significantly upset a lake’s food chain and broader ecosystem.
In New Hampshire, the spiny water flea has not been present long enough to know just what that upset might look like for the state’s lakes. Newfound is only the third New Hampshire lake confirmed to host the creature, which was first spotted in lakes Winnipesaukee and Winnisquam in 2023. But lakes elsewhere in the country, including the Great Lakes, have been dealing with water flea invasions for decades, and scientists said findings from those systems could shine a light on what New Hampshire can expect from this new, hard-to-shake visitor.
Tiny invader, outsized impact
Spiny water fleas, native to Europe and Asia, likely arrived in the United States in contaminated ballast water that cargo ships released into the Great Lakes in the early 1980s, according to the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources. The creatures are small, but their long tails can entangle, allowing them to form masses that appear like black-spotted bits of jelly bristling with their namesake spines. They also frequently get caught on fishing tackle, which is thought to be a major way the animals are transferred from water body to water body, Pellissier said.
Since the 1980s, the creatures have become established in the Great Lakes as well as in other inland lakes, including Lake Champlain in Vermont. Their effects, said zooplankton expert Donn Branstrator, reverberate through the ecosystems they invade.
This is due to the fleas’ unique biology compared to native species, said Branstrator, who works as an associate professor of biology at the University of Minnesota Duluth. Branstrator began studying zooplankton in the Great Lakes as a graduate student in the late ’80s, when spiny water fleas had just begun to garner attention. Ever since, studying the animals — how they move between lakes, reproduce, and affect the ecosystems they infiltrate — has been a central part of his career.
One impact of a spiny water flea invasion stems from the animals’ voracious appetites. Upon arriving in a lake, spiny water fleas begin feeding on other tiny animals that live suspended in the water column, leading to population crashes. Lakes that Branstrator has examined saw their zooplankton populations cut in half, he said. These lakes also saw their zooplankton biodiversity — a measure of how many different types of the organisms are present in a system, which scientists often consider a key indicator of an ecosystem’s health — fall by about 20%, according to Branstrator.
This change has ripple effects that extend both up and down the food chain. Native zooplankton typically eat the tiny plants, algae, and photosynthetic bacteria, collectively known as phytoplankton, that also live free-floating lives in the water column. But when spiny water fleas eat most of those native zooplankton, the photosynthetic organisms at the base of the food chain have fewer predators — and in turn, they could run wild, Pellissier said.
“You’ll have greener, murkier lakes because of that,” he said.

Some research has also suggested that the changes caused by spiny water fleas could also include increases in cyanobacteria blooms, which New Hampshire has dealt with increasingly in recent years. 
When spiny water fleas overrun native zooplankton, the effects also cascade up the food chain. Spiny water fleas are bigger than most native zooplankton, so they are less palatable to native fish, which find them difficult to eat. This is a problem, Pellissier said, because young fish mostly eat zooplankton before they are big enough to move on to larger meals. 
While larger fish can swallow the fleas, they might still be harmed, too, Branstrator said. His team has observed tangled masses of water fleas inside fishes’ stomachs — and in some cases, they have seen evidence that the fleas’ spines punctured through the fishes’ stomach linings, he said.
When a water flea infestation takes hold, therefore, fewer fish may make it to adulthood, and those that do may be less hardy.
This effect has been demonstrated in the Great Lakes, Branstrator said, where recreationally and ecologically important species like walleye and yellow perch have become smaller and less abundant since water fleas’ arrival. 
The changes spiny water fleas cause in native plankton populations, Branstrator said, happen fast; then, they stick around. In Minnesota, even in datasets that stretch over 10 years or more, he said, the shifts have remained mostly consistent.
“This happens within a couple years, then it’s maintained,” he said. “That is a pattern that has been repeated time and again throughout the Great Lakes and other inland lakes. … I would anticipate no difference in these lakes that you have out there.”
The Great Lakes are a different system from New Hampshire’s lakes, Branstrator said, and there are other factors at play in each system, such as the invasive zebra mussels that coexist with spiny water fleas in the Great Lakes and not, as of yet, in New Hampshire. However, he said, he expects many of the lessons learned from the invasion of spiny water fleas in the Great Lakes are still transferable to New Hampshire.
What can be done?
When it comes to removing spiny water fleas from a lake, scientists have explored plenty of ideas, Branstrator said. But, he continued, “nobody has figured out how to eradicate them.”
Lack of success treating the infestations, though, has not been for a lack of ideas. Branstrator said past proposals have included controlling the animals with predatory fish, like the pumpkinseed sunfish, which with its tough snail-crushing teeth is one of the few native fish species well-adapted to consuming spiny water fleas. But pumpkinseed sunfish prefer shallow waters, while water fleas tend to prefer deep, cold areas, Branstrator said. And, he added, to begin with, “it’d be kind of absurd to think you could add that many fish to a system” to handle a booming water flea population.
Some other aquatic invasive species, like zebra mussels, are treated with toxic chemicals (though with mixed results). But, according to Branstrator, water fleas disperse so quickly and broadly throughout a lake that the area in need of treatment would be prohibitively large for that technique.
“All of a sudden, you’ve got millions. Their life cycle is short, and they reproduce fast, and, you know, trying to stop exponential growth is a difficult thing to do,” he said. 
Preventing further spread and looking ahead
When it comes to handling a spiny water flea infestation, like what the Newfound Lake Region Association is anticipating they will now have on their hands, Pellissier said he expects to focus on managing the fleas’ impacts and preventing further spread.
“Once we have it, we have it, so it becomes more a question of, can you manage the impacts?” he said.
While the effects on fish populations are difficult to address, the effects of spiny water fleas on phytoplankton can be kept in check, Branstrator and Pellissier said, by limiting the amount of nutrients that are allowed to flow into a lake. This means preventing fertilizer runoff and stormwater runoff and mitigating erosion, Pellissier said.
“If algae is nutrient limited to begin with, it doesn’t matter if you take the brakes off of grazing or not. They’re not going to grow,” Branstrator said.
It will also be important to continue monitoring New Hampshire’s lakes and for everyone — especially anglers — to do what they can to prevent the spread of these animals and protect fish, Pellissier said.
Branstrator’s research has indicated that humans transfer water fleas between water bodies, often on fishing tackle. He has also proven that extended exposure to dry air is enough to kill spiny water fleas, with about 1½ hours of drying time killing the fleas’ adult forms and four to six hours enough to kill their eggs, according to his work. But when the fleas are tangled together or clinging to damp gear, they may take longer to dry, and to die, Branstrator cautioned.
When there isn’t time to let things dry, cleaning boats, fishing gear, and anything else that’s been immersed in lake water thoroughly with hot water or a mild bleach solution is another good way to prevent the spread of spiny water fleas, Pellissier said.
Branstrator added that everyone has the potential to make a difference by cleaning or drying their gear and boat properly, because it likely takes multiple “seeding” events for the water fleas to establish in a lake or other water body.
Pellissier said he hopes those who spend time on New Hampshire waterways will take spiny water fleas seriously and do what they can to prevent further spread.
“My concern is that this thing is so small, and nearly invisible, that people won’t give it the respect or attention that it deserves,” he said.
He also hopes the water samples that the Newfound Lake Region Association has been collecting will help form the basis for a long-term understanding of how the creature affects New Hampshire waters. The association is working with the Department of Environmental Services and the University of New Hampshire to track that data, he said. 
“That, I think, is going to be really important baseline data to understand the impacts of spiny water flea on Newfound, and potentially understand what the impacts might be on other lakes across the state,” he said. “… We can actually see that impact play out on Newfound.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/spiny-water-flea-NYDES-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-10-07 05:56:13.464233

(Photo by Graham Stokes for Ohio Capital Journal)Two Ohio state lawmakers are looking to the state’s name, image, and likeness laws to address the spread of deepfakes.
They contend the provisions allowing a college football player to make money appearing in a commercial also offer a good framework to protect everyday Ohioans.
The sponsors portray their plan as a way to address a “growing threat” without reinventing the wheel, and their idea has the backing of Ohio’s attorney general. But the Motion Picture Association worries the changes will stifle free expression.
The proposal
Ohio state Rep. Adam Mathews, R-Lebanon, explained Ohio House Bill 185 removes a provision in Ohio’s NIL law limiting protections to people whose likeness has “commercial value,” when it used for a commercial purpose.
“This gives it to all of those that may not be Ryan Day, Joe Burrow, or other household names that get paid to be in commercials,” Mathews said.

He added that while the impetus for changes may be artificial intelligence, they’re proposal isn’t limited to deepfakes.
“It also applies if people were to use Photoshop (or) cutting pictures out and using a glue stick. It is tech agnostic. But it is there for that protection of your name, image and likeness.”
Under the bill, using anyone’s likeness without prior written consent is prohibited.
Obviously, using someone’s likeness for commercial gain, say, in an advertisement, without consent is off-limits, but the sponsors note existing exceptions covering literary, historic, and audio-visual work remain in place.
The bill also installs explicit penalties for the malicious use of deepfakes.
Still, what exactly counts gets murky.
The measure describes its scope as covering any production where “a reasonable trier of fact” would confuse the fake with reality.
Pushback
In written testimony, the Motion Picture Association argued it’s not enough to simply retain exceptions in state law.
Granting every individual sweeping protections over their likeness pushes the burden to a producer to demonstrate their work falls within one of the existing exceptions.
“This in and of itself is a substantial expansion of the right of publicity and materially shifts the balance from protecting free speech to protecting individual likenesses,” the association argued.
And relying on whether a reasonable trier of fact gets confused, the group said, could have sweeping implications.
“In the movie Forrest Gump, filmmakers used digital technologies to have the lead character encounter and converse with Presidents Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon. In its current form, the bill makes such uses presumptively impermissible.”
The Motion Picture Association proposed several amendments.
First, the group doesn’t want to see Ohio’s NIL rights expanded to everyone regardless of commercial value.
Doing so would “permit individuals to prevent others from telling their stories, or to avoid critical or satirical portrayals, which are squarely protected by the First Amendment,” the association stated.
Additionally, the association wants to limit liability to those who “knowingly” distribute a deepfake recording with the intent to “harass, extort or cause physical harm” to another person.
Instead of maintaining existing speech protections, the association wants the sponsors to include explicit protections of work relating to the public interest, commentary, criticism, scholarship, satire, or parody.
Sponsor’s take
The bill’s sponsor Adam Mathews argued that the Motion Picture Association’s push to restore the commercial purpose language is a non-starter. Those changes would “gut the bill,” he said.
Meanwhile, his co-sponsor, state Rep. Ty Mathews, R-Findlay, claimed that the association’s First Amendment concerns are overblown.
“I believe that this bill is not going to really restrict their capability at all,” he said.
But in nearly the same breath, both lawmakers underlined the bill’s First Amendment implications.
“If some Hollywood filmmaker wants to create an image of you, Chairman (state Rep. Thad) Claggett, someday, they would need your permission, if they’re going to utilize your image in a disparaging way,” Ty Mathews said.
Rep. Adam Mathews chimed in, “it would be for the disparaging way, or any other way. If it weren’t disparaging, then they would just have to pay you for it and have that consent.”
The Motion Picture Association noted that courts have long recognized strong protections for parody or satire, “which are critical elements of protected speech.”
“Satirized portrayals of real-life individuals on television shows like Saturday Night Live and cartoon representations on shows like The Simpsons or South Park thus enjoy strong protections,” the association said.
Perhaps recognizing the problem, Ty Mathews attempted to walk back his statement.
“Maybe it was a bad example to use you as a public figure for that one,” he said. “Again, we do have specifically laid out here, protections of traditional satire.”

For nearly a century, the Kelley’s Falls Dam in Manchester, New Hampshire, generated as much as 2,400 megawatt-hours of electricity per year. When the small hydroelectric station in a downtown park came up for relicensing in 2022, its owners faced what many dam operators now expect when trying to extend the lifespan of these power generators: strict requirements that would force them to spend millions on upgrades to qualify for a new operating permit. Instead, Green Mountain Power made a choice that has become common among hydroelectric operators. The utility simply surrendered its licenses.
Last year, the plant shut down.
Nearly 450 hydroelectric stations totaling more than 16 gigawatts of generating capacity are scheduled for relicensing across the United States over the next decade. That’s roughly 40% of the nonfederal fleet (the government owns about half the hydropower stations in the U.S.). The country is now on the verge of a major shift in hydropower. The facilities could be relicensed to supply the booming demand for electricity to power everything from data centers to aluminum smelters. Tech and industrial giants could even help pay for the costly relicensing process with deals like the record-setting $3 billion contract Google inked with hydropower operator Brookfield Asset Management in July for up to 3 gigawatts of hydropower. Or, as has been happening for years, the U.S. could continue to lose gigawatts of power as hydroelectric facilities shut down rather than absorb the high costs of relicensing — especially with cheaper competition from gas, wind, and solar.
The fleet of dams that helped electrify the nation starting in the late 1800s provides the second-largest share of the country’s renewable power after wind, and by far its most firm. But the average age of U.S. dams is 65 years, meaning the bulk of the fleet wasn’t built with newfangled infrastructure to enable unobstructed passage for fish and other wildlife. As seen in New Hampshire, the cost of upgrading facilities to allow for that passage can soar into the tens of millions of dollars — on top of the expense of upgrading custom-built equipment for each plant. Complicating matters further, after decades of decline in the hydropower sector, the manufacturing muscle for turbines and other hardware that make a dam work has largely atrophied in the U.S.
The relicensing waiting game
The biggest obstacle to a hydropower comeback may be the relicensing bureaucracy. The problem is that the Federal Power Act — passed in 1920 to regulate hydroelectric facilities — does not give any single agency full authority over hydropower the way the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has over atomic energy. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission issues the key permits on the national level, but other agencies also play a role. The Fish and Wildlife Service, for example, may require a National Environmental Policy Act review to examine a dam’s effects on a specific fish species, a process that involves assessing multiple spawning cycles. And once that’s done for salmon, the agency may undertake yet another multiyear study on trout. FERC, meanwhile, can’t issue its licenses until state agencies overseeing waterways approve permits. That alone can eat up years.
As a result, it takes eight years on average to relicense an existing hydropower facility, according to the National Hydropower Association, the leading U.S. trade group. That’s more than five times slower than licensing for the typical atomic power station. (Nuclear, hydroelectricity’s closest competitor for clean, always-available power, is also notorious for its slow permitting timeline.)
“It takes longer to relicense an existing hydro facility than a new nuclear facility,” said Malcolm Woolf, the National Hydropower Association’s chief executive. ​“It takes just 18 months to get a new license for a nuclear plant.”
With no central body in charge of permitting hydropower plants, multiple state agencies have been known to take advantage of the once-in-a-generation certification process — eliciting support for tangentially related projects from dam owners who once represented a big and growing business.
“This is major infrastructure. These facilities cost billions of dollars,” Woolf said. ​“They’re like bridges and roads. They get a license for 50 years. The state agencies view [the relicensing process] as an opportunity to extract concessions from what they view as a deep pocket.”
At times, those concessions have little to do with the functioning of the hydropower plant itself. Woolf cited examples of dam owners pressed to build an amphitheater for Boy Scouts, and to fund the construction of regional roads that wouldn’t even go to the plant.
“One … regulator was requiring a facility to pay for a feral-pig-eradication program,” Woolf said.
“In the 1970s, maybe the industry was a deep pocket,” he added. ​“But now, with the low cost of other fuels like wind and solar and gas, it’s driving these facilities to bankruptcy and to surrender licenses.”
The eight-year timeline for relicensing is just an average.
In Idaho, the Hells Canyon hydroelectric plant has gone for 20 years without a permanent license. In Maryland, the Conowingo Dam’s relicensing process has also stretched on for two decades. In Massachusetts, the Northfield Mountain plant is in the middle of a 15-year permitting slog.
To continue operating, hydroplant owners obtain one-year extensions as they inch toward full licenses. ​“But if they don’t have a long-term license,” Woolf warned, ​“they’re not about to invest millions in upgrades.” 
One potential bright spot in the relicensing quagmire has been a shift in federal tax policy. For years, the wind and solar industries have benefited from a rule that treats facilities as new if owners reinvest at least 80% of the plant’s market value into upgrades like new turbines or panels, making them eligible for bigger federal write-offs. In January, the Biden administration’s Treasury Department granted hydroelectric facilities the same flexibility.
But so far, no hydroelectric facility has made use of the federal investment tax credit except one small plant that was destroyed in a flood, thus requiring a total reconstruction. That’s because until recently the industry still lacked clear guidance on how to apply the tax credit.
“The question in the hydropower industry was, if you think of the Hoover Dam, is it 80% of the electric generating equipment? Or 80% of the whole Hoover Dam and the reservoir? So that’s what the Treasury clarified,” Woolf said. ​“It’s 80% of the electric generating equipment. So if you replace a 50-year-old generator with a new generator, you’re going to satisfy that.”
While renewables face ongoing opposition from the Trump administration, the president specifically named hydropower as a key priority in his Day 1 executive orders on energy. In July, Donald Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, preserving hydropower’s access to key federal tax credits for the next eight years. If a hydro project is built in a designated ​“energy community” and uses domestically manufactured equipment, the tax credit can cover as much as half the investment.
A fishy problem
Providing safe passage for fish through dams is a perpetual challenge, especially at older facilities that lack proper infrastructure. But dams that have been updated with newer, thinner turbine blades are also an issue, as the blades become guillotines for trout and salmon navigating through. American eels pose an even greater problem, as the snake-like fish — which can make up as much as half the biomass in rivers across the country — migrate downstream to spawn as breeding-age adults.
One of the simplest and most widely used tools to prevent fish from being killed in a dam’s turbines is a screen that blocks them from entering the plant’s water intake. Other methods include fish ladders or elevators that allow wildlife to ascend rising water to reach the other side. Less practical are trap-and-haul systems where fish are manually captured and set free above the dam.
“Fish-passage solutions can be extraordinarily expensive,” said Jennifer Garson, the former director of the Department of Energy’s Water Power Technologies Office. ​“The problem is the burden falls completely on hydropower operators to make these upgrades.”
The key to overcoming the issue may be marrying the refurbishment of hydropower stations with environmental upgrades. In 2019, the startup Natel Energy, which designs fish-safe hydropower turbines, installed its pilot project in Maine, then another in Oregon the following year. Natel’s technology — based on thicker blades that don’t sever fish as they move through the dam — was validated by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. The company won $9 million from the Energy Department to scale up its supply chain.
While the fish-safe blades are thicker than traditional turbine blades, Natel claims that its equipment is more efficient than the older equipment it’s replacing. Compared with turbines that are nearly 40 years old, CEO Gia Schneider said, the new Natel units produce more electricity per spin on average.
“They’re going to modernize, get fish-safe turbines that will safely pass eel, salmon, and herring that need to go through the plant, and they’ll get 5% more energy,” Schneider said.
Even replacing newer blades comes with little loss in efficiency. 
“At another plant where we’re working on the design, the turbines are pretty young – only installed 10 years ago,” she said. ​“There, we’re going to get maybe 0.2% less energy out.”
On balance, Schneider noted, plant owners get more out of the facility, because even with new traditional turbines, dams require very fine exclusion screens and other equipment that restrict water flow enough to reduce energy output by anywhere from 5% to 15%.
“You’re losing a lot more from these bolt-on solutions,” she said. ​“At the end of the day, if you get 0.2% less on the turbine side, … on the whole-plant level, you’re coming out ahead.”
Old hydropower, new opportunities
At the moment, hydropower finds itself in a similar position to that of nuclear energy a few years ago, where existing facilities risk closure due to relicensing costs amid competition from cheaper newcomers. The U.S. is now actively looking to restart its nuclear program, with the once far-fetched prospect of new large-scale reactors under serious consideration. Even if hydropower can similarly flip its fortunes, few in the industry anticipate an appetite in the U.S. for a Hoover Dam–size project. Still, there is ample opportunity for new hydroelectric capacity.
Just 3% of the nation’s 80,000 dams generate electricity. In 2012, an Energy Department report found that the U.S. could add 12 gigawatts of new power by overhauling those facilities to produce electricity. More than a decade later, ​“none of it was built,” Woolf said.
There are plenty of hydropower critics who welcome that stagnation. The history of damming rivers is rife with ecological destruction that fish-passage routes don’t entirely solve, as well as social upheaval from land seizures that uprooted poor, Black, and Indigenous communities from their homes to make way for new reservoirs.
And in parts of the U.S. where water is growing more scarce as the climate warms, reservoirs are drying up. Hydropower output in the American West hit a 22-year low last year after below-average snowfall, according to analysis by the Energy Information Administration. Yet other parts of the U.S., such as the Northeast, are getting wetter as the planet heats up.
While debate over hydropower continues in the U.S., nations overseas are moving ahead with new dam projects. In July, China started construction on what will, upon completion, be the world’s largest power station, a giant hydroelectric facility in Tibet. Last month, Brazil held its first auctions for new small- and medium-size dams with hopes of turning $1 billion in investments into more hydroelectricity. And Ethiopia just opened its megadam project meant to alleviate electricity issues in the country, despite pushback from Egyptians who say the facility could negatively impact the flow of water on the Nile.
The U.S. could get in on the game, or at least work to clear away hurdles preventing the country from taking advantage of the infrastructure that already exists. As the Trump administration looks to re-shore heavy industry through tariffs, Woolf said, ​“hydropower is a great resource for colocating manufacturing because you’ve got energy infrastructure and you’re typically in fairly rural areas where land is less expensive.” For data centers, reservoirs could offer the additional service of providing water for cooling hot computer servers, along with electricity. And when the U.S. still had 33 operating aluminum smelters in 1980, many of them relied on publicly owned hydropower facilities to provide cheap power. These plants could, in theory, play that role again as new demand for domestically produced aluminum — to manufacture electric vehicles and clean-energy equipment — puts strain on the remaining six smelters.
“We know we’ve got load growth. We know we’ve got grid variability from renewables and extreme weather. The flexibility of hydropower offers clean, firm generation that is unique,” Woolf said. ​“At the same time — through quirk of history — we’ve got so much of the fleet at relicensing and at risk of surrendering permits. This could be an amazing opportunity.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/hydropower-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-07 05:56:13.464233

BELLEFONTAINE, Ohio – One by one, Mary Rutan Hospital’s former patients, some wearing bandages or warning that their replacement knee might set off the metal detector, shuffled into an unassuming municipal courthouse on the edge of downtown.
The people who showed up to Bellefontaine Municipal Court on a recent Thursday met with one of three lawyers representing the only hospital in Logan County, population 46,500. Virtually none of the former patients had lawyers of their own.
But most defendants in the Mary Rutan cases didn’t appear. A magistrate, at the request of the hospital, entered default judgments (losses in absentia) against about 10 no-shows, one after another.
Every default judgement sets the hospital up to take, or “garnish,” 25% of the defendants’ paychecks until they pay off the hospital bill and court costs, plus an 8% annual interest rate determined by state law.
Almost every case on that Thursday docket came from Mary Rutan, a 106-year-old hospital that, as a nonprofit, is exempt from state and federal taxes. Each lawsuit was a small piece of the hospital’s recently ramped-up strategy to lean on its patients through the courts to pay their bills.
Between 2000 and 2023, Mary Rutan sued fewer than 400 former patients per year on average across both municipal and county court, according to an analysis of court data.
But since the beginning of last year, Mary Rutan has sued nearly 2,700 patients and counting. 
Debts ran as low as $215 and as high as $153,000. Dozens were for less than $1,000. The Municipal Court cases target about $3,000 of debt per patient, according to a sampling of about 230 cases we reviewed. In all but one case, court records show these defendants had no attorney to represent them.
In Logan County court, which handles bigger cases, the average bill pursued by the hospital is about $26,000.
The hospital is driving a massive increase in the caseload of the municipal court docket, records show. So far this year, nearly two in three civil cases filed in Bellefontaine Municipal Court have come from Mary Rutan, which has already filed more cases this year than it had in all of last year, with three months remaining in 2025.
Data from Bellefontaine Municipal Court, Logan County Court of Common Pleas.
Hospitals vary in their treatment of people with unpaid medical debt, but several experts suggested in interviews that Mary Rutan Hospital, about an hour west of Columbus, was in a league of its own.

Mary Rutan Hospital CEO Chad Ross declined interview requests, as did the hospital’s two outside attorneys who handle most of its collection actions.
But in a lengthy statement, Ross said the hospital offers generous financial assistance, charitable care, and flexible payment plans, plus other care that’s undercompensated by Medicare and Medicaid.

He attributed the recent spike in cases to varying factors, including a backlog of deferred cases during the pandemic and different legal changes that shape the timing of lawsuits or might require the same person to be sued by the hospital in multiple separate lawsuits instead of just one.
He said Mary Rutan must remain “fiscally responsible” to continue to serve the community.
“Like many community hospitals, we depend on patient payments as part of keeping our doors open,” he said. “This allows us to keep services local, recruit and retain staff and invest in new equipment and technology. Turning to collections is always a last resort – only after we have worked to offer patients every available alternative.”
Read the full statement from Mary Rutan Hospital CEO Chad Ross here.
Signal Ohio has interviewed 17 Mary Rutan patients-turned-defendants, plus others familiar with the hospital’s billing practices. We also reviewed court files of thousands more patients. Many described confusion or disagreement over how much they owed, why they owed it, and why their insurance didn’t cover the costs of care. They talked about the struggle of getting simple accounting information from the hospital or debt collector. Some said they didn’t know they had been sued until their paychecks were garnished.
Many knew others around town who were also sued by the hospital. For instance, Chelcie Norris was sued for $1,300. Her husband, James, was sued for $9,000. Both had their wages garnished.
Courtney Henderson, a factory supervisor, said she has helped her current employer’s administrative staff facilitate garnishments of multiple coworkers for Mary Rutan. She herself has been sued twice recently by the hospital and just finished paying off a $1,300 court judgment after the hospital garnished 25% of her paycheck, or about $600 to $800 a month.
“It just seems like every week I’m being told one person’s garnishment is ending and another is starting,” Henderson said.
Mary Rutan wields clout in the community. It’s one of the top employers in Logan County. It files its lawsuits via two local attorneys, one of whom, Zebulon Wagner, is the Bellefontaine City Council president. And Wagner works at TDH Law (Thompson, Dunlap & Heydinger), a firm that previously employed the hospital’s current CEO.
About half of American adults keep a three-month emergency savings fund, according to the Federal Reserve. But for many living paycheck to paycheck, including some of those interviewed by Signal Ohio, a car crash or unexpected illness is enough to trigger financial ruin.
 ‘Do not take me to that place’ 

Tuff Kline, 31, is a cosmetologist at Kut N Loose in town. In September 2022, she was diagnosed with an ectopic pregnancy, a painful and dangerous condition that occurs when a fertilized egg implants outside the uterus. This caused internal bleeding and required outpatient surgery on short notice.

It struck during a three-week gap after Kline left her private insurance and before she enrolled on her husband’s, she said in an interview.
She said she tried to set up a payment plan, but the hospital wanted $1,500 a month, far more than she could afford.
Mary Rutan sued Kline in common pleas court earlier this year for $31,407. She considered hiring an attorney, but questioned why she’d spend more money when she’s already deep in debt.
Instead, she negotiated a payment plan on her own. She owes $130 per week toward the full bill, plus $400 in court costs, all against the 8% annual interest rate set in law. It’ll take nearly six years to pay off for a total cost of around $39,000.
If the hospital cared about a tragic and dangerous end to her pregnancy, the billing department didn’t show it, Kline said.
“I’ve made it very clear to anybody and everybody around me, even if I am dying and I will die in five minutes, do not take me to that place,” she said.  “Just the way they treated me from the minute I had surgery to the minute they sued me. It’s just been nothing but negative, not good, just unhuman. They just have no compassion anymore.”
 Bankruptcy only option for some

Court records show that most of the time, the hospital gets its money one way or another. Sometimes patients pay in full and the hospital drops the case. Sometimes all parties agree to a payment plan. Most often, wages are “garnished.”
A rare exception comes in the handful of cases where patients declare bankruptcy to shed the unpaid bills.

Dustin Overly, a contractor who said he had health insurance at the time, was clearing out a beaver dam when he got his foot stuck and fell backward awkwardly. He dislocated his knee and tore a ligament on the way down. After two surgeries, a year and a half of physical therapy, and a layoff from a contracting job, Mary Rutan successfully sued him for $23,209 in March 2024.
While declaring bankruptcy destroyed his chances of buying a home any time soon, he said it was his only option.
“I wasn’t too proud of it, but I don’t have $25,000 hanging around either,” he said. “I don’t think it played out the way I figured it was going to play out at all. Injuries happen, sometimes they just catch you off guard. But a small injury can turn out to be a big pain, I guess.”
Signal Ohio identified at least one other person being sued by Mary Rutan who notified the courts of a bankruptcy. His attorney didn’t respond to an inquiry.
 ‘I feel helpless’

In court on a recent Thursday, one woman appeared and asked to address a magistrate in a formal hearing. Speaking faintly, she said she suffered a “brain injury” and asked for a delay in the lawsuit against her. Hospital lawyers, and the magistrate, obliged.
In interviews, several patients reported being unable to verify medical charges after Mary Rutan notified them of unpaid bills. Henderson, the factory supervisor, said Mary Rutan sued her over an $809 bill in 2022 and again for $1,300 in 2024.
She was confused that she owed any money at all because, both times, she was covered through Medicaid, the government-funded health care program for the poor and disabled. But the charges were from so long ago that she couldn’t verify them through her Medicaid plan providers.
Henderson just finished paying off the second lawsuit. But she said the strain of having 25% of her paycheck garnished made her unable to save enough money to find a new home large enough for her whole family when she recently had to move unexpectedly.
“I got stuck with paying it. And I don’t know where this all is coming from,” Henderson said.
An employee at Mary Rutan Hospital, who asked not to be named in this article, thought she had settled her debts with the hospital after she was sued over a $17,100 bill. She said she refinanced her home to pay the tab; she thinks the charges were related to the birth of her daughter.
Then Mary Rutan sued her again last year for $5,700, for which she negotiated a payment plan. She said hospital officials also have informed her that she owes $22,000 in unpaid pediatric bills. She hasn’t been sued for that yet.
The employee incurred tens of thousands of dollars of debt even though she said she had insurance coverage – through Medicaid for the first wave of charges and through her husband’s employer for the second.
“I feel helpless,” she said.
 ‘I think it does incredible damage to our community’

Matthew Curry is a lawyer in Delaware, Ohio, who previously helped banks foreclose on homes and collect on other debts. Now, he defends people who are being sued over debts.
In an interview, Curry said he’s handled about a dozen Mary Rutan Hospital cases. He said the lawyers that represent Mary Rutan are responsive and willing to accept payment plans, which can help people avoid the financial damage of a court judgment against them.
But unlike other creditors, Mary Rutan is unwilling to settle for less than the full amount owed, he said.
Curry said he’s been shocked by the number of lawsuits Mary Rutan has filed against its patients over unpaid debts. Most hospitals, he said, send unpaid bills to collections and accept whatever they can get.
“The sheer volume, I’ve never seen anything like it,” Curry said. “Not on medical billing.”

Amanda Capehart is a former paralegal for the law firm of Smith, Smith, Montgomery & Chamberlain, which handles a majority of Mary Rutan’s debt collection lawsuits. 
In an interview, Capehart said she has personally struggled with health care costs and sympathizes with patients who told her they couldn’t afford their bills or get clear information from the hospital or their insurer.

She left the firm on moral grounds and now works for another lawyer in town.
“And that’s why I had to quit. Like I couldn’t do it to people anymore. It was awful,” Capehart said. “It would be one thing if it was a credit card loan or a car loan, but no, this is people getting health care and typically they probably don’t have insurance and that’s why they have to go to the emergency room.”
Andy Stahl, a behavioral health therapist, has worked for Mary Rutan as a provider. But it was health care for his three children that turned him into a defendant against the hospital. Acting as his own attorney, he fought the hospital in court, challenging what he said were suspect line items on his bill and whether the hospital properly served him a court summons.
He lost and was ordered to pay $1,628. In an interview, he said he’s thankful he was able to pay up and settle without any kind of garnishment. But many aren’t so lucky. While he doesn’t think the hospital is doing anything illegal, he questioned the morality of a health care provider suing its patients en masse.
“I think that it is excessive. I think it does incredible damage to our community,” Stahl said. “It creates a lack of trust in the local health care system – the only health care system in here. … I imagine it indirectly has caused deaths or injury, because people aren’t going to go back when they need care because a lot of people can’t afford it. Most people don’t have thousands of extra dollars to pay.”

 Trying to survive

Medical debt is a unique financial problem for a few reasons, said Ruth Lande, a former hospital billing administrator who now works with Undue Medical Debt, a nonprofit that raises funds to help buy Americans out from towering medical bills.
For one, it comes up fast and often without warning. And even when planned in advance, costs are difficult if impossible to compare. The financial risks are highest for the roughly 6.4% of Ohioans who have no health insurance.
But even for those with insurance, copays, coinsurance, out-of-network surcharges and other add-ons have shifted health care costs from insurers to consumers. She said that’s how people wind up a few hundred dollars in arrears.
“That’s a very common amount, around $1,200,” Lande said. “Employer-based deductibles are often several thousand [dollars], and that’s exactly what people don’t have.”
Mary Rutan’s policy, as is a best practice in the industry, is to only sue if the debtor “appears to have assets to pay the bill.”
The policy is messier in practice. The hospital sued Malia Pyles in June for $5,713 for failure to pay her bills related to a 2020 diagnosis of C. Difficile, a bacterial infection that causes miserable gastrointestinal distress. She was making $13 an hour at the time in a factory job. She said she has taken out a loan against her house to pay on a $192 per-month plan.
Mary Rutan sued Heath Keckler in 2022 after he failed to pay a $2,400 medical bill. These days, he pays the hospital $100 per month, even as he receives disability pay following a kidney transplant. He said he “basically had no say” in the matter.
Lande said most hospitals in her experience don’t sue their patients over unpaid bills.
“I think any justification for suing comes from an idea that there are people out there with plenty of cash who are not paying their medical bills,” Lande said. “So if you believe that, then you believe that suing is reasonable. However, that’s really not the case that I’ve ever seen.”
And then there’s hospitals’ core mission: helping patients. Lande said she worries about what happens when fear of debt turns into people declining necessary health care.
Mary Rutan is the only hospital within a 30-minute drive of the town. The sparse population leaves the independent hospital in a weak bargaining position against insurers who pay for most services, several experts said in interviews.
Andy Engel, a Columbus attorney, worked for his family’s debt collection company in Southwest Ohio, mostly representing hospitals.
He said the lawsuits might be the hospital’s way of “training” people against using emergency rooms as a source of primary care.
While the widespread garnishment surely hurts the community, everybody benefits when the hospital remains open, he said. In his opinion, the stingy reimbursement rates from Medicaid and Medicare are at the root of the medical debt trap, not the patients or the hospital.
“My guess is they’re in dire straits and they want people to understand they’re not doing this because they’re mean, nasty individuals,” he said. “They’re trying to survive.”
 Mary Rutan runs a profit most of the time

Mary Rutan’s tax records show it’s a profitable operation, albeit on thin margins. Over the decade ending in 2023, it averaged $4.4 million in profit per year. That’s a profit margin of about 4%. But it reported a $6.6 million net loss in 2022, its first since the Great Recession.
Ross, the hospital’s CEO, didn’t respond to specific questions, and his statement doesn’t directly address the hospital’s financial health.
He said too many Americans are uninsured or underinsured, exposing them to surprising and hefty medical bills. He said the hospital last year provided $21.8 million in uncompensated care, including charity care and losses associated with Medicare and Medicaid shortfalls.
“Importantly, Mary Rutan Health follows all federal and state guidelines for billing and collections, and we are committed to treating every patient with fairness and respect throughout the process,” he said.
Tax records over the most recent decade available show the hospital has written off an average of $3.3 million each year of the past decade in “bad debt,” meaning money it’s owed but likely will never see. (This accounting doesn’t stop the hospital from trying to collect on the debt.)
The bad debts have been increasing since the pandemic. That’s part of a statewide trend, according to John Palmer, a spokesman for the Ohio Hospital Association.
Citing data from the American Hospital Association, he said that 41% of U.S. adults have health care debt if you include credit cards and debts to family. Fourteen million people in the U.S. owe more than $1,000 in medical debt, and about 3 million people owe medical debt of more than $10,000.
 When medical debt comes for a former debt collector

Rhonda Chamberlain used to work for Mary Rutan’s debt collections arm. Now, she’s paying $130 a month to the hospital after Mary Rutan sued her for $6,800 last year.
The debt traced back to physical therapy Chamberlain received following a motorcycle accident in 2019, she said in an interview. By then, she no longer worked for Mary Rutan. She was uninsured when she injured her neck and hip.

She said she didn’t pay her bill while her lawyer negotiated with the insurance company of the driver who caused her accident. She said her lawyer also hoped to get nearly $2,000 in interest removed but was unsuccessful.
Part of Chamberlain’s repayment involved a $2,500 lump sum, which she got under a renter’s insurance payout she received after an apartment fire.
She struggled to find a new place she could afford on the $34,000 she makes a year as a school custodian. Eventually, friends agreed to rent her and her son a couple rooms. Her expenses, including her monthly payment to Mary Rutan, make it hard for her to afford food. Her friends help her make ends meet by sharing theirs.
Chamberlain teared up as she described her friends’ generosity, saying it prevented her from being homeless. She thinks she’ll have her medical debt paid off in two or three years.
“$130 is a lot of money to me. It might not sound like a lot to other people, but it is,” she said.











At the Statehouse in Columbus, a bipartisan pair of lawmakers wants to restrict some of the legal tactics health care providers can use to force patients to pay their bills.
If enacted, House Bill 257 would do three things:

Prohibit providers from garnishing wages
Prohibit providers from reporting medical debts to credit bureaus
Cap interest rates on medical debt at 3%

The bill is sponsored by Rep. Jean Schmidt, a Cincinnati-area Republican, and Rep. Michele Grim, a Toledo Democrat. They say heart attacks or bike crashes shouldn’t destroy Ohioans’ credit. And health care providers shouldn’t be able to seize patients’ income when they have rent to pay and mouths to feed.
Several debt collection law firms have publicly opposed the bill, arguing it would deprive barely profitable hospitals from using legitimate tools to cover their costs. And limiting medical debt from lenders would set the stage for irresponsible lending, they argue.

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)Agriculture and industry, as well as municipalities, face looming restrictions on water supplies essential for economic growth. Rural residents experience declines and possible closure of schools, health care facilities, churches, business and professional establishments, and other community services. Federal actions threaten agricultural markets, health care, clean energy, housing and numerous other programs.
The list of critical issues facing Kansans is long.
How do state lawmakers respond? Members of the Republican supermajority join President Donald Trump and tilt at windmills. They outlaw “wokeness” at state universities. They override a veto to assign “pregnancy compassion awareness” to the Republican state treasurer. They stand quietly aside as Trump’s “one big, beautiful bill” does damage to Kansans throughout the state. Their leaders propose an unprecedented special legislative session to gerrymander the single Democrat in Kansas’ congressional delegation out of her seat.
Rather than embracing Trump in attacking imaginary enemies, I would suggest state lawmakers look to the work of past Kansas reformers who led the state in addressing critical issues. Their solutions have served Kansans well over many decades.
Look, for example, to Rep. Jess Taylor, who in 1966 led the Kansas House of Representatives to reapportion a grossly malapportioned house chamber. Taylor, a Republican and former speaker of the House, represented the most malapportioned district in the state. He engaged Republicans and Democrats, urban and rural interests, to bring the Kansas House into compliance with the U.S. Supreme Court’s edict of one person, one vote. Urban and suburban voters gained representation, while 38 of Taylor’s colleagues, mostly Republicans, were turned out of office.
Consider the bipartisan leadership of Gov. Robert Docking, Senate President Robert Bennett, along with House Speaker Pete McGill and Minority Leader Pete Loux, who in the early 1970s steered reforms of the state’s political institutions — legislative, executive, and judicial — mired in constitutional restrictions written 100 years earlier. After careful study, Kansas lawmakers proposed and voters adopted 20 constitutional amendments that transformed legislative processes, strengthened the chief executive and unified a fragmented judiciary. These institutions consequently became more responsive, accountable, and capable of serving Kansans well into the 21st century.
These institutional reforms triggered other initiatives. For example, Bennett and McGill were instrumental in securing passage in 1974 of the campaign finance reforms that have assured a substantial degree of transparency in state politics to the present day.
Once elected governor, Bennett oversaw the conversion in 1975 of a politicized Highway Commission into an up-to-date Department of Transportation, which has operated professionally now for the past 50 years and focused attention on road conditions rather than highway politics.
In the mid-1980s, Gov. John Carlin persuaded legislative leaders of both parties to address the incredibly bad and long-ignored administration of property taxation. Together, they coupled modern and centralized appraisal with a constitutional amendment classifying property for purposes of taxation that stabilized the impact on taxpayers. That plan was adopted and has guided objective administration of property taxation now for nearly 40 years.
Carlin also assembled a bipartisan coalition of urban interests to update the state’s archaic liquor and banking laws and initiated constitutional amendments authorizing a state lottery and tax incentives for economic development. These steps affirmed that state government could and should act to stimulate economic growth.
Gov. Mike Hayden addressed declining investment in infrastructure by making finance of highways and the state water plan top priorities. He worked with bipartisan coalitions to secure a comprehensive highway program and initiate funding for the state water plan. Since 1989, the finance plan for highways has been replicated a number of times, and funding of the water plan has become the foundation for substantial increases in recent years.
In 1992, Senate Majority Leader Fred Kerr, a Republican, and House Speaker Marvin Barkis, a Democrat, stepped up to take on the divisive and difficult issue of school finance. Through back-and-forth debate within and across each chamber, state lawmakers fundamentally rewrote school finance by embracing public schools as a state obligation and shifting the financing of schools from property taxes to sales and income taxes. Property taxes were dramatically reduced throughout most of the state, and the 1992 law has served as a starting point for any adjustment in school finance ever since.
These Kansas reformers are covered in “Reform and Reaction: The Arc of Kansas Politics,” a book I co-edited with Michael Smith that came out last year. They took the job of lawmaking seriously and stepped forward to work on difficult public problems that had lingered years without resolution. They put their political careers on the line, built bipartisan bonds in a competitive political environment and left a lasting imprint on public policy in Kansas.
These leaders provide a better guide for state action on the critical issues confronting Kansans than does an embrace of Trumpism that distracts voters from addressing these issues.

(File photo by Getty Images)Last week, Ohio lawmakers overrode a governor’s veto, prohibiting schools from proposing emergency levies to maintain fiscal sustainability.
The reasoning used by lawmakers was that levies like these are a contributor to property tax burden in the state. 
Supporters of the bill argued that even though these levies required a vote from the people who would be subject to the tax, that voters did not know what they were agreeing to. According to them, eliminating the tax would stop voters from being duped.
It’s an interesting argument, but not one with a lot of merit. 
It seems that simply changing ballot requirements for transparency could have achieved the effect of solving the information asymmetry problem. 
Now districts are down another tool for ensuring fiscal sustainability.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Why do schools need local fiscal tools like this? 
Why not have schools more dependent on the state for funds and less so on the will of local voters? 
In the extreme, why doesn’t Ohio follow the lead of Hawai’i and eliminate school districts altogether?
A classic paper by 20th century economist Charles Tiebout gives us a reason that we may want to preserve local fiscal tools like this. 
Tiebout’s model of “Tiebout sorting” is built on the idea that people have choices about which jurisdiction they wish to live in. 
Different local jurisdictions can provide different mixes of public goods and collect different levels of taxes to finance those goods. That means people can move to communities that provide them with their needs.
Certain communities in Ohio have high taxes, good schools, and safe streets, appealing to families with children. 
Others have lower taxes and amenities like senior centers, which can appeal to people who are retirement-age. 
Still others can have their taxes allocated toward things like safety in entertainment districts, appealing to young professionals.

Strategies like school finance equalization can make it easier to deal with equity issues — people who do not have the flexibility to move jurisdictions based on their public goods needs. 
But overall, allowing communities to decide for themselves how much to raise for public goods and how to spend it allows for a diversity of communities that makes the state as a whole stronger.
In the 1970s, the state of California went through its own citizen-led property tax revolt. 
Spurred by housing prices that had more than doubled from 1970-1978, voters passed a citizen initiative that fixed property taxes in place across the state, with only small changes allowed over time.
This has led to some problems. 
Individuals and corporations have been given an incentive to sit on properties for decades without making improvements to the properties to avoid increases in property taxes. 
Schools and local governments are not able to raise money at the rate of increases in costs. 
This has been part of the policy landscape that has led to an exodus from the state over the past decade: things just don’t work there anymore.
Despite the troubles Ohio has had in its post-industrial era, the state still has a lot of positives. 
Housing and energy costs are still low compared to the rest of the country, cost-of-living-adjusted poverty is below average statewide, and the state is still an attractive place for people to start businesses and raise families. 
Blunt approaches to local government finance will only make it harder for communities to provide the range of lifestyles that will make the state economy dynamic decades into the future.

By examining campaigns for peace by opposing American wars we are provided with lessons from which we can learn and take courage.
In March,1967 a Connecticut man named Harrison Butterworth sailed with six  companions to Vietnam’s Gulf of Tonkin. Their 50-foot ketch was dubbed the Phoenix. The crew was bringing one ton of medical supplies for civilians injured by U.S. bombing raids.

That year alone 12,000 U.S. service members died in the Southeast Asian war. Some 150,000 Vietnamese were killed as well. The Phoenix carried medicine, in part, to atone for the civilians wounded or killed by U.S. forces.
Until last week, when most of it was intercepted by the Israeli forces, the Gaza flotilla Sumud was on its way across the Mediterranean Sea to bring food, baby formula and medicine to starving Palestinians. The population has been obliterated by massive Israeli assaults for the last two years. The flotilla launched on August 30 with 45 boats and an international crew that included eight American veterans.
As both the Phoenix and the Sumud have understood, their efforts are only a symbolic contribution to peace. But symbols have power. The U.S. government has wasted $17 billion tax dollars on Israeli weapon sales since 2023. Corporations that profit from this horror like Colt, Boeing and Amazon all have operations in Connecticut.
Butterworth and his comrades were committed pacifists motivated by a Quaker tradition with a very long history. From aiding enslaved fugitives’ escape from slavery, to refusing enlistment in the army and going to prison, the Butterworth family has quietly been in the forefront of popular resistance to U.S. violence.
The 1967 voyage began in March toward the end of the monsoon season. U.S. officials threatened the Phoenix team with felony charges of “trading with the enemy.” The crew encountered missiles from a hostile American vessel and then a North Vietnamese ship that ordered them to turn around.
It seemed their mission would end before it began, but suddenly – and apparently without pre-meditation– Harrison Butterworth and another crew member jumped into the ocean and swam toward land. Vietnamese sailors dove in to catch them, but Harrison reached the shore. Ultimately, North Vietnamese doctors and Buddhists from the south received the medical aid.
The international flotilla sailing to Palestine faced its own dangers. Israeli drones harassed and attacked the nonviolent Sumud and its sister ships. Past voyages by similar volunteer groups have sometimes ended in tragedy.
These atrocities–mass murder of Palestinian children, targeting of journalists, forced starvation of millions– are not beyond Washington’s control. We must demand accountability from U.S. decision makers.
As we learned in Vietnam, the most powerful nation on Earth is best situated to stop today’s chaos. It was poet laureate Tracy K. Smith who warned us: history is hot on our heels. With past examples as our model, ordinary people must recognize the catastrophe in Gaza and take action.

Several actions during the 2025 legislative session have moved the state closer to strengthening the technical infrastructure needed to support services that generate data for evaluating impact. Most recently, lawmakers have invested in childcare, reduced the cost burden on families, created Baby Bonds to fight generational poverty, and developed strategies to re-engage disconnected youth. Amidst a national climate where protections for vulnerable populations are eroding, Connecticut stands out for its commitment to its future.
Two policy initiatives —Baby Bonds and universal early childcare— have the potential to be transformative for the lives of Connecticut’s children. However, to realize their full impact, it’s essential that we implement systems capable of tracking progress.
Investing in our children’s future not only benefits our youth, it helps develop a stronger workforce for the future. Ensuring the recipients of the bonds are on a path to success will require cooperation among state agencies, characterized by interagency data sharing and measurement of outcomes.
Realizing the potential of this approach will require coordination not only among state agencies but also among nonprofits that administer services for the state. A key component in achieving success is a state data intermediary. The Office of Policy and Management and WestEd’s Data Integration Support Center have outlined what it would take: infrastructure, governance, and technical assistance to help nonprofits build the capacity they’ll need. This is just the foundation, and Connecticut can aim towards being the lead change agent in understanding youth outcomes.
Imagine a fully-functioning data ecosystem where nonprofit staff are not just reporting on state grants 12 months after the intervention, but where nonprofit staff are data leaders who are trained, resourced, and trusted to shape how information is collected, governed, and used. Imagine linked data from birth through young adulthood available not only to policymakers, but to the communities themselves. Youth and families could see their own stories reflected in the numbers and help guide interventions that make sense in their communities.
The Hartford Data Collaborative serves as a data intermediary that has successfully linked data from local nonprofits, the City of Hartford, and Hartford Public Schools, to provide insights including: which youth are being served by programs and how many residents in a specific neighborhood are accessing services and programs designed for them.
An established data governance process ensures data privacy, with providers driving the learning agenda. This groundbreaking initiative incorporates the community voice into the data work through the Hartford’s Youth Data Fellows program, which brings young people directly into the hands-on analysis and advocacy.


In addition, CTData Collaborative currently creates data strategic plans for nonprofit organizations through CTData’s Strategic Planning program so that nonprofits are realizing the potential of their data assets. The CTData Academy, which already offers an array of data-centric training for state residents, could deepen its role in training nonprofit staff to tell stories with data, and these stories could support the difficult decisions lawmakers, funders, and communities must make. This is not an abstract dream. These are the building blocks for a data ecosystem that would measure actual progress.
Connecticut has the opportunity to lead the nation in demonstrating how data, when shared responsibly and equitably, can transform the way we support our most vulnerable youth. A statewide data intermediary is not just another policy solution, it is the key that can unlock the knowledge already held by hundreds of nonprofits, turn it into collective action, and building far-reaching system response.
We need to think seriously about what we can do locally to preserve the efficacy of data and how we can build a better data infrastructure within our state to better serve our residents. Doing so is within our reach.
It is time for the state to take meaningful steps forward to by establishing pilot programs with philanthropically supported initiatives like the Hartford Data Collaborative to bring local data infrastructure to the next level. By linking local data with state data, we will 1) better inform policy making at the state and local level,  2) have necessary data to make better programmatic decisions, and 3) track the long-term success of program initiatives and the communities they serve.
Uncertainty about the future and de-investment from the federal government should not defeat us. In fact, it should energize us to think differently, invest wisely, make strategic decisions using data, and take pride in strengthening our social systems that support all our residents.

(File Photo by Bennett Leckrone/Maryland Matters)Maryland Supreme Court justices had pointed questions Monday for a lawyer arguing that local governments do not exceed their authority by seeking damages from large fossil fuel companies for their role in climate change over the decades.
Vic Sher argued that lawsuits against the companies by Baltimore City, Annapolis and Anne Arundel County are not trying to restrict emissions, as the companies claim, but only to protect consumers from deceitful practices by corporations — an area of law “traditionally” policed by state courts, he said.
That brought pushback from Justice Brynja M. Booth.
“How can you say that when you are asking for punitive damages?” she asked.
But justices also grilled the attorney for the oil companies, asking how he squared his argument that only the federal government can regulate interstate — and international — greenhouse gas emissions, when supreme courts in Colorado and Hawaii have allowed similar suits to go forward.
The exchanges were part of an hourlong hearing Monday before the court, which is being asked to decide whether Baltimore, Annapolis and Anne Arundel County can move forward with their suits against the fossil fuel companies.
Lower courts, in separate rulings, said they could not, dismissing the lawsuits before trial after finding that the claims focused on the companies’ communications about greenhouse gas emissions that went beyond state borders, putting the issue outside the reach of state courts.
Judge: Feds illegally capped sustainable energy funding in Maryland, 19 other states

The Maryland suits are part of a wave of more than 30 similar lawsuits filed by cities and counties across the nation arguing that massive oil and gas companies, including Chevron, BP and ExxonMobil, knowingly deceived consumers about the globe-warming impacts of their products. In doing so, they harmed coastal cities like Baltimore and Annapolis, which stand to experience increased flooding and other dangers as seas rise and storms worsen, the suits claim.
Monday’s hearing was the latest in years of arguments in Maryland courts — the Baltimore case was originally filed in 2018, the Anne Arundel and Annapolis cases in 2021 — over whether the suits can be heard in state court. Monday was no different.
Theodore J. Boutrous, Jr., an attorney representing the Chevron Corp. and the other oil companies, argued that the greenhouse gas emissions at the center of the complaints fall under federal law and the regulatory jurisdiction of the Environmental Protection Agency. State courts, he said, are ill-equipped to handle such questions.
“They’re asking this court to take Maryland law and project it around the United States and around the world,” Boutrous said of the Maryland jurisdictions.
Boutrous contended that even if the cities and the county are not seeking to explicitly cap emissions, monetary damages could have the effect of constraining the companies’ activities.
“Damage awards have a regulatory effect,” Boutrous said. “They’re meant to change behavior.”
Allowing state courts to “indirectly regulate emissions” by imposing massive fines would intrude on the federal government’s authority over interstate air pollution, Boutrous argued.
Sher, for his part, argued that any lessening of emissions would come from economic forces.
“The only limitation will come from the market,” Sher said. “There is no regulation.”
That’s evidenced by the relief that the plaintiff jurisdictions are seeking, Sher said. Though the companies would pay punitive damages, there would be no “capping” or “enjoining” of their greenhouse gas emissions, Sher said. They could continue their practices — and pollution — unabated, he said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The deception about climate change previously influenced the market, Sher said, and an award of damages to the cities and the county would set it right.
“It made a difference,” he said. “It had an effect on the world.”
Justices wondered whether the concerns about deceit in the marketplace could actually be separated from the concerns about air emissions. They also wondered whether companies had a duty to warn consumers about a global phenomena widely discussed for decades, and how more honest communications from the companies would have changed behavior specifically in Maryland.
But the panel also interjected with plenty of questions for Boutrous. They asked about the Hawaii and Colorado supreme court rulings that have allowed the climate cases to move forward in their courts. They also asked about Sher’s argument that only market forces would restrict emissions, not the court’s ruling.
“They’re using the lawsuit to try to change market forces to reduce emissions,” Boutrous said.
Boutrous also argued that it would be unwieldy for municipalities and counties across the United States to be permitted to move forward with litigation against the same large oil and gas companies.
“Think of the number of suits here,” Boutrous said.
He argued that if Maryland courts ruled that the companies should have warned the public, that outcome would have implications far beyond the state — even crossing international borders.
“This court would be imposing a duty that would run to China, to Great Britain — that would run all around the world,” Boutrous said.
But Sher argued that the nature of modern commerce means those effects are unavoidable.
“The notion that Maryland law cannot affect behavior outside of Maryland is wrong,” Sher said.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_7277-scaled-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-06 22:57:12.469845

The one-time payment of $700 is meant to provide a measure of financial support to federal workers who are required to continue reporting to work but will not be paid during the shutdown that began Oct. 1. The Federal Shutdown Loan Program is one of several efforts to assist Maryland’s large federal workforce. during the shutdown.
“A federal government shutdown creates immediate financial hardship for our dedicated public servants,” said Maryland Labor Secretary Portia Wu said in a prepared statement.
Shutdown support for federal workers comes from range of businesses, charities

“Maryland is home to a significant number of federal employees, and it is our responsibility to provide a bridge for those who are working without pay,” Wu’s staetment said. “This loan program is a critical lifeline to ensure that our neighbors can continue to put food on the table and keep a roof over their heads while we await a resolution.”
About 269,000 Maryland residents were employed by the federal government before layoffs and buyouts began earlier this year. There were also more than 160,000 federal civilian jobs located in Maryland at that time.
Federal workers deemed essential continue to report for work but do not get paid. Historically, those workers have received back pay when the shutdown concludes.
Current federal workers who are Maryland residents and deemed essential employees can apply for a one-time $700 loan through the state’s Federal Shutdown Loan Program. The interest-free payment must be repaid to the state within 45 days of the conclusion of the shutdown.
Should the shutdown continue into next week, the department would send out the first checks on Oct. 16.
Federal workers and contractors who have been furloughed may be eligible for unemployment benefits, the Labor Department announcement said.

The Chesapeake Bay Journal
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has selected a career employee with two decades of experience at the agency as the new head of its Chesapeake Bay Program Office in Annapolis.
In an email to Bay Program participants, the agency said that Dan Coogan was scheduled to begin Oct. 6.
He currently is the agency’s deputy assistant administrator for Infrastructure and Extramural Resources and oversees the Office of Mission Support in Washington, D.C., which is responsible for acquisitions, grants and facility operations.

Coogan will take over as the state-federal partnership is preparing to put the finishing touches on an updated Chesapeake Bay Watershed Agreement that will guide restoration and cleanup activities beyond 2025. He will be the Bay Program’s seventh director, or acting director, in six years.
Much of his experience is in programs managing grants and budgets. That could be useful because about two-thirds of the Chesapeake Bay Program’s annual budget of about $90 million goes toward grants to states, local governments, universities and nonprofits.
In the Office of Mission Support, he oversaw an annual budget of $900 million and 1,400 full-time equivalent employees who provided services and programs to support the rest of the agency.
In past roles over the years, Coogan has overseen a wide range of actions to streamline and improve agency operations, ranging from reducing the number of overdue Freedom of Information Act responses to helping lead implementation of massive grant programs under the Infrastructure, Investment and Jobs Act and the Inflation Reduction Act, both of which distributed record amounts of agency funding for environmental initiatives.
Coogan joined the EPA in 2004 and holds a bachelor’s degree in government and politics from the University of Maryland, a master’s degree in public policy, and a doctorate in public policy from George Washington University.
He lives in College Park with his family and enjoys running, cycling, gardening and coaching youth sports.
Coogan will take over for Lee McDonnell, who has served as the acting Bay Program Director since December 2024 and helped guide the partnership through efforts to revise its watershed agreement and develop a new governance structure for the partnership.
McDonnell will return to his position as chief of the Science, Implementation and Analysis Branch within the EPA Bay Program Office.

Brian Burns, a retired pharmacist who chairs the committee, said that about 9,000 Jacksonians live in rental properties with landlords who have past-due water bills. The disclosure signals to the large number of people who could be impacted by water shutoffs as private utility JXN Water continues its crackdown on delinquent accounts.
But it lacked much context. What kind of complexes? How many? Which ones and where are they located? How much does each complex owe? 
Committee members raised concerns about the figure.
“Do you think 9,000 is the number? Like we’re having a crisis with 9,000 tenants?” asked Jennifer Welch, a local property manager who co-chairs the taskforce. “Because we haven’t really said that number.” 
Members of the task force then learned that JXN Water had issued final notices last week to four apartment complexes with past-due bills, one of the last steps before the utility stops service if the owner does not pay within 21 days. But Carla Dazet, JXN Water’s representative on the task force, did not say the name of the complexes. 
Fewer than 1,000 residents live at those four complexes, but after the meeting ended, Burns and Welch would not say which four complexes were poised to lose water. 
“We are not releasing that information,” Welch said after the housing task force concluded its meeting. “If you would like to know that, you should contact JXN Water.”

JXN Water spokesperson Aisha Carson did not respond to a request for comment before press time. The private operator that manages the city’s water utility is not subject to the Public Records Act, and its administrator Ted Henifin has been selective about which information to share with the public.

Water shutoffs at apartment complexes with past-due bills totaling more than $200,000 began over the summer, displacing some residents. Jackson Mayor John Horhn had convened the task force in part to coordinate relocation assistance to tenants who were forced to find a new place to live. 
Some members of the committee seemed hopeful the owners of the four unnamed complexes would pay up and spare their tenants the same fate. During the meeting, Victoria Love, the manager of the city’s rental registry, said one of the complexes was federally funded with 156 units and three vacancies. The rest were market rate. 
“With Blossom Apartments being the example, I don’t feel like owners will press their luck,” Love said.
Soon after this discussion, the task force elected to go into executive session. Under the Open Meetings Act, an executive session is a legal justification that public bodies can use to limit members of the public from certain discussions, such as prospective litigation, personnel issues or confidential business decisions.
Welch said the task force was going to review a “delinquency sheet” and that she did not know the names of the four complexes.
“We do not know the answer to that,” Welch said prior to the closed portion of the meeting. “We are going to go into executive session to discuss that.”
But when two reporters sought the reason why the task force voted to go into executive session, city spokesperson, Nic Lott, said the task force was discussing “ongoing policy issues,” which is not a reason listed in the act. 
“There’s no action taken in executive session,” Lott said. “It’s just an ongoing discussion.”

After a few minutes, Lott returned from the closed session and said that while he agreed the Open Meetings Act applied to the city’s housing task force, “our lawyers tell us that we don’t have to say anything about executive session.” 
“We’re told that we don’t have to reveal the discussion of the executive session,” he added. 
Toward the end of the closed meeting, from behind closed double doors, reporters could hear a member attending over Zoom ask the task force, “why not invite Ted to answer some questions?”
Lott then asked the reporters to sit in the lobby of the city’s administrative building, citing the fact that the Zoom could be heard outside the room. 
When the meeting ended, Burns said the task force had entered executive session to discuss “strategy related to the housing issue, the upcoming housing issue that might be occurring,” including the “water shutoff and humanitarian issues.” 
“If you displace Jackson residents out of apartment complexes, that is extraordinary,” Burns said. “So we’ve got to have the funding to help some of those people.” 
Welch said closer to 600 people may to be impacted, but she directed most questions to JXN Water. 
“It’s such a large, complicated problem that there are not great solutions with 600 people who are going to be affected from a lack of water,” she said, adding “whatever the number might be at these supposed four apartment complexes.”  
The task force is still working to understand JXN Water’s policies for notifying impacted tenants, which include putting a “sign in the yard,” Welch said.
Burns said that in the event JXN Water shuts off service to another complex, the city is looking to secure federal funds from the Department of Housing and Urban Development to help tenants who want to move to an apartment with water. He did not think the ongoing government shutdown would impact the funding. 
The task force is focusing on the complexes that are causing the biggest issues for the city, but Burns said there are more than 80 rental properties, ranging from multifamily properties to duplexes and single-family homes, with past-due water bills. 
“We don’t want to be putting out information from JXN Water for JXN Water,” Burns said. “We want that information coming directly from JXN Water.”

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current) As the Trump administration increases pressure on states and cities to have police assist with federal immigration enforcement, officials in Rhode Island’s capital are moving to impose new limits on how officers can cooperate.
Following a three hour hearing Monday evening, the Providence City Council’s committee on ordinance voted to advance a proposal introduced by Councilor Justin Roias in January to amend the city’s Community-Police Relations Act. Three members voted for the proposal and two, Committee Chairman Pedro Espinal and Councilor Oscar Vargas, abstained. 
Over 50 residents and community advocates spoke before the committee, nearly all were against any relationship between the Providence Police Department and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).
“I do not want to feel like masked people could kidnap me or my neighbors off the street with support of the Providence Police and my tax dollars,” Rebecca Dupras, a Providence estate planning attorney, told the committee. “I want to feel that I can count on the police to protect me.” 
Angel Lopez of the city’s Silver Lake neighborhood said he believes amending its policing rules will only make the city safer.
“Positive relationships must work both ways,” he said. 
Among the proposed changes:

Providence Police would be barred from complying with ICE requests to establish traffic perimeters for any federal agency attempting to detain undocumented immigrants 
The city would not be allowed to deputize officers as immigration officials under the Department of Homeland Security’s 287(g) program.
The police would be prohibited from sharing personal data with federal immigration authorities, including state-issued IDs, licenses, names, addresses, dates of birth, fingerprints or biometric information.
Schools, places of worship, health facilities and courts would be designated safe spaces, meaning federal immigration authorities can’t be granted access unless they have a judicial warrant or are “acting in response to a specific act of terrorism, national security threat or when there is the threat of imminent danger of violence.”

In an interview ahead of the meeting, Steven Brown, executive director for the Rhode Island ACLU, told the Rhode Current that he believes the proposed ordinance is important in ensuring future administrations don’t go back on policy that isn’t codified.
Enacted in 2017 under then-Mayor Jorge Elorza, the Providence Community-Police Relations Act prohibits officers from assisting with federal immigration enforcement regardless of the reason the person is being detained, unless there is a criminal warrant issued for a person in Providence police custody.
But how strictly police adhere to internal policy came into question after officers were filmed at the scene of an ICE arrest on Alverson Avenue on July 13. 
At the time, Police Col. Oscar Perez told media outlets that officers responded only because ICE agents crashed their car, not to assist in ICE activity. However, body camera footage showed that some officers tried to assist federal immigration officials by asking a landlord if she could hand over her keys so ICE didn’t have to break down any doors in her home.
A review of the incident published by the Providence External Review Authority (PERA) in August found that police actions during the ICE raid “constituted prohibited assistance” in enforcing federal immigration policy.
“The assistance was operationally significant” the city’s oversight panel wrote.
PERA’s review recommended that the police department establish “clear operational guidelines” on its response to ICE or other federal agency requests for assistance related to immigration enforcement activities. 
“Guidelines should include express instructions to department personnel that they are not to render any services that directly or indirectly assist federal agencies in conducting civil immigration enforcement,” the review states.

Providence Mayor Brett Smiley took some initial steps to codify those guidelines with an executive order issued on Sept. 22 reaffirming the city’s police department will only enforce local laws.
Smiley said in a statement to Rhode Island Current Monday that “many of the updates” in the council’s proposal were in-line with his order and that local protections must be assessed by officials.
However, the mayor does have one major concern: A provision that allows community organizations to challenge potential violations in court. 
“In addition to opening up the city to legal liability, it creates a parallel process to our already existing external authority, PERA, who should have the responsibility to review these matters,” he said.
But Brown of the ACLU said allowing court challenges will ensure Providence police remain accountable for following their own policy.
“A lot of the people who might be most directly affected by violations are unlikely to pursue legal action because of their immigration status or the fear of taking such a public stand,” he said.
City Councilor Miguel Sanchez, a co-sponsor of the proposed ordinance, said the city needs to be held to higher standards in upholding its own laws.
“In today’s day and age, folks don’t want to be held accountable,” he said. “As public servants, that’s really disappointing to me.”
State Rep. David Morales, a progressive Democrat running to unseat Smiley next year, was not present for the hearing but provided written testimony in support of amending the city’s policing policy.
“At a time when trust in our public institutions is fragile and fear among immigrant communities is growing, Providence must take bold, concrete steps to affirm that it stands with and for all of our neighbors,” Morales wrote.
GOP mayoral candidate Allen Waters was the only speaker Monday who was fully against the amending the ordinance.
“I support the Providence police,” he said near the end of the hearing. “I support Immigration Customs Enforcement — we should not compete against them”
He was promptly booed by the over two dozen remaining members of the public seated in the council chamber.
Roias’ proposed ordinance now heads to the full council for consideration, where it will require two passages.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)A squealing microphone kicked off Barrington Democratic State Rep. Jason Knight’s entry into the race for Rhode Island Attorney General Monday night.
The piercing feedback startled Knight’s fellow Democratic Rep. June Speakman. “That was scary,” the Warren lawmaker said before launching into her list of all the reasons why Knight should be the state’s next Attorney General when the office’s current holder, Peter Neronha, finishes his term in 2026. 
“He is wicked smart, he is analytical, he is organized,” said Speakman, who has served with Knight in the General Assembly for six years.
Dozens of supporters — including fellow East Bay lawmakers Rep. Susan Donovan and Sen. Walter Felag — attended Knight’s inaugural campaign event at The Guild, a brewery in Warren that is in Speakman’s district, near the Barrington-Warren line. Knight represents parts of both of these East Bay towns. During his remarks to the crowd, the Providence-born Knight gestured several times at the bay visible outside and noted his love of the Ocean State. 
“They don’t make prettier postcards,” Knight said. “Rhode Island is a special place. And it needs an attorney general who can stand up and protect it from criminals and bad actors, whether they are found on the street corner or in the boardroom or in the White House. … I am here tonight to say I am that guy in 2026.”
Speakman told the crowd that Knight can often “speak truth to power,” and that she relies on the Navy veteran — who served eight years as a nuclear power operator — to shape her own political reasoning.
“I call him in the morning when we have a big bill to vote on at night, and I say, ‘I know how I’m going to vote. Here’s why,’” Speakman recounted. “And then he carefully and clearly explains to me why my position on the bill is wrong.”
“He cites sources. He sends me citations I read for the next three hours, and understand, of course, that he was correct, and he saved me from a bad vote.”
Knight, who worked as a special assistant attorney under Attorney General Patrick Lynch from 2006 to 2010 before opening his own practice as a criminal defense attorney, cited his recent legislative wins as proof of his mettle. He was the lead sponsor on the state’s semiautomatic weapons ban which won General Assembly approval in June.
“After July of 2026, you will not be able to buy an AR-15 in this state,” Knight said. 
Anticipated field of AG candidates includes two Democrats so far with another in the wings

Knight enters a Democratic primary that already includes Keith Hoffmann, who worked as the chief of policy and senior counsel under Neronha. Hoffmann left the AG’s office in August and formally launched his campaign on Sept. 30 — a bid reinforced by the support of Neronha. 
Neronha, who is term-limited, said recently he will not seek governorship or any other public office after his term ends in 2026. 
Knight had $90,419.25 in his campaign account as of the most recent filing from the end of June. Hoffmann’s campaign announced Monday that his account has raised $210,000 since he entered the race.
The contest to become AG has already lost one candidate. On Oct. 2, Rep. Robert Craven, a North Kingstown Democrat, exited the race only four days after announcing his campaign, when past allegations of domestic violence were brought to light. The aftermath rippled further out Monday, with Craven announcing he will not seek reelection as a state representative in 2026. Craven also relinquished his post as chair of the Committee on Judiciary, among the House’s most powerful lawmaking panels.
So far, as of Monday, no Republicans have formally announced their campaigns for Attorney General. 
The primary is scheduled for September 2026, and the general election is slated for Nov. 3, 2026.",https://rhodeislandcurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_9538-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-06 21:56:38.991532

A procedural order issued Monday vacates a prior ruling from a three-judge panel that declared the law unconstitutional.
The Louisiana Legislature and Gov. Jeff Landry approved the measure in 2024, and it was set to take effect at the start of this year until a group of parents filed suit against the state. A federal district court put enforcement on hold in the plaintiffs’ respective parishes while the case made its way through court.
On June 20, a 5th Circuit panel ruled that the law violates the establishment clause of the First Amendment, which bars the government from endorsing a religion or creating laws that favor one religion over another. Judge Irma Castillo Ramirez, who former President Joe Biden appointed to the appellate court, wrote the opinion. Judges James Dennis, a Bill Clinton appointee, and Catharina Haynes, who George W. Bush chose for the court, affirmed the decision.
Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill, who is defending the case, said at the time she intended to seek an en banc hearing on the case from all 17 appellate court judges – and appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court if necessary.  
“Glad to see the Fifth Circuit is taking this en banc,” Murrill said in a statement Monday. “Looking forward to those arguments in court.”
The plaintiffs consist of nine families with children who attend public schools across five parishes — East Baton Rouge, Livingston, Orleans, St. Tammany and Vernon. They represent a  range of religious and non-religious beliefs, including Catholics, Presbyterians, Jews, Unitarians and others. They have argued the Protestant version of the Ten Commandments the Legislature adopted differs from the versions they follow.
Lawyers with the American Civil Liberties Union and Americans United for Separation of Church and State are representing the plaintiffs.
Through Americans United, the plaintiffs issued a joint response Monday evening in response to the 5th Circuit’s latest order.
“The panel’s unanimous ruling last June was well reasoned and correctly followed binding Supreme Court precedent. We believe there is no reason to revisit it,” the statement reads. “Nevertheless, we look forward to presenting our clients’ case to the entire court of appeals, and we remain confident that the constitutional values and principles at the heart of the First Amendment, which guarantee religious freedom for all students and families, will prevail in the end.”
A date for the full 5th Circuit hearing has not been set.
Gov. Landry has been among the most ardent supporters of the law that calls for 11-inch by 14-inch posters of the Ten Commandments to be placed in every classroom. Schools do not have to spend their own money to acquire the posters, but they can accept donated versions.
“I can’t wait to be sued,” Landry told the crowd at a Republican fundraiser in Tennessee after signing the law.
When asked later about students who don’t have Judeo-Christian beliefs, the governor said they shouldn’t look at the posters.
“I think we’ve forgotten in this country that democracy actually means majority rule,” Landry said at the time

(Katie McKellar/Utah News Dispatch)Shortly after the Utah Legislature voted Monday to pick its preferred congressional map to submit to a judge in Utah’s court-ordered redistricting process, the plaintiffs in the lawsuit that has successfully challenged the state’s last congressional map also met their deadline to submit their preferred maps to the courts. 
Utah redistricting committee picks congressional map supported by Republican party

The plaintiffs — the League of Women Voters of Utah, Mormon Women for Ethical Government, the Campaign Legal Center and several Salt Lake County voters — announced they had submitted two maps for 3rd District Judge Dianna Gibson to consider as alternatives to lawmakers’ map C, which the Utah Republican Party urged members to support in an email last week. 
“These maps were submitted because the map enacted by the Legislature … fails to abide by and conform to Proposition 4’s requirements,” the announcement issued by the Campaign Legal Center said. 
Proposition 4 is the 2018 voter-approved ballot initiative that has since been reinstated as law by the courts after Gibson ruled lawmakers overstepped their constitutional authority when they repealed and replaced it with a law that turned an independent redistricting commission into an advisory body that lawmakers could ignore. That ruling also voided the state’s congressional boundaries last drawn in 2021, deeming them the result of an unconstitutional process.

Plaintiffs’ proposed maps
The redistricting lawsuit’s plaintiffs have proposed two maps: Map 1 and Map 2. 
Map 1, they said, “comes from a set of 10,000 maps generated by a computer algorithm designed to comply with Proposition 4’s priority-ordered redistricting criteria without considering partisan data.” It splits only one city and “has a significant population overlap” with the Orange and Purple maps proposed by the Independent Redistricting Commission in 2018. 
Plaintiffs described Map 2 as a “least change” map based on the Legislature’s adopted map C but with “changes made to correct its failures to conform to Proposition 4’s requirements.” 
“In particular, it corrects the enacted map’s failure to minimize municipal and county splits to the greatest extent practicable and the enacted map’s failure to comply with Proposition 4’s prohibition on party favoritism,” the plaintiffs said, adding that Map 2 only splits one city with an average of 84.1% population overlap with the Legislature’s map. 
In a court filing submitted to the court Monday, plaintiffs’ attorneys said maps 1 and 2 are “contiguous, preserve communities of interest, and follow natural and geographic boundaries as required by Proposition 4.”

“Neither map purposefully nor unduly favors or disfavors any political party, as Plaintiffs will demonstrate in their forthcoming brief and expert reports,” they wrote in the court filing.

Utah’s court-ordered redistricting process is far from over. 
The judge has given plaintiffs and legislative attorneys until Oct. 17 to file briefs, expert reports and other materials in support or opposition to map submissions, if necessary, to help inform her decision. 
Then, on Oct. 23 and Oct. 24, the court could hold an evidentiary hearing, if needed. 
Nov. 10 marks the latest possible date for the court to select a final map in time for the 2026 elections, according to the office of the lieutenant governor, who is the state’s top election official. 
Meanwhile, Republican legislative leaders have vowed to continue to fight Gibson’s ruling in court — up to the U.S. Supreme Court if necessary.

Claire Celsi, D-West Des Moines, died Monday, according to a social media post from her daughter and statements from lawmakers.
Celsi, 59, entered hospice care Sept. 18 and was no longer seeking curative treatment, according to her family. She had been battling an undisclosed medical issue for several months. She returned to the 2025 legislative session following a surgery in April after having missed more than a month of votes. Further details about her medical condition have not been released.
Iowa Democratic leaders issued statements mourning Celsi’s passing Monday, thanking her for her service to the state. Celsi was first elected in 2018 to the state Senate and won reelection in 2022 representing Iowa Senate District 16. She served as a Senate Democratic assistant leader in 2024 and as ranking member of the Senate Government Oversight Committee in the 2025 session.
Iowa Senate Democratic Leader Janice Weiner said she admired Celsi’s “perseverance and determination to continue to serve her constituents and to be present at the Capitol” as she dealt with health challenges this year.
“I cannot begin to express how deeply saddened I am by the passing of our senate colleague and my good friend Claire Celsi,” Weiner said. “In her private and public life, Senator Celsi was a fearless advocate and truthteller for women, the elderly, and public education. Improving the quality of life for Iowans in nursing homes became her signature issue. Claire was an advocate for the vulnerable and voice for the voiceless, representing thousands of Iowans who felt forgotten by the political process. She often told me it was both her honor and her passion to serve in the Iowa Senate.”
Iowa Democratic Party Chair Rita Hart issued a statement saying her thoughts are with Celsi’s family, friends and loved ones, saying she was a “fierce advocate” for worker protections, public education, water quality and mental health care in the Legislature.
House Minority Leader Brian Meyer also praised Celsi as “a tireless public servant who worked tirelessly for the people of her district and the state of Iowa.”
“As we mourn the loss of a dedicated leader, we also resolve to carry forward the causes she held dear,” Meyer said in a statement. “Our hearts and deepest sympathies are with her family, friends, and all whose lives she touched.”

“The hospital may be at risk of a sudden solvency crisis, which would potentially harm its community and the statewide system of care,” Vermont regulators wrote in a recent budget decision.

BRATTLEBORO — Brattleboro Memorial Hospital CEO Christopher Dougherty is on a leave of absence as state regulators express fears about the not-for-profit’s fiscal health.
“Stated as directly as possible, we are deeply concerned about BMH’s solvency,” the Green Mountain Care Board wrote in a recent budget decision. “We believe that its leadership must make big strides to adjust course.”
The 500-employee hospital named Dougherty as its chief executive officer in the spring of 2022. Two days after the state’s Oct. 1 report, the hospital announced internally that he was taking leave.

“Please be assured the board of directors remains fully committed to keeping the hospital open and continuing to serve the community,” the hospital emailed its staff Friday afternoon.
Dougherty, who started at the hospital in May 2022 after leading Shriners for Children Medical Center in Pasadena, California, hasn’t addressed his leave publicly and couldn’t be reached for comment.
On Monday night, the board announced the appointment of doctors Elizabeth McLarney and Tony Blofson as acting co-CEOs.
“They have a firm grasp of the hospital’s day-to-day operational needs and a solid understanding of our regulatory challenges,” the board said in its Monday statement.
The hospital, one of Brattleboro’s three largest employers, revealed in May it faced a projected $4 million shortfall in its $119 million annual budget upon the close of its fiscal year Sept. 30. In response, it implemented a hiring freeze and let go of six administrators in hopes of lowering its staff count by at least 30 employees.
Neither the hospital nor regulators could say Monday if Brattleboro had met its budget target. In its Oct. 1 budget decision, the state noted the uncertainty was, in part, because “missing, incomplete and inaccurate information makes it challenging to understand BMH’s current financial position.”
“We are deeply troubled by the quality of BMH’s budget submission and its reporting because the hospital may be at risk of a sudden solvency crisis, which would potentially harm its community and the state-wide system of care,” regulators wrote.
“We have a duty to establish hospital budgets that, among other items, ensure the economic operations of the hospital, preserve access and quality, and contain costs at BMH and the statewide health system,” regulators continued. “We cannot fulfill this duty when a hospital misrepresents its financial data and then refuses to address its errors.”
In response, the state reduced Brattleboro’s requested 1.7% rise in net patient revenue for the current fiscal year to 0% and its requested 3% rise in commercial health insurance reimbursements to not more than 2.4%.
Regulators also are requiring the hospital to resubmit its current budget plan and “corrected and accurate” operating results for the past two fiscal years by Jan. 31 or face outside intervention.
“If these resubmissions remain inaccurate,” they wrote, “we may hold a separate hearing to consider whether to appoint an independent observer for BMH.”
Acting co-CEOs McLarney, an orthopaedic surgeon, and Blofson, a primary care physician, have 50 years of combined service at the hospital.
“We are honored to serve side-by-side and together with our board, our executive leadership team, and our dedicated staff to help BMH move forward and continue providing the exceptional care our patients and community have come to rely on,” they said in a joint statement.

Gary Stubblefield by six months, alleging the current schedule prevents District 26 voters from having a voice during the 2026 fiscal session.
The lawsuit, which attorney Jennifer Waymack Standerfer filed in Pulaski County Circuit Court on behalf of Colt Shelby of Cecil, seeks an injunction and an order declaring Stubblefield’s seat must be filled within 150 days of his death. Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders and Secretary of State Cole Jester are the defendants.
“We look forward to a full victory,” Jester said in a statement provided by his spokesperson.
Shelby v Sanders Complaint 20251006
 
The complaint requests a judge hold a hearing within seven days. Pulaski County Circuit Court Judge Patricia James was assigned to the case.
“The General Assembly will officially convene and begin the 2026 Fiscal Session on April 8, 2026, where it will determine how to spend billions of dollars of taxpayer money and set the state budget for the upcoming fiscal year,” the complaint says. “The Governor’s designated election schedule prevents the people of Senate District 26 from having representation at the 2026 Fiscal Session.”
District 26 includes parts of Franklin County where the state has proposed building a new prison. During the fiscal session that starts in April, lawmakers are likely to vote on funding for the controversial project, which is expected to cost $825 million, according to preliminary estimates. Many locals living near the site are staunchly opposed to the prison, and an appropriations bill for the project failed five times during the 2025 legislative session.
Arkansas law requires governors to call a special election to fill a vacant legislative seat within 150 days, unless they find it impractical or too burdensome to do so. Jan. 30 would be 150 days from Stubblefield’s death; Feb. 12 would be 150 days from Sanders’ declaration of a vacancy.
The petition asks the judge to declare that Stubblefield’s seat must be filled by the 150-day mark and to issue an order to hold the special election on Dec. 9. It is currently set for June 9, 2026 — 279 days after Stubblefield died. The special election was originally scheduled for Nov. 3, 2026, or 436 days after the vacancy.
Prior to the District 26 special election, no special election since 2011 happened more than four to five weeks after the 150-day mark, according to an unpublished memo from the Arkansas Senate’s legal counsel that was obtained by the Advocate.
After resistance, Sanders revises election date to fill vacant Arkansas Senate seat

Sanders said on Sept. 26 that she set the special election dates to coincide with next year’s midterm elections “to save taxpayer money,” streamline the election process and maximize voter turnout. She revised the schedule later that day to its current dates after bipartisan outcry.
“Following conversations with election officials, the Governor decided that holding the primary for District 26 on the statewide primary date and holding the special election on the soonest possible date afterward saves taxpayer dollars and ensures the election is free, fair, and secure,” Sanders’ spokesperson said Monday.
The special primary election currently coincides with the midterm primaries on March 31, 2025. According to the Secretary of State’s office, the state stands to save roughly $20,000 by holding part of the election alongside the regular midterms, and would have saved between $41,000 and $55,000 had the original November special election date gone forward.
But even with the revised schedule, Sanders has caught flak from Stubblefield’s daughter, Amber Sullivan; Sen. Bryan King, R-Green Forest; the Republican candidates to replace Stubblefield; and opponents of the planned prison.
In a phone interview with the Advocate Monday, Shelby said it seemed as though Sanders was “undermining the voting rights of the people in our district.”
“We’ve got to resolve this and ensure our voices are heard,” he said.
While the prison votes are important, Shelby said District 26 voters need to have a voice on other important issues, such as school voucher money and child care funding. Shelby said he spoke to “every single one” of the declared candidates, and that they were ready to go as well.
“We need someone in there before the budget session comes,” he said. “I think all of the candidates are ready. … They were prepared to go early on. So there’s no reason why we should hold this election in June.”
Three Republicans have announced their intent to run — Ted Tritt and Brad Simon of Paris and former state Rep. Mark Berry of Ozark. No Democrats have entered the race so far.
Adam Watson, director of Gravel and Grit and an opponent of the Franklin County prison project, voiced support for Shelby’s lawsuit.
“We’re glad to see action taken to cure such an egregious act of disregard for the constitutional rights of every citizen of SD26,” Watson said in a text message. “The Governor’s actions surrounding the prison, potential ICE facility, and now the district’s right to representation will all set a dangerous precedent for governance by executive force if left unchecked.”

The University of Delaware’s foray into FBS football and Conference USA has started off well. The Fightin’ Blue Hens began the year with a victory over Delaware State, 35-17, but followed that with a road trip against Colorado that ended in a 24-point defeat. Since then, UD’s won two of their last three games.
The Blue Hens are in fourth place in the Conference USA standings with an early 1-1 conference record. The Blue Hens are second in the conference in scoring offense averaging just under 30 points per game through their first five. Their defense sits in the middle of the pack allowing a tad over 26 points per game.
UD has seven more games on its schedule. All but one of those contests are against CUSA schools — Wake Forest is the only non-conference opponent left on the schedule — meaning the Blue Hens will get to know their new conference foes well over the next two months. 
Let’s take a quick look at what’s in store for UD as it embarks on the bulk of its Conference USA slate.
Jacksonville State: UD at Jacksonville State on October 15
The Gamecocks are in their first season under new head coach Charles Kelly following a CUSA championship a year ago. 
It’s been an up and down start to the Kelly era. Jax State lost its first game of the season in a road battle against UCF, but bounced back the following week for its first win against Liberty. Since then, the Gamecocks have lost two of their last three.
Jacksonville State is led by its defense that allows under 400 total yards to opponents. The Gamecocks are fourth in CUSA with ten sacks and sixth in fumbles forced. The Gamecocks offense leads the conference with over 260 rushing yards per game to go along with 15 rushing touchdowns.  
The two teams have only played each other once before. The Blue Hens won that matchup by a touchdown.
Middle Tennessee State University: vs UD on October 22
The Blue Raiders are off to a similarly disappointing start as they had last season. MTSU is 1-4 with its lone win coming on the road against Nevada. The Blue Raiders are 0-1 in CUSA action after beginning their conference slate with a road loss against Kennesaw State.
Middle Tennessee has yet to score over 30 points this season and its red zone defense ranks second to last in CUSA. Opposing teams have scored on 14 out of 15 attempts in the red zone against the Blue Raiders, 12 of them touchdowns. 
These two teams haven’t faced each other since the late 1970s. UD is 2-0 all time.
Liberty University: UD at Liberty on November 1
Liberty is the closest member of CUSA to UD (geographically). The Flames are 1-4 this season with one defeat in conference play at the hands of Jacksonville State. Liberty is in the midst of a four game losing streak since beginning its season with a victory over Maine. 
The Flames offense has been held under 20 points in their last three games, although their defense is fifth in CUSA allowing under 24 points per game. The Flames’ defense is the best in CUSA against the pass allowing under 170 air yards and under 56 percent of passes to be completed through their first five games.
Louisiana Tech University: vs UD on November 8
The Bulldogs are second in the CUSA standings with an overall record of 4-1 and two conference victories. LA Tech’s lone loss of the year was an in-state battle against then ranked No. 3 LSU. Following the loss, the Bulldogs rattled off three straight wins scoring 30 or more points in each contest.
Louisiana Tech’s defense is first in CUSA with 11 interceptions on the year. Three of those takeaways were returned for touchdowns. The Bulldogs are also third in the conference with five forced fumbles this season. 
Linebacker Mekhi Mason is a player to watch on the Bulldog defense. The redshirt junior is second in the conference in tackles for loss and fourth with three sacks on the season.
UD has only faced LA Tech once before in 1982 when the Blue Hens traveled to Louisiana and departed with a 17-0 victory.
Sam Houston State University: UD at Sam Houston on November 15
The Bearkats are the only team in Conference USA without a win on the season. They’ve had to endure a tough early season schedule playing Western Kentucky to begin the season, No. 8 Texas and New Mexico State in their last game. 
Sam Houston owns the conference’s worst scoring offense (15 ppg) and scoring defense (allowing 41.6 ppg). Redshirt senior Emon Allen is a bright spot on the Bearkat defense with two interceptions this season which is second in the conference.
The University of Texas at El Paso: vs UD on November 29
The Blue Hens will finish the regular season at home against their final CUSA foe, the UTEP Miners. UTEP is 1-4 this season with a conference loss to LA Tech in its last game.
The Miners stand in the middle of the pack in both scoring offense and scoring defense. UTEP’s offense relies mostly on the pass ranking ninth in the conference in rushing offense. The Miners’ defense is first in the conference with 15 sacks this season. Redshirt senior Udoka Ezeani leads the conference with four. The Miners’ also have the conference’s leading tackler, Micah Davey.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_4203-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-06 20:57:55.638270

Joe Lombardo. (Photo: Richard Bednarski/Nevada Current)Gov. Joe Lombardo on Monday announced he plans to call the Nevada State Legislature into a special session “at some point over the next few months.”
His two-sentence statement did not include a timeline beyond that, nor did it identify what topics would be considered during the special session.
“The goal will be to finish what the Legislature left unfinished — plain and simple,” Lombardo’s statement read.
Governors in recent years have not provided much advance notice of special sessions, often officially announcing them just days in advance after weeks of rumors and speculation. But two recent vacancies in the Nevada State Assembly may have forced the early public acknowledgement.
Republican Assemblymember Toby Yurek, who represents part of Clark County, resigned last week, saying in a statement he will instead serve the state in a new role. Lombardo in the same announcement said Yurek would serve as policy advisor and as a member of a statewide finance committee.
Republican Assemblymember Ken Gray, who represents part of Douglas and Lyon counties, resigned in August to accept an appointment to the National Cemetery Administration, part of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.
In Nevada, vacancies in the state Legislature are filled by county commissions, but only if the Legislature is expected to convene before the next public election.
Both vacant Assembly seats will be on the ballot next year. The next regular legislative session isn’t until 2027.
By publicly announcing there will be a special session, Lombardo has effectively triggered commissions to fill the vacancies. The Clark County Commission will now need to appoint someone to fill Yurek’s Assembly District 19 vacancy.. Gray’s Assembly District 39 vacancy will be filled by an appointment jointly made by the Douglas and Lyon county commissions.
By state law, their replacements must be members of the same political party.
Special sessions are limited by law to issues included in its proclamation.
Lombardo has previously said the failed film tax credit expansion bill and his crime bill from the regular session earlier this year may reemerge in a special session. Democratic legislative leaders have publicly stated they want to address the financial impact of Trump policies, specifically on programs like Medicaid, as well as issues like the recent cyberattack on the state government.
Jokes about an inevitable special session were commonplace in the waning days of this year’s regular session. November has been the rumored month, though the governor’s office and legislative leaders have only confirmed that discussions are ongoing.
Legislators and statewide elected officials like the governor and attorney general are prohibited from soliciting or accepting campaign contributions in the 15 days before and the 15 days after a special session. If a special session proclamation is issued with less than 15 days notice, the ban on soliciting donations begins immediately.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/lombardo-stos-bednarski-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-06 19:57:52.831464

(Tim Lambert/Pennsylvania Capital-Star).State lawmakers are considering changing the legal definitions of child abuse and neglect to avoid prosecuting people who allow children in their care to engage in certain activities independently. 
Supporters say the proposal could help prevent overreach by child protective services, which disproportionately affects working and non-white families. 
The measure would amend child abuse and neglect definitions to clarify that parents or guardians must have shown willful or reckless disregard for obvious danger.
It also specifies that it is legal to let children do things alone such as play outside, babysit and go to and from school, the store or recreation facilities.

Families are currently penalized for exactly that, according to Mariel Mussack, staff attorney at the unemployment unit and youth justice project with Community Legal Services of Philadelphia. 
Mussack said clients of hers and others at CLS have suffered severe consequences from dealing with investigations stemming from what many would regard as routine situations.
“These incidents obviously can disrupt a family’s entire life and lead to lifelong consequences for parents related to their housing, their employment and their rights to parent their children. In addition, the time and cost of litigation for parents to defend themselves in these proceedings, even where they are successful in the end, can be so exorbitant,” Mussack said. “And even where a CPS investigation results in an unfounded report, the trauma to the family can be very extensive.”

Mussack recalled a client who left her one-year-old daughter briefly in the care of her 13-year-old son and, despite the children being fine, ultimately had to fight child abuse accusations. Mussack noted the Red Cross in Pennsylvania offers babysitting training to kids 11 and older.  
She and her client eventually prevailed. But in the interim, the single mother landed on a child abuse registry – making it hard for her to find work as a home health aide. 
Stories like that lead to many parents feeling afraid to let their kids do things independently “that would have been seen as completely normal in the past,” Mussack testified during a hearing before the House Children and Youth Committee Monday. 
Minority Chairwoman Kate Klunk (R-York) recalled her own experiences babysitting as a 13-year-old. She said Mussack’s anecdote was “appalling.”
“We live in a society where we ultimately are bubble wrapping our kids for the sake of additional bubble wrap, and it’s not actually helping them in any way,” Klunk said. “It’s actually suffocating them. And so we need to rip off that bubble wrap, let our kids be kids. Let our parents be parents.”

Committee Chair Jeanne McNeill (D-Lehigh) is sponsoring the bill along with representatives Rick Krajewski (D-Philadelphia) and Dave Zimmerman (R-Berks/Lehigh).
“These simple activities, you know, like kids playing outside, walking a sibling to school or being home alone should not be treated as neglect or endangerment,” said Krajewski, who recalled doing just that after school as a kid while his mother was working. “Merely allowing a child to be outside of constant supervision by an adult has led to frivolous Child Protection investigations, traumatizing children and families, and contributing to a climate of fear in our communities.”
There’s no timeline for the committee to consider the bill for an initial vote. 
Community Legal Services developed the bill with Let Grow, an advocacy organization co-founded by Free-Range Kids author Lenore Skenazy and Boston College Professor Peter Gray behind similar legislation in other states.

Spencer Cox to appoint the chief justice of the Utah Supreme Court, the Legislature voted to approve a compromise during a special session Monday.
If Cox signs the bill, the governor will have the power to appoint the chief justice, but this time, instead of going through the selection process every four years, the role will be subject to a single, eight-year term. 
The Senate voted 22-7 to pass the bill, with all Democrats and Sen. Daniel Thatcher of the Utah Forward Party voting against. The House also approved it with a 58-15 margin with all Democrats and Kearns Republican Rep. Anthony Loubet voting nay. The proposal now heads to Cox’s desk for his signature.

“The governor has agreed to a compromise, which extends by four years the term that the chief justice can serve,” House Majority Leader Rep. Casey Snider, R-Paradise, said on the House floor. 
The appointment would mirror the process used by the U.S. Supreme Court, with the executive nominating the chief justice and the Senate confirming, Snider said.
Like during the general session, Sandy Democratic Rep. Andrew Stoddard unsuccessfully attempted to make the Supreme Court justices elect the Senate president and speaker of the House.

“To use a phrase that I repeatedly tell my kids, just because we can, does not mean that we should,” Stoddard said. “So this keeps that balance going and gets the power back to both branches.”
Ultimately, Stoddard said, his opposition to the bill was about having “a truly independent judiciary.”
“These justices are already confirmed by the Legislature. The Senate gets to give input on them, appointed by the governor. They’ve already gone through this process,” Stoddard said. “I think by requiring another layer to pick the chief justice, we’re just submitting them to more political pressure.”



Let us know what you think...


 


The original proposal was part of a judicial reform series of bills Republican legislators sponsored during this year’s general session after publicly disagreeing with two major rulings from the high court — an opinion favoring plaintiffs in an anti-gerrymanding lawsuit challenging the Legislature’s 2021 redistricting process, and a ruling upholding a district court decision to block a nearly-total ban of abortions in the state while it is adjudicated.
Lawmakers argued the changes weren’t in retaliation for the decisions, but were efforts to make the judicial system more transparent and responsive to the people. 
Cox vetoes bill that would have given governor power over appointing Utah chief justice

After weeks of contention, Legislative leaders and the judiciary reached an agreement, killing most of the proposed bills, but keeping the bill changing the chief justice’s selection. 
In his veto letter, Cox said no one from the judicial branch had asked for the veto, and while the prospect of having more power over the Utah Supreme Court was tempting, he remained skeptical on the reappointment process, which he described as “a very meaningful and problematic additional step.”
“The Bar reaffirms its commitment to the rule of law and to an independent, impartial judiciary as essential to public trust in our system of justice,” the Utah State Bar said in a statement after the 
Monday votes. “Each branch of government has distinct constitutional responsibilities, and the judiciary must remain free to exercise its duties without undue influence or political pressure.”  
Lawmakers also approved other bills during the special session, making technical changes to streamline code, and tackling issues like berm management of the Great Salt Lake amid its alarming low levels; and modifications to election records law.

The election records amendment bill sponsored by Rep. Norman Thurston, R-Provo, defines election records that may not be destroyed for at least 22 months in case of questions or contests to results. It also increases transparency, Thurston said.
Now, election officials will be required to post a cast vote record report detailing how the tabulating equipment tallies every vote. 
“Think of a gigantic spreadsheet where every row is a ballot, and then it just has some sort of a non-traceable serial number was counted for X person, Y person,” Thurston explained. With that document, anyone can add up ballots and make their own audits, he added.
The bill also will limit access to video records from cameras near drop boxes to people with a legitimate need to watch them.

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Pennsylvania’s prime location, amid the nation’s largest population centers, made it an important hub for warehouses to distribute consumer goods. Hundreds sprung up along interstate highways in the last decade. 
Those sprawling structures, some larger than 1 million square feet, could play a role in answering the commonwealth’s demand for renewable energy over the next decade.
Legislation under consideration in the state House Energy Committee would require new warehouses to be wired for solar panel installations and allow local governments to offer tax incentives to retrofit existing warehouses.
“We’re building warehouses along the corridors,” Pennsylvania State Building & Construction Trades Council President Robert Bair said in a hearing on the bill Monday. “We’re employing a lot of people in those jobs, but we have a lot of roof space just sitting there doing nothing, so we can put it to use now.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Energy demand in the 13-state region that shares Pennsylvania’s power grid is forecast to skyrocket nearly 20% by 2035, according to PJM Interconnection, which manages the supply of electricity.
While long-range predictions call for new nuclear power plants to satisfy much of the demand and natural gas-fired plants to sustain the load until new technology comes online, solar energy will be critical, said Patrick McDonnell, president and CEO of PennFuture, a clean energy and environmental advocacy group.
Concerns about the reliability of natural gas generation were raised after winter storm Elliott froze supplies in December 2023 and contributed to surging electricity prices this summer that caused bills for some customers to leap by 10% to 30%.
“Diversification of the portfolio is critical in order for us to drive down those prices,” McDonnell said, adding that new standards for warehouse construction would ensure an opportunity to use their multi-acre roofs as sites for solar generation.
The bill is sponsored by Rep. Joshua Siegel (D-Lehigh), whose district is a hot spot for warehouse development. It would require new warehouses to be built with roof structures designed to carry the additional weight of solar panels. The measure would also require conduits for the electrical wiring and space for equipment to connect the panels to the grid to be included in the designs. 
The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, which would enforce the legislation, would have the authority to grant waivers for projects where the installation of solar panels is unfeasible. 
And local taxing authorities, such as townships, counties and school districts, would have authority to grant tax exemptions or special tax provisions to offset the increase in value of warehouses retrofitted to allow solar installations.
“Commercial rooftop solar is a great example of environmentally beneficial land use,” said Victoria Moroney, director of market development for ForeFront Power, which develops solar and storage projects in the United States and Mexico.
She added the use of warehouse roofs for solar energy puts generation close to electricity users and benefits ratepayers because it reduces the construction of new transmission infrastructure associated with new energy sources.

“It’s not that any of these requirements are overly cumbersome or expensive,” Moroney said. “It’s just that warehouse developers don’t have this in mind when they’re developing their facilities, and that’s completely understandable.”
Energy Committee Chairperson Elizabeth Fiedler (D-Philadelphia) said New Jersey passed a law requiring warehouses larger than 100,000 square feet to be built ready for solar installations starting in 2022. 
“The trade association for commercial developers in New Jersey explained that, in fact, warehouses with solar ready roofs are easier to lease than those that lack solar preparation, and this is part of the reason they supported it,” Fiedler said.
Rep. Martin Causer (R-McKean), the ranking Republican committee member, said he has concerns about making the new construction standards mandatory.
Is the sun setting on Pennsylvania’s solar future?

“That’s sort of a new level of government involvement, because this is private property. What if the owner doesn’t want to be solar ready? Isn’t that their right to not be solar ready?” he asked.
Bair said the legislation would be subject to discussion and amendments and that providing incentives to build to accommodate solar would be another option. But he said solar power is the fastest way to increase supply.
“I don’t like the government in my business,” Bair said. ”But I also understand that with our grid needs, solar is the most rapidly deployable excess energy we can put on right now.”
Rep. Paul Friel (D-Chester) compared the design requirements to any building code, such as accessibility or fire safety requirements. “It’s all saying there’s some public policy good that goes into that building code that benefits us as a society,” Friel said, adding that such mandates should come with a return on investment for the owner. 
He asked what additional government action would be required to ensure warehouse owners would be able to sell solar energy produced on their rooftops.
“I don’t think it’s fair to increase cost, but not guarantee I have a market in place,” Friel said.
Moroney said warehouse owners would be able to contract with a solar power developer to design and construct installations on their rooftops. Where the warehouse itself has a demand for the power produced, the owner would have the option to enter a power purchase agreement to pay a set price for the energy and reduce uncertainty about energy costs. 
In a scenario where the warehouse does not have sufficient energy demand to use all of the power, owners could make use of options such as virtual net metering. That’s where energy produced by a solar project is sold at a discount to subscribers elsewhere in the community. But, it would require additional legislation, Moroney said.
A bill to create a community solar option for consumers who can’t put solar panels on their own rooftops passed in the House last year but wasn’t considered in the Senate.
“It doesn’t exactly exist in Pennsylvania right now,” Moroney said. “So creating programs that enable options for these developers is going to be really important, because no, no warehouse is the same.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/solar-panels-california-1024x715.jpeg,,,2025-10-06 18:56:55.785058

Sam Creekmore, the Republican House Public Health and Human Services chairman from New Albany, said he believes all opioid settlement money cities and counties are receiving should be for mental health.","One of the state’s two top public health lawmakers told Mississippi Today he plans to take legislative action to ensure cities and counties spend opioid settlement money on addressing mental health, an issue he said was brought to light by the newsroom’s recent investigation. 
In September, Mississippi Today revealed that of the over $15.5 million dollars local governments have received from corporations that helped catalyze an addiction epidemic that’s killed over 10,000 Mississippians, less than $1 million had been used to prevent more deaths. Spending on other purposes is allowed because Attorney General Lynn Fitch wrote a contract in 2021 that says towns, cities and counties can spend their settlement shares on any public purpose and don’t have to report what they do with the money.  
Communities across the state are expected to get an additional nearly $48 million over the next 15 years, according to the settlements and press releases from the Attorney General’s Office. Unlike Fitch, Rep. Sam Creekmore, the Republican House Public Health and Human Services chairman from New Albany, said he believes all opioid settlement money cities and counties are receiving should be for mental health. 
He said the comments on Mississippi Today’s “The Other Side” podcast, in which he also advocated for $5 million from separate state opioid settlement funds to research the addiction treatment potentials of the psychedelic drug ibogaine.
“They need to spend it, spend that money on abatement for opioid addiction, PTSD, TBI (traumatic brain injuries),” he said on the podcast. “And they need to be spending it now.”
Sen. Hob Bryan, the Democrat Senate Public Health and Welfare chair from Amory, said he would want to see this particular legislation before endorsing it. But in general, he said he supports Creekmore’s efforts to help local governments spend settlement money to address the crisis.

Attorneys general and legislatures in some states have provided this type of guidance on settlement spending for their towns, cities and counties. Tricia Christensen, a Tennessee consultant who advises states on how to spend opioid settlement money to prevent more overdoses, said in August these types of guides are effective at encouraging local governments to address addiction. 
She said North Carolina’s version, a series of 90 detailed frequently asked questions, provides direct steps for how any local government could spend money for treatment, recovery and prevention. 
“That’s really clear guidance for folks,” she said. 
Fitch did not respond to a question Mississippi Today sent her in August asking whether she would consider creating these types of suggested guidelines. In a statement, her Chief of Staff Michelle Williams said the opioid lawsuits allow for some of states’ settlement money to be used for any public purpose, a “reimbursement” for the hundreds of billions of dollars American governments spent on the crisis throughout the 2000s and 2010s. 
Creekmore also said he would consider proposing a law that requires local governments to publicly report how they spend their settlement dollars. Maine passed a similar bill in May after years of local governments spending their money with minimal public reporting.  
Mississippi Today published some amount of city and county settlement spending information from all but one of the 147 local governments receiving money in its investigation, but the data is only current to the summer. Required public reporting for local settlement spending could reveal which localities have changed their plans since then. 
While local government leaders are the only people who are spending Mississippi’s opioid settlement money right now, the state Legislature controls the majority of the funds, which an August record from Fitch’s office shows was around $89 million after attorneys fees. Creekmore is helping to oversee most of that money through his role on the state’s Opioid Settlement Fund Advisory Council. 
The council was only established this year despite receiving these funds periodically since 2022, and the Legislature will only start distributing money for overdose prevention when the next fiscal year starts in July 2026. The delay is a big reason why Mississippi has spent less settlement money for abatement than every other state, both in terms of share percentage and total dollars.
Bryan said as Mississippi lawmakers use state and local settlement dollars, he would like to see a more comprehensive plan to address addiction — starting with knowing what Mississippi’s addiction response needs are. 
Then, he said, he and other decision makers could know whether they should be focused on connecting people in recovery with jobs, expanding in-patient treatment services, supporting the Department of Mental Health’s response efforts or investing in other efforts. 
“The problems of addiction don’t stop at city limits or county lines. It’s a state problem,” he said “To me, it works better if all the money is spent in some sort of coordinated fashion.” 
Creekmore said he spent the week reviewing state opioid settlement applications to help end the addiction crisis, but getting to that point took longer than he intended when Mississippi received its first check. He and his fellow lawmakers have a responsibility to act quickly and effectively with the money to address a crisis that has led to the untimely deaths of Mississippians and grief from their loved ones, Creekmore said.

Randy Miller, a farmer and Iowa Soybean Association member based near Lacona, said precipitation early Monday morning slowed his harvest efforts. But Miller welcomed the rain and said it was “too dry for comfort” to be out in a hot combine as temperatures the past week have neared 90 degrees. 
Miller said his combines have been “smoldering” and there have been reports of neighbors and other farmers across the state dealing with combine fires due to the dry stalks and hot weather. 
“So hopefully the temperatures will cool off, this moisture will soak back up some of that, and it’ll be a more traditional harvest,” Miller said. 
The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Agricultural Statistics Service ordinarily compiles harvest data in its weekly crop progress and condition reports, but the office is not publishing reports during the current government shutdown. 
Miller said Monday that on his farm, about 25% of his corn has been harvested and nearly half of his soybeans are harvested. Miller said that is ahead of schedule, considering he normally begins harvesting soybeans on Oct. 1. 
“We cut beans for however long it takes to cut all our beans, and then we pick corn,” Miller said. “So we’ve already picked corn and we’ve got half our beans cut the 5th of October, I would say harvest is rolling right along.” 
Miller said he started harvesting corn earlier than normal this year because it reached its optimal moisture levels sooner than usual. Miller said the farms around him are harvesting at a similar pace. 
Will Cannon, an Iowa Corn Growers Association board member and farmer near Newton, said he also started harvesting corn a “little ahead” of his typical schedule this year. 
Cannon said he started early in part because of disease pressure. Sections of his corn were hit with Southern corn rust, a disease that occasionally makes its way up to Iowa when weather patterns are just right, and tar spot, which can take off under wet conditions like Iowa saw in July. 
Cannon said this was the worst corn rust pressure he has experienced. 
“I think of rust as being a 1-in-20 year issue, and that combined with the wet July, I think it’s probably a once-in-a-lifetime scenario we had this year,” Cannon said. 
Cannon said he has harvested about 40% of his corn and 55% of his soybeans as of Monday. 
The crops are drying down quickly, according to Cannon, and most farmers are “pushing really hard, trying to keep up with everything drying down.” He said the Monday rain, which also kept him out of the field, would help to moisten corn and soybeans and help farmers keep their yields up. 
Trade tensions and agricultural challenges
Historically, China has been the largest buyer of soybeans, but trade war tensions from the first Trump administration and current tariff disputes between the nations have left soybean farmers in a tough position.
Cannon said the soybean industry has been the “poster child” for trade instability lately, but the tensions between the U.S. and China put a “dark cloud over the top of everything.” 
Cannon said as China buys less of other U.S. crops, like cotton and sorghum, those farmers might instead plant corn and soybeans, which in turn means more corn and soybeans on the market. 
USDA reports show planted corn acreage increased 5% in 2025 compared to 2024, while soybeans planted decreased 4%, wheat planted went down 1% and cotton planted decreased 10%. 
“This instability is causing everybody to make tough decisions, and it’s just putting pressure on all the markets,” Cannon said. 
Cannon said with “steadily eroding” grain prices the past two years, he tries to focus on the things he can do to better his farm, rather than on the depreciating market. 
“It can be really mentally challenging to stay upbeat and stay optimistic about things when every day the news is about how the markets are going down,” Cannon said. 
Overall, it means he has put off equipment upgrades that aren’t vital and tried to be very conscious about all of his input costs. 
“I’m still glad I’m in farming,” Cannon said. “I’m afraid that there’s probably a few more hard years ahead of us. But I think with some of the challenging times we’re having right now, there’s some really interesting discussions that are happening amongst farmers.
“… I think there’s some opportunities to get some really honest answers and get some really good feedback from farmers right now that could lead to some long-term positive changes in policy and how we think about farming.”
Miller said some of his grain was forward sold earlier this year, but he is still worried by the apparent loss of the Chinese soybean market. 
“When the largest buyer of soybeans in the world doesn’t buy any from you, and we’re in our window when we should have been shipping beans to them – yeah, it’s concerning, because nobody can make up for that,” Miller said. 
Despite the wet July, a dry fall and an early start to harvest season, Miller said it’s been “just another typical year in Iowa.” 
“You get 40 different chances to raise a crop, and this one was by far different than any I’ve experienced,” Miller said.

Mazurek Justice Building in Helena which houses the Attorney General's Office, the Montana Supreme Court and the state law library (Photo by Eric Seidle/ For the Daily Montanan).Two groups leading efforts to ensure that Montana’s judicial elections, both at the local and Supreme Court level, remain nonpartisan have filed a motion with the Montana Supreme Court saying that Attorney General Austin Knudsen has rewritten the ballot language of a proposal his office had already determined met the state’s legal requirements, and alleging that Knudsen has confused the issue intentionally in order to sabotage it.
Montanans for Fair and Impartial Judges and Montanans for Nonpartisan Courts, each of which have sponsored their own versions of nonpartisan judiciary amendments, have joined together in a legal challenge for Constitutional Initiative 131, which would add just three words to the state’s constitution. The proposed amendment would make it so that the state’s Constitution would explicitly say that Montana’s judicial elections are nonpartisan.
The current portion of Article VII, Section 8 reads:


        “Supreme Court justices and district court judges shall be elected by the qualified electors as provided by law.”
 
CI-131 would change that section:

“Supreme Court justices and district court judges shall be elected in nonpartisan elections by the qualified electors as provided by law.”
 
The two groups have pushed three separate proposed constitutional initiatives that deal with the judiciary. CI-131, which was submitted by Montanans for Fair and Impartial Judges, has already been approved for the signature-gathering process, while two other initiatives by Montanans for Nonpartisan Courts are still pending review by the Attorney General’s Office. Essentially, two of the initiatives would do the same thing, plus a separate initiative would make any future court or judge created by the Legislature nonpartisan as well. Monday’s court filing marks a combined effort by attorneys from both groups. Raph Graybill of the Graybill Law Firm and Alex Rate of the American Civil Liberties Union of Montana are representing MNC, while Joel Krautter is representing MFIJ.
The Montana Attorney General’s Office was not immediately available for comment on Monday.
Republican lawmakers in the Legislature have contemplated converting the state’s judicial elections to partisan, something the GOP has said would bring more transparency to the judiciary. Montana’s judicial elections have been nonpartisan since 1935, but the state’s constitution is silent on whether they can be partisan or not. CI-131, if approved by voters, would keep the state’s court races nonpartisan unless and until voters changed it through the amendment process.
However, in their lawsuit, the groups say that Knudsen’s office is intentionally meddling in the wording in attempt to create confusion, essentially sabotaging the effort. While they decried the revision, they also said in a court filing on Monday to the Montana Supreme Court that the move is illegal because Knudsen’s office had already signed off on the measure, saying it was legally sufficient.
The Montana Supreme Court is the not only the highest state court, but is also the only court authorized to hear this particular constitutional challenge.
“Montana’s statutes governing the ballot statement approval process strike a balance between securing the public’s right to make an informed vote and proponents’ constitutional right to propose ballot issues on fair terms,” the lawsuit said. “Thus, the government may intervene to improve ballot statements for clarity and neutrality. But the statutes do not empower the government to leave its own editorial imprint on ballot statements on a whim, or to degrade their quality by introducing confusing and prejudicial language.”
The revised CI-131, as submitted by Knudsen’s office, expands the three word addition to a two-sentence description:


“CI-131, if passed, mandates Montana supreme court and district court elections be non-partisan. A non-partisan election prohibits labeling candidates on the ballot according to the political party the candidate aligns with including labels like independent.”
 
Attorneys for the ballot group allege that Knudsen’s office expanded the description to purposely tilt against the notion of a nonpartisan court, appearing to prohibit independent candidates for judicial office.
“The Attorney General did exactly what the statute proscribes: Opining on what the ballot initiative, if passed, will do and what voters should think about it,” the lawsuit said.
Attorneys also said that if the state’s Supreme Court does not intervene, it could set a dangerous precedent where future attorneys general can rewrite ballot statements at will.
The attorneys also said that Knudsen is not following Montana law, which says that if the office finds that there is a problem or concern with a proposed ballot initiative, the review process is the proper place to raise those concerns. In this case, they allege that Knudsen’s office had already determined CI-131 met the legal requirements.
“First, the rewritten statement would lead voters to believe the initiative prohibits them from voting for judicial candidates not signed with a political party, when that is the exact opposite of the initiative’s purpose,” the lawsuit said. “Second, the statement tells voters to presume that judicial candidates are partisan and the effect of the initiative will be to conceal this information from voters. This is pure political messaging and flatly inappropriate for a ballot statement.
“Especially egregious is the Attorney General’s gratuitous reference in the second sentence to prohibiting ‘independent’ judicial candidates.”
Attorneys for the groups also say that Montana law prohibits rewriting statements to be argumentative or controversial. Instead, the State of Montana routinely publishes a voters’ guide, a “Voter Information Pamphlet,” on statewide issues in which supporting and opposing groups give their opinion for voters to consider.
“The rewritten statement prejudicially and falsely, tells voters to presume that judicial candidates are partisan actors aligned with a political party, and that voting for the initiative will have the effect of concealing this information,” the lawsuit said. “This is exactly the kind of argument — not description — that belongs in the ‘opponent arguments’ of section of the Voter Information Pamphlet, not the ballot statement itself.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/HS1A0028-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-06 18:56:55.785058

,Mississippi Today,2025-10-06 22:20:48+00:00,Mississippi Today,Retired south Mississippi newspaper publisher Roland Weeks dies at 89. ‘He just stood up for what was right’,"Anita Lee, Sun Herald",,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/10/06/retired-south-mississippi-newspaper-publisher-roland-weeks-dies-at-89-he-just-stood-up-for-what-was-right/,Roland Weeks Jr. served as publisher of the Sun Herald and as a community leader in South Mississippi for 33 years.,"Roland Weeks Jr. was a leader among leaders, a man who cared deeply about the Mississippi Gulf Coast and helped shape the region through his 33-year stewardship as publisher of the regional newspaper, The Daily Herald and its successor, the Sun Herald. 
Weeks died Saturday at age 89.
Weeks, who lived in Biloxi with wife Sharon Weeks, retired in 2001 as publisher, president and general manager of the Sun Herald. He remained active in the community, continued his adventures as a pilot and served for many years as a volunteer for the Salvation Army in Gulfport, showing up weekly to wash clothes for the homeless. 
“He was just this unflinching friend to so many people,” said Ricky Mathews of Biloxi, who spent many years working under Weeks and succeeded him in the publisher’s job before his own retirement. “He loved people. I don’t know that we’ll ever meet anyone like him again.”
“Community leader is an understatement,” said Henry Laird of Pass Christian, who worked closely with Weeks as longtime attorney for the Sun Herald. “He unified the Coast. 
“He ran the newspaper much like he lived his life. He was independent. He just stood up for what was right.”
Newspaper publishing in a hurricane 
Weeks graduated from high school in Charleston, South Carolina, then attended The Citadel, followed by the executive program at Stanford Business School. He received his bachelor’s degree in engineering from Clemson University before joining the U.S. Air Force, where he served as a first lieutenant.
Weeks worked briefly as an engineer in the private sector but found his calling in the newspaper business. He started out at Columbia Newspapers in Columbia, South Carolina, where he worked as a management trainee.
He came to Mississippi Coast in 1968 — one year before Hurricane Camille — when the State Record Co., which owned the Columbia newspaper, bought The Daily Herald, then headquartered in Gulfport. 
Weeks, his trusted editor Bob McHugh and several others rode out the Category 5 hurricane in The Daily Herald’s building. When water rose in the first floor, they moved upstairs. 
“My car, as a matter of fact, was washing around in the water outside of several windows as we worked here,” Weeks said in a 2019 Sun Herald video. Weeks and McHugh called Columbia and got an agreement that The Daily Herald would publish there. 
The Coast newspaper never missed a day of publication, a tradition that has continued through the years, including for the unprecedented Hurricane Katrina in 2005, when the newspaper won the Pulitzer Prize for Public Service, the industry’s highest honor. 
The morning after Camille, The Daily Herald building was covered in debris. Weeks and McHugh cleared the front door. Employees began showing up to see how they could help.
Weeks said one of the first sights was a large sail boat washed up from the Gulf. “That told us what we could expect to find in other parts of the Gulf Coast,” Weeks said.
Weeks strove for excellence 
Weeks oversaw construction of a new building on the Gulfport-Biloxi line, where the newspaper operated from 1970-2021. The building was made of concrete with narrow rectangular windows along both sides and large plate-glass windows that could be boarded up only in front. 
Staff rode out subsequent storms, including Katrina, in that building. 
As publisher, Weeks also set about modernizing the operation and transforming the newspaper from a community publication to a statewide force. 
For the first time, he hired local columnists and photographers. He believed strongly in giving the news staff the editorial independence needed to gather and report the news. 
“We became who we are because of Roland,” said Kat Bergeron, who worked full time for the Sun Herald for 32 years as a columnist and feature writer, and still writes her Gulf Coast Chronicles column for the newspaper. “He had the wherewithal to hire editors who brought us into the 21st century before we were really in the 21st Century.”
Bergeron said she was given the freedom to get to know the Coast and its history for her column. 
“We took off and ran,” she said. 
Weeks also brought a morning newspaper to the Coast, as The Daily Herald was an afternoon publication. The Sun and The Daily Herald eventually merged into The Sun Herald.
Publisher leaves strong legacy 
Like any good leader, Weeks had the courage of his convictions, publishing news even when it was disagreeable to those in power. 
He also had a long-range vision for the Coast, promoting consolidation of government services to increase efficiency and cut waste. He played a key role in consolidating five chambers into the Gulf Coast Chamber of Commerce. 
“Roland was a giant in both of his principal capacities — newspaper publisher and community leader,” said Stan Tiner of Gulfport, who was executive editor when Weeks retired. “He was a visionary who recognized that the Coast would be more prosperous as a unified region, while giving great credit to each of the unique communities that were vital to his new home.
“As a publisher, he created a legacy of fairness and public service journalism that served the Coast and South Mississippi with distinction throughout his decades of leadership.”

Over the years, Weeks won many awards for his service to the community, including the John S. Knight Gold Medal, the top honor awarded an employee of the newspaper when it was owned by media company Knight Ridder, the Alvah Chapman Award for best-performing newspaper in Knight-Ridder, United Way of South Mississippi Philanthropist of the Year and the Gulf Coast Chamber’s Spirit of the Coast Award.
Weeks also was one of the major fundraisers and promoters of the Ohr-O’Keefe Museum of Art in Biloxi, home to the works of renowned ceramist George Ohr and a replica of the home of Pleasant Reed, a former enslaved person who built his family’s original home in 1887.
“He had so many different causes over the years that he threw himself into,” said Jeff O’Keefe, son of deceased museum founder and former Biloxi Mayor Jerry O’Keefe. “We will be forever grateful for his work with the Ohr-O’Keefe Museum of Art.” 
Weeks was humble about his accomplishments. As a publisher, he created a culture of customer service. He considered his employees internal customers. Even after he retired, Weeks frequently stopped by the newspaper office to visit, encourage employees and tell them what a good job they were doing. 
“His legacy?” Mathews wrote in a Facebook tribute. “It’s in the bridges he built between people, the resilience he instilled in our institutions, and the way he turned challenges into opportunities.”
Weeks stayed in touch with employees 
His enthusiasm for the newspaper and news was contagious.
“I count myself very, very lucky to have worked for him,” said Pam Firmin, a former Sun Herald staff writer. “He made it fun. He made things exciting. 
“He was so quick to be understanding and caring and to see the big picture. It was something that seemed to come natural to him.” 
Firmin had taken a break from the newspaper when her husband, Pic Firmin, served as executive editor under Weeks. After his retirement, Pic Firmin had cancer. Weeks regularly picked up Firmin to take him for coffee and visited Firmin daily in the last weeks of his life.
“He was so quick to be understanding and caring and to see the big picture,” Pam Firmin said. “It was something that seemed to come natural to him. He did help make the Gulf Coast what it is, but he is so much more than it.”
Flying was one of his passions 
After retirement, Weeks faithfully volunteered at the Salvation Army in Gulfport, where for years he washed clothes for the homeless alongside Pam Firmin, who said he was also “an awesome laundry mechanic.”
Weeks also found more time in retirement for his favorite hobby, flying airplanes. He was known as somewhat of a daredevil, but real talent accompanied his rolls and aeronautical stunts. 
“I’ve got so many stories,” said Joe Pevey of Gulfport, who became a close friend of Weeks after they met at an airport. Pevey described himself at the time as a Cessna pilot with a Top Gun attitude. He bought a high-performance plane that he really didn’t know how to fly. Weeks studied the book where Pevey had logged his experience and told the younger man, “’Joe, you’re going to kill yourself with this plane.’”
Instead, Weeks taught Pevey to fly the plane. “Roland quite literally saved my life,” Pevey said. Pevey considers himself a technical aerobatics pilot who thinks through his moves ahead of time, while Weeks was a natural.
“He wasn’t a pilot,” Pevey said. “He was an aviator.”
Weeks once corralled Mathews to deliver newspapers from the plane to customers who had chartered Weeks’ boat for fishing at Chandeleur Island. Weeks tested Mathews’ seatbelt strap before they started their mission in Weeks’ twin-engine plane. Mathews was positioned in a seat facing the back of the plane, where the door had been removed. 
They located the fishermen on skiffs deployed from the big boat and each time they approached a skiff, Weeks dipped sideways so Mathews could angle a newspaper toward them. 
Mathews promised himself, “If I ever make it back to the airport, I’m never getting in an airplane with Roland again. And I didn’t.” 
Weeks lived to see the internet change the newspaper business. His belief in a community’s need for strong journalism never wavered, a tradition he helped build on the Coast. 
The building whose construction he had overseen came down in the spring, the Sun Herald having moved to quarters more suited to an online operation. He was moving slowly, but Weeks showed up to see some of his former employees for one last photograph on the front steps of the building.
“You’re wonderful people,” he told the group. “You just can’t imagine the excitement that I feel and the love that I feel for all of you.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/06162930/Roland-Weeks-and-Joe-Pevey.jpeg,,,2025-10-06 18:56:55.785058

The hospital’s leaders and its nursing union have been in talks since May. Ongoing issues with contamination in the operating room stymied some progress.

On Friday evening, dozens of Northwestern Medical Center nurses from their recently-formed union gathered with friends and families outside the St. Albans hospital to rally support in a honk and wave event. Nurses held signs and balloons as they encouraged attention to their cause from foot traffic and drivers. Many of them leaned on their horns or threw a thumbs-up in support.
In February, the nurses officially unionized and have been meeting with hospital management on a biweekly basis since May to flesh out a contract. The union is now dialing up its efforts to try to bring the hospital into an agreement by Thanksgiving. 
Hospital management has yet to present an initial budget proposal, though the two sides have made progress on negotiating some concerns surrounding scheduling, parking and worker protection issues like just-cause firings.

“The membership is quite frustrated,” said Julie MacMillan, an ICU nurse at the medical center who serves on the union’s bargaining committee. “Here we are, five months in. It’s hard to bargain a contract when you don’t know all the pieces of the puzzle.” 
With regard to the length of time negotiations are taking, hospital management cited the need for diligence in presenting an initial proposal. 
“This being our first contract, it is important to negotiate thoughtfully and deliberately, and that takes time,” Northwestern Medical Center communications director Kate Laddison wrote in a statement. 
Laddison said that nationally the average contract takes about 18 months to negotiate and that other hospitals closer to home have taken more than a year to negotiate with their nurses’ unions.

The negotiations have, in part, been hindered by an ongoing issue with contamination on surgical instruments in NMC’s operating room, according to the union representatives, though Laddison said the issues are separate. 
In August, the hospital halted surgeries because staff consistently found specks of particles in plastic-wrapped trays of surgical tools. Surgeries were routinely canceled and rescheduled or delayed as the hospital paused surgeries any time it encountered contaminated trays.
Laddison was unable to respond to a request for further details about the current status of surgeries by presstime, though she did inform VTDigger that “there’s a lot going on in that area.” 
Not only did the issue stymie some progress on the contract negotiations, but it also fomented more frustration among staff.

Christine Juaire, an operating room nurse and member of the bargaining team, stressed that the operations that do occur are safe.
“Most of all, I want to emphasize that we don’t proceed with surgeries at this time unless our staff feel confident and safe in the sterility of the procedures we perform in our hospital,” she said. “We take our role in caring for our community extremely seriously.”
But the nurses also said they felt left in the dark by hospital management about how it is  navigating the contamination issue, even in decisions that would affect the ability of operating room staff to perform daily operations. Several said that hospital management did not seek their input or suggestions for how to improve the problem, even though staff working in and around the OR saw areas where their on-the-floor experience might help. 
The lack of communication was something that the bargaining committee expressed to management. The committee asked for staff nurses to be more formally involved in responding to the contamination problem, and for the hospital to improve its reporting on the issue to include more detailed and up-to-date information.

The hospital’s reliance on traveling nurses, over its own staff, has remained a central point of contention in the contract negotiations. According to documents Northwestern Medical Center submitted to the Green Mountain Care Board this summer, the hospital employs 100 nurses on staff and 27 as contracted nurses. 
MacMillan said she often sees traveling nurses receive priority shifts, with staff nurses needing to take weekends or less desirable times. She added that in negotiations, the hospital’s lawyer often explains this situation as the result of the traveling nurses coming to the hospital under a contract, with a set of working conditions and pay that the hospital management is bound to. 
“Staff nurses don’t have that, so they are at the whim of whatever scheduling practices [or] the needs of the unit may be,” MacMillan said. She described a situation that flips the industry norm, where staff nurses fill a hospital schedule and travelers are drawn on to pinch-hit and fill remaining gaps.
“It’s backwards, especially for a little community hospital,” she said.

But the reliance on traveling nurses dampens morale for the nurses who do stay: “With travelers coming and going, you don’t really feel like you build a team,” MacMillan added.
She said she is grateful to work with many of the young and traveling nurses who come through the hospital, but she wishes that the system were better set up to help them root their careers here longer term.
She cited NMCs nursing pathway program, which financially supports employee nurse apprentices in earning their Registered Nurse licensure. “We would really like to see these wonderful young nurses who have been trained here, stay,” MacMillan said.
MacMillan sees better pay for staff nurses as the primary way to raise retention. The small community hospital, whose 2026 revenue was just set at $130.8 million by the Green Mountain Care Board, is dwarfed by UVM Medical Center, whose annual budget for this coming year was approved to be over $1.89 billion. Though the community hospital doesn’t need to compete with the state’s largest hospital, MacMillan said, the wage difference between what a Northwestern nurse is making and a UVM Medical Center nurse makes is enough to lure many Franklin County nurses to make the roughly half-hour drive down to Burlington.
“We just want to stay a little competitive with UVM, even if [Northwestern’s administration] can come close,” she said.
It could also make staying at Northwestern a more competitive alternative for many of the traveling nurses who come through the hospital: “We’ve had travelers who have said, ‘Hey, I would love to live here, but I can’t find housing, and I can’t afford the housing that’s around. Why would I take a pay cut when I [could otherwise] just keep traveling and see the country?’” MacMillan said. In its 2026 budget narrative to the Green Mountain Care Board, Northwestern reiterated that “it is not unusual for travelers to communicate that they would be open to exploring a permanent position at NMC if affordable housing was more widely available.” 
Northwestern Medical Center’s philosophy of neighbors taking care of neighbors really resonated with MacMillan, who had worked at the University of Vermont Medical Center for most of her 23-year career before she made the move to a hospital closer to home a little over two and a half years ago. 
She described the feeling of community that comes with recognizing local patients as they come into the ICU across the stages of a progressive illness. Even though no one wants to be in the hospital, she said, “there is some comfort (for patients) in knowing the nurse and seeing a familiar face.”
It’s something that may cost more upfront, but MacMillan and her colleagues on the bargaining committee see the investment in nursing staff as an opportunity to save costs in the long term — both for the costs it can save from paying for traveling nurses as well as for the effect good nursing can have in preventing deeper problems like bed sores, infections or falls.
“We applaud fiscal responsibility. We also need to recognize that people come to the hospital for nursing care,” MacMillan said.

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Statewide test scores for reading and math have dropped significantly in Oklahoma public schools since the state returned to more rigorous scoring, according to results the state Department of Education released publicly on Monday.
In the 2024-25 school year, only 27% of third graders were classified as proficient or advanced in reading while 51% were the year before. A similar difference is evident in math testing results, with 33% of Oklahoma third graders hitting grade-level targets, despite 38% doing so in 2023-24.
State officials have warned the lower scores are not the result of worse academic performance, but rather a reflection of more rigorous expectations. 
“This year’s test results don’t mean that Oklahoma students are doing worse,” said Megan Oftedal, executive director of the state’s Office of Educational Quality and Accountability. “Our students are learning and working just as hard as before, but the bar for what’s considered ‘Proficient’ has been raised.”

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)
Oftedal will soon join the state Education Department as a member of a “turnaround team” advising newly appointed state Superintendent Lindel Fields.
The state lowered expectations in 2024 for how much knowledge students had to demonstrate on state reading and math tests to receive a score of “proficient,” which is defined as showing mastery of grade-level subject matter and readiness for the next grade. 
Those who fall below “proficient” are labeled either “basic,” which indicates a student has only partial mastery of concepts at his or her grade level, and “below basic,” which indicates a student has fallen even more significantly behind. Students who perform above a proficient level are considered “advanced.”
The state Education Department developed the lower scoring expectations with committees of Oklahoma teachers and then earned approval in July 2024 from the Commission for Educational Quality and Accountability, which oversees Oftedal’s agency. 
The Education Department, under state Superintendent Ryan Walters at the time, then released the 2024 test scores without announcing that a major change in scoring had taken place, leaving districts and families with the false impression that their students had made dramatic leaps in academic progress.
After news media, including Oklahoma Voice, uncovered the scoring change, the commission reversed its 2024 decision, opting to restore the stricter, nationally aligned scoring methods that Oklahoma used from 2017-2023. 
That means students needed to have a stronger performance in reading and math this year to be considered proficient. Statewide reading and math tests are administered each spring to grades 3-8.
With more rigorous expectations in place, the 2025 results give the appearance of a major dip in performance, just like the 2024 scores gave an artificial indication of growth.
Reading scores showed the most dramatic swing this year.
Along with the 27% of third graders who scored proficient or higher, only 24% of fourth graders, and 26% of fifth graders did so in reading, according to results the Education Department posted publicly on its website. A quarter of sixth graders, 22% of seventh graders and 21% of eighth graders made a proficient or advanced reading score.
Under last year’s scoring, no grade level had a reading proficiency rate below 39%.
Math results in 2025 classified 33% of third and fourth graders and 27% of fifth graders as scoring at grade level or higher. Only 24% of sixth graders, 25% of seventh graders and 17% of eighth graders in Oklahoma scored proficient or advanced in math.
That’s an across-the-board decline from 2024 math scores. However, 2024 data should be considered an “outlier,” according to guidance from the Office of Educational Quality and Accountability.
The agency advised that the 2025 results are more comparable to 2023, when 26% of all Oklahoma students scored proficient or above in reading and math.
Having higher testing expectations better identifies whether students are on track to be ready for college or a career by the time they graduate high school, Oftedal said. It also more closely aligns with scoring used in national testing.
“Scores may look lower, but what they show is more meaningful,” she said. “Raising expectations helps everyone — parents, teachers, and schools — see more clearly where students are thriving and where they may need extra support. Our students haven’t fallen behind; we’ve simply raised the bar to match their potential and prepare them for the future.”

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)The state of Iowa’s general fund revenue for fiscal year 2025 is roughly $200 million less than predicted when state lawmakers were moving forward with the budget, according to a Legislative Services Agency report.
The nonpartisan LSA document found the state collected $8.8 billion in the fiscal year covering July 1, 2024, through June 30, 2025. This is a drop of $780 million in revenue compared to the state’s $9.6 billion revenue in FY 2024 – an 8.1% decrease.
Part of this funding decrease was expected, as Gov. Kim Reynolds signed a law in 2024 speeding up previously approved income tax cuts. When state legislators reconvened for the 2025 legislative session, Republican leaders said they were expecting to draw from the $3.75 billion Taxpayer Relief Fund, as well as the state’s $2 billion budget surplus and $961 in reserve accounts to make up for the expected shortfall caused by the tax cuts.
The Revenue Estimating Conference predicted in March that Iowa would see a revenue of $9.020 billion in FY 2025, excluding lottery and other transfers. The updated total from the LSA is $198 million below that prediction.
State Auditor Rob Sand, who is running for Iowa governor, said in a statement Monday the LSA report shows Iowa Republicans’ “irresponsible budgeting practices” have led to a predicted financial crisis.
“I warned of a fiscal time bomb back in May, and now we are seeing it detonate before our very eyes,” Sand said in a statement.  “The decline in state revenues is even worse than anticipated, raising serious concerns about funding for services that Iowa’s families and communities depend on.”
He and other Democrats have criticized both the move to a single 3.8% income tax rate, as well as the state’s Education Savings Account program awarding public funding for private school tuition and associated costs.
Democrats have warned these GOP-backed initiatives will cause major issues as the state draws from its reserves. According to the LSA, the state’s Taxpayer Relief Fund contains $3.6 billion and the state retains a $1.6 billion surplus as of July.
Sen. Janet Petersen, D-Des Moines, said in a statement earlier in October that the LSA’s report shows “the governor’s five-year projections are looking pretty rosy compared to the state’s fiscal reality.” Earlier in 2025, Petersen had made a Freedom of Information Act request to the Iowa Department of Management requesting the release of the administration’s five-year financial plan, which showed the intention to transfer money from the Taxpayer Relief Fund from FY 2026 through 2030.
“Republican lawmakers planned to spend more than we take in for at least the next five years,” Petersen said. “Our reserves won’t last forever. Just how much, or for how long, are they willing to deplete our reserves to cover their budget malpractice?”
In addition to the confirmed lower revenue in FY 2025, the state is expected to bring in less money in future years. This is not only because of state tax law changes – Reynolds said in September some of the individual and corporate income tax law changes approved through the federal “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” will also result in a $437.5 million decrease for Iowa’s general fund revenues in fiscal year 2026, according to initial Iowa Department of Revenue projections. Struggles in the agricultural economy are also expected to have a negative impact on Iowa’s economy.
But in a social media post Thursday after the LSA report was released, Reynolds highlighted the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis report on GDP growth data, which found Iowa’s GDP grew by 3.7% in the second quarter of 2025, “ranking Iowa in the top 20” in the country.
“With $20B of new capital investment in the last 18 months, we’re continuing to drive growth and diversification for Iowa’s economy,” Reynolds wrote.
The REC is next scheduled to meet Oct. 16 at the Iowa State Capitol.

This summer, The Creative Campus hosted the Green Mountain Playwright Retreat. “I got 600 submissions from all over the world,"" said retreat director and Goddard graduate Erin Galligan Baldwin. ""It went viral.”

This story by Evan Witt was first published in the Hardwick Gazette on Sept. 30, 2025.
PLAINFIELD — The people trying to revitalize Goddard College’s former campus are counting on the arts. They say the new program is starting to gain traction, with summer events drawing crowds and attention.
“What’s going on here now is the dream come true,” said Kris Gruen, director of the nonprofit group The Creative Campus at Goddard. He praised developers Execusuite LLC for being, “open to the hopes and dreams of the local community.”
Gruen gave two examples of success from this summer: sold-out concerts and a retreat for playwrights that attracted international attention.
After closing in 2024, Goddard College was bought by Execusuite. Owner Mike Davidson asked the community of Plainfield to decide what should be done, resulting in the development of The Creative Campus. “It’s a nonprofit organization dedicated to cultivating a dynamic, intentional community where people of all ages come together to foster creative expression, live holistically, create new models of community living,” Gruen said.

The primary goal of The Creative Campus is to foster the creative arts, he said. Examples include concerts, plays, creative arts courses and retreats. “It’s really an invitation to people who want to bring their creative practice to a space that supports it, a space that has a community to engage around it,” Gruen said.
Another goal is to act as an economic driver for the town of Plainfield, filling the gap that was left by Goddard College. Many elements of Goddard College have been preserved through this new creative arts venue, including the Haybarn Theatre and the former college dorms.
This summer, Creative Campus hosted the Green Mountain Playwright Retreat, a four-day program run by playwright and Goddard graduate Erin Galligan Baldwin.

The retreat received submissions from playwrights in Vermont and beyond, resulting in a selective process of choosing which plays would be presented at the event, Baldwin said. “I got 600 submissions from all over the world when I posted it. It went viral.”
In addition to hosting playwrights, The Creative Campus presented plays in the Haybarn Theatre, which is well known in the community. “It’s been a theater space in Plainfield on the college campus since 1934,” Gruen said, “so it was one of the first things that got rejuvenated after the purchase of the campus last year.”
Nearby, Haybarn Restaurant and Lounge provides theater-goers and others somewhere to dine, including Vermont veggie burgers, avocado hummus and apple crisp. It was closed for remodeling until Oct. 1.
In addition, The Creative Campus rents out about 60 to 70 dorm-style rooms. Some are suites, but most are singles and double rooms, Gruen said.
The dorms provide a housing option for people coming from longer distances, giving them the ability to stay the night before or during an event.
The dorms, as well as other buildings at Goddard College, are in need of care. For example, some guests this summer were displeased when a bat got into the dormitories, Baldwin said.
“If you’re used to country living, it’s not a huge deal to have a critter. But I think in the future, if we’re catering to clientele from Boston or New York, we don’t want bats flying around,” she said.
As for the plans for developing housing on campus, Gruen said that Execusuite LLC is still in the planning stages. Davidson did not respond immediately to an email requesting comment.
Baldwin said she was happy to be back on campus where she graduated and back at the Haybarn Theatre, and excited for the future of the community as well.
“Central Vermont, and all of Vermont, has been through a lot with the flooding and with everything. I just thought this is a resurgence of an extremely important part of our state and part of our history and our culture here,” she said.

Laura Kelly to host public town halls in eight cities to gather input on new state budget in 2026 legislative session.,"Gov. Laura Kelly is hosting an eight-city tour of town halls dedicated to soliciting public input on how to  reshape the state government budget to better meet the needs of Kansans. The tour starts Oct. 9 in Salina and ends Nov. 12 in Wichita. (Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Gov. Laura Kelly plans to embark on an eight-city tour during October and November to explore with Kansans their state budget priorities ahead of next year’s legislative session.
Kelly, who is term limited and cannot seek reelection, said on Monday the town halls dedicated to formation of “The People’s Budget” would give folks an opportunity to express where they wanted lawmakers to earmark spending.
“Kansans should know and have a say in where their hard-earned taxpayer dollars are going,” Kelly said. “In the months ahead, it’s critical that we continue down the path of responsible budgeting to ensure Kansas does not return to the days of reckless fiscal mismanagement.”
She said her administration continued to be dedicated to creating and maintaining a financial foundation that could survive economic downturn.
In 2018, Kelly was elected in aftermath of aggressive state income tax cuts signed into law in 2012 and 2013 by Gov. Sam Brownback. The 2017 Legislature, in a bipartisan vote, wiped out much of Brownback’s tax agenda, which had been created as a mechanism to eventually eliminate the state income tax. Instead, the result was deep budget cuts, heavy borrowing and a sales tax hike.
During a special legislative session in 2024, lawmakers approved a $2 billion, five-year program of state tax reductions.
Kelly had cautioned the Legislature against income tax reductions that jeopardized the state’s financial well-being.
“My administration has been laser-focused on building a strong fiscal foundation for our state,” the governor said.
The first stop on the governor’s tour has been scheduled for 6 p.m. Oct. 9 at Salina South High School. She is to be joined by Adam Proffitt, the state budget director.
Other dates and locations: Hays, Bob & Pat Schmidt Community Center, Oct. 29; Garden City, Garden City High School, 6 p.m. Oct. 29; Kansas City, Kansas, West Wyandotte Library Auditorium, 6 p.m. Nov. 3; Leawood, Leawood Community Center, 6 p.m. Nov. 5; Emporia, Lyon County History Center, 6 p.m. Nov. 6; Pittsburg, Frisco Events Center, 6 p.m. Nov. 10; and Wichita, Nov. 12.
Kansans interested in attending the first-come, first-serve events should visit this form for additional details.
House Speaker Dan Hawkins, a Wichita legislator seeking the Republican Party’s nomination in 2026 for state insurance commissioner, offered a tongue-in-cheek response to the governor’s announcement.
“After seven years in office, Governor Kelly has announced she and Secretary Profitt are living out their inner Sonny and Cher and launching a statewide duet tour. I hope in addition to their vocal stylings, they offer real budget solutions,” Hawkins said.
He said the House and Senate appropriately set aside the governor’s budget recommendations during the 2025 legislative session and adopted a package of bills that spent $30 million less than Kelly proposed.
“While the golden oldies tour makes its rounds, you can rest assured that the beat will go on in the Legislature as we keep doing the hard work of rooting out waste and abuse in government spending,” Hawkins said.
In January, the Democratic governor submitted to the Legislature as required a budget that outlined investments in education, health care, infrastructure, public safety and other areas. The Legislature, led by Hawkins and Senate President Ty Masterson, a candidate for governor, built a separate budget plan designed to minimize Kelly’s influence on appropriations.
The governor’s office said the budget bill passed in April left the state with potential long-term problems. Legislative documents indicated the state could spend $300 million more than it collected in annually in taxes, which would jeopardize the state’s financial health.
Kelly’s statement said the budget tour was designed to gather feedback on “how to repair the damage caused by the Legislature’s reckless budget.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Kelly-democrat-lenexa-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-06 18:56:55.785058

(Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)SIOUX FALLS — The leader of an association of federal judges did not hesitate Monday when asked about her colleagues’ top concern. 
“I think every judge right now is concerned about their safety and the safety of their families,” said Judge Karen Schreier, speaking to the Sioux Falls Downtown Rotary Club at the South Dakota Military Heritage Alliance.
Schreier said judges across the country are facing “never-before-seen levels of threats” and intimidation, which she called “an attack on the rule of law itself.”
Schreier, who’s based at the federal courthouse in Sioux Falls, is the president of the 1,100-member Federal Judges Association. In May, she was appointed to a new national Judicial Security and Independence Task Force, created by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts to address growing threats against federal judges and challenges to the judiciary’s independence. 










I think every judge right now is concerned about their safety and the safety of their families.


– U.S. District Judge Karen Schreier, president of Federal Judges Association


Schreier cited an incident earlier this year when the sister of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett was targeted with a bomb threat. The U.S. Marshals Service has logged 562 threats against federal judges so far this year. More than 100 threatening packages have been delivered to federal judges’ homes, Schreier said, “sending a not-so-subtle message that we know where you live.”
Schreier also recalled the 2020 killing of federal Judge Esther Salas’ son in New Jersey by a lawyer who had previously lost a case in Salas’ court. Some judges, Schreier said, have been “doxed” with their private information posted online, while others — including South Dakota’s chief federal judge, Roberto Lang — have been “swatted,” a hoax in which false reports draw armed police to someone’s home.
During an audience question-and-answer session, South Dakota NewsWatch co-founder and former journalist Jack Marsh asked Schreier about criticism of the judiciary from political leaders, specifically President Donald Trump. The president has harshly criticized and even called for the impeachment of judges who ruled against him.
Schreier made general comments but declined to address Trump specifically, saying her restraint reflects the judiciary’s obligation to stay above partisan conflict.
“If judges are to protect the rights and liberties of citizens and to act as an effective check on the other branches of government, they must be independent,” she said. “They need to be free to decide cases based on the law.”

(Photo by Catherine Scott/URI photo)A public medical school could generate nearly $1.5 billion for Rhode Island’s economy within its first decade and help shore up the state’s primary care doctors.
That’s the key takeaway of a roughly nine-month feasibility study commissioned by a special legislative commission.
The 104-page report released Monday afternoon is not the final product of the commission charged with investigating how or if a public medical school could bolster the state’s primary care workforce. The final set of recommendations is not due until Jan. 2, 2026. 
Legislators were curious to learn if a hypothetical medical school at the University of Rhode Island (URI) could counteract the state’s shrinking fleet of primary care doctors, many of whom are aging out of the workforce. Absent any pipelines for new medical talent, a deficit of around 100 primary doctors is projected by 2030, the report estimates. Other estimates have pegged the current shortage in excess of 300.
The report from Tripp Umbach, consultants based in Kansas City, Missouri, also cites 2024 data from the Rhode Island Health Care System Planning’s foundational report that about 44% of Rhode Island’s physician workforce are nearing retirement age.
Paul Umbach, the founder and president of Tripp Umbach, shared a tentative version of the report with the commission in June. The complete feasibility study envisions an inaugural class of 50 students in fall 2029, which would then ramp up to the full capacity of 100 students by 2033. The medical students would largely train within a community-based model that would see them gain experience in the state’s Federally Qualified Health Centers and community hospitals. 
“Rhode Island hospitals, community health centers, and regional partners in Massachusetts and Connecticut have the capacity and interest to host clinical clerkships and residencies,” the report reads. “URI can attract local students by offering B.S./M.D. pathways, early assurance programs, tuition incentives, and service-based loan repayment tied to in-state practice.”
The consultants now project the school would generate about $196 million a year in economic activity, would employ about 1,335 people, and contribute $4.5 million in state and local taxes. They said the economic benefits would come from the hiring of staff and faculty, student and faculty spending in the community, research growth, and the new companies that often start up from such research as well as small businesses that cater to a university community. 
Those economic benefits would not come gratis. The firm is recommending $175 million upfront from a public/private mix of “early philanthropic gifts, institutional contributions, and long-term public commitments.” That money would support finding the school’s dean, building out the faculty and staff and gaining accreditation from the Liaison Committee on Medical Education. About $62.5 million of this seed funding would go toward upgrading, retrofitting or building facilities. Operating costs and expenses for IT and simulation are also bundled into this lump sum. 
State contributions would amount to about $20 million in an initial round of public funding, plus $22.5 million annually beginning in 2029 upon entry of the school’s first class. These funds would be separate from any existing appropriations to URI, the report notes, and the annual state support would largely cover medical education at the school. Expanding residency options for med students and offering incentives like loan repayment — perks, the report notes, which would help keep graduates in Rhode Island — would need separate appropriations.
The report adds, “While start-up deficits are anticipated for any new medical school, they are offset over time by tuition revenue, clinical partnerships, research growth, and operational efficiencies.”
The project timeline could be pushed back a year to accommodate any delays in the school’s launch — such as finding an appropriate dean, a process that would ideally need to be completed by 2026 — but the feasibility study recommends the school open “no later” than 2030. 
“While Tripp Umbach believes funding conditions will improve in future decades, projections for federal research support in the 2030s are uncertain,” the report reads. 
The per-student costs the state would need to absorb are relatively modest compared to other states, the report suggests: “[T]he U.S. average for annual state support per medical student is $275,000, with Connecticut being $189,565 and Massachusetts at $97,975; therefore, Rhode Island’s $52,250 per student request within the feasibility study is approximately half as much per student as in Massachusetts, almost four times less than in Connecticut, and nearly five times less than the U.S. average.”
The final draft of the feasibility study will inform the commission’s ultimate suggestions. The public still has a chance to comment on the report’s findings, during a public hearing scheduled for the panel’s next meeting on Thursday, Oct. 9, at 5 p.m. in the Senate Lounge of the Rhode Island State House.
The legislative panel was created through legislation passed in June 2024. The following month, its 21 members were appointed by former Senate President Dominick J. Ruggerio, who died in April.

(Photo courtesy of Department of Enterprise Services)A hammer-wielding 29-year-old Washington resident is facing multiple felony charges after allegedly breaking into the state Capitol building in Olympia Sunday night, setting fires and toppling two iconic busts outside the historic state reception room.
Gunnar McLean Schubert wreaked havoc for about 10 minutes before the Washington State Patrol arrested him without incident as he left the building, authorities said. He was booked into Thurston County jail and is facing charges of first-degree burglary, first-degree arson, and first-degree malicious mischief. 
“It did not seem to be at all politically motivated. It appears to have been a person experiencing a mental health challenge,” said Chris Loftis, a spokesman for the Washington State Patrol.
Shortly after 10 p.m., Schubert, a native of Auburn and a former minor league baseball player, used a hammer to smash a first-floor window of the suite of offices shared by several House Democrats, authorities said.
He proceeded to knock over county flags positioned in one corner of the rotunda, and, using lighter fluid, set the Columbia County flag on fire, Washington Lt. Gov. Denny Heck said in an interview.
On the third floor, officials said he broke a glass door to get into the reception room, where he burned a piano bench and attempted to set the carpet on fire. He also tipped over state and national flags and burned them, Heck said. Outside, he knocked over a bust of Martin Luther King Jr. and a much larger one of George Washington. Both had been put back in place by midday Monday.

And some stanchions were thrown down the rotunda stairs, causing a few chips on the marble stairs, according to the Department of Enterprise Services, whose staff first notified law enforcement Sunday night.
“It’s terrible. It’s heartbreaking news,” Heck said of the damage in the state reception room.
The room is used for public tours, class visits, press conferences and bill signings by governors.
It contains “priceless, irreplaceable” items. The carpet, for example, is the original flooring from 1928 and described by the state as the “world’s largest single-loom carpet.”

Schubert played baseball at Gonzaga University in Spokane and was drafted by the Florida Marlins in 2018. His professional career lasted two seasons.
In recent days, Schubert appeared to post repeatedly to Instagram, voicing rambling frustrations with the government, though his political ideology is unclear from the posts. In separate posts, he posed with a gun, invoked a Democratic state lawmaker and wrote current events-themed poems as captions.
Heck said Schubert had dropped by his office three times in the last few months. In those visits, the suspect left notes and small gifts for Heck, although the veteran political leader said he doesn’t know the man.
“I take his family at their word that there are mental health considerations,” Heck said in an interview. “How is it not a political statement to enter the state Capitol building and do damage? He could have entered any of a thousand buildings in Thurston County. Secondly, we do know that he has an Instagram trail of having made strong statements.”
“The truth of the matter is, anytime this happens, whether it’s Paul Pelosi getting his head beat in or Steve Scalise being shot, they are, in all likelihood, both political statements and issues of mental health,” Heck added, referring to separate attacks over the past decade on U.S. Rep. Nancy Pelosi’s husband and Scalise, a congressman from Louisiana. 
“It’s not cleanly one or the other, I don’t think,” Heck said. “Hardly ever. It’s some combination, often.”
In a statement, House Speaker Laurie Jinkins, D-Tacoma, called the Capitol “more than just a building.”
“It is the people’s house, and it must always be a place where legislators, staff, and the public feel safe carrying out the important work of democracy,” she said. “While this act of destruction is disturbing, we will not be deterred. The people’s work will continue, and our commitment to transparency, safety, and service remains unwavering.”
Heck said this incident is another reminder of the “significant escalation in both violence-tinged political rhetoric and actual violence.”
Recent months have seen the killing of Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband in their home and the shooting of Minnesota state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife by the same gunman, and the assassination of Republican political activist Charlie Kirk. 
“We must all do our part in turning down the temperature,” Heck said in a statement. “Violent rhetoric, property destruction, and violence against individuals are a cancer on our democratic society.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/washington-state-capitol-vandalism-1024x532.jpg,,,2025-10-06 17:58:29.043940
,DC,2025-10-06 21:40:15+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Government shutdown enters day six with talks over health care at an impasse,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/government-shutdown-enters-day-six-talks-over-health-care-impasse,,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump sent mixed messages Monday about whether he would negotiate a deal with Democrats to extend the enhanced tax credits for people who get their health insurance from the Affordable Care Act Marketplace, one of the main issues that led to the government shutdown. Trump said “some very good things could happen with respect to health care” and that “if we made the right deal, I’d make a deal, sure,” before sharply criticizing the 2010 health care law, also called Obamacare. “That’s the problem with Obamacare. The subsidies are so much — billions and billions of dollars is being wasted,” Trump said. “And we could have much better health care than we have right now. And we’re talking to them. I’m not saying that’s going to happen.”Trump centered much of his 2016 campaign for the presidency around repealing and replacing the health care law, but Republicans were unable to do so with unified control of government during the first half of his first term.  After Democrats swept in the 2020 elections, they enhanced the tax credits for people who buy their health insurance through the ACA Marketplace in a coronavirus relief law. Those enhanced subsidies are set to expire at the end of December. Democratic leaders for weeks have called on Republicans to negotiate a bipartisan agreement to extend those enhanced tax credits ahead of open enrollment beginning on Nov. 1. That didn’t happen and Democrats have largely voted against advancing a stopgap spending bill written by Republicans that was needed to fund the government past the end of September. ‘On another planet’Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said during a floor speech shortly before Trump spoke from the Oval Office that the president and GOP leaders seem “to be on another planet.”“Instead of trying to solve this shutdown crisis, Donald Trump spent the weekend golfing and posting memes and deepfakes on the internet,” Schumer said. “He seems to think this shutdown is some big joke. He’s wrong.”Schumer released a statement following Trump’s press conference, saying the two sides aren’t negotiating, despite the president saying “we are speaking with the Democrats.” “For months, Democrats have been calling on Donald Trump and Congressional Republicans to come to the table and work with us to deliver lower costs and better healthcare for the American people,” Schumer wrote. “If President Trump and Republicans are finally ready to sit down and get something done on healthcare for American families, Democrats will be there — ready to make it happen.”Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said during a morning press conference he will only negotiate with Democrats on the enhanced ACA Marketplace tax credits after the shutdown ends. But Johnson did indicate he believes the expiring expansion likely needs a resolution before open enrollment begins next month.“They've been saying that some of the insurance companies will be sending out notices in early November. The last time I checked, it's Oct. 6. We have the entire month of October,” Johnson said. “We'll stay here around the clock to work through all these things, but we have to get government open again to do it.""Discussion about passing billsThe House has been in recess since mid-September and Johnson has refused to bring representatives back until after the Senate approves a bill to reopen the government. Johnson revealed during the press conference that he had a “fruitful conversation” a few days ago with Senate Appropriations Committee ranking member Patty Murray, D-Wash., about the annual government funding process, which lawmakers were supposed to complete by the start of the fiscal year on Oct. 1.Johnson said he gave Murray assurances that he would hold floor votes on the final bipartisan versions of the dozen full-year bills after the Democrats and Republicans in charge of each subcommittee worked out an agreement.“I'm ready to go,” Johnson said. “But we've got to open government up so that they can move to that next level, so that the conference committee can get that work done. That is small-d democracy at its best; you get Rs and Ds, everybody in the room, and they hash it out, and whatever that final product is, we will move through the process.”The House has passed three of the full-year government funding bills along party-line votes and the Senate has approved three with a broadly bipartisan vote. Congress’ failure to approve all of the bills on time, combined with its inability to approve a stopgap spending bill to keep funding on autopilot while lawmakers work out a final full-year agreement, is why a shutdown began.Dems say bipartisan talks needed to end shutdownMurray posted later in the day on social media that bipartisan talks between the congressional leaders are the best option to end the shutdown.“I’ll reiterate now what I told @SpeakerJohnson: the only path forward begins with him & @LeaderJohnThune talking with Leaders Schumer & Jeffries,” Murray wrote. “Premium hikes are going out THIS MONTH. We need a deal that reopens the government & stops premiums from doubling.”White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said during an afternoon briefing before Trump spoke that he “is definitely committed to fixing and improving our health care system,” though she declined to say if he supports extending the enhanced ACA tax credits as they exist. Leavitt also opted not to fully answer questions about when the administration will begin laying off federal workers by the thousands, saying the White House budget office continues to consult with Cabinet secretaries to determine which workers may lose their jobs. “We’ll see how the vote goes tonight,” Leavitt said, referring to the Senate’s Monday evening vote on the stopgap spending bills. Rural air service, air traffic controllersTransportation Secretary Sean Duffy said during a press conference at Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey that the shutdown means there are only a few days left of funding for the Essential Air Service program, which provides federal “subsidies to airlines to service” rural communities. “That money runs out this Sunday, so there are many small communities across the country that will now no longer have the resources to make sure they have air service in their community,” Duffy said.  Alaska will be the most affected by that particular funding lapse, he said. Duffy said there has been a “slight” increase in the number of air traffic controllers calling out sick during the shutdown but added it hadn’t caused any safety challenges yet. That will all change if transportation officials feel the staffing isn’t adequate for the number of flights. “If we see there are issues in the tower that are affecting the controllers’ ability to effectively control the airspace, we’ll reduce the rate and you’ll see more delays or you might see a cancellation,” Duffy said. “I’m willing to do that before we’re willing to risk anyone’s life in the air.”Duffy, a former Republican congressman from Wisconsin, said he had spoken earlier in the day with air traffic controllers who were thinking about taking on jobs at ride-sharing companies to pay the bills, since they will not be paid until after the shutdown ends. He said the effects of the funding lapse, including air traffic controllers worrying how they’ll make ends meet, are problematic, especially if they’re distracted by it while on shift or exhausted from working other jobs.  “I don’t want them finding a second job to pay the bills,” Duffy said. “I want them to get paid for the work they’re doing today, keeping our planes in the air and our skies safe.”Duffy also reiterated the Transportation Security Administration, or TSA, which screens people entering airports, is housed within the Department of Homeland Security, not DOT.  Shauneen Miranda contributed to this report.",,,,2025-10-06 17:58:29.043940

(Photo by Andrew Kennard/Wisconsin Examiner)The Trump administration has backed away from a threat to demand that states cooperate with federal immigration enforcement if they want access to federal funds to aid crime victims, according to Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul.
Wisconsin was one of 20 states and the District of Columbia that sued the administration in August over a demand that states join in federal immigration enforcement efforts if the wanted access to Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) grants.
Fees, fines and penalties collected in federal court proceedings  are distributed under VOCA to states to use on victim services, including operating community-based organizations such as domestic violence shelters and rape crisis centers and victim-witness offices within county district attorneys’ offices. 
The Wisconsin Department of Justice estimated the state would have lost more than $24 million in grant funds if the threat had been  carried out.
The U.S. Department of Justice abandoned the plan after the lawsuit was filed, Kaul said Monday.
“This is funding that helps make a difference for victims of crime,” Kaul said in a statement. “The Trump administration shouldn’t have tried to tie states’ access to this funding to their assistance with immigration enforcement.”

(Provided by MSU for the Daily Montanan)Montana’s flagship institutions of higher education are both celebrating continued growth reflected in fall enrollment numbers released last month. 
In Bozeman, Montana State University saw headcount numbers tick up slightly from last year, marking a second consecutive fall with more than 17,100 students enrolled. MSU is the largest school in a four-state region that includes Wyoming and both Dakotas. 
“It’s humbling that so many students have chosen to start their futures at Montana State University,” MSU’s new President Brock Tessman said in a statement. “Our mission is to open the door to higher education for as many students as we can and offer them a first-rate education in a wide range of disciplines. And we are committed to helping our students meet their educational and career goals and to providing excellent support and resources for them every step of the way.”
To the west, the University of Montana heralded a fifth-straight year of enrollment growth with 11,064 students this semester, fueled by strong growth at Missoula College and UM’s graduate school. 
“Students choose UM because they will succeed here, our Griz community will support them, and we will help them launch a meaningful career and lead a fulfilling life,” UM President Seth Bodnar said.
Missoula College, the two-year school embedded within UM, grew by 17% over fall 2024, according to UM’s census data. The graduate program counted a record 2,910 students, making it the largest graduate school in the state, while the Alexander Blewett III School of Law grew by 4% to 280 students.

The University of Montana was the state’s largest school until 2012, according to the Montana University System. UM saw 10 years of falling enrollment until the trend began to reverse in 2021. 
This fall’s headcount marks the first time UM has surpassed 11,000 students since 2017. 
Both of Montana’s largest universities welcomed large classes of first-time college students — MSU with 3,743 and UM with 3,621 — and both schools count Montanans as the majority of their students. 
Half of all MSU students are from Montana — 8,519 — while 69% of UM’s student body — 6,866 — are in-state residents.
Both schools also touted success in meeting the state’s workforce needs by bolstering offerings at their respective two-year colleges and through non-credit courses and training. 
Gallatin College MSU had an enrollment of 1,078, the second year the college has exceeded 1,000 students. 
“The growth we’re seeing this fall reflects the confidence students and families place in Montana State University,” said Robert Mokwa, MSU’s provost and executive vice president for academic affairs. “As the state’s land-grant university, our mission is to expand access to higher education, prepare graduates for Montana’s workforce needs and advance knowledge that benefits communities across the state.”
According to UM’s press release, the university served 10,387 individuals — not counted in enrollment figures — during the last year through noncredit courses and training, designed to help learners “re-skill, upskill or change careers.”
“In today’s rapidly changing labor market, everyone deserves access to education that meets their specific needs and is delivered on their timeline,” Bodnar said. “UM has made investments to bolster our ability to serve learners beyond the traditional 18- to 22-year-old college student. We are proud that more than 10,000 people have benefited from these courses during the past year, landing jobs in growing fields like health care, construction and technology.”
MSU provided the following figures from fall enrollment:

It brought in 3,743 new first-time college students, including 1,572 Montanans;
A record 15,142 undergraduate students and 2,023 graduate students;
A record 1,124 Hispanic and 153 Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander students enrolled, as well as 848 Native American/Alaska Native students enrolled;
A record retention rate of 81.8%, which measures the number of students who return for a second fall; and
A 21% increase in students receiving veteran benefits, at 700. 

The university also acknowledged setting four-, five-, and six-year graduation rates last spring.

“Record headcounts would not be possible if we were not working day in and day out to keep students in school and on track to graduation,” said Steve Swinford, MSU’s vice president for student success. “That plays a direct role in our increases in graduation rates, and that is something we are immensely proud of at MSU.”
Additional highlights from UM’s fall census data include:

259 more graduate students this fall compared to last;
A record 77.2% retention rate, up nine points from 2018;
817 Native American students enrolled for fall semester, a number that has increased by more than 40% since 2018;
An increase of 592 UM students who are first in their family to attend college; and
An undergraduate headcount made up of 31% of students who are eligible for Pell Grants, awarded to those whose families earn significantly less income than the state’s median.

“Our No. 1 priority is to place student success at the center of all we do, and these record-breaking student success rates are a testament to the hard work and dedication of UM’s talented faculty and staff members,” Bodnar said. “Given the high number of first-generation college students on our campus, this work is truly changing the economic trajectory for thousands of Montana families.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/first-day-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-10-06 17:58:29.043940

Free.,Trump administration defends nationwide rapid deportations at appeals hearing,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-administration-defends-nationwide-rapid-deportations-appeals-hearing,,"WASHINGTON — Judges on a federal appeals court panel seemed skeptical that the Trump administration's expanded use of a fast-track deportation procedure didn’t violate the due-process rights of immigrants during oral arguments Monday.The hearing before judges Patricia A. Millett, Neomi Rao and J. Michelle Childs of the D.C. Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals comes after a lower court struck down the expedited removal policy used to bypass judicial review in the quick removals of migrants far from the southern border. The expanded policy is a pillar in the Trump administration's mass deportation campaign. “This is a critical tool of immigration enforcement,"" U.S. Department of Justice attorney Drew Ensign said. “This is not a small deal. The ability to conduct expedited removal is one of the executive’s most important tools for maintaining border control and not being overwhelmed.”For decades, presidential administrations have applied expedited removal to immigrants apprehended at the southern border who cannot prove they have remained in the country for more than two years. If they cannot produce that proof, those immigrants are then subject to deportation without appearing before an immigration judge.In January, the Trump administration expanded expedited removal to apply nationwide, rather than only within 100 miles of the southern border.Childs said the Trump administration can still use expedited removal, along with other enforcement tools, for its immigration policy.“So what are you losing, other than (applying expedited removal to) millions of other people, to go inward into the U.S.?” Childs asked.Former President Barack Obama appointed Millett, former President Joe Biden appointed Childs, and President Donald Trump appointed Rao in his first term.Policy lacks procedureArguing on behalf of the immigration advocacy group that brought the suit, Make the Road New York, attorney Anand Balakrishnan said the new policy “brings to bear against this new class of people an entire system of expedited removal that is not procedurally adequate.”The judges also questioned the legality of the Trump administration’s expanded use of expedited removal. Ensign argued that the Trump administration doesn’t believe the expansion violates due-process rights because those affected are not U.S. citizens.“It has been well-established that aliens who are not lawfully admitted into the country are only entitled to whatever procedures the political branches provide, and that the plaintiffs cannot rely on the due-process clause to impose additional procedural requirements,” Ensign said.Balakrishnan said that when the Trump administration expanded the use of the policy in January, there were no new procedures put in place, meaning immigrants wanting to challenge their removal under the new policy would have no way to do so.“The procedures that have been on the books, in some cases are not tailored for this radically new class to which it's being applied, and in other cases, are insufficient to deal with the unique challenges placed by them and the liberty interests of this new group,” Balakrishnan said.",,,,2025-10-06 17:58:29.043940

Ned Lamont's gearing up to run for a third term.,"Gov. Ned Lamont has been shy when asked by reporters whether or not he’s running for a third term. However, he has spent the summer highlighting his administration’s successes.
WSHU’s Ebong Udoma spoke with CT Mirror’s Mark Pazniokas to discuss his article, “It’s clear Lamont wants a 3rd term, less so what he would do,” as part of the collaborative podcast Long Story Short. Read Mark’s story here.
WSHU: Hello, Mark. Governor Lamont has yet to declare he’s seeking a third term. So could you explain how you’ve been able to decipher from his recent moves that he is seeking a third term in office?
MP: Well, it’s a very sophisticated analysis, which goes, if he walks and talks like a candidate, I think we can assume he’s a candidate. To give a little bit more, he has stopped really being coy about whether he’s truly undecided. And if you look at his schedule, he is acting very much like a candidate, putting a nice gloss on the last session, as well as his previous almost seven years in office. But as I know you know, he doesn’t give us much of an idea of what his ambitions are for the third term. He wants to get there, but what does he want to do with it?
WSHU: So, tell us what his record is right now, and if he does declare for a third term, what do you think he would say he wants to do for a third term?
MP: Well, he has emphasized returning a certain degree of stability to the Connecticut state government, particularly its finances. It’s not the most exciting issue to run on, but it’s an important issue, and that has been his emphasis, really, since he took office. He had a horrible first year in office over a failed proposal to bring back highway tolls. But the thread that connects that failure to some of us is his successes is that he said Connecticut is not paying its bills, that Connecticut needs to have a balanced approach to spending, and that included the special transportation fund that, at that point, was headed for insolvency, so that’s what prompted that. But since then, he has been somewhat lucky. Let’s be honest, a significant amount of federal funds has been allocated to Connecticut and other states as a result of COVID-19 and the aid that has flowed from the federal government. On top of that, he has been a defender of the volatility cap, which preceded him, which was passed in 2017. And the real short version of that is, tax revenues that tend to be more volatile, you have to bank them. You have to either put them into the rainy day fund, and once that is full, it has to go to paying down Connecticut’s really horrific pension debt, unfunded pension liability, which has built up over a decade.
WSHU: And also, the stock market has done pretty well, and that’s what the volatility issue is all about. You know, when the stock market does well, we make a lot more revenue, and if we can hold on to some of that revenue for longer, it might help us out on a rainy day, correct?
MP: Connecticut’s income tax structure is very sensitive to how Wall Street is doing. In good times in Connecticut, the money just flows in. So, the governor’s approach to this has been to avoid what he calls the yo-yo effect: in good times, you spend a lot, and then two, three years later, you have to make cutbacks in those areas. So again, his mantra has been stability and certainty.
WSHU: And what he’s got to show for that is we have a better credit rating now.
MP: Yes, the credit rating has been upgraded several times since the governor took office, and that means Connecticut can borrow money at a lower rate. The other argument he makes on behalf of his approach is that Connecticut’s fixed cost, and I’m talking about contributions, the annually, actuarially required contributions to the pension fund, they actually get lower as the financial condition of the pension funds improves. So by the governor’s calculation, the state is paying maybe $700 even $800 million less a year, and that is money available to do other things, which is the argument that he makes to offset the complaints that Connecticut is being a little bit too tight with Its money in this era of huge surpluses, and that there are significant unmet needs in Connecticut. Nobody really disagrees with that general point, that there are, in fact, unmet needs in this state.
WSHU: Okay, now let’s talk about the opposition the way it’s lining up right now. Let’s start with the Republican side. Who do we have opposing Lamont, and what are their arguments?
MP: Well, they’re not making any arguments yet, but there are two of them there. One is a declared candidate, and that is state senator Ryan Fazio. He’s 35 years old. He represents Greenwich. He is considered a rising star in the party. And then the other one is Erin Stewart, the mayor of New Britain, who’s been an interesting politician, given that she is a Republican who has done quite well in a democratic city of New Britain. She created an exploratory committee in January, and she has raised about $350,000. The significance of that is to qualify for Connecticut’s system of public financing of campaigns. That $350,000 is a very important number that you have to raise through small-dollar contributions to qualify for public grants. And she is expected to become a declared candidate sometime after the municipal elections next month. And the two of them, you know, there is at this point a generational contrast with the governor, the governor is 71, he would be the oldest governor to seek re-election since Wilbur Cross in 1938. But beyond that, their campaigns really have not developed yet, which is not surprising. They are in the early stages of really putting together the infrastructure of a campaign to challenge an incumbent whose approval ratings have been pretty good. There’s a little bit of softness on the question of a third term. You know, people generally think two terms are plenty, but in the end, it’ll come down to a binary choice.
WSHU: Talking about challenges, he’s also got some challenges coming from his left flank. His fellow Democrat, progressive Democrat Josh Elliot, has declared that he’s running. What is that shaping up to be?
MP: Representative Elliot really had trouble gaining support for his campaign as measured by his fundraising. And he told me the other day that when they file later this week, he’ll show that he’s raised about $45,000. His argument is, and his reason for being, I think, is twofold. One, there’s dissatisfaction among liberals in the Democratic Party with the governor’s fiscal conservatism. There has been a push to get him to be more willing to spend money for things like Medicaid reimbursement rates, you know, which are still pretty low in Connecticut, and that can impact the ability of people to get health care at times. There are some people who would like to see him far more aggressive in dealing with President Trump and immigration policies.
And then there’s the matter of the governor’s veto of the most significant housing bill to be sent to his desk since he’s been elected governor, and he really did side with suburban opponents and Republicans who said that the bill as written was too much of an intrusion into local zoning, and that, you know, again, that is a source of significant conflict with the governor.
WSHU: Do you think he’ll be able to solve it before he’s likely to formally declare after the November municipal elections, from what you’ve been able to discern, right?
MP: He has been negotiating a revised version. He has been expressing optimism, House Majority Leader Jason Rojas, a key sponsor of that bill, also has been expressing optimism about having a version that perhaps the General Assembly could adopt in special session by the end of the month, we’ll see. You know, these are two men who tend to offer an optimistic view of how things are going, but that is something that they hope to get done, and that would potentially ease some of the tensions with the left. But at the end of the day, if there’s no realistic alternative to Ned Lamont, you know, some of those folks generally come home. As it were, we’ve seen that with labor in the past. You had a lot of anger at Governor Dannel Malloy over his budgets. But in the end, when you have a choice, a binary choice, between a Democrat and a Republican, you know, labor generally comes home. The question is, do you lose some of the enthusiasm that you want to see in generating voter turnout?
WSHU: However, I like the way you ended your article with the quote from Lamont saying, I like where we are.
MP: That’s a contrast with the federal government and President Trump. And that is the other factor here. Our governor, let’s be honest, he’s not the most exciting politician we’ve ever seen, but that is part of, I think, the appeal that he will be making, you know, “I am Mr. Steady. I am Mr. Stable,” at a time where there’s some value in that. So we’ll see.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025_1002_SR_LamontPortrait_021-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-06 17:58:29.043940

(Patrick Lohmann/Source NM)
New Mexico’s Motor Vehicle Division will no longer issue or renew commercial driver’s licenses or learner’s permits to certain foreign-born drivers, according to a recent news release.
The announcement last week came about a week after the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration issued emergency interim rules seeking to crack down on what it says are immigrants illegally, and unsafely, driving semi trailers on nationwide highways. The MVD says its change announced Thursday complies with those interim rules.
According to the MVD, the division will only issue commercial licenses or permits to foreign nationals who have valid, unexpired foreign passports that have an I-94 form documenting their most recent entrance into the United States. 
That is also true for those with certain employment-based, non-immigrant visas — namely, the H-2A, H-2B and E-2 visas — according to an updated form MVD published this month listing the documents required to receive a CDL. 
The change mirrors those that have occurred in other states, and it comes after federal Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy publicly threatened to withhold funding from New Mexico and two other states if they didn’t comply with President Donald Trump’s executive order requiring commercial truck drivers to be proficient in English.
Trump administration threatens to yank funds for New Mexico, California and Washington over truckers’ English proficiency

New Mexico, Washington and Florida were all targeted with the funding cut threat because Duffy accused all three states of playing a role in a fatal crash involving a foreign truck driver in Florida. In that case, a Florida driver, an immigrant from India who did not have permanent legal authority to be in the country, made an illegal U-turn on the Florida Turnpike, caused a crash that killed three people in another vehicle, according to local reports.
The driver had a commercial license from California and Washington, and had been pulled over for speeding in New Mexico prior to crashing in Florida, Duffy said in August.
The interim rules the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration published said five fatal crashes this year, including the one in Florida, involved “non-domiciled CDL holders,” which typically refers to foreign-born commercial truck drivers. 
New Mexico has issued 204 CDLs and commercial learner’s permits to “non-domiciled” people in the state. According to federal data, about 37,178 drivers have active CDLs in New Mexico.
After Duffy threatened to withhold $7 million in funding from New Mexico, a spokesperson for Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham told Source New Mexico that the state’s “thorough and federally compliant process for issuing CDLs” requires English proficiency.
“We believe that a full review of the incidents in question will demonstrate that New Mexico is in full compliance with federal law and that New Mexico State Police are effectively enforcing safety regulations on our roadways,” spokesperson Michael Coleman said.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_4779-scaled-e1759786292702-1024x707.jpg,,,2025-10-06 17:58:29.043940

(Screenshot)President Donald Trump on Monday signed an order that overturns a decision by the Biden administration to cancel a 211-mile mining road through Alaska’s Brooks Range by denying a right-of-way permit. 
Ambler Road, planned by the state of Alaska’s development bank and supported by state officials and Alaska’s congressional delegation, would link the Dalton Highway with a mineral-rich region of northwest Alaska, providing access to the mining of rare minerals needed for batteries and high-technology manufacturing.
“It’s an economic gold mine, so to speak. I signed this years ago, and Biden un-signed it for me,” Trump told reporters on Monday at the White House. 
Last year, the U.S. Bureau of Land Management concluded that the road would have a litany of negative impacts, and the Biden administration issued a record of decisions saying that the best route for the project was no route at all.
The Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority, Alaska’s state-owned investment bank and the road’s developer, sued the Biden administration, seeking a reversal.
U.S. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, speaking at the White House on Monday, said the state of Alaska requested an appeal of that decision, and that under federal law, President Trump has the executive authority to make decisions on land use.
The appeal in question was filed by AIDEA under Section 1106 of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act of 1980.
“This opens up a wealth of resources,” Burgum said, adding that the federal government will also take partial ownership of Trilogy Metals, one of several firms exploring for minerals in northwest Alaska.

Larson’s $800,000 in the quarter ending Sept. 30.","Connecticut’s first serious intra-party challenge to a congressional incumbent produced a burst of fundraising claims Monday, with challenger Luke Bronin reporting $1.18 million to Congressman John B. Larson’s $800,000 in the quarter ending Sept. 30.
Neither campaign released full reports that would disclose sources of their funds, the extent of their early spending or cash on hand. Those are due Oct. 15 in public filings to the Federal Election Commission.

But Bronin, who opened a challenge on July 30 for the Democratic nomination, used the release of the partial numbers to deliver a dig over “corporate PACs” at Larson, whose voting record has not drawn criticism yet from any of his challengers.
“We know that we’re never going to raise as much as a 27-year incumbent who gets most of his money from corporate PACs, but these first two months show that we’re going to have what we need to compete and make a powerful case for change,” Bronin said in a statement at 9 a.m. Monday
The Larson campaign responded at 2 p.m. with a statement ignoring the gibe over political action committees and publicizing that he had raised “over $1 million this cycle,” a reference to all fundraising since Jan. 1. The campaign clarified that its quarterly number was $800,000.

Larson’s previous two quarterly filings show he had raised $249,345 through June 30, including $200,055 from committees. Bronin, who showed himself to be a prodigious fundraiser in two mayoral campaigns, has said he will not raise money from corporate political action committees.
“I am grateful for the outpouring of support from across the First District,” Larson said in his statement. “At a time when President Trump and his allies are attacking our democracy, targeting immigrant families, and labeling me an agitator for standing up to them, this campaign is powered by people who know what’s at stake. They know we cannot allow Trump to dismantle our Constitution, privatize Social Security, or roll back the rights we have fought for over generations.”
Larson and Bronin are two of five Democrats in the race. Ruth Fortune, a Hartford school board member, filed papers July 3 and was quickly followed by Councilman Jack Perry of Southington. By the end of August, the field included Bronin and state Rep. Jillian Gilchrest of West Hartford. Fortune, Perry and Gilchrest did not release fundraising numbers.
In the 5th District, which has offered Connecticut’s most competitive congressional races in recent cycles, Republican challenger George Logan spent $2.9 million last year in his second unsuccessful challenge to Democrat Jahana Hayes, who spent $3.8 million.
With the U.S. House closely divided, the Hayes-Logan fight also attracted outside partisan money unlikely to be present in a Democratic primary: $1.4 million in support of Hayes and $6421,540 in support of Logan.

Neubauer, 68, has sat on the District II Court of Appeals for 18 years after being appointed to the seat in 2007. Prior to joining the bench, she was a private practice attorney at Milwaukee-based Foley and Lardner. 
She ran unsuccessfully for the Wisconsin Supreme Court in 2019 and was last elected to a six-year term on the appeals court in 2020, winning 54% of the vote in the 12-county southeastern Wisconsin district that is based in Waukesha County. 
She is also the mother of Assembly Minority Leader Greta Neubauer (D-Racine). 
As the judicial liberals have slowly gained control of the Supreme Court over the past five years, District II has become the most reliably conservative appellate district. Neubauer is the only liberal on the four judge panel. 
“In these trying and divided times, our courts must protect our democracy, our liberty, and our rights, by maintaining judicial independence and upholding the constitution and the rule of law. I have attempted to do that with every single decision,” Neubauer said. 
Last week, conservative District II Judge Maria Lazar announced she is  running for the Supreme Court in next year’s April election.

Kiewit originally said they were owed almost $25 million for extra work on the project, a figure the Port Authority disagreed with.
Port Authority Chairman Paul Whitescarver said the agreement hasn’t added any more to the total cost for State Pier — which has ballooned from the original estimation of $93 million to more than $300 million.
“It’s just a matter of maybe we use some of the interest that was in the escrow account while we’ve been waiting around to do this,” Whitescarver said. “Maybe there are other ways we can move funds around to make this meet that requirement that we’re going to provide Kiewit. It’s a positive outcome for everybody, the bottom line doesn’t change, and quite frankly, I think everybody is pleased with how it came out.”
Three state legislative Republicans, Sen. Minority Leader Stephen Harding, Sen. Heather Somers, and Sen. Henri Martin, have sent a letter to the authority asking them why they didn’t tell the public about the $11 million figure.
“Is this true? If so, when will this information be made public? There was no public discussion about this at your recent meeting other than a vote,” the Senators said. “If this $11 million payout news is true, what will the new total cost for taxpayers be with regard to the State Pier project? As you know, we have repeatedly expressed frustration regarding the lack of transparency at the Port Authority.”
Costs at the State Pier ballooned due to underwater issues and design changes. The pier was developed to be a hub to support offshore wind construction.
Whitescarver said he wants the pier to be an asset to the region.
“If we had not partnered with offshore wind and Orsted and Eversource, the pier would still be looking like it was before,” Whitescarver said. “And we have gained roughly 11 acres of storage or flat space where we can do a heck of a lot more than we could before. We could do lumber, we did lumber before, but now we’ve got 11 more acres, we can put lumber on the pier. I just wish people would open their minds and realize what a great advantage it is for southeastern Connecticut.”

(Photo by Eesha Pendharkar/ Maine Morning Star)Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows is confident law enforcement will ultimately uncover why 250 official ballots were allegedly delivered to a Newburgh home in an Amazon package. She also said the incident underscored that Maine’s processes work and that the state’s elections are safe and secure.
“Even if the most enterprising criminal were able to fabricate Maine ballots or Maine absentee ballot envelopes or if that chain of custody were broken, our elections would remain free, safe and secure because of the checks and balances in absentee voting itself,” Bellows said at a news conference at the State House Monday afternoon. 
Monday also marked the first day of in-person absentee voting throughout the state for the November election. 
In order to vote absentee, lawfully registered Maine voters must specifically request a ballot, Bellows explained. Those requests are tracked in the central voter registration system. Additionally, the Secretary of State’s office uploads public files in the lead up to the election that list absentee ballot requests. 
Bellows outlined the various steps in Maine’s absentee voting process including how the ballots are returned in secure envelopes to clerks throughout the state. With that process in place, Bellows underscored her faith in the safety of Maine elections. 
At the same time, her office continues to work with law enforcement to investigate the Newburgh incident. In response to several questions from the press, Bellows repeatedly said she couldn’t provide specific details because the investigation is ongoing.
“Those checks and balances in our production and distribution of ballots have been in place for a long time,” Bellows said. “Clearly, there was an interruption in the process this time so we will certainly do an after-action to evaluate how we can safeguard against any bad actor who seeks to interrupt that chain of custody.”
Despite sharing that the town of Ellsworth reported that it was missing 250 ballots the same day that the conservative news website the Maine Wire reported a Newburgh woman discovered official Maine ballots inside an Amazon shipment, Bellows said Monday that the towns of Ellsworth and Newburgh have all the ballots they need. The woman who reportedly found the ballots has not spoken with other news outlets. 
Republican legislators have raised concern about the incident and sent a letter to the Trump administration asking the Federal Bureau of Investigation to open a probe into potential violations of federal law. 
One of the two questions on November’s statewide ballot would make a series of significant changes to Maine election laws, including requiring voters to show certain identification when voting and limiting absentee voting access.

(Photo courtesy of University of Northern Iowa)For Bill Henninger, retiring has given him the ability to wake up in the morning with plenty of options for how to fill his day. The former law enforcement officer and Cedar Falls resident said he gets to decide whether to head to the YMCA for a swim, take out one of his four bicycles for a ride or go grab a beer “with the fellas.”
However fun being retired may be, Henninger said he still found himself bored and without anything like a job driving him to go out and do things.. That’s where the Cedar Valley Men’s Shed came in.
Since joining the group, Henninger and other men looking for friends and chances to put their hands and minds to work have participated in trail cleanups, visited museums, built garden beds and other structures, discussed aging and other topics with University of Northern Iowa students and more.
“It just seemed like I needed something to get me involved in, where every Wednesday I know I need to be somewhere because I’m part of this group,” Henninger said.

Melinda Heinz, an assistant professor teaching gerontology at UNI, founded the Men’s Shed in Cedar Falls nearly one year ago and organizes the group’s activities, though she said she doesn’t add much to the activities and interactions taking place among members.
The goal behind Men’s Sheds, which has chapters across the U.S. and world, is to fight against social isolation among men, especially later in life, and help them form a strong social support network.
Her research into men’s health, relationships and Men’s Sheds in other areas made her realize the need for such a group in her own backyard. Now, Heinz said, she’s seeing around 10 men at the average meeting and hearing about its success in bringing people together, even outside of events.
“It’s kind of these organic relationships that started at the shed, but are growing from there,” Heinz said.
The group meets weekly, once a month on the UNI campus and the rest of the time traveling for volunteer work, guest discussions and other activities. Some guest speakers for the group have decided to join themselves, Heinz said, which is always welcomed.
Heinz first learned about Men’s Sheds when traveling with students in Ireland, later receiving a Fulbright scholarship to head back to the country and study the initiative further. Although the groups originally started in Australia, Ireland has more groups per capita than any other country in the world, according to a UNI news release.
When she’s asked about the shed and why it’s needed, Heinz said she tells people about how men’s social circles are often smaller than women’s, especially later in life. Many men’s identities stem from their work, she said, and retiring can both shrink their social circle and chip away at that part of themselves. Participating in the Men’s Shed could help ease the transition into retirement and provide them with increased support.
“Thinking about the Men’s Shed as a really important community resource is something that I really try to instill in people that I’m talking with,” Heinz said.
Anyone can form a shed, Heinz said, and more information on how to do so can be found online.
A tidbit shared by Heinz has stuck with Henninger, he said, that men form stronger bonds when “they are shoulder-to-shoulder, working on a project, and not just sitting around the table talking.” He’s found the truth of the statement within himself, and seen what a lack of these bonds can do to those who didn’t find them.
One friend of Henninger’s who retired several years ago struggles with his mental health, Henninger said, which he believes is at least in part due to the isolation that comes with not leaving the home and maintaining relationships.
“You give me something I’m supposed to do, and then I’m like a beagle in tall grass trying to find a fox. I’m going to go in head-first, as fast as I can,” Henninger said. “So I just noticed that with other guys that, you know, give us something to do, no matter how small it is, and it’s like, okay, now I gotta focus in life for an hour, or a week, or whatever it may be. So I think that’s why it’s important for men.”

They've been inciting violence,” Leavitt said.Mainstream local media reports and statements from local officials have contradicted that claim.​​""There is no need for military intervention in Oregon. There is no insurrection in Portland. No threat to national security,” Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek, a Democrat, said in a statement Sunday.Federal agents used tear gas and pepper balls on nonviolent protesters Saturday evening, according to local media reports.Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker also filed a legal challenge against the administration Monday morning. A federal judge set a hearing for Thursday. Illinois and Chicago sought a temporary restraining order to stop Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth from ordering Texas and Illinois Guard troops to the country’s third-largest city.Trump teases Insurrection Act Trump on Monday afternoon raised the possibility of invoking the Insurrection Act of 1807, a tool to expand the president’s legal authority for using military personnel for domestic law enforcement.Asked by a reporter in the Oval Office the conditions under which he would invoke the law, Trump said “if it was necessary,” and speculated that he could use it to defy courts or state officials.“So far it hasn’t been necessary,” he said. “But we have an Insurrection Act for a reason. If I had to enact it, I’d do that. If people were getting killed and courts were holding us up or governors or mayors were holding us up, sure, I’d do that. I want to make sure that people aren’t killed. We have to make sure our cities are safe.”Court battle in Portland In Oregon, federal District Judge Karin Immergut broadened her order Sunday night barring the Trump administration from deploying any National Guard troops to Portland. The edict came after Trump and Hegseth defied a temporary restraining order that Immergut issued Saturday halting 200 Oregon National Guard troops from being sent there. Immergut was nominated by Trump in 2019 and confirmed by the U.S. Senate by voice vote.The administration maintains the Guard is needed to protect federal agents, as sustained small protests pop up outside an ICE facility 2 miles south of city hall. Kotek rebuffed Trump’s claims that the city is “on fire” and said local authorities are equipped to handle the demonstrations that lately range from a dozen or so people to roughly 100.Trump ordered 101 California National Guard troops to Portland overnight, without the knowledge of Kotek, she said Sunday. California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a fellow Democrat, confirmed that Trump had ordered up to 300 of his state’s National Guard troops to Oregon. Just before Immergut’s Sunday night emergency hearing, an Oregon assistant attorney general filed a memo with the court showing that Hegseth had ordered 400 Texas National Guard troops to Portland and Chicago.California joined Oregon and Portland in suing the administration.‘A domestic militarization’Pritzker said he has urged Texas Gov. Greg Abbott to “immediately withdraw his support for this decision and refuse to allow Texas National Guard members to be used in this way.”“Let me be clear, Donald Trump is using our service members as political props and as pawns in his illegal effort to militarize our nation’s cities,” Pritzker said at a press conference Monday afternoon.Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul said the deployment “is unfair to National Guardsmen, it is unfair to local law enforcement, and it is certainly unfair to the law-abiding citizens of Illinois who do not want to be subject to military occupation.”Chicago is nearly a month into a federal immigration crackdown. Dozens of federal agents raided an apartment building in the city’s South Shore neighborhood on Sept. 30, ziptying adults and children, and detaining some U.S. citizens, according to multiple media reports. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security published a highly produced video of the raid on social media.Trump’s federalization and deployment of National Guard troops to mostly Democratic-run states has alarmed political and constitutional experts. Pat Eddington, senior fellow in homeland and civil liberties at the libertarian Cato Institute, said he agrees with Pritzker’s concerns.“I share his belief 100% that the use of the American military and all these massive employment of ICE and HSI and FBI and marshals and the rest for ostensible immigration enforcement and ostensible crime control, it's really designed to lay the groundwork to normalize a militarization, essentially a domestic militarization of Americans, civic life,” Eddington told States Newsroom in an interview in late September.On a Monday afternoon press call, Hima Shansi, the head of the American Civil Liberties Union’s national security program, said Trump’s use of military and federal police forces in recent months “raises serious constitutional concerns in terms of federalism, the separation of powers between the federal government and the states which generally exercise police power.”“What that means in real-people language is that, as the states have been saying, they are fully capable of doing their jobs as needed, and there is absolutely no reason for the president to assert federal power in the way that he is forcibly doing.”Starting in Los AngelesTrump federalized California National Guard troops and deployed U.S. Marines to Los Angeles in June in response to protests against aggressive immigration enforcement there. Newsom objected to the plan and sued to stop the deployment. A federal judge initially sided with the Democratic governor and blocked the deployment, but an appeals panel reversed the decision. The trial court ruled again in September that Trump had overstepped the line separating military forces from law enforcement. The administration has appealed.While that case in California was ongoing, Trump also ordered the District of Columbia National Guard to assist local police in the nation’s capital. Because the district is a federal territory, it is relatively clear that move was within the president’s legal authority, even if many Trump critics questioned its necessity. National Guard troops from several Republican states also deployed to the district in a more legally dubious move.Trump also ordered Tennessee National Guard troops to Memphis last month, with the approval of the state’s Republican governor.Ashley Murray reported from Washington, D.C.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement plans to use a hub in Vermont to bolster its digital surveillance capabilities as the agency ramps up operations across the country at the direction of leaders in President Donald Trump’s administration.
According to federal contracting records, which were first reported by the technology magazine Wired, ICE plans to hire at least a dozen contracted workers for the effort at its National Criminal Analysis and Targeting Center, which is located in an unassuming business park in Williston. In addition, the agency would hire at least 16 contracted workers at a similar intelligence-gathering facility in Santa Ana, Calif. 
The Vermont center is off Industrial Avenue, located a short drive from Patrick Leahy Burlington International Airport. It is largely unmarked from the outside and, according to Wired, handles investigations from across the eastern part of the country.
Workers there already generate leads for ICE’s Office of Enforcement and Removal Operations, according to agency documents, compiling information field agents can then use to locate people ICE is targeting for deportation and other enforcement.

Draft plans published last week state, however, that ICE has had “limited success” using social media platforms and other information that’s available on the open web — which includes sites accessible to the public via search engines — for enforcement. The plans refer to an existing contractor though do not provide any specifics about it.
Under the latest plans, a contractor would use sites such as Facebook, Instagram and X — and could, in addition, use powerful online commercial, law enforcement and federal government databases — to generate leads about “individuals who pose a danger to national security, risk public safety or otherwise meet ICE enforcement priorities.” 
Details collected could include people’s social media posts and the locations tagged in them, according to the plans. The contractor could also be asked to find information about targeted people’s “associates,” including family members and coworkers, for the purpose of determining someone’s whereabouts, the plans from last week state.
The documents are a Request for Information, meaning the government is looking for details on the feasibility of its plan but is not yet actively soliciting contractors. Work on the plan could begin in May 2026, per the records. 
ICE’s media relations office did not immediately respond to a request for comment or additional information about its plans for contracted work at the Industrial Avenue office.
That location is just one of several ICE facilities in Vermont. They include another one close by in Williston, next to the Maple Tree Place shopping center, called its Law Enforcement Support Center. That office is ICE’s national hub for coordinating with other law enforcement agencies and also houses the infrastructure for a major tip line. 
ICE also has a field office in St. Albans where it holds mandatory meetings with people it is monitoring and, in at least one recent high-profile case, held someone the agency had previously arrested overnight.
The plans are not the first time ICE has sought contracts to bolster its surveillance operations. Earlier this year, for instance, the agency inked an agreement with Palantir Technologies, the firm co-founded by the billionaire Peter Thiel, to build software aimed at streamlining the process of identifying and deporting people the agency is targeting. The plan has faced sharp criticism from privacy and immigrant rights advocates.
James Duff Lyall, head of the American Civil Liberties Union of Vermont, said in an emailed statement Monday that the plans for the Williston office warranted greater scrutiny to ensure they would not undermine people’s privacy.
“Any increase in ICE presence or activity must be scrutinized, given the agency’s long history of abuse, lack of accountability, and disregard for our constitutional rights,” Lyall said. “That includes its reported expansion of digital surveillance efforts, a project which will be staffed in our own backyard and will involve surveilling the online activity of large swaths of the general public.”

 What happened?

A Waukesha County judge on Friday ordered the Wisconsin Elections Commission to determine whether any noncitizens are registered to vote and to stop accepting voter registrations without verifying that the applicant is a U.S. citizen.
 What’s the dispute?

A Pewaukee resident, represented by conservative attorneys, filed a lawsuit last year seeking to require the election commission to verify citizenship of registered voters and applicants. The suit also sought to force the Wisconsin Department of Transportation to compare its citizenship information against voter rolls.
The election commission opposed the initial request, saying that no state law called for requiring documented proof of citizenship. It also argued that the DOT has no obligation to match citizenship data with voter records.
Waukesha County Circuit Court Judge Michael Maxwell rejected the commission’s argument, saying that the agency is failing in its duty to ensure that only lawful voters make it to the voter roll. He cited several statutes that he said made clear that only citizens could cast a ballot.
Maxwell didn’t specify how the election commission and local clerks should verify citizenship of new registrants, or how the commission should check for noncitizens on the voter rolls. He only called for the parties to figure out a plan, whether that be through matching the DOT’s citizenship data or using “other lawfully available means.” He called for that process to be substantially completed before the next statewide election, which is February.
Currently, applicants for voter registration in Wisconsin and most other states must attest, under penalty of perjury, that they are U.S. citizens who are eligible to vote, but they are not required to present proof of citizenship.
The issue of noncitizen voting has been hotly debated in recent years, though no widespread instances have been found. Republicans have used the concern to call for citizenship proof checks of all voters, even as data shows that such measures risk disenfranchising some U.S. citizens.
Republicans praised the decision, with state Rep. Amanda Nedweski calling it a “great win for election integrity.”
Democrats and the respondents in the case were largely mum.
Election commission spokesperson Emilee Miklas didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Riley Vetterkind, a spokesperson for the Wisconsin Department of Justice, which represents the commission and Department of Transportation, declined to say whether the agencies would appeal the decision.
 Who are the parties? 

The current plaintiffs, Pewaukee resident Ardis Cerny and Waukesha resident Annette Kuglitsch, sued the election commission, Department of Transportation, and officials in both agencies. They have argued that the election commission is violating their voting rights by not checking for noncitizens already registered to vote and seeking to vote.
Maxwell agreed, saying they “have a clear legal right to not have their votes diluted by a non-citizen casting an unlawful ballot.”
 What happens now? 

It’s unclear how the commission would verify the citizenship of all of Wisconsin’s registered voters by February. Bryna Godar, a staff attorney at the University of Wisconsin Law School’s State Democracy Research Initiative, said the decision will “definitely be appealed” and that the lower-court decision could be stayed while the appeal goes through the courts.
If the case reaches the Wisconsin Supreme Court, the liberal majority could overturn the order of the conservative-leaning Waukesha County Circuit Court.

Robert Craven is ceding his position as chairman of the powerful House Committee on Judiciary and intends to leave politics altogether after his term ends next year.
Rep. Robert Craven bows out of Rhode Island Attorney General race

Craven, a North Kingstown Democrat, said in a statement issued Monday afternoon his decision to step aside was in the best interest of his family. He has led the 15-member panel responsible for shaping the state’s penal code and judicial system since the start of the 2019 legislative session.
“Through seven years as chair, I was privileged to shepherd issues like women’s reproductive health, gun safety and the environment that matter deeply to Rhode Islanders,” he said in a statement. “While I will continue to serve the people of North Kingstown through the end of my term, I will not seek re-election.”
Craven, 69, launched his long-planned campaign for attorney general of Rhode Island on Sept. 29, but ended his run on Thursday, Oct. 2, amid renewed scrutiny of domestic assault charges from two decades ago.
The charges have since been expunged, but Craven in his statement Monday alluded to how the focus on his past has personally affected him.
“Many people have reached out to me over the past few days,” he said. “Some I know from my work as a representative, others are colleagues in the law, friends, and some are strangers who are on their own journey of hope and redemption. I am grateful for their support and understanding as I continue on my own personal journey.”
House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi did not immediately comment on Craven’s decision.
Craven, who works as an attorney in his private practice in North Kingstown, was first elected to represent House District 32 in 2012.

Steve Daines recently opined that he believes the drug mifepristone is not safe, while providing nothing but a debunked study.On Sept. 23, the Helena Independent Record published an opinion piece by Montana’s Republican Sen. Steve Daines,  “The abortion pill is harmful to women.” 
Mifepristone, nicknamed “the abortion pill,” is the medicine that Daines is attacking. In the United States and globally, mifepristone is widely used, particularly for medication abortions. Its use has increased steadily through the years, though access and usage statistics differ by country and region. Mifepristone is also used for other medical conditions, like managing miscarriages and treating Cushing’s syndrome. Mifepristone has been approved for use in nearly 100 countries as of mid-2023.
On several points Daines is wrong and giving incorrect information about the drug. First, he states, “In 2000, the FDA required three in-person doctor appointments for mifepristone. Today none are required. Pills can be dispensed by mail and sold at drugstores lie Walgreens and CVS without any medical oversight.” This is blatantly not true. Mifepristone cannot be purchased without a prescription because it is a restricted medication under the FDA’s Mifepristone REMS Program, requiring a prescription from a certified healthcare provider or a certified pharmacy to dispense. Although telemedicine and mail-order options are available in some states, a valid prescription is still necessary to obtain the medication safely and legally from these certified providers or pharmacies. 
Daines cites a study created by the Ethics and Public Policy Center as the basis of his criticism of the use of the drug. The study’s authors, Jamie Bryan Hall, EPPC’s director of data analysis, and Ryan Anderson, the organization’s president, are not health experts, and neither seems to have a record of publishing scientific research through peer review. Their methods deviated wildly from what is standard in the world of health research, and so, predictably, did their conclusions: In sharp contrast to dozens of trials conducted around the globe over decades, the EPPC report determined that mifepristone is a danger to women. 
The study lacks basic transparency about how that assessment was made. The authors relied on data from an insurance database that, according to the report, included more than 800,000 mifepristone abortions from 2017 to 2023. But the authors don’t actually say which database they used, so there’s no way for anybody to try to re-create their analysis to see if they receive the same results. The report also took some peculiar methodological steps to arrive at its conclusions.
The authors counted episodes in which a surgical procedure was required to complete the abortion after mifepristone—patients require additional treatment in about 1-in-20 cases, so the FDA considers this a recognized outcome rather than an adverse effect. They counted “other life-threatening adverse events,” including heart problems and mental-health concerns, that women in the study experienced in the weeks after the abortion—which may have had nothing to do with mifepristone. The authors did not effectively distinguish between the outcomes of abortions and of miscarriages treated with mifepristone, or between normal amounts of post-abortion bleeding and severe hemorrhage.
In short, the report is not a study in the traditional sense and not conclusive proof of anything. Daines is following the lead of Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., in using pseudo-scientific studies and their bogus conclusions to further a political agenda. Once again, the so called “smaller government” Republican Senator wants to have the government intrude into women’s personal moral and medical decisions, to create a situation where, as he puts it, “abortion is unthinkable.” He also states that he will “continue to work with the administration to protect women and fight for the most vulnerable in our society.” If you’re pre-natal, he’s your protector. If you’re pre-school, you’re on your own.
Sen. Daines, please explain to us how interfering in the very personal medical and moral decisions that women may have to make protects them? From whom are you protecting them? Big Pharma? Or themselves? 
Meanwhile, Daines regularly votes against any legislation that would bring expanded aid or relief to people who are struggling to survive on incomes below the poverty level or expand medical insurance or coverage. He has consistently voted against legislation like the Women’s Health Protection Act, and for tax breaks for Big Pharma and other corporations who benefit from our current dysfunctional health system. So much for being a “champion of the poor and oppressed, women and children.”

The latest report on disciplinary action involving Vermont State Police troopers reveals one officer facing a sexual harassment investigation has resigned. 
The twice-yearly report released Thursday from the Vermont Department of Public Safety and the State Police Advisory Commission covers the period July 1–Dec. 31, 2024.
The State Police Advisory Commission, according to its website, provides “advice and counsel” to the public safety commissioner on misconduct allegations that lead to internal investigations against Vermont State Police members.
In total, the report lists four incidents of alleged misconduct, with three of them leading to “unfounded” determinations.
The identities of the troopers, as well as identifying details of the incidents, are withheld because internal affairs investigations are confidential by law.
The reports provide only brief descriptions about the nature of each incident and alleged violation, leading to complaints that not much can be learned from them.
There are times when the identities of troopers involved in alleged misconduct do become public, particularly when criminal charges are filed. 
One incident covered by the latest report involved an allegation that a state police officer violated the sexual harassment policy. 
“The member resigned before the completed investigation could be reviewed and adjudicated by the Commissioner of the Department of Public Safety,” the report added.
Two other incidents listed in the report involved state police internal reviews of shootings to determine whether the officers involved complied with use-of-force policies. In both instances, the cases followed separate reviews by the Vermont Attorney General’s Office and the relevant state’s attorney’s offices.
According to the report, the actions by the state police members were “determined to meet use of force policy standards.” 
The fourth incident, which the report stated was determined to be “unfounded,” involved an allegation that a state trooper had violated an out-of-state fish and wildlife regulation.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-06 20:44:43+00:00,CT Mirror,"CT faith leaders, advocates press lawmakers to protect immigrants",Laura Tillman,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/06/ct-rally-immigrant-safety/,"Faith leaders and immigrant advocates held a rally Monday outside the Capitol, urging CT lawmakers to prioritize immigrant safety.","As state legislators inside the Capitol in Hartford discussed the possibility of a special session on Monday, faith leaders and immigrant advocates rallied outside the building,  urging the lawmakers to prioritize immigrant safety.
The large crowd had marched from the federal courthouse to the Capitol for their rally, with signs that read “Hands Off Our Neighbors” and “Gov. Lamont: Immigrant Protections Can’t Wait” and chanting “No hate! No fear! Immigrants are welcome here!”
In recent months, Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, often wearing masks, have detained people across Connecticut, at federal courthouses, carwashes, and from their vehicles.
Many of the speakers at Monday’s rally were faith leaders in Connecticut. Reverend Josh Pawelek of the Unitarian Universalist Society East in Manchester, said that he, along with many advocates at the rally, had worked hard to put protections for immigrants into an updated version of the TRUST Act when lawmakers were in session earlier this year.
“It was infuriating when the bill that we wanted got out of the Judiciary Committee and then just got watered down. And so many of the good things that were in that bill — the things that immigrants needed to be safe in our state — went away in that strange way that laws get made in Connecticut,” Pawelek said. 
Pawelek urged those gathered to scan a QR code distributed on flyers through the crowd that would link them to a page to write to lawmakers.
Sen. Matt Lesser, D-Middletown, also spoke at the rally. In his district, an August raid by masked ICE agents took place at a Newington car wash. Lesser said the state has the ability to better protect immigrants, but, “we need strong laws that apply equally to anyone who is depriving the civil rights of anyone in this state. Connecticut can play an important role, but we have a choice to make. And I’m hoping we do so soon.”
After the rally ended, Lesser said there are two schools of thought among lawmakers inside the Capitol: “One that Connecticut should take a more confrontational approach, and one that we should keep our heads down.” While Lesser said he understands why some lawmakers favor a more passive approach, “I just don’t think that’s going to work, I don’t think that’s how you stop a bully.”
Constanza Segovia, one of the leaders of Hartford Deportation Defense, also spoke at Monday’s rally. She updated the crowd on the case of Victor Sanchez, an activist with Make the Road and HDD, who was detained  in September when he arrived to federal court for a routine check-in.
“I have amazing news to share with you all,” Segovia said, announcing that Sanchez had been released from detention. But that news was tempered by the stipulation that Sanchez was given just 30 days to leave the country. 
Segovia said her group planned to keep fighting for Sanchez to be able to stay in the U.S. She also read some words in both Spanish and English from Sanchez, who said he was blessed to be a member of the community.  
“When I was in detention, I talked to people who didn’t have anything — no documents, prepared in packets, no communities or organizations rallying in support. The reason I am here today is because of all of my community support and the organizing of my community. That people united will never be defeated.” 
Segovia told those gathered that lawmakers should act on several concerns the immigrant community has: “We need to protect our personal information from the federal government. Am I right? We need to protect our communities and make sure that our tax dollars are not being spent to assist immigration enforcement in Connecticut.” 
Segovia also said that funding should be directed so that no one, regardless of immigration status, loses Medicaid coverage or access to food assistance programs.
Judiciary Committee Co-chair Rep. Steve Stafstrom, D-Bridgeport, said in an interview that lawmakers would continue to look for ways to support immigrants in Connecticut, if given the opportunity during a special session, which must be called by Gov. Ned Lamont. “We’ll continue to try and do what we can to make sure people feel safe in our state, despite the threatening and frankly harassment coming from the federal government,” he said.
In September, the judicial branch issued a new policy to ban federal agents from making immigration related arrests inside of Connecticut courthouses without a judicial warrant or signed order. The policy also bans mask-wearing inside of courthouses, unless the mask is medically necessary and has received prior authorization from a judicial authority.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_4934-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-06 16:59:46.927655

Aerospace engineering is a challenge for anyone—and as a first-generation college student, Maria faced additional hurdles. With strength, hard work and the support of community, Maria persevered. Now, she’s carving out a career as an aerospace engineer. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Protons to planes: Maria Tye turns a love of chemistry into a career i[...]","Maria was in high school when she first heard the words “chemical engineering.” She remembers that she did really well in chemistry class that year… so well, that her teacher suggested she think about studying chemical engineering in college. “It sounded fun and challenging and like something that would be economically sound,” Maria remembers. She was good at math and knew she wanted to build a stable future. “We went through some tough times when I was a kid and I wanted things to be different.” 
Maria’s now working as a project engineer at Amphenol Aerospace, a company that develops electrical connectors for aerospace vehicles. Her work focuses mainly on the commercial side. She’s been part of projects tied to the growing industry of electric aircraft.
“Every day is different,” she says. “As a chemical engineer, we end up in a variety of positions. The skills are transferable because of the depth of the studies. You depend on your team members. You learn a lot about networking. It transfers quite a bit into the workplace.”
Staying grounded with the support of family and the outdoors
Maria’s path to engineering started far from aerospace. Maria is the second youngest in a family of seven kids. When she was little, her family lived in Texas. She was only 5 years old when her family lost most of their belongings in a fire. That’s when they decided to relocate to Vermont. It took a few years for the family to get back on their feet; Maria was in eighth grade when her parents proudly bought their first house in South Burlington.
“Mom started working again when my youngest sibling started school. We had state support and lots of help,” she says. 
“My parents still have this massive table that they got as a donation from someone to help them get on their feet. Everyone still gathers around it, but we don’t fit sitting down anymore,” she laughs. Along with her siblings and their partners, there are 11 nieces and nephews. “There’s always a ton of people around.”
Maria was quiet and studious as a child; she received extensive support from her teachers. In middle school, she struggled with homework until a teacher challenged her. “She told me I could get into a higher math class early if I could get my homework done. That motivated me.”
Books and libraries were a constant. “I’ve always been a big bookworm. I read all the time and I loved the library.” 
She also found joy outdoors, with summers spent working for the Vermont Youth Conservation Corps. “I worked and did four weeks living out in the woods, then did seven weeks the next summer because I liked it so much. I like hiking a lot. I wish I did more of it as an adult,” she laughs. 
Finding her way with the help of VSAC
College was not a given for Maria. Neither of her parents had gone—her mom didn’t finish high school—and while her parents encouraged her, they were anxious about costs. “They had no clue. They didn’t know a credit score was involved,” she says. 
That’s where VSAC came in. Through VSAC’s Talent Search and GEAR UP career and college readiness programs, she connected with Outreach Counselors Matt “Beagle” Bourgault and Nancy Schwartz. “They helped with college tours and with understanding the requirements of the paperwork. I still have a professional email because Beagle let me know ‘Tinkerbell’ wasn’t the best email to have on my college applications,” she laughs.
She learned to make her own appointments, gather information, and advocate for herself. “VSAC helped me with the grant programs and timelines, and the “how” of looking at colleges. They’d meet me in the library and go over things, checking on everything, and asking me about my aspirations. They were there to help students like me who needed the extra help. And, they helped me look at what degrees could get me where I wanted to be.”
When it came time to choose, Clarkson University rose to the top. “It was the only college I could find that had chemical engineering. It was a good engineering school. I had a gut feeling in my research, so I applied and was so excited when I was accepted.”
Financing Clarkson, however, was a constant challenge. “My parents’ credit score wasn’t good enough to help me get the loans I needed. We didn’t realize that would be an issue. I almost didn’t finish college because of it.” 
Her grandparents helped her first semester, then a friend’s parent stepped in and cosigned a loan for her. “I ran track and field with this friend, and their parent stepped in to help me. It was really a miracle and it got me through until my uncle could help. It was a real motivator for me too, I was determined to do good enough that I didn’t fail them.”
A few years after graduating, she paid off that loan. “Getting that loan was so hard…I almost couldn’t see a way to finish college that one year until I got that help. It’s amazing to think I’ve actually paid the loan off.”
Learning to lean on her peers
College pushed Maria academically and socially. “It forced me to be social. I was more of an independent, older-than-my-years kind of person in high school. Clarkson broadened my horizons.”
She leaned on peers to get through the difficult program. “You can’t survive that degree at Clarkson without leaning on your peers. You learn networking and teamwork.”
But she also struggled. “I had some struggles with mental health that I really had to work through. It was close—I was close to thinking I might not graduate.”
She joined Alpha Phi Omega, a co-ed fraternity focused on community service, and also worked a few on campus jobs. Over the summer, she took a job in manufacturing. “I did a lot of sheet metal work—finishing and minor operations–on industrial kitchen appliances. I wanted to DO the hard stuff. A lot of people don’t have an eye into manufacturing, and I think it’s really helped me.”
Graduation was a family affair. “My parents and mi abuela were there, and my uncle was there. I showed them around campus. It was surreal.”
Building a career
Maria’s first job after Clarkson was as an operator in circuit board etching at an aerospace manufacturer. She stayed in aerospace, but moved into environmental engineering, then product engineering and operations program management.
Eventually she landed at Amphenol Aerospace, where she works today. “I bridge the gap between various disciplines and focus on new products. Every day is different.” 
Outside of work, Maria’s personal life has also taken flight with her partner Gerald, whom she’s been with for 12 years. They met at Clarkson, and he also works in the aerospace industry, but on the computer engineering side.
Looking back, moving forward
Reflecting on her journey, Maria is clear: VSAC made the difference. “I wouldn’t have made it without them. Having that person who has faith in you, it was everything. I wouldn’t have understood all the details, gotten to see the colleges, or what the environment would be like. And the value of meeting other students in similar positions was huge. There were a lot of other first-gen students I met through VSAC. All of us did remarkable things to get where we did.”
Maria is proud of where she is today. She’s in a stable, challenging career that excites her, with the tools to support herself and her health. “I work a decent job and can afford the medical support and the counseling. It’s still a work in progress, but supporting myself in that way has been fantastic. And my job? Every day is unique and fun and interesting. I’m proud of where I’ve gotten. And I know I didn’t get here alone.”

(Screenshot from video from James Uthmeier's X account)Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier led 21 states in a brief filed with the U.S. Supreme Court Monday supporting a Tallahassee mother who claimed her rights were violated when a local middle school created a secret plan supporting her child switching genders.
Uthmeier’s lengthy letter of support is the latest turn of legal events involving January Littlejohn, now a banner for parental rights in GOP Circles, and her then-13-year-old child who attended a gender-support meeting at Deerlake Middle School in 2020 that school staff allegedly intentionally kept secret from Littlejohn. They followed the policy laid out in the district’s LGBTQ+ guide dissuading teachers from “outing” students to their parents.
“Parental rights have taken on new focus as an ever-growing number of public-school officials are placing it upon themselves to make life-altering decisions for children in place of, or in direct conflict with, parents’ convictions,” Uthmeier wrote in the friend of the court brief, joined by 21 other states.
“That unfortunate phenomenon is front and center in this case,” he continued, criticizing school officials for hiding the “social transition” from the Littlejohns. “This sort of intervention is highly destructive and can lead to permanent damage to the child’s mental and physical health.”
Now a prominent speaker for the right-wing Moms for Liberty organization and the inspiration for Florida’s so-called “Don’t Say Gay” law, Littlejohn in 2021 took her case against Leon County Schools to state and federal courts, although she was rejected at every turn.
In March of this year, a three-judge federal appeals panel ruled against her because the district’s actions, though Littlejohn disagreed with them, did not “shock the conscience.” This legal precedent determines whether egregious misconduct violated a person’s rights. Littlejohn attempted in July to have the court rehear her case, but it quietly dismissed it.
“Defendants did not force the Littlejohns’ child to do anything at all. And perhaps most importantly, defendants did not act with intent to injure,” Judge Robin Rosenbaum of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit wrote in the March opinion. “To the contrary, they sought to help the child.”
January Littlejohn holds a sign reading, “It’s time to take about detransition.” (Via January Littlejohn’s Facebook, Sep. 22, 2025)
Littlejohn’s outrage quickly sparked statewide attention. The GOP-dominated Legislature responded by ushering in the 2022 “Don’t Say Gay” law, which banned teachers from discussing sexuality with students and allowed parents to sue school districts over curriculum they deemed inappropriate.
In March, Littlejohn was First Lady Melania Trump’s special guest at President Donald Trump’s joint session to Congress. Trump lauded her as a “courageous advocate” for parental rights, and claimed cases like hers are why he signed a January executive order blocking funds for schools promoting “gender ideology.”
Similar cases have cropped up nationwide. The U.S. Supreme Court is considering a nearly-identical case out of Massachusetts, in which an 11-year-old’s parents were allegedly kept in the dark when the school helped the child socially transition. Tammy Fournier, a Wisconsin mother who successfully sued when her 12-year-old’s school “refused” to refer to the child as female, filed her own letter in support of Littlejohn on Monday.
Other supporters who have filed briefs supporting Littlejohn include 10 conservative organizations and a transgender psychologist who has warned against helping minors transition.
What happened?
Littlejohn’s 13-year-old child, born female, asked to be referred to by a male name with they/them pronouns ahead of the 2020-2021 school year. Littlejohn told the child’s teacher that the school could use the nickname “J,” but she didn’t want staff using different pronouns for her child.
According to emails obtained by The Tallahassee Democrat, Littlejohn told the teacher that, “If she wants to go by the name (redacted) with her teachers, I won’t stop her.” Littlejohn added that they did not use the male name at home.
The school later called a meeting with the school counselor, staff, and the child to create a Student Support Plan to help socially transition the child. Per district law, the school did not tell the Littlejohns about the plan, nor did they release the details in the following months.
This came from Leon County’s LGBTQ+ guide warning staff against telling parents if their child was not heterosexual, because “[o]uting a student, especially to parents, can be very dangerous to the student’s health and well-being.”
The Littlejohns sued in federal court, which case was promptly dismissed, and then in a federal appeals court, hoping to receive financial damages and ban the LGBTQ+ guide. The three-judge panel sided against the parents in March and refused to hear the case again in July.
On Sep. 3, the Littlejohns filed an appeal with the U.S. Supreme Court questioning whether a court can deny relief for a violation of a “fundamental right” if the infringement did not “shock the conscience.” The case bounces off of the Massachusetts case, which asks the Supreme Court to decide whether a public school “violates parents’ fundamental constitutional right” when it secretly helps “transition” their child to a new gender.
The letter of support submitted by Uthmeier was co-signed by the attorneys general of Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, and Texas. They were joined by Arizona’s Speaker of the House and Senate President.

This story by Clare Shanahan was first published in the Valley News on Oct. 4, 2025.
WINDSOR — Three Vermont school districts in the Upper Valley say they are willing to become one.
The Mountain Views Supervisory Union, Hartford School District and Windsor Southeast Supervisory Union presented a letter to a state task force on Sept. 29 indicating they are open to being combined into one educational unit.
Merging “will be a practical and effective path to meeting the state’s goals while protecting our communities and ensuring the long-term sustainability of our schools,” read letter read, which was signed by members of all three boards.
The school redistricting task force formed in July following the passage of Act 73, an education reform bill. The 11-member group includes state Rep. Rebecca Holcombe, D-Norwich, and Jay Badams, a recently-retired SAU 70 superintendent who lives in Strafford.

The group is charged with redrawing Vermont’s school districts so each has between 4,000 and 8,000 students. Together, the three districts would have about 3,700 students, which is close to the minimum target size of 4,000, said Keri Bristow, chair of the Mountain Views school board. 
Members of the three school boards held a special meeting Sept. 18 to discuss the possibility of partnering in the face of the impending changes.
State Rep. Elizabeth Burrows, D-West Windsor, who also serves on the Windsor Southeast Supervisory Union School Board, reached out to the other boards to invite them to the meeting. Windsor Southeast includes students from Windsor, West Windsor, Hartland and Weathersfield.
Burrows called the situation an “informal meeting with an informal outcome” in a Friday email. She said the meeting “simply asked whether it was a good idea in principle to talk about working together.”
While the task force works on creating three options for school district maps by Dec. 1, the local boards wanted to get involved in the conversation.
“I personally don’t believe that any of the three parties agree with Act 73, but if we are left with no choice after the maps are drawn, we wanted to show our willingness to work together,” Hartford School board member Jeremy Warren said in an email.
Warren helped to draft the letter along with Davis McGraw of Windsor Southeast and Bristow and Carin Park of Mountain Views.
Personally, Warren said he is not a fan of Act 73 and “won’t be shy” about saying it. His preference would be to not have “other people’s voices in the town of Hartford,” but said it seems inevitable.
Bristow, of Mountain Views, attended a meeting of the state task force last Monday and read the Upper Valley boards’ letter to the group. The three districts would make good partners because they “have similar educational goals, share a Career and Technical Center (the Hartford Area Career and Technical Center), and are geographically aligned,” according to the letter.
The districts have common curriculum priorities, especially in math and literacy, Bristow added in a Thursday interview. A key goal in all three districts is to have students graduate “career and college ready.”
The Mountain Views Supervisory Union includes Woodstock, Barnard, Bridgewater and Pomfret in the Upper Valley, as well as three other Vermont towns.
“We just feel that we are natural partners, even though we are rivals on our sports teams,” Bristow said.
The districts already pull from some of the same student populations, Bristow noted. For example, some students in Hartland and Weathersfield, which are part of Windsor Southeast and offer choice for high school, choose to attend Woodstock or Hartford high schools. Bristow said in a future district she would like Woodstock to host a “regional hub school,” which is one of the benefits of this possible partnership.
She said it seems like a reasonable choice for the supervisory unions and district to come together and center around Woodstock because Mountain Views Supervisory Union has already invested millions of dollars in planning, permitting and design for a new middle-high school and it would take minimal changes to accommodate a larger student population.
Voters in Woodstock rejected a controversial $99 million bond to construct the new middle and high school building in 2024. The supervisory union will likely try to put together a new bond for next March, Bristow said.
The proposed union of the three districts aligns closely with a proposal presented at a Monday meeting of the school redistricting task force. At the meeting, the group discussed a map that would create 14 school districts based around Vermont’s Career and Technical Centers. It was the first time the committee reviewed a proposed map.
The proposed map creates a cluster around the Hartford Area Career and Technical Center, which includes the three school districts and Norwich, which is part of the Dresden Interstate School District.
Hartford’s Warren said the tech center map was “maybe a glimmer of hope personally for me because I think that was at least one map that made a little more sense” than other options that have been thrown around.
Still, some of the many questions that remain in the redistricting process include what will happen to programs that cross borders or to Vermont’s interstate school districts such as Rivendell Interstate School District, which is comprised of the towns of Orford, Fairlee, West Fairlee and Vershire, or Dresden School District, which oversees schools in Hanover and Norwich.
“We have other questions: what do we do with our neighboring towns across the river that also utilize our career and technical center?” Warren asked. “We definitely want to serve those people as well because they’re part of our neighborhood.”

(Photo: John Partipilo/  Tennessee Lookout)NASHVILLE – A federal judge in Nashville ruled that there is a “realistic likelihood” that the government behaved vindictively in bringing human smuggling charges against Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Maryland man wrongly deported to El Salvador before being brought to Tennessee in June to face criminal charges.
The 16-page ruling by U.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw on Friday opens the door for Abrego’s attorneys to seek documents and testimony from Trump administration officials about their public remarks in the case and the basis of their decision to bring criminal charges. 
Crenshaw noted that the government has repeatedly been thwarted in its months-long efforts to deport Abrego in one of the earliest – and highest profile – tests of the Trump administration’s mass deportation tactics.
“This has created a significant burden on and embarrassment to the Executive Branch, that must now expend additional time, resources, and international goodwill to remove Abrego to El Salvador or elsewhere,” he wrote.
Prosecutors: no ‘ill will’ in Tennessee criminal prosecution of Kilmar Abrego Garcia

Abrego, as he is identified in the Tennessee case, illegally entered the United States as a teen and worked as an apprentice sheet metal worker in Maryland. The 30-year-old married father was deported in March despite a standing stay of deportation issued in 2019 by an immigration judge. A federal prosecutor who admitted Abrego’s deportation was in error was fired after his statements and has since filed a claim of retaliation. 
Abrego currently faces potential deportation to the African country of Eswatini, government officials have told his attorneys. He is due to return to a Maryland court in that case on Friday.
In granting Abrego’s request to proceed with allegations the government behaved improperly, Crenshaw highlighted the timeline of official actions leading up to Abrego’s criminal charges in Tennessee as evidence of “potential unreasonableness of the prosecution.”
Abrego was deported on March 15 after a routine Maryland traffic stop. Nine days later, attorneys for Abrego successfully filed suit in a Maryland federal court challenging the deportation in a decision the government appealed. The Supreme Court concurred with the decision. 
Crenshaw noted that within “mere days” of the Supreme Court decision, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security reopened an investigation into a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee, which resulted in neither a ticket nor an arrest at the time.
The government brought charges against Abrego less than a month after it started its reopened investigation — a remarkably swift investigation. A grand jury returned a two-count indictment a month later and Abrego was returned to Nashville to face charges. He has since been released pending trial and remains in the custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Abrego has pleaded not guilty to the charges.
Kilmar Abrego Garcia attorneys seek to dismiss Tennessee case as ‘vindictive prosecution’

On the day of his indictment, Homeland Security Secretary Pam Bondi and others “celebrated the criminal charges against him” and said he would be found guilty, sentenced and deported again to El Salvador, Crenshaw wrote.
“Most tellingly,” the judge wrote, Homeland Security Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche revealed that the government started investigating Abrego after a judge in Maryland questioned the government’s decision, found that it had no right to deport him and accused the government of wrongdoing.
“Deputy Attorney General Blanche’s remarkable statements could directly establish the motivations for Abrego’s criminal charges stem from his exercise of constitutional and statutory rights to bring suit against the (federal government), rather than a genuine desire to prosecute him for alleged criminal misconduct,” Crenshaw wrote.
Prosecutors have denied that the government has acted with any “ill will” in the case.”
Crenshaw’s order contains no final conclusions on whether the case against Abrego should be dismissed due to vindictive prosecution, but instead greenlights a request by Abrego’s attorneys to proceed with collecting evidence to present at an evidentiary hearing. No date for the hearing has been set.

(Photo via Google Earth)A southwest Iowa nursing home cited for more than two dozen regulatory violations this year has been added to the federal government’s list of the nation’s worst care facilities.
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has added the Garden View Care Center in Shenandoah to its list of Special-Focus Facilities.
In February 2025, state inspectors cited Garden View for 15 federal violations, including failure to meet professional standards, overall quality of care, insufficient nursing staff, a lack of competent nursing staff, infection-control issues and the use of unnecessary drugs.
Inspectors reported that on Feb. 12, 2025, the home, which had 37 residents, had no nurse on duty in the afternoon, and no one on staff certified to provide CPR if needed. A worker explained that a nurse from a temp agency had reported for work at 6 p.m. on Feb. 11, and remained on duty until roughly 2 p.m. Feb. 12, when she was told to go to the hotel where she was staying and get a few hours of sleep before reporting back for work at around 5 p.m.
The nurse’s departure allegedly left the home without a nurse in the building for three hours, despite the presence of several high-risk residents, including individuals who were on dialysis or needed airway suctioning or had COVID-19. “The administrator told staff he is a nurse but not currently licensed,” the inspectors wrote in their report.
State records indicate no fines or penalties were imposed as a result of the inspectors’ findings.
In April 2025, state inspectors returned and cited the home for 11 additional violations related to abuse-and-neglect policies, resident discharges, pharmacy services, medication errors, food quality and infection control. Again, no fines or penalties were imposed.
In the fall of 2021, CMS added Garden View to its special-focus eligibility list after the home was cited for 23 regulatory violations and fined $306,335 by the federal government. According to inspectors’ reports, the staff had withheld one woman’s dinner, with one worker telling a colleague the woman had no right to a meal because of how big she was. Another employee allegedly reported seeing a coworker pull a woman out of a room and drag her backward across the floor into another room while cursing at the resident.
In 2024, the state proposed, but held in suspension, $47,500 in fines against the home for inadequate staffing and the physical and verbal abuse of residents.
According to state inspectors, the home’s director of nursing informed them she was being pressured by management to cut staff due to budget constraints, adding that she felt doing so was “unsafe.”
Between October 2022 and July 2024, CMS imposed $241,479 in federal fines against the facility. Garden View is currently owned by a for-profit, limited liability company called Greenside Healthcare Properties, according to CMS.
Current CMS list includes some errors 
At any given time, no more than two nursing homes per state appear on CMS’ list of federally designated Special-Focus Facilities, although the list also includes hundreds of other nursing homes — typically, 10 per state — where ongoing quality-of-care violations have made them eligible for that status.
Once a home is designated a Special-Focus Facility, it receives additional oversight and assistance from the government that’s intended to improve resident care. The other homes that are merely deemed eligible do not receive that assistance. They appear on the list, some for as long as 10 years, and then drop off without ever receiving the federal help.
In addition to Garden View, the other Iowa care facility currently designated a Special-Focus Facility is Pine Acres Rehabilitation and Care Center in West Des Moines.
However, CMS’ latest Special-Focus Facilities list, published by the agency on Sept. 24, 2025, appears to include several errors. Garden View, for example, is listed not only as one of Iowa’s two special-focus facilities, but also as one of Iowa’s 10 care facilities that are eligible for the status without actually being enrolled in the program.
Although CMS did not respond Monday to inquiries about discrepancies in its list, possibly due to the federal government shutdown, it appears the list of Iowa facilities with “eligible” status has not been revised or updated since July.
The data from CMS suggests Garden View has taken the place of Aspire of Gowrie in the list of special-focus facilities. The Gowrie home had been in the special-focus program for at least 22 months without graduating before it closed on July 23, 2025.
As for the Iowa facilities whose quality-of-care issues make them eligible for special-focus status, the two most recently added homes are The Ivy at Davenport, located in Scott County, and Parkview Manor in Reinbeck. Both were added to the list in July, although the new list suggests they made their debut on the list in late September.
And while The Ivy at Davenport has been on the list continuously only since July, that’s because the home was inexplicably dropped from the list, for one month, in June. In May, the home had logged its 20th straight month on the eligibility list. So while the current list suggests The Ivy has been eligible for special-focus status for only one month, it has actually been eligible for the better part of two years.
The other Iowa homes on the eligibility list, and the corrected number of consecutive months they’ve appeared on the list, are:
— Greater Southside Health and Rehabilitation Center in Des Moines, 38 months.
— Harmony West Nursing and Rehabilitation Center in West Des Moines, 23 months.
— Harvest Acres Nursing and Rehabilitation Center in Keota, eight months.
— Clarion Wellness and Rehabilitation Center, seven months.
— Caring Acres Nursing and Rehabilitation Center in Anita, five months.
— Pioneer Valley Living and Rehabilitation Center, Sergeant Bluff, four months.
— Aspire of Washington, four months.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Gardebn-View-Care-Center.jpg,,,2025-10-06 16:59:46.927655

The office is asking for patient medical records, incident reports, “adverse event documentation” and communications about patient care, according to court records. Also requested through a subpoena were operational and clinical protocols, equipment patient records, contractual arrangements and documentation of compliance. 
“Despite the Missouri attorney general’s blatant attempts to overturn the will of the people, all patients expect and have the right for their medical records to be private,” leadership with Planned Parenthood Great Plains, Planned Parenthood Great Rivers and the ACLU of Missouri said in a joint statement. “Politicians have no place in the exam room with patients and their medical providers, and that’s why we will keep fighting for patients and their rights.”
The attorney general’s office, newly under the leadership of Catherine Hanaway, did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday. 
The Missouri Attorney General’s Office also subpoenaed two former Planned Parenthood Great Rivers board members, one physician contracted by Planned Parenthood Great Rivers and the chief medical officer of Planned Parenthood Great Plains, who was handed a subpoena during recess of a court hearing related to abortion access on Sept. 10.
“This is nothing more than an attempt to harass (Planned Parenthood) and should not be permitted by the court,” attorneys for the clinics wrote in a court filing asking Jackson County Circuit Judge Jerri Zhang to throw out the subpoenas. 
Last November, Missourians voted to codify the right to reproductive health care, including abortion up to the point of fetal viability, in the state constitution. A day later, Planned Parenthood and the ACLU of Missouri sued the state in an effort to take down several abortion regulations that remain part of state statute, arguing that those regulations are now unconstitutional because they burden abortion patients and providers. 
Missouri secretary of state submits second attempt at abortion ban ballot language

That lawsuit is set to go to trial in January. Until then, Zhang temporarily enjoined — or struck down — some of the regulations, allowing Planned Parenthood to begin offering procedural abortions again. 
Planned Parenthood is also awaiting a decision from Zhang after asking her to enjoin even more state regulations that the clinic argues are preventing clinics from prescribing mifepristone and misoprostol, which are used in medication abortions. As of Monday, Missourians could not access medication abortion from an in-state provider because of these regulations.
Planned Parenthood is currently offering procedural abortions at its clinics in Kansas City, Columbia and St. Louis. 
 A separate battle for patient records

Last month, the Missouri Court of Appeals gave the green light for the attorney general’s office to subpoena patient health information in a separate case involving the Washington University Transgender Center. But it has to be done under more stringent parameters, the court ruled. 
The attorney general’s office initially requested “all electronic health records of (the center’s) clients” and a list of all the center’s patients. The higher court is now requiring that only the minimum required health information be turned over.
The appeals court reversed a ruling last year in which a district judge said the center did not have to turn over patient information protected by the Health Information Portability and Accountability Act, also known as HIPAA.
In that case,  the attorney general’s office argued that it qualifies as a “health oversight agency,” and as such should be privy to patient information protected by HIPPA.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_8172-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-10-06 16:59:46.927655

(Capitol News Illinois photo by Hannah Meisel)CHICAGO — Illinois and Chicago filed a federal lawsuit Monday to block the Trump administration’s planned deployment of National Guard troops to the state — a move Gov. JB Pritzker called an “invasion.”
Trump pushed forward with the plan to activate hundreds of National Guard soldiers, including some from Texas, despite monthslong opposition from state and local leaders, as well as objections from civic and business groups in the city.
“We must now start calling this what it is: Trump’s Invasion,” Pritzker said in a statement Sunday night. “It started with federal agents, it will soon include deploying federalized members of the Illinois National Guard against our wishes, and it will now involve sending in another state’s military troops.”
Read more: Over Pritzker’s objections, Trump sending 300 National Guardsmen to Chicago, governor says
Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem asked President Donald Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to deploy troops to Illinois to protect federal immigration officers and facilities. The Immigration and Customs Enforcement processing center in Broadview, a near-west suburb of Chicago, has been the site of several clashes between ICE agents and demonstrators in recent weeks.
But Pritzker, who said Saturday that he refused the Trump administration’s “ultimatum” to activate the National Guard himself, has insisted there is no emergency necessitating guardsmen on the ground. He also warned that White House officials would use any conflict between immigration agents and civilians as a “pretext” for military occupation.
“It will cause only more unrest, including harming social fabric and community relations and increasing the mistrust of police,” the lawsuit said.
The suit, filed in the Northern District of Illinois, names Trump, Noem and Hegseth as defendants.
 Texas National Guard also activated

Illinois filed its lawsuit hours after Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott announced he will send 400 guardsmen to cities around the country, including Chicago, and after a federal judge in Oregon blocked National Guard deployments to Portland.
The order is “effective immediately for an initial period of 60 days” and subject to extension, according to the memo, signed by Hegseth. It comes a day after Pritzker confirmed Trump’s intention to federalize 300 members of the Illinois National Guard.
“The American people, regardless of where they reside, should not live under the threat of occupation by the United States military, particularly not simply because their city or state leadership has fallen out of a president’s favor,” the lawsuit reads. “To guard against this, foundational principles of American law limit the president’s authority to involve the military in domestic affairs. Those bedrock principles are in peril.”


The opening paragraph of Illinois’ lawsuit against the federal government argues that the “foundational principles of American law” that limit the president’s powers to involve the military in domestic affairs are at risk. (Capitol News Illinois illustration with highlight added)

The promised deployment comes as ICE has ramped up activity in Chicago and its suburbs as part of “Operation Midway Blitz,” which has so far resulted in more than 800 arrests according to the Department of Homeland Security.
There have also been two shootings since the clashes began. On Saturday, the governor called the administration’s National Guard activation a “manufactured performance” and not about protecting public safety.
Though the Trump administration insists ICE is targeting undocumented immigrants who have criminal backgrounds, reports have mounted of agents arresting those with no history of illegal activity, detaining children along with their parents and even handcuffing U.S. citizens and children with zip ties. Immigrant and civil rights groups have alleged ICE is arresting people without warrants in violation of a federal consent decree.
The lawsuit also alleges ICE activity in Chicago and its suburbs has already subjected Illinois “to serious and irreparable harm.”

“It also creates economic harm, depressing business activities and tourism that not only hurt Illinoisians but also hurt Illinois’s tax revenue,” the complaint said.
That argument echoes one made by a group of Chicago business and civic groups over the weekend.
“National Guard troops on our streets, like those reportedly being ordered here by the federal government, have the potential to sow fear and chaos, threatening our businesses’ bottom lines and our reputation,” the Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce, Civic Committee of the Commercial Club of Chicago and the Civic Federation said in a joint statement Saturday.
Read the lawsuit here.
 Order violates states’ rights

Attorney General Kwame Raoul argues the troop deployment violates Illinois’ rights as sovereign state to carry about its own law enforcement, as well as 1878 Posee Comitatus Act that bans the military from participating in domestic law enforcement.
The lawsuit also claims the Trump administration failed to meet any criteria that could allow the president to federalize the National Guard. The president can federalize the National Guard to stop a foreign invasion, when the president can’t execute the laws of the country or to stop a rebellion.
Raoul and state leaders have argued for weeks that Trump would use protests in Broadview as a “flimsy pretext” to claim a rebellion.

Several protestors have been arrested near the facility in recent weeks on charges of assaulting officers. Federal agents have sprayed tear gas and fired nonlethal ammunition into crowds that have gathered there.
Over the weekend, a U.S. Border Patrol agent shot a woman on the city’s Southwest Side in a confrontation with protesters. Prosecutors eventually charged the woman and another protestor with attempting to “assault, impede, and interfere with the work of federal agents in Chicago.” According to the Chicago Sun-Times, agents fired “defensive shots” when they saw the woman was allegedly “armed with a semi-automatic weapon,” and she was taken to a nearby hospital for treatment before she was charged.
Further, the lawsuit argues the Trump administration has entirely manufactured any public safety crisis in Illinois that would require military intervention. It cites a 2013 social media post by Trump, two years before he announced his candidacy for president, that suggested the military should be deployed to Chicago. It lists several other derogatory comments Trump made about the city, state and their leaders over the years, including as president.


Illinois’ lawsuit against the federal government includes several posts that President Donald Trump has made about the city over a period of at least 12 years. (Screenshots from Illinois’ lawsuit against the federal government)

The lawsuit argues that animosity culminated last week with Trump claiming during a speech to military generals that there was an “invasion from within” and suggesting cities like Chicago should be used as “training grounds” for the military.
How soldiers will be deployed 
The lawsuit includes new details about how federal officials communicated with state leaders and gave Pritzker an ultimatum.
DHS sent a memo to the Illinois National Guard on Sept. 28 stating troops “would integrate with federal law enforcement operations, serving in direct support of federal facility protection, access control, and crowd control.”
On Saturday morning, Illinois National Guard Adjutant General Rodney Boyd received a formal email from the Defense Department National Guard Bureau saying Trump asked for at least 300 soldiers, and if Boyd did not activate them within two hours, Hegseth would federalize them. Boyd responded that Pritzker declined to activate the guard. Defense officials sent a new memo late Saturday saying the guard was federalized.
Illinois National Guard leaders received another memo on Sunday informing them soldiers from Texas would be sent to Chicago beginning Monday.

Abbott, a Republican and ardent Trump supporter, has been a frequent foil of Pritzker, bussing thousands of asylum-seeking migrants from the border to Chicago in 2023 and 2024 and criticizing the Illinois governor for welcoming Texas Democratic legislators who fled their state this summer amid a partisan redistricting fight. He said in a social media post that Pritzker “can either fully enforce protection for federal employees or get out of the way and let the Texas Guard do it.”
Prior to this year, the last time a president federalized a state’s National Guard without a request from a state’s governor was in 1965, when President Lyndon B. Johnson sent federal troops to protect civil rights protesters in Alabama without the cooperation of segregationist Gov. George Wallace.

(Photo by Perry Bennett/West Virginia Legislative Photography)Some West Virginia Medicaid recipients will lose their health care when new federal work requirements go into effect in 2027, lawmakers were told Monday.
“I do anticipate that we will see some of our enrollment go down for the community engagement,” Cindy Beane, commissioner for the West Virginia Bureau for Medical Services, told the Legislature’s Joint Standing Committee on Finance. She used a term she said referred to new federal work requirements. “I don’t know that everyone will be able to comply, or will comply with that. So I do anticipate some people coming off its rolls.”
The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which President Donald Trump signed into law in July, will cut the federal Medicaid program by nearly $1 trillion over the next 10 years.  The changes in the bill are projected to make approximately 60,000 West Virginians lose their health care coverage over the next decade, according to KFF. 
Beane said the bill has more than 20 new provisions in it that will affect Medicaid. Some of those provisions the state already complies with, she said. For instance, the state already checks Social Security data to make sure that the program is not paying for the care of dead people, she said. 
 
Beginning in January 2027, new working requirements will go into effect for approximately 160,000 West Virginians who are part of the expanded Medicaid program through the Affordable Care Act. 
 
Under the legislation, expanded Medicaid recipients ages 19 through 64 — with some exceptions — must work or participate in certain qualifying activities for at least 80 hours per month. States will be required to verify that those applying for coverage meet the work requirements for at least one or more consecutive months and that enrolled individuals meet requirements for one or more months between the twice-yearly eligibility redeterminations.
Beane said 60% of the state’s affected Medicaid recipients have an earned income, but it’s not clear how many of them work at least 80 hours each month. About 20,000 to 40,000 people on expanded Medicaid are “engaged with the workforce” and will need to engage in order to stay enrolled, she said. 
Beane said the state is preparing now to enact the work requirements. The federal government has made it clear there will not be extensions to the January 2027 deadline, she said.
“The bill does say there’s a possibility for [the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services] to waive the timeline if you’re not ready,” Beane said. “CMS has made it very clear. I’ve had multiple meetings with CMS, and I’ve also talked to the current director about this, with regards to how quickly states are having to get this done, that basically there is no good faith waiver. They will be anticipating that you will be ready next January.”
Beane said the state enlisted the help of West Virginia University Health Affairs to help with project management and systems requirements for the work requirements. 
Alex Mayer, secretary of the state Department of Human Services, and Janie Cole, commissioner of the state Bureau for Family Assistance, are working to determine the staffing levels they’ll need to take on the twice-yearly redeterminations, she said.
“I think what we’re going to try to do as much as possible with regards to work requirements and anything is make it as ex-parte, which is no touch, as possible,” Beane said. “[We’ll] see if there’s some technologies we can employ to where it’s not staff intensive. But I do think there will be increased demands.”
Beane said the department does not have an estimate for how much the system upgrades and staffing changes will cost the state to prepare for work requirements but “there will be a cost.”
A federal report found that it cost the state of Georgia $54.2 million in less than five years to administer the country’s only Medicaid program with work rules, more than twice what it spent to provide health care to enrollees.
She added that her biggest concern with staffing levels is making sure that the state’s payment error rate doesn’t increase. Another provision of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act will require states to pay money as a penalty for Medicaid payment error rates that exceed 3%. A high payment error rate could cost the state potentially millions of dollars, she said. 
West Virginia’s payment error rate has been high as 15%, but was down to 3.43% during its last audit. Errors could be anything from a worker mistyping a number to missing documentation, she said. 
“I feel like this is a particular part of the bill that the state needs to pay a lot of attention to,” Beane said. “Because like it said it could just be one country worker stressed and entering something wrong or something like that can really affect your [payment error rate measurement].”

(Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday is scheduled to hear oral arguments in a case that could reverse or solidify state laws across the country that ban a controversial counseling practice for LGBTQ+ youth.
The case challenges a 2019 Colorado law that bans “conversion therapy” for children and teens. Conversion therapy is a catchall term for efforts to change the sexual orientation or gender identity of LGBTQ+ people. Sometimes called “reparative therapy,” it can range from talk therapy and religious counseling to electrical shocks, pain-inducing aversion therapy and physical isolation. The therapy has been widely discredited by medical groups.
More than half of states — including some led by Republicans — have banned or restricted the practice for children and teens since California became the first to do so in 2012, according to the Movement Advancement Project, a left-leaning nonprofit research organization that tracks LGBTQ+-related laws and policies.
In recent years, however, Republicans in several states have worked to reverse bans, with some success. A poll in June by Data for Progress, a liberal think tank, found that although less than half of Republican voters, 43%, support or strongly support conversion therapy, more than half — 56% — said the Supreme Court ought to allow states to ban it.
A decision in the Colorado case, expected next year, could have far-reaching ramifications for dozens of other states.
“I think we’re all really worried about the implications,” said Cliff Rosky, a professor of law at the University of Utah. Rosky helped draft Utah’s 2023 law prohibiting licensed professionals from practicing conversion therapy on LGBTQ+ youth. That measure unanimously passed the Republican-controlled legislature.
“We certainly hope the court will uphold the right of states to regulate the behavior of therapists that it licenses and protect children from a lethal public health threat,” he told Stateline.
The impact on other states’ laws would depend on the scope of the high court’s ruling. But most of those laws are similar to Colorado’s, Rosky said.
“Certainly, a broad ruling against Colorado’s law would jeopardize the constitutionality of all the other laws.”
Conversion therapy for LGBTQ+ people, long discredited, could make a comeback

In Chiles v. Salazar, a licensed counselor in Colorado Springs, Kaley Chiles, sued state officials in 2022 over a law that bars licensed mental health professionals from conducting conversion therapy on clients under 18. She argues the law violates her First Amendment right to free speech and interferes with her ability to practice counseling in a way that aligns with her religious convictions. Chiles is represented by conservative religious law firm Alliance Defending Freedom.
“The government has no business censoring private conversations between clients and counselors,” Jim Campbell, chief legal counsel for Alliance Defending Freedom, said in a news release when the group filed its opening brief in June. “Colorado’s law harms these young people by depriving them of caring and compassionate conversations with a counselor who helps them pursue the goals they desire.”
Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser, a Democrat, said in an August news conference that the law doesn’t prohibit a provider from sharing information or viewpoints with a patient, and that therapists are still allowed to talk with patients about conversion practices offered by religious groups.
But he called conversion therapy a “substandard, discredited practice.” Conversion therapy has been denounced by major medical organizations including the American Medical Association, the American Psychological Association, the American Psychiatric Association and the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.
“This practice has been used in the past to try to force patients to change their sexual orientation or their gender identity,” Weiser said. “The science, however, says that this practice is harmful. It doesn’t work.
“Regardless of how it’s performed, there can be real harms from this practice. And those harms can include depression, self-hatred, loss of faith, even suicide.”
The key question in the case is whether Colorado’s law regulates professional standards of conduct and speech, or whether it attempts to regulate the right to free speech, said Marie-Amélie George, a legal historian who has published extensively on LGBTQ+ rights and is a professor of law at Wake Forest University School of Law.
“What is really interesting about these laws is that most licensed health professionals don’t offer conversion therapy because professional associations across the board have condemned it as extremely harmful,” George told Stateline. After the mainstream mental health community disavowed efforts to change people’s sexual orientation by the late 1980s, conversion therapy “became primarily the province of religious and lay ministers,” she said.
State laws like Colorado’s don’t restrict clergy and lay ministers from engaging in conversion therapy, she said. They address only the small subset of state-licensed mental health professionals who wish to use it.
In August, attorneys general in 20 states and the District of Columbia filed an amicus brief supporting Colorado’s law. They argue the First Amendment doesn’t shield mental health practices from regulation when the state deems them dangerous or ineffective, and that states have a long and established history of regulating professional standards of care.










The decision in this case will probably affect all of the conversion therapy bans in this country.


– Marie-Amélie George, Wake Forest University School of Law professor


Colorado isn’t the only recent battleground over conversion therapy, as conservative majorities in the courts, state legislatures and at the federal level have opened the door for Republican lawmakers and conservative Christian groups to reinstate the practice.
Earlier this year, Kentucky’s Republican-controlled legislature passed a bill canceling Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear’s 2024 executive order that banned conversion therapy for minors. Beshear promptly vetoed the bill, but the legislature overrode his veto in March.
In April, a coalition of Republican attorneys general from 11 states, led by Iowa and South Carolina, appealed a January decision by a U.S. district court judge to uphold a 2023 Michigan law that’s similar to Colorado’s. It prohibits mental health professionals from trying to alter a minor’s sexual orientation or gender identity. The case began when Catholic Charities of three Michigan counties filed a lawsuit targeting Michigan’s law in 2024 on behalf of a licensed therapist.
In July, a Virginia court partially struck down the state’s 2020 ban on conversion therapy for minors. Republican lawmakers in Michigan introduced a bill in July to repeal their state’s ban, while Missouri’s Republican attorney general sued to overturn local conversion therapy bans.
From the mid-1990s until the mid-2010s, LGBTQ+ rights advocates won a lot of cases before the U.S. Supreme Court, said George, the Wake Forest professor.
“But in the years since, the Supreme Court has been more hostile to LGBTQ+ rights claims,” she said. “I think, with the political environment of the court, it will be interesting to see what they do given how they have treated other LGBTQ+ rights cases in recent years.
“States are extremely similar in the laws they have enacted, so the decision in this case will probably affect all of the conversion therapy bans in this country.”

(Photo provided by S.C. State Ports Authority)CHARLESTON — The state agency that owns and operates the Port of Charleston has tapped former top sales executive Micah Mallace to take the helm of South Carolina’s largest economic driver.
The agency’s board of directors on Monday, named Mallace, who spent 11 years with the S.C. State Ports Authority before leaving in late 2022 to become president of warehouse and trucking firm Harbor Logistics, the authority’s new president and CEO.
The board, during a special meeting, unanimously approved a five-year contract that will pay $525,000 per year to Mallace, who previously was the authority’s chief commercial officer. His first day will be Oct. 13 – less than two months after previous CEO Barbara Melvin unexpectedly resigned from the job.
Imports spur stellar August for SC Ports, but tariff troubles await

“What we do and how we operate influences global trade and the worldwide economy,” Bill Stern, the authority’s board chairman, said in a statement. “Micah Mallace understands that significance and responsibility. He has the vision, experience and nuts-and-bolts knowledge to navigate the many facets of today’s maritime industry.”
Industry experience
Mallace, 41, a Charleston native and graduate of the College of Charleston, was an overwhelming top pick among government and industry leaders for the port’s CEO role.
The leadership role attracted widespread interest “but the board and government leaders rapidly coalesced behind Mallace,” the authority said in a news release.
“I care deeply about serving the employees, serving the community that depends on the port and, of course, I care deeply about serving the state,” Mallace said. “I don’t take any of that lightly, and certainly that will require a lot of hard work.”
His time with Charleston-based Harbor Logistics kept Mallace in touch with the authority’s operations and he said that private-sector experience “will come in handy in this role.”
“I’m fortunate that I’ve worked closely with the port over the last three years – I’ve been a customer of the port and I’ve also been a partner in pursuing growth projects” he said. “I will need some time to get up to speed and will be assessing both the challenges as well as where there’s wind in our sails.”
SC Ports still sees a future in barges, but rail yard getting first focus

Mallace said the authority’s board reached out to him “as they were thinking through various candidates” and looking for Melvin’s replacement.
“I met with all of the board members to share my understanding of the challenges and my understanding of the opportunities and kind of what I saw as where the port should go next,” he said.
Mallace succeeds interim CEO Phil Padgett, who was thrust into the role following the sudden resignation in August of Melvin, who held the title for about three years.
Padgett will remain the agency’s chief financial officer and vice president of administration.
“I can think of no better person to lead SC Ports and know he will bring the necessary vision to grow as a top 10 container port,” Padgett said of Mallace.
Legislators applauded the selection, with Rep. Bruce Bannister, R-Greenville and chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, calling Mallace “an outstanding choice.”
“Micah’s experience and qualifications firmly align with our port’s mission and he will be an invaluable asset as we move forward in the highly competitive maritime industry,” added House Speaker Murrell Smith, R-Sumter.
An unexpected resignation
Mallace’s appointment gives the authority an opportunity to quickly gain traction in the wake of an unexpected leadership void.
SC ports director Melvin abruptly resigns, citing ‘personal reasons’

No specific reason has been given for Melvin’s surprise resignation, which was announced two days after the board held a previously unscheduled and unannounced closed-door meeting that lasted for about an hour. Melvin said the resignation was due to “personal and professional reasons.”
The resignation followed a period in which Gov. Henry McMaster appointed new members to the authority’s board to address what he termed concerns about how the agency was being run. McMaster declined to elaborate when asked by the SC Gazette late last month.
Reportedly, the governor’s concerns included a Supreme Court decision in February 2024 that gave members of a local dockworkers union the right to operate cranes and other heavy-lift equipment at the port – jobs that previously were limited to non-union authority employees. The authority’s fight with the union – which McMaster vowed to fight “to the gates of hell” –  delayed the port’s new $1 billion Leatherman Terminal from becoming fully operational for two years.
Also, state legislators say they were not kept informed about cost overruns and construction delays at a rail yard the authority is building, where cargo containers can be moved between trucks and trains. The cost of that mostly state-funded project has nearly doubled to $690 million.
Melvin, who made $585,000 in salary and bonuses in the most recent fiscal year, will get a nearly $1 million severance package that includes salary continuation and contributions to her state retirement account.
Charleston’s port – the state’s largest economic driver with an $87 billion annual economic impact – finished the last budget year that ended June 30, handling a little more than 1.4 million containers of all sizes. That’s up 2.3% from the previous 12-month period.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/micah-mallace-1-1024x579.jpg,,,2025-10-06 16:59:46.927655

A Massachusetts District Court judge last week dismissed a case against Rida Kori, a former Burlington school board member who was charged with drug trafficking last year.
Kori, 25, was arrested in Holyoke, Massachusetts, during a traffic stop in September 2024 and was charged with trafficking roughly 86 grams of suspected heroin and fentanyl, according to previous court records.
But last week, a Massachusetts District Court Judge William P. Hadley dismissed the case after Kori’s attorney filed a motion to suppress evidence.

The attorney, Kedar Ismail, argued that police searched Kori’s car without a warrant and without probable cause or reasonable suspicion, and he asked the judge to suppress the evidence in the case as “fruits of the poisonous tree,” according to a court transcript. 
In a phone interview, Ismail called the traffic stop “pretextual,” and in court transcripts said the officers involved in the traffic stop were “using what they needed in order to fit their narrative to get the reasonable suspicion, to get the probable cause.”
Prosecutors during a court hearing in August pushed back, and said officers with the Massachusetts State Police had made previous surveillance observations of Kori in a “high-crime area,” according to court transcripts.
Members of the federal Drug Enforcement Administration in Springfield, Massachusetts, were alerted to Kori when they spotted his vehicle during a separate narcotics investigation in Enfield, Connecticut, in July 2024, according to a previous affidavit written by Massachusetts State Police Trooper Michael DeCaro.
Investigators later tracked Kori’s vehicle via electronic surveillance and noted several trips into Massachusetts and Connecticut, the affidavit read.
Ismail did not dispute that drugs were found in Kori’s car, but told the judge during court hearings that the search was “an egregious violation of his Fourth Amendment right and his Article 14 protections.”
A Burlington High School graduate, Kori ran unopposed for the Ward 1 seat on the school board on Town Meeting Day in 2024. He attended Central Connecticut State to play Division 1 soccer, and previously worked as an assistant varsity soccer coach at Burlington High School.
He submitted his resignation shortly after his arrest last year. Kori, in an email, referred comment to his attorney but said the court “dropped my case and I was vindicated.”

Gretchen Whitmer in her official capacity to end the state’s policy of denying worker’s compensation to undocumented immigrants who are injured while working. 
In a press conference held in advance of oral arguments to the Michigan Supreme Court, which will begin on Wednesday, Anna Hill Galendez, a managing attorney at the Michigan Immigrant Rights Center, said the issues in this case involve basic fairness and worker well-being.
“The reality is, many employers gladly hire workers who don’t have work permits because they can pay them less and get away with more cutting corners on health and safety protections and when workers are inevitably injured, workers compensation insurance companies know they can deny wage loss benefits without challenge,” Galendez said.
Lawyers from the Michigan Immigrant Rights Center and others involved in the lawsuit against Gov. Gretchen Whitmer held a press conference in advance of oral arguments beginning. Oct. 6, 2025 | Screenshot
John Philo, the executive and legal director of the Sugar Law Center for Economic and Social Justice, noted that this issue has already been addressed in Ohio and Minnesota, where in both states undocumented workers have been guaranteed access to worker’s compensation. The Sugar Law Center is representing the Michigan Immigrant Rights Center alongside FarmSTAND, a legal advocacy organization focused on issues of corporate agriculture.
“Going to work should not mean having to gamble your health, your livelihood or the ability to care for your family,” Galendez added.
However, this case, first filed in 2021 in the Court of Claims, has become about more than just immigrant rights, argued lawyer David Muraskin, managing director for litigation at FarmSTAND. The Court of Appeals, overturning a decision from the Court of Claims, ruled in May 2024 that the argument was not timely — thus making Whitmer subject to immunity — because the claim was filed more than one year after the governor’s policy went into effect.
“That would mean that when the governor has a policy of any unconstitutional conduct, including this one, the fact that she got away with it for a year would keep anyone from ever going to court,” Muraskin said. 
Phil Mayor, a senior staff attorney at the ACLU of Michigan, which has filed an amicus brief in the case, shared a similar portrayal of the issue.
“It’s an issue about whether Michiganders, and I mean all Michiganders, can go to court to stop the government from breaking the law, or whether, as the governor would have it, if they’ve gotten away with breaking the law for a year, they can just keep doing it indefinitely,” Mayor said.
The Michigan Immigrant Rights Center and its lawyers are aiming to have this case sent back to the Court of Claims by the Supreme Court. Muraskin also noted, however, “she [Gov. Whitmer] could tomorrow choose to stop enforcing this policy and follow the law, and that would resolve this case entirely.”
A request for comment from Whitmer’s office has yet to be returned.

Pat Harrigan (R-N.C.) for more than $75,000 over his claims that she was fired for comments about the death of Charlie Kirk.
Bridget Sullivan filed a libel lawsuit against Harrigan in Forsyth Superior Court Friday, alleging Harrigan spread falsehoods about her when he posted from his congressional X account that she was “FIRED for celebrating Charlie Kirk’s assassination.”
Sullivan posted the song lyrics, “He had it coming, he had it coming,” on Sept. 11, the day after Kirk was fatally shot, alongside a comment that “this audio is all I have to say about that.”
The following day, Harrigan called for her firing on X, reposting screenshots of her Wake Forest biography alongside her Instagram post. He added that he contacted the university about her comments.
“If a staff member is openly celebrating the assassination of Charlie Kirk, it crosses every line of decency and professionalism,” Harrigan wrote. “No university should tolerate an employee glorifying political violence. Anything less than firing her is an endorsement of it.”
According to the lawsuit, both Sullivan and the university received threats and other “derogatory comments” after this, requiring additional police protection on campus.
On Sept. 16, he made a follow-up post announcing she was fired. The post received more than 23,000 likes and 874,000 views, according to the lawsuit, and was cited by The Charlotte Observer and Raleigh News and Observer in reporting that she was fired. His X account reposted the latter headline.
A spokesperson for Harrigan did not respond to a request for comment.

Sullivan denied in the lawsuit that she was fired, and that instead, she and Wake Forest “mutually agreed that it would be best to part ways” on Sept. 14.
“Wake Forest did not fire or terminate [Sullivan]. Upon information and belief, no Wake Forest representative issued such a statement to [Harrigan], to the school at large, to the press, or to the public,” the complaint reads. “Such a statement was and is false.”
Wake Forest University did not respond to a request to confirm that.
In the wake of Kirk’s death, conservative activists and lawmakers have sought action against employees for universities, hospitals, and government agencies over insensitive comments made online.

Another 6,801 swim vouchers applications were submitted to the state during August. The DOH  is expected to award the vouchers in the coming weeks and reopen the application process for vouchers in the coming months.
The DOH swim voucher website maintains that in Florida, drowning is the leading cause of unintentional death to children ages 1-4 and that home swimming pools are where most children are likely to drown. That is not to say, though, that drownings don’t occur in natural bodies of water.
The DOH will discuss its swim voucher program and the state’s implementation efforts with members of the Senate Health Policy Committee Tuesday.

The presentation on the swim voucher program comes as St. Augustine Republican Rep. Kim Kendall has filed legislation to open the program to more children. Kendall filed HB 85 Monday. The bill revises eligibility for the program allowing children up to age seven to qualify for the swim vouchers.
Passed by the Legislature in 2024 and initially appropriated $500,000, the program was established for children living in families earning 200% of the federal poverty level or less —$64,300 for a family of four. The Legislature doubled the funding for the program in the fiscal year 2025-26 to $1 million and made the vouchers a priority for children with autism and in active-duty military families.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data show:

Drowning is the leading cause of death for children ages one to four;
It is the second-leading cause of death for children ages five through 14;
More than 4,000 unintentional deaths annually are attributed to drowning.

The CDC advises that greater access to swimming lessons is key in curbing the rise in drowning deaths.

While the former site for the coal-fired power plant is nearly 90% demolished, environmental officials will host a meeting on Oct. 7, 2025 about the potential pollution from the decades the site was in operation. (Courtesy Benjamin Hunter for EcoFlight)In the past year, state environment officials have increased the testing of the soil and water around the site of a decommissioned coal-fired electric power plant in New Mexico’s northwestern corner.
In July, environmental regulators told state lawmakers they’ve been trying to track historic spills from leaking ponds, coal ash disposal and other pollutants, and had installed more monitoring wells.
“We’re trying to understand the scope,” NMED Deputy Cabinet Secretary John Rhoderick told legislators during a presentation to the Radioactive & Hazardous Materials Committee. “Contamination is three-dimensional, you’ve got to know how long, how wide and how deep it is.”
This Tuesday, state officials are planning to present some of those findings, including more information about potential pollution from decades of coal waste disposal.
The San Juan Generating Station operated for nearly 50 years, fed by two nearby coal mines, including the La Plata mine and the San Juan Mine. The power plant, along with the neighboring Four Corners Generating Station, in 2014 were considered one of the largest single sources of pollution in the U.S.. The San Juan Generating Station permanently closed in 2022 and has been under demolition since August 2024.
In 2023, lawmakers passed House Bill 142, which directed the New Mexico Environment and Energy Minerals and Natural Resources departments to monitor and enforce cleanup of the area for at least two years. NMED is in charge of the station site, while EMNRD is tasked with the mining area cleanup.
While there is no agenda or preview released, a news release said the  environment department will present data collected during its recent groundwater investigation — which will inform future remediation — during a hybrid open house on Tuesday in Fruitland.
“One of the Environment Department’s top priorities is making sure New Mexicans are informed of the work we’re doing in their backyard,” said Justin Ball, NMED’s Groundwater Quality Bureau chief in a statement to Source NM. That’s why we’re holding this meeting — to show the public the same data we’re using to make key cleanup decisions at the San Juan Generating Station site.”
Numerous operators have owned the station throughout its lifespan, but it was last owned by New Mexico’s largest electricity provider, Public Service Company of New Mexico (PNM).
In a July letter, environment officials requested PNM officials produce a plan to reduce pollution, writing that multiple potential sources of groundwater and soil contamination already existed in quantities violating state laws.
“Known contaminants of concern, based on historic monitoring, include nitrate, sulfate, arsenic, selenium, uranium, boron, and volatile organic compounds,” the letter stated. The letter required the plan to be produced to environment officials by the end of September.
PNM requested an extension, NMED spokesperson Drew Goretzka told Source via text message, and the plan will now be due to state officials on Nov. 26.
The public will “hopefully” hear more about the exact nature of any contamination and further cleanup plans at the meeting, said Mike Eisenfeld, energy and climate program manager with local environment group San Juan Citizens Alliance.
Area conservation groups had previously focused on reducing the annual emissions of 12 million tons of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, he said, but the concern has shifted to soil and water cleanup. Eisenfeld said he wants to avoid a “culture of abandonment”  for the generating station, and pointed to taxpayers being on the hook for cleaning up private uranium and oil and gas operations.
Any information about the status of groundwater pollution, and how the state will require cleanup will be useful, he said.
“The state agencies have tried to be responsive,” Eisenfeld told Source NM Monday. “But it’s really difficult when you’re just a citizen just trying to sort out who’s responsible for legacy cleanup.”

Norton I State House News Service,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/shns/senate-president-says-federal-government-working-against-us/,"During an interview televised Sunday morning, Spilka echoed comments made earlier in the year by House Speaker Ron Mariano, who said Massachusetts had ""lost our federal partner.""","THE STATE CAN’T make up for all of the federal government spending cuts that are occurring, according to Massachusetts Senate President Karen Spilka, who also said she’s not looking to raise taxes as part of any response.
During an interview televised Sunday morning, Spilka echoed comments made earlier in the year by House Speaker Ron Mariano, who said Massachusetts had “lost our federal partner.”
“I believe that Trump and the Congressional Republicans are working against us and the Legislature and the residents of Massachusetts,” Spilka said. 
While Republicans believe the One Big Beautiful Bill that was passed in July will unleash economic growth and responsibly rein in government spending, many Democrats say that less support from the federal level for social safety net programs will just push inevitable costs and responsibilities down to the states. 
The Ashland Democrat said Beacon Hill had mobilized quickly and “gotten some great bills done to protect Massachusetts residents, defend Massachusetts values,” but two of the three actions she cited — a student cellphone ban and data privacy legislation — have only cleared the Senate and await action in the House.
She said “we will continue doing bills” and predicted action on legislation to help veterans. She also pointed to a major new law this session to further protect access to reproductive health care and gender identity care.
The Democrats who run the Legislature have been steadily criticizing the across-the-board shifts in federal policies since Trump took office, but have had less to say about how the state plans to respond to forecasts that the ranks of the insured here are about to surge and that families will lose access to food benefits.
“I’m not talking about new taxes right now,” Spilka told Jon Keller of WBZ-TV, who asked if new taxes may be part of the response to threatened public programs and services. “We are not going to have enough funding. We have a good rainy day fund, we’re not going to have enough to cover everything.”
Asked about recent chatter about altering the limit on local property tax increases, Spilka said, “Nobody has spoken to me directly about that as a possibility. For right now, I am not looking at tax increases.”
Bills that provide local “residential assistance to our elders, our vulnerable residents” are a focus, she said. 
The Senate on Sept. 25 passed legislation (S 2619) featuring right-to-know provisions about personal data that is being collected and the ability for people to opt out of having their data used for targeted advertising or being sold to other companies. In addition to enhanced protections for data belonging to minors, the bill give the attorney general enforcement powers and features data protections around health care information, face scans and fingerprints, geolocation, and information about a person’s religion, ethnicity or immigration status.
“I think they need some guidance by the state,” Spilka said, referring to technology companies that she said “are mining tons and tons of your personal information.” 
The state last week released the latest round of MCAS scores and the lackluster standardized test results show students have not rebounded from pandemic-related learning loss. Spilka said Massachusetts is “number one in education in the country” and while she said the results illustrate that enhanced efforts are required, she didn’t offer specifics other than to recommend “what is evidence-based, what works with our kids.”
“We still have some work to do, clearly,” Spilka said. “I think we need to really focus, zone in on the different grades and where the kids are at, starting early, not waiting until high school. I think literacy is a big thing, mathematics.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/09-18_Spilka_1-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-06 15:57:13.796238

(Screenshot of the meeting's livestream)The federal government shutdown, which enters its second week, is not yet impacting Oklahoma highway projects, but could prove problematic if Congress is unable to reach a long-term funding agreement, Oklahoma’s top transportation official said.
Tim Gatz, who heads the Oklahoma Department of Transportation, said the federal government is still processing his agency’s bills as the shutdown enters its second week. But as the 2026 federal fiscal year gets further along, his agency would have to “very carefully consider” which projects they can do and which they cannot if they don’t have federal participation.
But he also said it would still be problematic if Congress only passes a short-term funding resolution because it wouldn’t provide the Oklahoma Department of Transportation access to one full year’s worth of federal funding.
The federal government remained closed Monday after the Republican-controlled Congress was unable to reach agreement on either of two separate government funding bills by the start of the Oct. 1 federal fiscal year. A Republican proposal would keep the government open until Nov. 21. Democrats, meanwhile, have a separate plan that would permanently restore federal health subsidies.
Gatz said states are also waiting to hear what Congress plans to do when the federal Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act expires at the end of the 2026 federal budget year. The measure, which became law in November 2021, appropriates nearly $1.2 trillion for transportation and infrastructure projects nationwide, including nearly $350 billion for federal highway programs.
Gatz said Congress is currently working on a new highway funding bill with the aim of sustaining current funding levels, but it’s going to be challenging because the Highway Trust Fund, which pays for transportation projects using excise taxes, only covers around 50% or 60% of all expenditures. The rest of the Act’s costs were deposited into the trust by Congress. 
Gatz said it’s not yet known if that 2021 investment will be a sustainable trend.
“I call that to your attention because we are trying to project our federal funding availability with some uncertainty,” Gatz told the members of his governing board Monday during their monthly meeting.
He said it has already been a challenging year. Oklahoma lawmakers have had to provide an extra $200 million in one-time funding in budget years 2024 and 2025 to “help shield” the Department of Transportation.
The agency has been grappling with an “inflationary trend” that began in 2020 impacting heavy highway construction. An analysis of construction costs show they have increased over 63% since 2020, Gatz said.
The fiscal constraints have forced the state Transportation Department this year to delay some projects that it had planned to do as part of its eight-year work plan, Gatz said. That 2026 through 2033 work plan is planned based on critical infrastructure needs and projected federal and state funding.
“Those projects are still a priority, and they are still projects that need to be done,” Gatz said. “It’s just going to take us a bit longer to get to those projects.”
The latest eight-year work plan, approved unanimously by the Department of Transportation’s governing board Monday, contains over $7.08 billion in total investment in 1,266 individual projects. It prioritizes 460 individual bridges that need rehabilitation or replacement, 675 miles of improvements to two-lane highways with deficient shoulders, and planned pavement improvements to 2,810 lane miles, officials said.
“The needs are just outpacing our ability to get there with the improvements,” Gatz said. “We’ll carry those discussions into the legislative session to make sure the Legislature understands what’s going on.”
He said the state’s highway system is the largest publicly owned asset, valued at over $100 billion. It needs about $27 billion in investments to bring it to an acceptable standard.

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)A controversial proposed natural gas pipeline in North Carolina could be unnecessary, according to an environmental assessment of the Mountain Valley Pipeline Southgate project by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
Running into Rockingham County, the pipeline has been the subject of controversy since it was proposed in 2018. North Carolina’s Department of Environmental Quality denied a water quality permit for the project in 2020, NC Newsline previously reported.
FERC staff found that the approval of an amendment to the Southgate project would not constitute a major federal action that significantly affects environmental quality, according to the document released on Friday.
But another natural gas project, the Williams Companies’ expansion of their Transco pipelines — the Southeast Supply Enhancement project — is also undergoing a permitting process at the moment. The two companies have sparred over access to the area and the need for both pipelines.
The Virginia Department of Environmental Quality is conducting a clean water permit review of the Transco project through Nov. 10, and FERC is expected to release an environmental assessment in early November.
FERC’s environmental analysis found that the Southeast Supply Enhancement Project could remove the need for Southgate, according to the document.
A representative for the Southgate project did not immediately respond to NC Newsline’s request for comment.
“We conclude the Transco System Alternative would be technically and economically feasible and practical,” FERC staff wrote in the analysis.
FERC staff also claimed the SSE project’s benefits outweigh those of Southgate by negating the need for a second pipeline to provide resources to customers.
“We conclude that the Transco System Alternative would provide an environmental advantage over the proposed Amendment Project because the SSE Project could supply both its own customers and Mountain Valley’s customers with a single pipeline instead of two separate and similar pipelines, thereby significantly reducing environmental effects,” the analysis read.
Environmentalists and local residents have voiced concerns over the possibility of two high-pressure, large diameter pipelines in the same area.
Crystal Cavalier-Keck, co-founder of 7 Directions of Service, an organization focused on environmental justice and indigenous rights, emphasized the pipeline’s harmful effects on people in the area.
“MVP’s proposed extension of its pipeline into North Carolina — MVP Southgate — is now within half a mile of another dangerous proposed pipeline, Transco SSEP, and the burden on our communities will only be compounded,” Cavalier-Keck said in a statement.
Opponents of Southgate argue that the company should be required to submit a new application for the project rather than an amendment, since the changes deviate significantly from the original proposal.
FERC’s environmental assessment follows MVP’s amendment request to change the route, pipe diameter, and capacity of the pipeline, extending it from Pittsylvania County, Virginia into North Carolina.
“Southgate necessitates a full application, not an insufficient amendment request and environmental assessment,” Jessica Sims, Virginia field coordinator at Appalachian Voices, said in a statement. “Southgate’s developers inflicted harm on all communities within the path of their violation-riddled Mountain Valley Pipeline mainline, and should not be granted more permission to extend that harm into North Carolina.”

A patchwork of pilots, well-meaning grants, and isolated bright spots. What we don’t have is a statewide blueprint.","THIS FALL’S KINDERGARTEN class was born during the first wave of the pandemic. Five years later, we still haven’t stabilized their future. 
The data are clear: learning loss isn’t just lingering; in some cases, it’s worsening. The state’s press release announcing the recent MCAS results didn’t call it a “crisis,” but it should have. The severity of the problem isn’t a question, but whether we have the courage to act remains unknown. 
Student outcomes in math and reading remain well below 2019 levels across all student groups. Only 13 of more than 350 Massachusetts districts have returned to pre-pandemic performance. 
For the fourth straight year, 10th-grade scores in both math and English language arts dropped. Third-grade results are also distressing: reading remains 14 points lower than in 2019, with no improvement in the last four years, resulting in more than half (58 percent) of our children failing to read at grade level. 
These are not just numbers. These are the human consequences of policy decisions. In a state that prides itself on high-quality public education, we are graduating students with fewer skills and diminished economic mobility. 
So, what’s our strategy? A patchwork of pilots, well-meaning grants, and isolated bright spots. What we don’t have is a statewide blueprint. 
Southern states like Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana, and Tennessee do. Even with less per pupil funding and higher child poverty rates, these states have significantly outpaced growth in comparison to Massachusetts, especially for the most vulnerable students. In 2024, on average, low-income fourth-graders in Mississippi and Louisiana outperformed low-income fourth-graders in Massachusetts on reading and math.  
This success is not accidental; it came from deliberate policy choices. In Massachusetts, we can learn from these outcomes and establish key pillars for a blueprint of our own. Here are four. 
1. Build Educator Capacity at Scale 
Make the message clear: If you want better outcomes for kids, give every teacher the tools to get them there. Mississippi’s policy leaders invested in equipping all teachers to excel in teaching reading and math – before entering the classroom and while on the job. They trained 20,000 K–3 teachers in the science of reading, backed by state-funded literacy coaches who visited schools weekly. Tennessee built a summer training program that reached over 60 percent of K–3 teachers, free of charge.  
2. Align Assessment and Accountability 
Rather than run from data, drive transparency and focus. Louisiana publicly reports how often teacher prep programs produce effective educators and ties renewal to those results. Tennessee links district funding and interventions to student achievement, with clear academic goals and public dashboards. Poor results became impossible to ignore and possible to fix. 
3. Build Instructional Infrastructure and Align Incentives 
Align incentives and build ecosystems around evidence-based teaching. Louisiana created a vetted list of high-quality curricula and aligned teacher prep, professional development, and funding around it. Tennessee made sure families had access to reading strategies that matched classroom instruction. They set clear goals, and then ensured vendors, universities, and parents all rowed in the same direction. 
4. Hold a High Bar and Stick with It 
Raise expectations for all students and stick with them, even when it’s hard. Mississippi kept its third-grade reading retention policy despite backlash. Today, its students lead the nation in reading gains by fourth grade. Alabama set a statewide goal that all students master foundational math by grade five, and backed it with free, high-quality summer math programs for all struggling students. In 2022, it was the only state to improve math scores on NAEP post-pandemic. These states invested in all the key stakeholders to stay the course. 
It’s not too late for Massachusetts. We have more resources than our southern peers and a legacy of educational excellence. What we lack is a statewide strategy. But a new window has opened. 
We have strong leadership at the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education. Commissioner Pedro Martinez previously led ambitious academic improvement efforts in Chicago — one of the most complex school systems in the country — and knows what it takes to move from fragmentation to focus. 
The Healey administration’s Literacy Launch initiative is a promising down payment on improving reading instruction. But without a plan to ensure full statewide adoption of high-quality curricula and evidence-based teaching practices, it won’t reach the scale needed on the time horizon students deserve. 
For the first time in over two decades, Massachusetts is revisiting its graduation requirements. To thrive in our state, students need to read deeply, write clearly, think critically, and master the math and problem-solving skills that power our innovation economy. These standards are our compass, and the difference between students charting a future and finding a dead end. 
We can’t afford another year of decline. The stakes are too high. A patchwork won’t save us. A blueprint might. But only if we build it now.

“It started off with vandalistic origins, but over the last half century it has grown into one of the most legitimized and profitable art forms,” said an organizer of a $12,000 weekend spray-painting project.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Most municipalities try to curb graffiti. So why is Brattleboro commissioning it?.","BRATTLEBORO — Stone Arch Properties owner Mike Cota woke Monday to see two of his downtown buildings colored by more than 200 cans of spray paint. 
Cota knows he asked for it. Literally.
“A year ago, I thought, ‘Even with all the mediocre graffiti that’s down here, a lot of people love coming to take pictures,’” he said. “It’d be a shame to get rid of it, so what if we did something to improve it?”
That’s why Cota teamed with the nearby Brattleboro Museum & Art Center and Brandon-based Juniper Creative Arts to host a weekend “Graffiti Jam” that drew 15 professional “aerosol artists” from as far away as Slovakia.
Vermont’s largest city of Burlington recently made news when someone spray-painted over part of a $10,000 Main Street mural elementary students created near their school. In contrast, the Brattleboro event aimed to show graffiti has its good side.
“It started off with vandalistic origins, but over the last half century it has grown into one of the most legitimized and profitable art forms around the globe,” said Will Kasso Condry, an organizer.

Condry first spray-painted at age 7, then studied fine art and illustration at The College of New Jersey. As a co-founder of the Juniper collective with wife Jennifer Herrera Condry and daughter Alexa Herrera Condry, he has created more than 40 murals in public buildings throughout Vermont. He has won the Vermont Prize for visual art in 2022, the Herb Lockwood Prize in the Arts this summer and, with his family, the Vermont Arts Council’s Arthur Williams Award for Meritorious Service to the Arts last month.
Condry, who works with spray paint imported from Europe, understands why property owners can feel angry when someone targets them with a cheap can.
“It’s ignorant to think that you can stop all graffiti that is being done without sanction — that’s been going on since antiquity,” he said. “Graffiti culture was started by Black and brown children in inner city Philadelphia and New York, but nowadays, a lot of it springing up around Vermont is more than likely done by young white males. You control it through proper education and mentoring.”
And so the event aimed to teach a steady crowd of spectators the difference between “tagging” (a hit-and-run spray-painting of one’s name) and investing time and talent into an authorized “production” mural.

“Some people continue to see graffiti through the lens of vandalism,” Jennifer Condry said. “One of our goals with this event is to reinforce the message that graffiti is a respected global art movement that beautifies neglected spaces and builds community. We’re trying to show an evolution and elevation of style.”
The jam received a $12,000 grant from the Vermont Community Foundation’s arts and social cohesion fund — as well as one complaint from a resident who feared it would encourage vandalism elsewhere.
“This is public art in a graffiti style being done at the behest of the property owner,” Danny Lichtenfeld, the museum’s director, said in reply.
The result can be seen on Arch Street, just opposite Main Street’s Latchis Theatre and Hotel, where organizers found an eager apprentice in 14-year-old area eighth grader Eko Harmon-Fee.
“We’re not telling kids, ‘Just because you see us out here, go do it in the back of your school,’” Will Condry said. “We say, ‘Take the time to understand this is an art form like any other that requires training and education.’ Introduced the right way, this is the future of public art.”

(Photo by George Frey/Getty Images)The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Monday updated its adult and child immunization schedules to to recommend COVID-19 shots for people 65 and older after they consult with their health care providers.
The CDC also is recommending in its updated immunization schedules that toddlers receive the chickenpox vaccines as a standalone immunization rather than in combination with measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) shot.
The CDC announced what it called the return to “individual-based decision-making to COVID-19 vaccinations” in a press release on its website Monday morning.
The immunization schedules adopt recent recommendations by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), which has been overhauled by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who fired  all 17 former members of the vaccine panel earlier this year and replaced them with his own appointees.
RFK Jr. fired everyone on a key vaccine panel. Here’s who he replaced them with.

“Informed consent is back,” said Acting Director of the CDC and Deputy Secretary of Health and Human Services Jim O’Neill. “CDC’s 2022 blanket recommendation for perpetual COVID-19 boosters deterred health care providers from talking about the risks and benefits of vaccination for the individual patient or parent. That changes today,” he continued.
“I commend the doctors and public health experts of ACIP for educating Americans about important vaccine safety signals. I also thank President Trump for his leadership in making sure we protect children from unintended side effects during routine immunization.”
According to the CDC press release, individual-based decision-making “means that the clinical decision to vaccinate should be based on patient characteristics that, unlike age, are difficult to incorporate in recommendations, including risk factors for the underlying disease as well as characteristics of the vaccine itself and the best available evidence of who might benefit from vaccination.
“Individual-based-decision-making,” the release continues,” allows for immunization coverage through all payment mechanisms including entitlement programs such as the Medicare, Medicaid, Children’s Health Insurance Program, and the Vaccines for Children Program, as well as insurance plans regulated by the Affordable Care Act.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Vaccines greatly reduce rates of death and disease around the world. The American Academy of Pediatrics, American Academy of Family Practitioners, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, American Medical Association, American Nurses Association, American Pharmacists Association, National Academy of Medicine, and World Health Organization endorse the use of vaccines.
The health insurance trade group AHIP issued a statement last month saying health plans would continue to cover all ACIP-recommended vaccinations, including updated formulations of the COVID-19 and influenza vaccines, with no cost-sharing for patients through the end of 2026.
Health insurance group says vaccines in Florida still a covered benefit

The Florida Board of Pharmacy met briefly last month to affirm that Florida patients don’t need a prescription from their physician before receiving a vaccine. That’s because Florida law authorizes certain pharmacists who work in collaboration with physicians to administer vaccines.
Chickenpox
Meanwhile, the “new recommendation of standalone chickenpox vaccination for toddlers through age three follows evidence presented to ACIP by the CDC Immunization Safety Office’s that healthy 12–23 months old toddlers have increased risk of febrile seizure” from the combined chickenpox-MMR vaccine compared to those given immunization for chickenpox separately.
“The combination vaccine doubles the risk of febrile seizures without conferring additional protection from varicella compared to standalone vaccination,” the CDC statement says. Febrile seizures are brought on by high fevers.

,DC,2025-10-06 18:58:35+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Trump administration wants to remove wrongly deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia to Eswatini,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-administration-wants-remove-wrongly-deported-kilmar-abrego-garcia-eswatini,,"GREENBELT, Md. — A federal judge on Monday ordered the Trump administration to produce evidence within 48 hours on its efforts to again deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia, this time to the southern African country of Eswatini.That evidence from the Trump administration is due by Wednesday to  Maryland District Court Judge Paula Xinis. She will consider an order to release Abrego Garcia as part of his habeas corpus petition, which challenges his detention at a U.S.immigration and Customs Enforcement facility. If the Trump administration is making no effort to remove Abrego Garcia, Xinis said the issue then becomes indefinite detainment of an individual, which runs against a Supreme Court ruling that found immigrants can’t be detained longer than six months if they are not in the process of being removed.Abrego Garcia, the Salvadoran immigrant whom the Trump administration mistakenly deported to his home country and to a notorious mega-prison before returning him to the United States to face criminal charges, has thrown the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration crackdown into the spotlight.

Xinis, nominated by former President Joe Biden, scheduled another hearing Friday, which will be about Abrego Garcia’s possible removal to Eswatini, formerly known as Swaziland. The African country has aided the Trump administration in accepting third-country removals.Department of Justice attorney Jonathan D. Guynn during Monday’s hearing confirmed such a removal is planned at some point by the administration.Xinis pressed DOJ attorneys on exactly what steps the federal government has taken to send Abrego Garcia to Eswatini.Guynn said the federal government has not formally started a plan of removal, but said he could not confirm if removal plans were in motion. He argued that there are no imminent plans by the federal government to remove Abrego Garcia and the DOJ is trying to show that by keeping him in ICE custody.“The government feels like it's in the damned if it does, damned if it doesn't, situation,” Guynn said. “The government has been trying to respond … about concerns that Mr. Abrego Garcia will be rapidly removed from the United States, notwithstanding his habeas case, and ongoing immigration proceedings, and so in an abundance of caution... the United States is not imminently planning to remove Mr. Abrego Garcia.” Previously the Trump administration planned to deport Abrego Garcia to either Uganda or Eswatini. DOJ attorneys also asked for a temporary stay in the habeas corpus petition because of the government shutdown. Xinis denied the stay. She pointed to the DOJ's own shutdown contingency plan, which allows for litigation concerning habeas petitions to continue. Protests in support of Abrego GarciaAbout an hour before Monday’s hearing, the immigrant advocacy group CASA led a rally in front of the courthouse to continue its show of support for Abrego Garcia.About 100 people led chants shouting, “We are Kilmar!” “No More” and “When we fight, we win!” and held signs in support of Abrego Garcia and criticizing the Trump administration.

Religious leaders said prayers and a few other people spoke, such as Krystal Oriadha, who serves as vice chair of the Prince George’s County Council. Oriadha’s father was born in Kenya and immigrated to the U.S., where he met her mother in college.“I understand the story of immigration, and it’s one that has been such a story of pride in my life because it’s filled of sacrifice, yes and struggles, but pride and love for your family and hard work,” she said. “It is what every immigrant stands for, not the propaganda that this administration is propping up calling hardworking, loving families criminals, demonizing them. So let’s be careful and mindful of the propaganda that they’re spilling today.”Tennessee chargesThe federal judge in Abrego Garcia’s criminal trial in Tennessee, in which he is accused of human smuggling of immigrants, on Friday granted Abrego Garcia an evidentiary hearing. It will determine if those charges from the Trump administration are an illegal retaliation after Abrego Garcia successfully brought a suit challenging his wrongful deportation to El Salvador. Separately, an immigration judge last week denied Abrego Garcia’s request to reopen his asylum case. Abrego Garcia first came to the U.S. without legal authorization as a teenager in 2011. He tried to open an asylum case in 2019, but was denied because he did not apply within his first year in the U.S., which is the legal deadline for such claims.The Friday decision from that immigration judge ends one of the efforts for Abrego Garcia’s lawyers to keep him in the U.S., due to his protections from deportation to El Salvador. A separate immigration judge granted Abrego Garcia those protections from El Salvador in 2019, finding that Abrego Garcia would likely face violence if returned to his home country. At the time, the federal government didn’t search for a third country to remove Abrego Garcia. Six-month limitMonday’s hearing focused on the time frame of Abrego Garcia’s detainment and whether it conflicted with a 2001 Supreme Court case, in which justices ruled immigrants who are not in the process of removal cannot be kept in ICE detention for more than six months. Xinis questioned the reason for Abrego Garcia’s detention since late August if the Trump administration had no evidence of its plans to remove the longtime Maryland man. Another DOJ attorney, Bridget K. O’Hickey, said the federal government has not formalized a removal plan for Abrego Garcia, adding that she didn’t know if there were any plans in the process. Xinis called a short break in the middle of Monday’s hearing to give the DOJ attorneys time to make any calls to get information if the Trump administration was removing him. DOJ attorney Ernesto H. Molina said he was unable to reach anyone, pointing to the possible furlough of federal workers.

“It just is remarkable to me that you're saying you can't find a soul who can give you, in this case, any additional information,” Xinis said. “That suggests there is none.” One of Abrego Garcia’s lawyers in the Maryland case, Simon Y. Sandoval-Moshenberg, argued that if the Trump administration wanted to remove Abrego Garcia, they would send him to Costa Rica, which has already agreed to accept Abrego Garicia as a refugee.

Xinis asked why Abrego Garcia hasn’t been removed to Costa Rica. “We've received no communications, and I can't even wrap my brain to think of a constitutionally permissible reason why they would be fighting over whether to send them across the Atlantic Ocean when they can, this afternoon, send him to Costa Rica,” Sandoval-Moshenberg said.Xinis asked the DOJ attorneys if there has been any effort to remove Abrego Garcia to Costa Rica, but Molina and O’Hickey said they have not been informed of those efforts.Human smuggling chargesAttorneys for Abrego Garcia’s criminal case in Nashville said in court filings that the Trump administration was trying to force him to plead guilty to  human smuggling charges by promising to remove him to Costa Rica if he does so, and threatening to deport him to Uganda if he refuses. Abrego Garcia has pleaded not guilty and was ordered released by the federal judge in Tennessee to await his trial there in January on charges he took part in a long-running conspiracy to smuggle immigrants without legal status across the United States.

In late August, after Abrego Garcia was released from U.S. Marshals Service custody in Tennessee, immigration officials informed him he had to appear in Baltimore before the ICE field office for a check-in appointment. During that appointment, Abrego Garcia was detained. Xinis has previously ordered the Trump administration cannot remove Abrego Garcia from the U.S. while his habeas petition continues, and that he must be kept within 200 miles of the courthouse in Greenbelt, Maryland. Last month, the Trump administration transferred Abrego Garcia from a facility in Virginia to an ICE detention facility 189 miles away in Pennsylvania. William J.

(Photo by Laura Paton/Rhode Island Current)Energy savings for nearly 1 million households and jobs for hundreds of thousands of union laborers are in jeopardy under the abrupt cancellation of federal solar energy funds, according to a lawsuit filed Monday against the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and its administrator, Lee Zeldin.
The 47-page complaint submitted in the U.S. District Court in Rhode Island centers on the ramifications of the yanked Solar for All grants for solar panel installation companies, labor unions, homeowners and nonprofit advocates.
“If Defendants’ unlawful termination of the Solar for All program is allowed to stand, nearly one million low-income households will lose access to affordable, resilient solar in communities in all states and territories, and hundreds of thousands of good-paying, high-quality jobs will be lost, especially in the low-income and disadvantaged communities Congress intended these funds to benefit,” the complaint states.
The lawsuit, filed by attorneys with the Lawyers’ Committee for Rhode Island, the Southern Environmental Law Center, Lawyers for Good Government and the Conservation Law Foundation, comes more than two months after the EPA abruptly ended the Solar for All program. Originally included in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act approved under the Biden administration, the $7 billion program aimed to help low- and moderate-income homeowners and renters access the benefits of solar panels — often too expensive or unfeasible otherwise — while advancing renewable energy use and creating jobs.
Funding was distributed in 2024 to state and local governments, nonprofits and tribal organizations nationwide, including a $49.3 million award to Rhode Island through the state’s Office of Energy Resources. 
Rhode Island had spent $89,000 of its share — on employee costs for administration preparation — when the money was clawed back, Christopher Kearns, acting energy commissioner, said in an email Monday.
But development work was well underway, with the state agency in tandem with labor leaders and nonprofit partners intent on maximizing the benefits of its federal windfall. The five-year program was projected to help 900,000 households nationwide save $350 million annually on their energy bills while creating 200,000 new jobs and workforce training programs, according to estimates from the Biden administration.
RI AFL-CIO leads the charge
The Rhode Island AFL-CIO, which represents 80,000 union workers in Rhode Island, is the lead plaintiff in the lawsuit. Union leaders helped Rhode Island plan and submit its application to the EPA seeking funding through the program, simultaneously creating and boosting workforce training and apprenticeship programs to prepare for the frenzy of new solar panel installations.
“Because of the requirement for prevailing wages and utilization of apprentices, the hope was that this would end up going to union contractors because we already pay prevailing wages and we always have professional apprenticeships in place,” Patrick Crowley, RI AFL-CIO president, said in an interview Monday. 
Meanwhile, the Rhode Island Center for Justice, a nonprofit public interest law firm, increased its staff by 20% — from eight to 10 attorneys — to focus on the state regulations governing solar energy and utilities in preparation for the federal grant, said Jennifer Wood, the center’s executive director. 
The Center for Justice is also named as a plaintiff in the lawsuit, along with a Georgia homeowner who had already applied for a free solar installation, and several businesses and nonprofits involved in solar panel installation, financing and education.
None of the plaintiffs were direct recipients of the Solar for All grants, but all stood to benefit from the funds awarded — and are now “significantly harmed” by the funding termination, the lawsuit states.
“By not having this program, it’s a lost opportunity for hundreds of jobs,” Crowley said. 
Kearns, with Rhode Island’s Office of Energy Resources, declined to comment on the lawsuit.
Access issues 
Wood lamented the time and resources spent training two new attorneys on the complexities of state utility proceedings that govern the incentives for and implementation of solar energy in Rhode Island. More consequential, though, was the loss for low-income Rhode Island residents already struggling to afford rising energy bills and unlikely to reap benefits of solar energy without the federal aid.
“There are a lot of questions around solar, how it gets implemented, how the infrastructure works, but for our clients, the question is, can they even get access to it at all?” Wood said. “Not getting funding from Solar for All means our low-income customers may not be able to break into the benefits of solar power. That’s why it’s such a devastating blow.”










“Not getting funding from Solar for All means our low-income customers may not be able to break into the benefits of solar power. That’s why it’s such a devastating blow.”

The Trump administration’s opposition to renewable energy was clear on the campaign trail, and cemented as soon as he took office: halting offshore wind projects, yanking electric vehicle incentives, and freezing access to federal grants and loans for energy efficiency programs and solar panels, among others. 
Federal budget cuts signed into law on July 4 canceled $16 billion of clean energy and emissions reductions incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act, a move affirmed by an appeals court in D.C. on Oct. 1. But the federal budget cuts only applied to funds not already committed to specific projects or recipients – suggesting the Solar for All funding was preserved, according to the lawsuit.
It alleges that Zeldin ignored the congressional directive and its “unambiguous text” when he announced in a social media video on Aug. 7 that the EPA was canceling the Solar for All program — violating the Administrative Procedures Act as well as constitutional protections for legislative authority.
The move drew swift condemnation from Democrats in Congress, including Rhode Island U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, ranking member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works. Gov. Dan McKee also denounced the news, accusing the Trump administration of “trying to undermine programs that support Rhode Island families” in a statement on Aug. 12.
“Congress designed Solar for All grants to give local front-line communities the tools to lower household energy costs and ensure high-quality careers for a new generation with clean, renewable energy,” Amy R. Romero, chief legal counsel of Lawyers’ Committee for Rhode Island, said in a statement Monday. “The Lawyers’ Committee for Rhode Island, along with its colleagues, has brought suit against the federal government to enforce the law enacted by Congress and ensure Rhode Islanders receive what Congress intended.”
The complaint asks a federal judge to force the federal administration to restore funding for the program, and declare its termination unlawful.
A spokesperson for the EPA declined to comment in an emailed response on Monday.
The case was assigned to District Judge Mary S. McElroy.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-06 18:35:37+00:00,CT Mirror,Kosta Diamantis trial starts with prosecutors outlining alleged bribes,Andrew Brown,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/06/kosta-diamantis-trial-begins/,"In opening arguments, an attorney laid out the case against Diamantis, including the variety of locations where he allegedly accepted bribes.","The alleged bribes to Konstantinos Diamantis, head of Connecticut’s school construction office at the time, were delivered to him in a variety of locations, according to prosecutors.
The cash payments were allegedly dropped off at Diamantis’ house in Farmington. They were exchanged in the bathroom of the Capitol Grille in Hartford. And they were passed along to him in a Dunkin’ Donuts across from the government office building where he worked.
During opening arguments of his criminal trial in U.S. District Court in Bridgeport, federal prosecutors painted Diamantis, a former state deputy budget director, as someone who was eager to profit off of his public position and “begged, pleaded and threatened” school contractors to pay him bribes.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Jonathan Francis spent nearly half an hour during the opening day of the high-profile criminal trial laying out the case against Diamantis and previewing some of the evidence and testimony that jurors will see during the weekslong trial.
Diamantis was officially charged last year with more than 22 federal counts of bribery, extortion, conspiracy and lying to federal investigators, following a multiyear investigation. 
The federal prosecutors told the jurors that they would prove that Diamantis solicited bribes from construction firms in return for him exerting his control over the state’s multibillion dollars school building program, which he oversaw for more than six years.

And they quickly followed up those arguments by providing a preview of several text messages, emails and voicemails in which Diamantis and the school construction contractors discussed how much was expected to be paid.
“Just so you both (know). I’m very good at what I do and always do what I say,” Diamantis wrote in one of those text messages. “And I always usually work at 5 percent of total. Just FYI.” 
Diamantis, who was fired from his job as state deputy budget director in 2021, sat silently at the defense table taking notes, as prosecutors laid out the case against him. 
Meanwhile, Diamantis’ defense attorney, Norm Pattis, declined to deliver his own opening arguments to the jury. 
The first witness that prosecutors called to the witness stand quickly put the criminal allegations into perspective.
John Duffy, the former vice president of Acranom Masonry, repeatedly admitted to the jury that he and his boss Sal Monarca paid bribes to Diamantis. And in return, Duffy said, Diamantis secured work for Acranom on the state-funded school projects.
Prosecutors walked Duffy, who is Diamantis’ former brother-in-law, through a set of text messages and emails that allegedly showed Diamantis using his influence to ensure Acranom won a multimillion contract for the masonry work on the Weaver High School project in Hartford. 
“Please make sure vote tonight goes for us. Talk to your guy,” Duffy wrote to Diamantis in one exchange.
In response Diamantis wrote: “I already did.”
“Thanks bro,” Duffy replied. “U should be president.”

Duffy’s text messages also showed how Diamantis continued to hound the executives from Acranom for more money in return for his continued assistance on Connecticut school projects. 
“He’s all about full time consultation and annual fee,” Duffy wrote at one point referring to Diamantis. 
“We paid him 35k,” Monarca, the owner of Acranom masonry, replied.
Duffy, who already pleaded guilty to bribery last year, calmly testified about his dealings with Diamantis during the trial Monday.
But prosecutors also forced Duffy to admit that he initially lied when he was first questioned by federal investigators about the alleged bribery. 
Duffy told the jurors that he only acknowledged the alleged bribery after being confronted with the mountain of text messages that were obtained by prosecutors.
“I saw a number of texts that proved what really happened,” Duffy told the jury. 
Prosecutors claim that Duffy was not the only person who sought to cover up their actions. 
During the opening arguments, Francis also told the jury that they would get to listen to several recorded interviews in which Diamantis allegedly lied to investigators about accepting money from Acranom and another contractor, Construction Advocacy Professionals. 
They also highlighted a text message in which Diamantis instructed Duffy to delete their written conversations. 
“Erase this shit,” he wrote.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025_1006_SR_KostaTrialDay1_130-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-06 14:58:21.067469

(Photo by Jose Luis Pelaez Inc./Getty Images)Iowa schools recently kicked off October National Farm to School Month by serving at least two locally grown food items for breakfast, lunch, or snacks. On Oct. 8, school students will tackle the ambitious goal of achieving 1 million crunches of locally grown apples during the Great Apple Crunch.
But a different type of crunch time challenge is threatening to take a bite out of both student nutrition and the bottom line of small local farmers during the 2025-26 school year.
“As much as I love local food, it’s more expensive,” says Kaitlyn Scheuermann, Waukee Community Schools registered dietician nutritionist. “We need to pay farmers fair value, but when you buy a local apple for 60 cents, it means you only have about $3.65 left to buy protein and milk. The school lunch program runs on a shoestring budget, and food and labor costs are up.”
That’s why after six months of cutbacks and cancellations, it seemed like a huge win when U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins recently announced with great fanfare up to $18 million in revamped Farm to School funding for fiscal year 2026. The grants range from $100,000 to $500,000, and are the largest total annual amount in the program’s history.
But at Pleasant Grove Homestead near Fremont, Ashley and Zach Wenke aren’t so sure that their local produce and egg business would benefit. Based on her experience, Scheuermann has reservations about the revised grant criteria.
“The Patrick Leahy Farm to School grants have been around for several years, and our school has participated,” Scheuermann says. “Although the grant amounts are larger, no more than 10 percent of the grant budget can be allocated to buy food. The $18 million will be competitively awarded across the entire U.S.”
If the revised grant restores only a limited menu of options for farmers and schools to participate, it’s unlikely to advance the Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) goals for children and families. Is it simply window dressing for shrinking federal support for local foods?
Grant helps prepare the seedbed
Since 2013, the Patrick Leahy Farm to School Grants Program has awarded $100 million to help schools build infrastructure and capacity, including planting school gardens, buying kitchen equipment, food safety training for farmers, and ag education.
Between 2013 and 2024, Iowans received $1.6 million to undertake 21 of these projects. Then in March 2025, the grant was canceled, and funding for fiscal year 2025 was pulled midstream.
“The larger grants may attract more partnerships, bigger collaborations,” Scheuermann says. “But the size may discourage others. Smaller schools may need to partner with others, like ISU Extension, or nearby schools. Matching funds also are required.”
But the Patrick Leahy Farm to School grant is only a single fiber of a federal patchwork of programs stitched together to create local partnerships between farmers, schools, food banks, and child care centers.

Two other programs launched during the COVID-19 pandemic to provide federal dollars to schools, child care facilities and food banks were canceled at the same time: the Local Food for Schools (LFS) Cooperative Agreement Program and the Local Food Purchase Assistance (LFPA) Cooperative Agreement Program. Both focused on targeted purchases from producers and facilitated local food partnerships.W
Due to these cancellations, Iowa schools and child care facilities lost a total of $8.3 million in promised grants over the next three years; food banks and pantries would have received another $3 million.
Scheuermann says Waukee Schools also participated in LFS, and worked closely with Farm Table Delivery, a nonprofit hub in Harlan that aggregated local foods. “Without this grant, it adds another layer of complexity to work directly with producers,” she says.
Laying the groundwork for a local foods farm
The Wenkes first applied for LFS and LFPA in 2021. By the time they found out the grant funds were canceled in 2025, they had ordered and paid for 350 birds and planted vegetables in their high tunnels. “Many don’t appreciate how far ahead growers have to be thinking, planning, and purchasing,” Ashley Wenke said.
The grants, which had helped them scale up production over the past few years, were built into their business plan. “It was a way to project a predictable income and stay as close to home as possible with our products,” Wenke said.
Most of their eggs and 55 types of their garden produce were distributed to food pantries and schools through the Grinnell Farm to Table Hub. They also delivered 200 pounds of cherry tomatoes per week to Iowa City’s Field to Family nonprofit food hub and market.
After the grant cancellations, the Wenkes added a farmers market to their schedule. “The markets are time consuming, and when weather isn’t good, sales can be disappointing,” she said. They also sold some of their hens.
The Choose Iowa Food Purchasing Program passed by the Iowa Legislature earlier this year was one step in the right direction. The Wenkes participate in this state program created to help food banks buy local foods. However, the total state appropriation is only $200,000. “Our farm alone had $50,000 in income from the two federal grant programs that were canceled,” Wenke said.
Food banks report rising needs
Emily Shearer has worked at Food Bank of Iowa for nine years, and as a food purchaser, she’s witnessed firsthand the positive impact of the LFPA on the food pantries in 55 of the 99 counties served.
“It’s often cost prohibitive to buy local foods, but LFPA provided options to buy cheese, lettuce, ground pork and beef, and other items,” she says. “It’s not true that people don’t want to eat healthy. It’s more expensive.”
Food Bank of Iowa distributed 27.3 million pounds of food in fiscal year 2025, an 8% increase over 2024. “We’ll still invest in local foods, but it may not be as consistent,” she says. “We’re having to do more with less.”
Although LFS and LPFA were launched to ease COVID supply chain shortages, Shearer says new sources of food insecurity are emerging.
“We’re distributing more than at the height of COVID, due to a combination of increasing food costs and a lot of jobs that don’t pay well,” she says. “The need is record and rising. We’ve never seen it at this level. We have to make sure people know food pantries can help.”
Scheuermann echoes this concern. “An estimated 2.4 million people will lose their SNAP benefits,” she says. “That means their children will lose their automatic eligibility to free-and-reduced school meals.”
This raises the question: If MAHA wants kids to eat healthier, why is the government cutting school, child care, and food bank funding? How does pulling out the rug from farmers producing fresh, healthy foods advance MAHA goals?
Local food is healthier, tastes better, supports our neighbors, and builds community. An accessible network of local food producers also builds resilience into our food supply to safeguard against the risks of climate change, trade wars, and future pandemics.
Crunch time challenge for local food supply chain
At the Food Bank of Iowa, Shearer witnessed the federal grants creating positive change. “It was great meeting growers and learning there’s a robust local foods landscape out here, contrary to the stereotype of Iowa farms. A lot of people worked for years to grow their farms and build regional food hubs. Continuing this momentum will be a challenge.”
Local food producers are hard to replace markets and carve new distribution channels. “It’s a lot of work to find a home for your products, and it’s more unpredictable now,” Wenke says. “We’re more cautious to sign any future agreements that leave us unprotected if cancelled. But we’re the type of people who figure things out. We want to keep doing this, and we’re too far into it to back out now.”

(File photo by Getty Images)The State Law Enforcement Division is investigating a fire that erupted over the weekend at the Edisto Island home of a circuit court judge and her husband, a former state senator.
Three people were injured in the fire that consumed the home belonging to Judge Diane Goodstein and former Democratic Sen. Arnold Goodstein on Saturday. All three people were taken to the Medical University of South Carolina, two by ambulance and one in an air evacuation, said Capt. KC Campbell, spokesperson for Colleton County Fire-Rescue.

Campbell declined to say who was injured because of patient privacy laws or even who was in the house at the time. Information about their condition as of Monday morning was not available. Nor was any information about the cause of the fire. SLED’s investigation is ongoing, and the state’s law enforcement agency will provide more information as it becomes available, said spokeswoman Renée Wunderlich.
Diane Goodstein, 69, a circuit court judge since 1998, recently signed off on an order blocking the release of voters’ information to the federal Department of Justice as part of a lawsuit over privacy concerns. The state Supreme Court overturned Goodstein’s order, saying she acted too quickly. The case was moved to a different court, since the agency involved is not located in Goodstein’s circuit, which spans Calhoun, Orangeburg and Dorchester counties.
The three-story house’s location on a barrier island complicated firefighting efforts, according to St. Paul’s Fire District, which helps respond to emergencies in small Lowcountry communities. The water supply near the island is limited, and the area is difficult to maneuver. People inside the house jumped out of windows and into the backyard, where kayakers brought them to the waiting ambulances, according to the department’s Saturday statement.

The Goodsteins bought the house and the surrounding 1.3 acres of marsh for $700,000 in 2019, according to county property records.
John Kittredge, chief justice of the state Supreme Court, was aware of the incident and requested additional security for Goodstein, according to a Saturday statement. The state’s highest court declined to comment further until the investigation is complete, asking people to respect “the privacy of the Goodstein family during this difficult time,” according to a Monday news release.
Diane and Arnold Goodstein have two adult children, Arnold Goodstein II and Eva Goodstein, according to Diane Goodstein’s judicial biography. Arnold Goodstein, 81, represented Charleston and Georgetown counties in the Senate from 1975 to 1980, following a two-term stint in the House, according to his legislative biography.
Although no information about the cause of the fire has been made publicly available, Ashley Creech, president of the South Carolina Association for Justice, called the idea of a judge facing threats or attacks for ruling a certain way “deeply concerning.”
“As a society and as a state, we must reject hostility and intimidation in all forms,” Creech said.
Judges must be able to make impartial rulings without fear that an unhappy party might attack them or their loved ones, Creech said.
“What matters most right now is that Judge Goodstein is safe and that those injured are receiving the care and support they need,” Creech said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/court-gavel-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-06 14:58:21.067469

(Photo courtesy of Ben Ackman/Jersey City Times)June’s legislative primaries were the most expensive in state history, the New Jersey Election Law Enforcement Commission announced Monday.
Assembly candidates and outside spending groups backing their bids poured nearly $30.7 million into the races, eclipsing the previous spending record reached in 2015, when candidates and outside groups spent $18.3 million on primaries after adjustments for inflation.
All 80 Assembly seats are on the ballot this year.  State Senate seats are not up for grabs until 2027.
Commission officials credited contribution limits that rose dramatically under a 2023 law for the increase.
The Elections Transparency Act doubled the maximum donation to candidates to $5,200, from $2,600, and the commission raised those limits to $5,500 under a provision of the act that requires the state to account for inflation every two years.
The surge of Assembly candidacies this year also contributed to higher spending totals, the commission said. This year, 209 individuals filed to run for Assembly, the most since 252 people ran in 1977.
Though seven of those candidates were knocked off the ballot as a result of challenges to their nominating petitions, the 202 that ran this year still far outnumbered candidates in recent Assembly cycles. Assembly races between 2015 and 2023 averaged 177 candidacies, the commission said.
Each of the 10 most expensive Assembly primaries was contested on at least one side.
District spending peaked at nearly $2.8 million in the 19th District, where Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin (D-Middlesex) and Assemblywoman Yvonne Lopez (D-Middlesex) faced a long-shot challenge from social worker Michelle Burwell.
Candidates and outside groups spent more than $2.5 million in the 32nd District. There, an insurgent slate led by Hoboken Mayor Ravi Bhalla (D) and former New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency chief of staff Katie Brennan (D) beat out county-backed challengers and incumbent Assemblywoman Jessica Ramirez (D-Hudson).
Together, the state’s 10 most expensive Assembly primaries accounted for just over half of all spending on the lower-chamber races, or just under $16 million.
Outside spending on legislative primaries also reached a new peak. Independent expenditure groups put about $2.7 million into this year’s Assembly primaries, eclipsing the $2.3 million record reached in 2021’s primaries, which included primaries for both legislative chambers.
New Jersey holds Assembly elections in every odd-numbered year. Senators serve a four-year term or a two-year term for elections held at the start of the decade. Senators elected in 2027 will serve for four years, and those elected in 2031 will serve for two.

(Piper Hutchinson/Louisiana Illuminator) An LSU student arrested last week for protesting at a presidential search committee meeting said police became hostile toward her once they learned she is transgender. The questionable treatment she alleges continued once she was taken to jail, where she said guards didn’t know where she should be kept.    
Gabriela Juárez, 20, was arrested after she refused to cede the microphone after reaching the three-minute limit for public comment at Wednesday’s meeting. Six other student protestors tried to block the police car taking Juárez away and were also arrested. All are members of the LSU chapter of Students for a Democratic Society, who claim Gov. Jeff Landry – not campus leaders, faculty or students – is secretly steering the process to hire the university’s next president.  
While the other six students were charged with misdemeanors and released from the campus police station, Juárez was charged with interference with educational process, which is a felony, and misdemeanor resisting arrest. 
In an interview Thursday, Juárez said LSU Police officers began treating her differently when they discovered she is transgender. They initially referred to Juárez as “she” or “her,” she said. But when she told police her legal name, which is different from the one she uses, they began treating her with more hostility and referred to her as “he” or “him,” Juárez said. 
LSU spokesman Todd Woodward, who also represents the campus police department, declined to comment on Juarez’s allegations. 
When Juárez was taken to East Baton Rouge Parish Prison, she said correctional officers conducted a strip search on her. While she was still unclothed, she said they discussed whether she should be kept with the men or the women at the jail. 
“They said to the officer, ‘I have someone here who is bottom parts male but up top fully female,’” Juárez said in an interview. “And so they had no idea what to do with me.” 
Juárez said she was given a women’s uniform and put into a cell by herself, with officers telling her they were concerned she would be sexually assaulted otherwise. Despite her women’s uniform, Juárez said other officers interrogated her about her gender and loudly referred to her as a man. 
Juárez also said she was not given the opportunity for a phone call after her arrest. Other student members were able to get her release without getting in contact with her, she said. 
The East Baton Rouge Sheriff’s office has not yet responded to a request for comment. 
Juárez must appear in court for her charges Jan. 5, though she said she believes the charges will be dropped before then. Until her court date, she has been banned from entering the LSU Foundation building, where the LSU Presidential Search Committee holds its meetings. 
The other six students were told they would receive their court summonses in the mail within the next two weeks. 
Chaotic meeting
Fifteen angry students sprung from their seats the moment LSU Police officers grabbed Juárez at Wednesday’s committee meeting. 
She and six other members of Students for a Democratic Society made public comments at the meeting, many dressing down the 20 members of the search committee that they characterized as illegitimate. Several wore white T-shirts with the slogan “No MAGA President.” 
Some made profane comments — Juárez alleged the only criteria for serving on the committee was to “be a millionaire and suck off the governor” — though most kept their language clean until the police stepped in. 
“Don’t f—ing touch me,” Juárez shouted as the first LSU Police officer grabbed her arm. 
“Am I being detained?” she shouted as two officers dragged her out of the room. 
After Juárez was taken from the room, the chaos continued. Several students in her organization remained behind to protest Juárez’s removal. 

“Shame on you,” they shouted, until another police officer escorted them out of the room. The students cursed at the police as they left. 
Outside the LSU Foundation building, Juárez was searched, handcuffed and placed in the back of an LSU Police cruiser. Her friends watched, shouted and recorded video on their phones as she was arrested. 
Police officers warned their peers — and several nearby reporters — to stay 25 feet away from them, referencing a state law approved last year that prohibits the public from getting within that distance of a working officer after being told to stay back. The law is currently blocked from being enforced while it’s challenged in court. 
The six students who blocked the police cruiser were handcuffed and led to the sidewalk, where they sat in the sun until more cars arrived to take them away. They were charged with simple obstruction of a highway and resisting an officer with force.

Juárez was held in jail until other students posted $1,000 bail on her behalf after midnight Thursday.  An LSU Police report lists her victims as the campus police department, the public and the university. 
Juárez said she believes she was targeted for her activism. She has been at the forefront of the Students for a Democratic Society’s campus protests against Israel, Landry, President Donald Trump and the LSU administration. 
The Louisiana Republican Party called on LSU to discipline Juárez for her comments criticizing ultra-conservative activist Charlie Kirk in the wake of his shooting death last month. Juárez shared an Instagram story that referred to Kirk as a “world famous fascist” with the caption “rejoice.” 
“In a moment where they are actively cultivating a panic around the presence of Latinos and the presence of trans people, and especially transgender women … I do believe that that – combined with the fact that I have a high profile on campus – led to them wanting to make an example out of me, and wanting to intimidate me specifically, and to use me as a show of force to scare other students into being silent,” Juárez said.
Charges rare for public comment violations
LSU Board Chairman Scott Ballard, who asked police to remove Juárez, said that while she was out of line, he didn’t think she should be criminally charged. 
“I don’t want any student to be barred with a mistake she made,” Ballard said. “I hope that cooler heads prevail.”
Juárez said she believes she was the only one taken to the parish prison because she was the only non-white person in the group and a transgender woman. 
“LSU PD wants to pretend like this wasn’t targeted because it would be blatantly corrupt if it was. But it was and it is,” Juárez said. 
In a comment passed through the university’s spokesman, LSU Police Chief Marshall Walters said Juárez was taken to prison “because of her level of physically resisting the arrest.” 
While it’s not uncommon for members of the public to exceed their allotted time for speaking – or even to angrily interject outside of public comment periods – it’s rare for those incidents to lead to arrests. 
Since 2018, there have only been three reported incidents of arrests in Louisiana for speaking out of turn at public meetings. In two of those cases, charges were ultimately dropped.  
“It’s important for public bodies to control the meeting and make sure when it’s orderly as long as those rules are being applied to everyone in a fair manner,” said attorney Scott Sternberg, who specializes in First Amendment cases. “We see all the time people being cut off and asked to sit down or even asked to leave if they are disorderly.” 

“Being arrested for speaking at a public meeting is very, very strange, and there must have been some other aggravating factor,” Sternberg added. 
Juárez’s charge for interfering with an educational process is also unusual, Sternberg said. According to the law, the charge is applicable when the violator, while on school grounds, “willfully impedes the staff or faculty of such institution in the lawful performance of their duties” or if they “willfully refuse” to leave school property when requested to do so if the person is disrupting the operations of the institution. 
Juárez and the other arrested students said they heard police officers discussing using ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence chatbot, to determine what charges the students should face.
Woodward declined to comment on this assertion.

(Photo by John Oldham/Arkansas National Guard)More than 100 Arkansas National Guards members traveled to the nation’s southern border this weekend to support U.S. Customs and Border Patrol. 
The 13-month deployment supports a federal requirement and is a routine rotation to replace National Guard units currently serving along the southern border, according to a news release. 
A departure ceremony was held Sunday morning for nearly 120 troops and four UH-72 Lakota aircraft from 1st Battalion,114th Security and Support Aviation Regiment, 77th Expeditionary Combat Aviation Brigade. The helicopter unit, which includes pilots, crew chiefs, mechanics, flight operations personnel, fuelers and battalion staff, was mobilized for a Title 10 federal active duty deployment and is expected to return in November 2026. 
Brig. Gen. Chad Bridges, Arkansas’ adjutant general, said he is “immensely proud” of the guardsmen “as they answer the call to serve our state and nation.” 
“As Governor Sanders has often highlighted, their unwavering dedication, exceptional skills, and profound professionalism are a true testament to the strength and commitment of Arkansas,” Bridges said in the release. “They embody the very best of our state as they undertake this critical mission.”

The 1-114th has subordinate units in Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, Oklahoma and Puerto Rico. The Arkansas guard crews will deploy with roughly 170 troops and more than a dozen other UH-72s from Bravo Company, 1-114th, from Texas and Oklahoma, and Charlie Company, 1-114th, from Mississippi and Louisiana, according to the release.
After traveling to a mobilization station in Fort Hood, Texas, the troops will disperse to various locations along the border with Mexico. 
The Arkansas National Guard has been to southern border states numerous times on federal missions, according to the release. Most recently the 875th Engineer Battalion in Jonesboro deployed 50 troops in 2022 and 2023 to Texas for one year to perform command and control of subordinate military companies on Title 10 orders. 
Arkansas governors have also deployed guardsmen to the southern border. In 2021, then-Gov. Asa Hutchinson ordered 13 guard members to Texas to provide vehicle maintenance support to the Texas National Guard for 90 days, according to the release. 
Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders ordered 80 guard members to Texas for 40 days in 2023 to perform lookout and observation post duties. In 2024, Sanders sent 40 troops to support the Texas National Guard for 60 days.

(Photo by Max Nesterak/Minnesota Reformer)A bitter regulatory battle that divided state government and fractured the Democratic-Farmer-Labor coalition came to an end Friday when utility regulators voted unanimously to approve the sale of northern Minnesota’s largest public electric utility.
After the $6.2 billion deal closes later this year, a subsidiary of asset management giant BlackRock will own 60% of Allete, the parent company of Minnesota Power. The Canada Pension Plan Investment Board will own the rest.
Allete’s management hailed the decision, saying that the new owners’ capital would help the company invest billions in new energy infrastructure to meet its obligations under Minnesota’s 2040 carbon-free power law. BlackRock and the Canadian pension board have said they would invest nearly $5 billion in Minnesota Power’s sprawling system over the next several years.
The decision “positions Allete well to meet the significant infrastructure demands of the clean-energy transition without compromising the high-quality service and commitments to reliability and affordability that define our company,” Allete chair, president and CEO Bethany Owen said in a statement.
The PUC’s decision also garnered support from Minnesota labor unions and some nonprofits that advocate for lower greenhouse gas emissions.
At a commission hearing on Sept. 25, Kevin Pranis, regional marketing manager for the Laborers’ International Union of North America, downplayed what he called “exaggerated fears” about the world’s largest asset manager owning a relatively small electric utility. He said the merger would be a good thing for Minnesota Power’s customers, including the large mining and industrial companies that argued it would undermine their economic competitiveness.
“We have only one interest in this proceeding…ensuring Minnesota Power continues to function as an independent utility,” he said. “We chased down every angle to make sure we’re not making a mistake that will hurt us and our reputation with our members.”
In a statement Friday, Allen Gleckner, chief policy officer of St. Paul-based clean energy group Fresh Energy, also nodded to public apprehension around the deal while calling it a win for the environment.
“Fresh Energy only decided to get involved in this proceeding after a thorough examination of the record and extensive conversations with stakeholders both for and against the sale,” he said. “We determined that the sale of Minnesota Power would significantly mitigate risk to the transition to clean energy in Minnesota.”
Fresh Energy and the Clean Grid Alliance registered their support for the proposed merger after the Minnesota Department of Commerce extracted commitments from Allete and the prospective buyers to freeze rates for one year, safeguard the independence of its 14-member board of directors and meet service quality standards while protecting lower-income ratepayers. Following the July 11 settlement, the department threw its support behind the deal, splitting with the Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, who remained staunchly opposed.
The merger is “consistent with private equity playbook,” assistant attorney general Peter Scholtz said at the Sept. 25 hearing. The partners aim to “put in as little of their own capital as possible…then sell for a profit,” he added.
The Office of Attorney General remained unpersuaded by a Sept. 24 agreement that secured additional commitments from Minnesota Power and its future owners. Those included $50 million in bill credits paid to Minnesota Power customers by 2032; $20 million in monthly bill discounts for eligible low-income customers; fines of $250,000 per violation of the agreed-upon service standards; and, a cap on Minnesota Power’s profit margin — which is set by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission — through 2030.
Scholtz noted that while Allete’s future owners agreed to cap their profits for five years, they would not agree to cap their return on investment, which opponents of the deal said could encourage it to overbuild expensive infrastructure. The agreement also calls into question the independence of Allete’s future board of directors and leaves open the possibility that BlackRock and CPPIB will sell Allete to another “financial buyer” in the coming years, he said.
Ratepayer groups and corporate watchdogs were likewise unmoved by the agreement, calling its ratepayer protections insufficient.
“While figures like $50 million may sound like a lot, the very temporary protections, programs, and funding tacked onto this deal cannot offset the billions of dollars of profit the new owners intend to reap from northern Minnesota households and businesses,” said Hudson Kingston, legal director for rural advocacy group CURE, in a statement that called the deal a “lose-lose for northern Minnesota.”
In a fact sheet published after the commission’s vote, Citizens Utility Board of Minnesota cited expert witness estimates that BlackRock and CPPIB are overpaying for Allete by as much as $1.5 billion. Ratepayers will eventually be on the hook for this “windfall for Allete shareholders,” it said.
CUB hinted that BlackRock and CPPIB were not being forthcoming about their plans to extract value from Allete and Minnesota Power, noting the parties’ extensive use of trade secret designations and redactions during the merger proceeding. At the Sept. 25 meeting, the Public Utilities Commission denied a motion by the Office of the Attorney General to remove trade secret designations from some filings.
And CUB questioned the buyers’ true commitment to Minnesota’s carbon-free power transition. BlackRock has extensive fossil-fuel investments, is a frequent opponent of climate-related motions by other shareholders in those companies and withdrew from a global climate finance coalition that subsequently suspended its activities, CUB said.
Despite those concerns, CUB Executive Director Annie Levenson-Falk struck a conciliatory tone in a statement following the commission’s vote.
“Though we disagree with the commission’s decision, we genuinely hope they are correct in their assessment,” she said.
With the Allete proceeding behind it, BlackRock is gearing up for future — and perhaps bigger — fights before state utility commissions. The Financial Times reported last month that BlackRock is eyeing a $38 billion deal for AES, a utility group and energy developer with operations on four continents.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/P1230519-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-06 14:58:21.067469

Wingate issued July 20. The order paused the enforcement of a state law that bans diversity, equity and inclusion programs in public schools.","The leader of the Senate committee that oversees U.S. courts is asking a federal judge in Mississippi to explain whether his office used artificial intelligence to write a flawed order in a recent case.
Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, sent a letter to U.S. District Judge Henry T. Wingate on Monday that questioned whether the judge or his clerks used AI to write an order. He also asked why the order in question had been removed from the public docket and whether the judge planned to restore the original order to the docket.
The letter stems from an error-laden temporary restraining order Wingate issued July 20, which paused the enforcement of a state law that bans diversity, equity and inclusion programs in public schools.

After the Mississippi Attorney General’s Office raised concerns about mistakes in the order — which included naming defendants and plaintiffs that weren’t parties to the case, misquoting state law and referencing a case that doesn’t exist — the judge replaced the order with a corrected version, wiping the original from the public docket. 
Wingate denied the state’s request to restore the original order with errors to the public docket and refused to explain the errors, chalking them up to “clerical” mistakes. But attorneys have questioned whether artificial intelligence was used to prepare it. It’s hard to know for certain, experts say, but the original order did contain errors that are “hallmarks” of AI usage.
“These do not appear to be simple slips of the pen or mechanical oversights, but substantive errors that undermine confidence in the Court’s deliberative process,” Grassley wrote. 
The state attorney general’s office has since appealed Wingate’s orders prohibiting the state from enforcing the DEI laws to the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals. Judges from the appellate court could also ask Wingate to explain the errors in the order. 
Wingate did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Grassley’s letter. 
Grassley’s letter, which cited reporting from Mississippi Today, is a general oversight inquiry and not a subpoena. He has given Wingate until Oct. 13 to respond to his questions.
With a U.S. senator weighing in on Wingate’s recent case, the Mississippi judge may now be at the center of how the federal judiciary polices itself over AI usage. 
The legal profession has seen a rise in AI use in recent years, with people relying on software or processes that attempt to replicate aspects of human work. These are trained on vast amounts of data to accomplish tasks such as researching court cases and citing them in legal briefs.  
But these systems are not perfect and can “hallucinate,” or provide false information. 
It’s increasingly common for judges to sanction lawyers for suspected artificial intelligence usage. Attorneys have a professional and ethical responsibility to make truthful statements in court and in legal filings, but there’s little accountability when the roles are reversed. 
Grassley, though, wrote that federal judges should also be held to the “highest standards of integrity, candor, and factual accuracy.”

The Supreme Court is expected to settle Trump's birthright citizenship challenge. (Photo by Leah Millis-Pool/Getty Images)A federal appeals court in Boston upheld a New Hampshire judge’s move to block President Donald Trump from eliminating birthright citizenship Friday, ruling in favor of a New Hampshire Indonesian organization and others. 
The ruling came as the same court, the 1st Circuit Court of Appeals, issued an exhaustive opinion against the Trump administration’s birthright citizenship actions in a separate lawsuit. Its decision in that case, Doe v. Trump, formed the basis for the ruling in the New Hampshire case.
In both rulings, the court rejected an attempt by the Trump administration to reinterpret the 14th Amendment and use that reinterpretation to deny automatic U.S. citizenship to the children of parents who are undocumented. 
Instead, the court pointed to centuries of judicial precedent that reads the 14th Amendment, adopted in 1868, as guaranteeing that right to citizenship based on birth — in particular, the 1898 case of U.S. v. Wong Kim Ark.
“Our nation’s history of efforts to restrict birthright citizenship — from Dred Scott in the decade before the Civil War to the attempted justification for the enforcement of the Chinese Exclusion Act in Wong Kim Ark — has not been a proud one,” the court wrote in its Doe decision. 
“… The ‘lessons of history’ thus give us every reason to be wary of now blessing this most recent effort to break with our established tradition of recognizing birthright citizenship and to make citizenship depend on the actions of one’s parents rather than — in all but the rarest of circumstances — the simple fact of being born in the United States.”
The rulings keep in place a February freeze by a New Hampshire court of the Trump administration’s reinterpretation. They also bring the matter one step closer to the U.S. Supreme Court, which is expected to ultimately settle it. 
But Friday’s opinion addressed only the first question of the lawsuit: whether the current preliminary injunction against Trump’s birthright citizenship order was proper. The underlying legal matter will still need to be worked through in the New Hampshire District Court — even if the U.S. Department of Justice appeals the Friday opinion. 
New Hampshire Indonesian Community Support is one of three plaintiffs in the New Hampshire-based lawsuit, NHICS v. Trump, along with the League of United Latin American Citizens and Make the Road New York. That lawsuit was filed by state and national branches of the American Civil Liberties Union.
The lawsuits seek to challenge a Jan. 20 executive order from Trump titled “Protecting the Meaning and Value of American Citizenship,” in which the president directed his departments to adopt a new interpretation of the 14th Amendment that eliminated the birthright citizenship right. The order argues that the amendment was not meant to grant automatic citizenship to anyone born in the country regardless of the immigration status of their parents, and that the federal government should not consider those people citizens.
In the legal complaint, the New Hampshire organization wrote that some of its members are undocumented and are expecting children, meaning they would be affected by the executive order. For instance, “Gail” and “Thomas” — whose names are pseudonyms created by attorneys in the case — are undocumented people who worried in February that the child they were expecting would not receive government benefits or a birth certificate. 
The lawsuit was brought against Trump, the heads of the Department of Homeland Security, State Department, Department of Agriculture, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and the departments themselves. 
But in its ruling Friday, the 1st Circuit Court decided that it could not apply an injunction to Trump — or his departments — directly, and that it was “an abuse of discretion” for New Hampshire District Court Judge Joseph Laplante to have done so. Instead, the appeals court narrowed the injunction to the leaders of the federal agencies.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/trumproberts-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-06 14:58:21.067469

Cindy Holscher, a Johnson County Democrat seeking the party's 2026 nomination for governor, appears for a recording of the Kansas Reflector podcast. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — All four of Democratic state Sen. Cindy Holscher successful campaigns for the Kansas Legislature were in districts distinguished by the strong influence of Republicans and independents.
Her political career began with defeat of GOP incumbent Rep. Amanda Grosserode in 2016 and reelection to that Johnson County seat in the Kansas House. Next was her 2020 campaign for a Kansas Senate seat held by retiring GOP Senate Majority Leader Jim Denning, in which Holscher defeated former Republican Rep. James Todd.
Now, in her biggest electoral test, Holscher is asking red-state Kansas to make her the Democratic Party’s nominee for governor in 2026 so she can attempt to follow in footsteps of Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly.
“It’s great training ground for a governor’s run. Of course, on the state level, you can’t just win with Democrat numbers. You have to have Republicans and independents,” Holscher said. “Kansans want commonsense solutions. That’s what it’s all about. I’m going to listen to people. I’m going to collaborate and work together with peers. I’m going to listen to the experts in terms of health care and issues like that.”



Voters of Kansas have a history of moving between Republican and Democratic governors. It began in 1965 with Republican William Avery, who was followed by Democrat Robert Docking, Republican Robert Bennett, Democrat John Carlin, Republican Mike Hayden, Democrat Joan Finney and Republican Bill Graves. From 2003 to 2011, Democrats Kathleen Sebelius and Mark Parkinson held the office. Republicans Sam Brownback and Jeff Colyer were in change from 2011 to 2019, at which point Kelly was elected to back-to-back terms as governor. She leaves office in January 2027.
“I wouldn’t have entered this race if there weren’t a path to victory for me,” Holscher said during a Kansas Reflector podcast interview.
She’s competing in the August 2026 primary against state Sen. Ethan Corson, D-Fairway, and Lawrence resident Marty Tuley.
 
Statehouse experience
Holscher, 56, said her nine years in the Legislature and a demonstrated ability to work across the aisle to pass legislation made her a viable candidate for governor.
She said she was among a group of House members who worked to adopt a bill in 2017 to expand eligibility for Medicaid. It wasn’t implemented because the House fell a few votes shy of overcoming Brownback’s veto.
She was a founder of the Women’s Bipartisan Caucus in the Legislature that formulated a plan to repeal the Brownback administration’s 2012 decision to slash state income taxes without sufficient resources to sustain funding for core programs in education, transportation and social services. The tax law was largely reversed in 2017 on a bipartisan vote after budget shortfalls made the tax policy unsustainable.
“We’ve had a lot of things happen every year since ending the experiment,” Holscher said. “Though, of course, the Brownback allies, the MAGA extremists, they have wanted to restart the Brownback experiment or some version of it. This is the concern.”
Holscher said Kansas was at a “crisis point” at the Capitol because two-thirds Republican supermajorities in the House and Senate continued to move damaging legislation to Kelly’s desk. The governor has relied on her veto authority, but she has been overridden many times.
In the future, Holscher said the presence of a Democratic governor and shrinking of the GOP’s numerical advantage in the House were important to balancing state policy.
“I’m not only committed to winning my race in terms of the governor’s race. I’m committed to flipping a few of those House seats. We just have to change the makeup of this Legislature,” she said.
 
‘That’s cheating’
She opposed the effort by Republicans in the Legislature to call a special session in November to consider new boundaries of the four congressional districts in a bid to undermine reelection of U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids, a Democrat serving the 3rd District in the Kansas City area. It would be done at behest of President Donald Trump, who has been anxious about the GOP’s potential loss of the U.S. House next year. The new Kansas map would divide Johnson County voters among two or three congressional districts.
“A lot of people are very concerned about this in Johnson County,” Holscher said. “It’s a scheme that is aimed to dilute the votes of hundreds of thousands of Kansans. There’s no reason to redistrict mid-decade except to rig the system in one party’s favor over another. Frankly, that’s not democracy. That’s cheating.”
Holscher was born on a farm at Slater, Missouri, as the granddaughter of tenant farmers. Her father worked in concrete construction, while her mother was employed at the local school as a bus driver and custodian.
She earned a degree at the University of Missouri to become a first-generation college graduate. Eventually, she moved to Johnson County to start a family. She worked in marketing before entering the Legislature.
In the statehouse, Holscher has been an advocate of funding K-12 public schools and an opponent of shifting millions of tax dollars to private schools.
“I’m a product of public schools. That’s what helped me rise out of poverty. I’m just so grateful to my teachers, the teachers my kids had who have had a profound impact on them. Our public schools hold together our communities,” she said.
She said private school vouchers were marketed as “school choice” and a way to assist lower-income kids enroll in better schools. In reality, she said, “it’s just a transfer of wealth” because seven of 10 vouchers go to families in which children already attend private school.
Holscher has been a supporter of abortion rights in the Legislature. She opposed the proposed 2022 amendment to the Kansas Constitution that would have made it easier to restrict reproductive health services in Kansas. The amendment failed by a margin of 59% to 41%. At stake was a Kansas Supreme Court decision that says the state constitution offered Kansans a fundamental right to bodily autonomy, which included the decision to end a pregnancy.
“We settled that essentially with the amendment in 2022,” Holscher said. “Some of the extremists in the Legislature want to keep bringing that topic back. The public overwhelmingly said they wanted to protect access to reproductive health care.”
Holscher said as governor she would work to moderate the cost of living in Kansas, including essentials such as child care, health care and housing.
“My focus is on just making sure that, you know, we are working to make life more affordable for Kansans,” she said. “I come from, essentially, a background that struggled. I can understand those situations.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/P9250016-e1759773246218-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-10-06 14:58:21.067469

FPL’s originally proposed base rate hike in February would have allowed it to collect $9.8 billion in revenue over the next four years — […],"Solar farm via Florida Power & Light, 2022.The Florida Public Service Commission (PSC) began the first phase of technical hearings in Tallahassee Monday for Florida Power & Light’s (FPL) proposed rate hike for its approximately 12 million customers.
FPL’s originally proposed base rate hike in February would have allowed it to collect $9.8 billion in revenue over the next four years — the highest in U.S. history. Since then, that has been negotiated down by approximately $2.9 billion — still far too high, energy advocates argue.
In her opening statement, Ali Wessling, attorney for the Office of Public Counsel (OPC), said the PSC’s statutory obligation is to regulate utilities such as FPL for the protection of the public welfare, which in this case means customers — not the corporation itself.
“Based on their filing in this case, they would have you believe that it is their welfare that we are here to protect,” she said, adding that over the course of the hearings, the OPC will provide expert testimony that many of FPL’s requests “would in fact cause harm to the welfare of FPL’s customers, and thus result in unfair, unjust, unreasonable, and thus unaffordable rates.”
In its filing for a base rate increase with the PSC in February, the company requested a return on equity (ROE) of 11.9%, several points higher than the industry standard of 9.68%, with a third of the proposed first-year increase going strictly to profits, according to the OPC.
However, just days before FPL was scheduled to begin hearings before the PSC on that proposal in August, the investor-owned utility announced an agreement with a group of key stakeholder groups, including the Florida Retail Federation, Walmart, and the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy (SACE). The company reduced its proposed  rate increase to $6.903 billion with a 10.95% ROE.
FPL has claimed that its latest version of a four-year plan would benefit customers through “rate stability and predictability.” That FPL is asking permission to raise its base rates in every year of the four-year plan contradicts that claim, Wessling said.
“Rate stability protects FPL’s welfare, not the customers with FPL’s welfare,” she said, adding that “bill stability” would certainly not be guaranteed in the four-year plan because of problems like storms and fuel prices.
The OPC says it intends to demonstrate that FPL’s rates should not increase by more than $35.2 million through 2027. It claims the proposed deal would increase FPL’s revenues by $6.753 billion through 2029, which it asserted in a filing with the PSC in August as “unconscionable.”
The first witness was FPL President CEO Armando Pimentel. He testified that the proposed base rate increase would result in an average increase on the total bill for “typical” 1,000-kWh residential customers of “roughly 2.5% a year.”
Along with the Office of Public Counsel, other organizations represented during the hearing include Floridians Against Increased Rates (FAIR), Florida Energy for Innovation Association, Federal Executive Agencies (FAE), Florida Rising, the  League of United Latin American Citizens of Florida (LULAC), and Environmental Confederation of Southwest Florida.

Susan Collins attends the ribbon cutting at the newly renovated American Red Cross facility in Portland, Maine on October. 6, 2025. (Photo by Eesha Pendharkar/ Maine Morning Star)At an event celebrating the renovation of the American Red Cross facility in Portland on Monday, U.S. Sen. Susan Collins criticized congressional Democrats over their refusal to support Republicans’ plan to keep the government running without lowering health care costs.
Collins and independent U.S. Sen Angus King appeared at the ribbon cutting hours before returning to Washington, D.C., where they are expected to hold a fifth vote on the House-passed Republican bill that would keep the government open until Nov. 21 as well as on Democrats’ counterproposal that aims to provide funding through October while restoring and permanently extending certain federal health funding and subsidies.
As the vast majority of both parties appeared entrenched in their positions, neither bills are expected to pass, prolonging the shutdown that began on Oct. 1.
“The consequences are going to be felt by federal employees who will start missing their paychecks starting at the end of this week, and by federal employees who are forced to work despite the fact that they’re not going to be paid,”  Collins said. “And that’s just not right.”
Both Collins and King voted in support of the GOP proposal, as well as U.S. Rep. Jared Golden, who was the only House Democrat to back the Republican bill. U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree and other Democrats have continued to call for negotiations over the short term funding deal, arguing that the upcoming expiration of health care tax credits and other cuts need to be urgently addressed.
Sharing concern about health costs, Maine delegation split over shutdown strategy

Known as the enhanced premium tax credit, the subsidies lower the cost of health insurance for people who buy coverage through the Affordable Care Act marketplace. Of the 61,000 Maine people who enroll through CoverME.gov, the state’s online marketplace, 85% rely on premium tax credits to reduce their monthly costs.
Collins on Monday reiterated her support for extending the credits, but she said she does not agree with that being part of the continuing resolution. Such a proposal is not “clean stopgap funding,” she said, which is what Republicans are proposing “to ensure that there is not a disruption of services, nor of paychecks to federal employees.”
“I do think we need an extension, but we also need some reforms, such as a cap on how much income you can earn, and that is totally feasible to do right after we finish keeping government open,” Collins said. “But we should not have issues that are very complicated that split the Senate attached to the continuing resolution, because all that’s going to do is prolong the shutdown.”
Last month, the Maine Bureau of Insurance announced steep increases in 2026 health insurance premiums for more than 100,000 Maine people. 
By late October, Maine households insured by the state-based health insurance marketplace will begin to receive notices of premium increases that are expected to average $286 per month when combined with insurer-submitted 2026 rate increases. The Mills administration has warned that nearly 9,500 consumers — 18% of those receiving assistance — will lose all premium support if the enhanced credits expire, leading to average increases of more than $900 per month.
Collins frets over threat of mass layoffs
Meanwhile, the White House has threatened mass layoffs if an agreement is not reached soon, which some Democrats have characterized as a “mafia-style threat” and an unprecedented continuation of the Trump administration’s slashing of the federal government. 
Typically during a shutdown, some federal employees are categorized as exempt, meaning they work throughout the funding lapse. Others are furloughed. All receive back pay once Congress funds the government, under a 2019 law. 
Collins on Monday voiced concern that White House budget director Russ Vought “may take a look at that so-called nonessential list and lay off federal employees who are in fact doing very essential work.”
Collins, who chairs the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee, said she’s made it “very clear to [the Office of Management and Budget] that I do not think that those layoffs are fair, and that will end up with the agencies not having sufficient personnel to do the mission of the agency.”
Asked what she’s doing to end the shutdown, Collins said she’s been talking with her colleagues and outlined a proposal to restart the government, which included working to get a commitment from Republican leaders to get a negotiated version of the bipartisan appropriations bills passed by the Senate in August to a full vote. 
“That was something that Democrats were particularly concerned about. So there’s no reason why this can’t be worked out,” she said. 
Whether such a deal would be honored by the White House remains to be seen. Democrats are growing increasingly frustrated with the Trump administration’s unilateral actions on spending, arguing it has significantly eroded Congress’ constitutional power of the purse.
Since Trump resumed office, his administration has rescinded and withheld numerous congressionally appropriated funds.
Last week, Collins said the Government Accountability Office should sue the Trump administration over its efforts to freeze or unilaterally cancel spending approved by Congress. The GAO has cited the Trump administration for illegally impounding funding for electric vehicle charging, museums and libraries, Head Start, energy efficiency upgrades in K-12 schools, funding for medical research at the National Institutes of Health and funding for the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

Washtenaw Intermediate School District Grants & Special Projects Coordinator Sarah Hierman said the significant influx of $800 million in one-time federal funding during the pandemic via the American Rescue Plan provided more flexibility for schools to work with families who were facing challenges associated with housing instability. In this case, the intermediate school district was able to pay for a hotel stay for the child and their parent, allowing them to take the test the next morning.
While the scenario illustrated just one of the barriers students experiencing homelessness have in accessing their education, Hierman said it also showed how more flexible funding offered an immediate solution to the student’s dilemma.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“We do not need our kids who are unstably housed also falling behind in school, because education is a means to something different for them,” Hierman said.
Although much remains uncertain about the ongoing funding for federal programs with the current government shutdown, both the U.S. Senate and House appropriations committees have passed bills that maintain funding for students experiencing homelessness, rejecting the Trump administration’s proposal to do away with dedicated federal funding in favor of consolidating funding for homeless students with 17 other programs in a single K-12 block grant.
While the $128 million in dedicated federal funding for homeless students provided via the McKinney–Vento Homeless Assistance Act is a far cry from the pandemic-era funding schools received, the fact that Congress maintained the dedicated funding is an acknowledgement of the challenges those students face, said Barbara Duffield, executive director of SchoolHouse Connection, a national nonprofit advocating for working to overcome homelessness through education.

“I think it shows that across the political spectrum, there is an understanding that without this specific federal program, children and youth who are homeless would not be able to access schools at all. This is the door opener,” Duffield said. “So, it’s broad recognition that homelessness creates unique barriers for very basic school access and school stability, and a desire to keep this in place moving forward.”
Signed into federal law in 1987, the McKinney-Vento Act defines homelessness at the federal level and ensures that schools identify and support eligible students, offering assistance with everything from transportation to school supplies. It also requires that school districts have homeless liaisons who provide referrals to social services for health care, food and housing assistance. 
McKinney-Vento protections ensure that students are able to enroll in school even when they lack records required due to frequent moves. It also allows those students to continue to attend the same school, even when their homelessness forces them to move out of the district.
More than 35,000 Michigan students identified as experiencing homelessness in 2023-24, according to state data. Nearly 70% of students who experienced homelessness in the state were chronically absent, meaning they missed 10% or more of all school days.
State
Impacting outcomes
When federal funding to schools for identifying and serving homeless students increased during the pandemic, a summary of national outcomes showed chronic absenteeism went down and graduation rates went up. The study showed graduation rates improved among homeless students, who also had better outcomes on math and science assessments.
“That’s a pretty important finding there — that if you actually are providing additional support for children we know are at high risk, that you can have an impact on all these different educational outcomes,” said Jennifer Erb Downward, director of Housing Stability Programs and Policy Initiatives with the University of Michigan’s Poverty Solutions Initiative.
The significant influx of $800 million in one-time funding during the pandemic via American Rescue Plan dollars helped increase the number of districts receiving dedicated homeless education funds from 21% to 62%, according to data from UM’s Poverty Solutions and SchoolHouse Connection.
Beyond that, Erb Downward said school districts that previously only received a small amount of funding via McKinney-Vento saw increased dedicated funding, bringing to light more awareness about how widespread and underreported the issue is.
“The first thing that we really saw and heard from people working directly in the schools with families and working with identified students experiencing homelessness, was that funding raised awareness about the issue,” she said. “There are a lot of people who said they didn’t know previously about McKinney-Vento or the protections that students had.”
In Newaygo and Oceana counties, the increase in one-time funding allowed schools more flexibility in how those funds were spent, said Katherine Mater, the McKinney-Vento coordinator for both counties.
That meant families experiencing financial hardships during that time — even temporarily — were eligible to receive funding to stay in a hotel if they had been evicted or had a financial emergency.
“Those COVID-19 dollars had a little more flexibility in allowing us to put them in a hotel for a short period of time and then help get them connected with local resources to help them get out of that and find a long-term solution,” Mater said. “That was a really great benefit that we noticed, and since then, it has been a hardship to kind of revert back and not have that resource.”
A stable place
While federal funding for the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act accounts for less than 1% of the Department of Education’s budget, its impact is immense, Erb Downward said. 
The inherent difficulties that come with housing stability have led to 48% of homeless students being chronically absent, compared to 27% of all other U.S. students, according to data collected by SchoolHouse Connection and Poverty Solutions. 

School often provides a safe haven for those students, Erb Downward said, fulfilling a variety of their basic needs throughout the course of the day.
“I think when you don’t have a stable place to live, school really becomes that stable place where you’re going to see people who care about you,” she said. “You know that you’ll have access to food. You know you’ll have a place to be that is safe.”
In Washtenaw County, as is the case across the state, the most prevalent circumstances students experiencing homelessness face involves “doubling-up,” or a shared living arrangement, accounting for 72.7% of Michigan’s homeless student population, according to state data.
While that is also the most common scenario in Newaygo and Oceana counties, Mater said the county’s rural backdrop means some families are without a home entirely, living in a camper, their car or a tent.
To help those students and their families, Mater said school liaisons look to fill in the gaps of their most practical needs, with popular items including gas cards, hygiene products and some small car repairs. Some school districts in Newaygo County were able to use American Rescue Plan funds to start food and clothing pantries, while the county has partnered with a local laundry mat to help McKinney-Vento families.
Ultimately, the work of liaisons involves removing any barriers to education for students, Mater said.
“If you think about it in a more broad term, it’s really what helps the student be able to get to school, attend school and be successful within their day at school,” she said.

(Photo by Delaney Nolan/TheLens)Tulane University terminated an academic director this summer after the syllabus she’d helped create for an infectious disease class was rejected by a newly hired instructor because it included an academic article about a polio outbreak in Gaza.
Some say that the incident is yet another glimpse of the tense climate experienced on local and national campuses by people who support Palestine.
The situation also raises questions about free speech on the nation’s campuses. “It is important that faculty members and other instructors are able to select and teach pedagogically relevant material in class, even when that material is potentially upsetting or controversial for students,” said Graham Piro, a fellow with the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, a nonprofit civil liberties group that defends free speech on college campuses.
In the current climate, some institutions are feeling pressured to violate student and faculty First Amendment rights to avoid federal investigations, Piro said. But FIRE encourages them to withstand those pressures. “We urge departments and universities to stand by scholars when they come under fire for the material they teach, or for their statements outside the classroom on matters of public concern,” he said. “Universities must remember their legal obligations under the First Amendment.”

Though at first the matter seemed headed for a mere warning, Tulane ended up terminating Samia Rahman, academic programs director for the university’s pre-college program, on July 28. Along with the termination, Tulane altered the course’s syllabus, removing the article, a Harvard School of Public Health discussion about the resurgence of polio in Gaza.
Earlier this year, in anticipation of this summer’s Tulane’s pre-college courses – short classes taken by high school students during the summer – Rahman, who’d worked for the Pre-College Program for more than a year, had developed the syllabus for the course, “Infectious Disease: Epidemics and Public Health,” in collaboration with at least two faculty members from Tulane’s School of Public Health.
In the class, students examined “the factors leading to outbreaks of disease and the impact that infectious diseases have on our society,” according to Tulane’s online course summary. On the third day of the five-day course, students would learn how armed conflict can contribute to the outbreak of epidemics.
The students were slated to read and discuss the article, “Polio in Gaza: Experts explain the outbreak and the public health response.”
The brief article, comprised of excerpts from a panel discussion about polio vaccination efforts by American, British, and Israeli health and humanitarian experts, was originally published by the Harvard School of Public Health.
To Rahman, 38, the article wasn’t controversial. “For me, there’s an assumption I make that if … you work in medicine or if you work in health,” you’d be interested in an article about stepped-up polio vaccinations in a war zone, she said.
Since the article had also been approved by Tulane public health faculty, Rahman was taken aback when Atara Jaffe, hired as a temporary instructor, refused to teach it, she said.
Harvard academic director Mary Bassett, a contributor to the Harvard public health piece, was also surprised to hear of Jaffe’s discomfort with the article. “I just really don’t understand what would make the person uneasy about it, except that it referenced the situation in Gaza,” Bassett said.
To Bassett, the article seemed relevant to a public health course about epidemics. The situation, she said, is a marked and teachable example of how war leads to epidemics: before 2024, Gaza had not seen a polio case for decades, she said. The disease has grave, lifelong risks such as paralysis, but is also “entirely vaccine-preventable,” she said, noting that polio only reappeared after the conflict began, and primarily threatens unvaccinated infants exposed through contaminated water and sanitary systems damaged by war.
Discomfort with reference to ceasefire
Shortly before Tulane’s pre-college summer programming began, both Jaffe and another instructor who’d been hired to teach the infectious disease course said in a virtual meeting with Rahman and a co-manager that they were uncomfortable leading the in-class discussion for the article about polio in Gaza.
Though Rahman explained they would strictly be addressing public health, not politics, Rahman says Jaffe told her she felt the article was blaming Israel because it referred to the need for a ceasefire. Jaffe and the other instructor asked to instead teach an article about post-COVID mental health on that day of class.
Jaffe declined to speak with The Lens when reached for comment.
It’s unclear why the article’s mention of a ceasefire was objectionable. Even in May and June, as world policymakers squabbled over Israel’s blockade of aid and food intended for Gaza, a ceasefire was discussed as a neutral solution. Many of the world’s leading public health organizations, including Doctors Without Borders, MedGlobal, and the World Health Organization, had called for a ceasefire by the end of last year. Israel’s actions in Gaza have been widely characterized by experts, humanitarian organizations, and a UN inquiry as genocide, though the article did not use that word.
Within the Tulane School of Public Health, Rahman and her colleagues listened to the instructors’ complaint and offered them the choice to assign one of two articles as homework: the article about polio or another about a cholera epidemic in Sudan exacerbated by civil war. Ultimately, the instructors were given the option to assign either article as homework, or lead a discussion.
But in the meantime, Jaffe found two TikToks Rahman had made. After watching videos, she would file an equal opportunity complaint.

Federal pressure on schools
Rahman’s termination comes during a time when many U.S. universities feel under fire, as the Trump administration targets diversity-equity initiatives and programs it characterizes as antisemitic or “race-exclusionary.” Bassett’s employer, Harvard, is said to be in stalled discussions over a $500 million settlement after the Trump administration froze billions in federal funds designated for the university. The Trump administration has also pushed to deport non-citizen students who express support for Palestine.
In March, Tulane was one of 60 schools named by the Trump administration as being under investigation by the Department of Education for alleged antisemitic discrimination. Many institutions are pushing back on what they say is the coercive use of public funds to assert more federal control over universities. In April, a letter opposing the Trump administration’s punitive actions against universities garnered 400 signatures from university and college presidents and educational leaders.
The Trump administration has particularly targeted universities that saw pro-Palestine protests. Last April, a high-profile, pro-Palestine encampment on Tulane’s campus was forcibly dismantled by officers from the New Orleans Police Department and Louisiana State Police in SWAT gear, who arrested 14 protesters. Tulane suspended seven students from the camp.
Rahman’s termination came the month after Tulane dropped its controversial academic charges, from a separate incident, against seven students who participated in an off-campus protest held after ICE and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security detained Palestinian student activist Mahmoud Khalil.
Because Rahman continued to make social media posts about her opposition to Israel’s assault on Gaza throughout Tulane’s investigation, she wonders whether she was terminated because of her political beliefs.

Tulane is still facing a Title VI investigation over allegations of antisemitism, opened in December 2023 with the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights after a student filed a complaint following an on-campus protest where someone tried to set fire to an Israeli flag, which then led to a physical altercation. Title VI investigations pursue discrimination complaints based on race, color, or national origin within programs that receive federal assistance.
The following year, in July 2024, an attorney with Most & Associates filed another Title VI complaint against Tulane, this time on behalf of students alleging a pattern of anti-Palestinian discrimination.
The complaint was filed on behalf of Tulane Arabic Club, Tulane Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), and four SDS members. It describes multiple cases of alleged discrimination by Tulane faculty: in one incident, a chemistry professor referred to Palestinians as terrorists in front of her class, which included a Palestinian student. The student reported the remarks, but Tulane “refused to investigate it as an incident of anti-Palestinian racism.”
Faculty have also forced students to remove their keffiyeh scarves – cultural symbols of Palestine – and called campus police on an individual wearing a keffiyeh, calling it a “terrorist scarf,” according to the Most & Associates complaint.
Tulane has made no statements and taken no public action to resolve those matters.
In response to queries, Tulane spokesman Michael Strecker provided a statement about anti-discrimination trainings and programming at the university.
“We have mandatory training for employees that is designed to prevent discrimination – including antisemitism and Islamophobia – based on shared ancestry,” Strecker wrote. “We also have related and ongoing educational efforts, partnerships and programming, including our annual Islamophobia Awareness Week and Antisemitism Awareness Week.”
TikToks lead to complaint
Rahman, who holds a master’s in education from Columbia University and has worked in education for over a decade, occasionally posts about current events on social media. This summer, after Jaffe objected to the syllabus, Rahman posted two videos on TikTok, critiquing the objections without naming either instructor.
Rahman acknowledges that the social media posts, which have been viewed by The Lens, showed “a lack of good leadership judgment.”
In one video, she tells viewers: “I don’t know if I should feel sorry for Zionists, if I should feel angry, if I should feel sad, because they are so brainwashed that they cannot look at a neutral article talking about public health concerns and not get triggered that Israel is getting blamed.” She later deleted the videos.
But Jaffe found the videos and opened an equal opportunity case against Rahman, alleging that Rahman “discriminated against and harassed Atara Jaffe based on her religion, national origin and shared ancestry, unreasonably interfering with or limiting participation, and creating a hostile work environment,” per a Tulane Human Resources document. Rahman does not know Jaffe’s religion, but says she had the impression Jaffe was a white American, and that Jaffe later mentioned she was from South Africa. Jaffe has earned degrees in both California and Cape Town, South Africa, and is currently on staff with Tulane’s Psychology Department.
After hearing about the complaint from her supervisor and a human resources representative, Rahman offered to apologize. Jaffe instead chose to pursue the complaint. The other instructor didn’t join the complaint. Rahman later gave a statement to an equal opportunity investigator at Tulane.
Almost two months later, the Tulane Equal Opportunity and Resolution Management office notified Rahman that an investigation had determined that she’d violated the university’s “religion and shared ancestry” discrimination policy but was cleared of the alleged discrimination based on “national origin.”
Tulane terminated Rahman soon afterward.

The polio article was meanwhile dropped from the syllabus. Tulane’s spokesperson did not respond to questions about who made that decision, but Shanna Harper, Tulane’s director of summer programs, informed Rahman by text that given the investigation, “the University has recommended pulling” the article.
Rahman is disturbed by what she sees as academic censorship.
“Removing this material sends a chilling message to students and faculty about whose suffering is acceptable to examine in an academic context and whose is not,” she wrote in an email to Robin Forman, Tulane’s senior vice president for academic affairs and provost.
Tulane’s spokesman did not give details to The Lens about why the university had pulled the article from the syllabus.
Importance of polio article
In fairly antiseptic terms, the Harvard School of Public Health article focuses on how conditions in Gaza created a “perfect storm” for the return of polio, and the logistical difficulties of administering polio vaccines there.
“We had a target of vaccinating 640,000 children, or 90% of all children under 10 in the region,” said Sam Rose, the senior deputy director of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) Affairs in Gaza, as he described the planned response to a confirmed case of polio in a 10-month-old, partially paralyzed infant.
“I’ve been on the ground for these campaigns, which took place during agreed-upon pauses in fighting,” Rose said. “However, these pauses did not cover the entire geographical area. In addition, northern Gaza has been cut off since October of last year [2023], making the campaign challenging in that region.”
It’s impossible to talk about the resurgence of the disease without talking about the destruction of Gaza’s civilian infrastructure, including water and sanitation systems, said Bassett, who directs the Francois-Xavier Bagnoud Center for Health and Human Rights at Harvard School of Public Health. That widespread damage can swiftly affect public-health outcomes, she said, noting that, before the bombing began, Gaza had “a much higher vaccination coverage rate than we had in New York state.”
Within the article, the word “ceasefire” does appear twice – both in comments made by Israeli health workers.
First, Guy Shalev, the Israeli executive director of Physicians for Human Rights Israel, is quoted as saying, “Even as we continue to hope for a ceasefire, the social determinants of health and infrastructure in Gaza are still issues.”
Later in the piece, Bassett also quotes an Israeli pediatrician, who says that, to stop polio, “the prescription is ceasefire, vaccines, and good public health conditions.”
Bassett, an academic director, was surprised that Rahman’s TikTok posts about the article’s critics led to her termination.
While criticizing Zionism publicly may have been reckless, Bassett said, “I was surprised that you’d lose your job over it.”

Large institutional investors, defined as those owning over 100 homes (which includes private equity firms), own 3 percent of the single-family rental stock nationwide according to Brookings. This share is higher in some local markets — in the 20 Metropolitan Statistical Areas where these investors are most present, they own 12.4 percent — but they still own far less than 20 percent nationwide. The Urban Institute similarly finds they own just 3.8 percent of nationwide single-family rental stock.
Considering purchases rather than holdings, investors (those buying non-primary residences) bought nearly 27 percent of all homes sold in the first quarter of 2025. However, most of these purchases are likely by small investors (those who own less than 5 properties), as they own 85 percent of all investor-owned residential properties. Research by John Burns Research and Consulting found institutional investors are buying less than 2 percent of all homes.

The facility has become a focal point of protest since ICE officials expanded their immigration enforcement in Chicagoland. (Capitol News Illinois photo by Andrew Adams)CHICAGO — After weeks of threatening to do so, President Donald Trump is taking command of 300 Illinois National Guard troops and sending them to Chicago over Gov. JB Pritzker’s objections, the governor announced Saturday.
“This morning, the Trump Administration’s Department of War gave me an ultimatum: call up your troops, or we will,” Pritzker said in a statement. “It is absolutely outrageous and un-American to demand a Governor send military troops within our own borders and against our will.”
The promised deployment comes as federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, activity has ramped up in Chicago and its suburbs as part of “Operation Midway Blitz,” which has so far resulted in more than 800 arrests according to the Department of Homeland Security.
There have also been two shootings, including one Saturday on the city’s Southwest Side.
Though the Trump administration insists ICE is targeting undocumented immigrants with criminal backgrounds, reports have mounted of agents arresting those with no history of illegal activity, detaining children along with their parents and even handcuffing U.S. citizens. Immigrant and civil rights groups have alleged ICE is arresting people without warrants in violation of a federal consent decree.
The wave of raids and arrests has spurred large protests in recent weeks, especially outside of an ICE processing center in Broadview, a suburb eight miles west of Chicago. The demonstrations have spurred clashes between immigration agents and activists, leading to the arrests of several protestors last weekend on charges of resisting and assaulting officers. Agents have sprayed chemical agents and fired nonlethal rounds into the crowds outside the facility.

On Monday, Pritzker announced DHS was seeking 100 Illinois National Guard troops to protect ICE facilities and immigration agents in Illinois, warning the Trump administration would use any confrontation resulting from its Chicago-area immigration crackdown as a “pretext” for a military deployment.
On Saturday, the governor called the administration’s National Guard activation a ”manufactured performance” and not about protecting public safety.
“I want to be clear: there is no need for military troops on the ground in the State of Illinois,“ Pritzker said, pointing to the Illinois State Police’s announcement this week that it had joined forces with Broadview Police and the Cook County Sheriff’s Office to form a “Unified Command” to coordinate law enforcement activity outside the ICE facility.
One of ISP’s first acts in Broadview was designating demonstration areas, also known as “free speech zones.” Pritzker on Saturday said the combined efforts of state and local law enforcement protected “people’s ability to peacefully exercise their constitutional rights.”
The Unified Command reported the arrests of at least five protesters on Friday, and five more on Saturday night, as of 8 p.m. The area was quiet Saturday afternoon with only about a dozen protesters gathered, at times outnumbered by members of the media.

“I will not call up our National Guard to further Trump’s acts of aggression against our people,” the governor said in his statement.
But shortly before Pritzker’s announcement about the National Guard deployment Saturday, a U.S. Border Patrol agent shot a woman in an altercation between immigration agents and protesters on Chicago’s Southwest Side.
According to reporting from the Chicago Sun-Times, the woman was alleged to have been driving one of 10 cars that “rammed” and “boxed in” nearly three dozen immigration agents in the city’s Brighton Park neighborhood. Agents fired “defensive shots” when they saw the woman was allegedly “armed with a semi-automatic weapon,” according to the paper. She was taken to a nearby hospital for treatment. The woman was one of two people charged by federal prosecutors in the Northern District of Illinois with using their vehicles to “assault, impede, and interfere with the work of federal agents in Chicago.”
Trump and Pritzker have spent weeks trading barbs over the president’s threats to deploy National Guard troops to Chicago, with the governor alleging Trump’s apparent backing off from the idea last month was a sign of dementia.
The governor has already vowed legal action against the Trump administration if and when the president activated the National Guard. After the president sent 1,400 National Guard troops to Los Angeles this summer — the first time since the 1960s that the feds deployed the National Guard without a governor’s consent — a federal judge last month ruled the move violated the Posse Comitatus Act, which limits the power of the federal government to use military force for domestic matters. But the ruling only applies to California.
The National Guard’s presence in Los Angeles has dwindled to roughly 250, but there are still a couple thousand troops on assignment in Washington, D.C., where the federal government has more power over law enforcement. Since their August deployment to the nation’s capital, guardsmen have been reportedly picking up garbage, as they are only authorized to assist with arrests if asked by local law enforcement.
Trump has also threatened to federalize the National Guard in Portland, Oregon, though troops had not yet been sent as of Saturday evening. Tennessee’s Republican governor has welcomed the president’s recent suggestion that he’d deploy guardsmen to Memphis, but that has also yet to happen.
Chicago, Los Angeles, Portland, Washington, D.C. and Shelby County, Tennessee, where Memphis is situated, have all adopted so-called “sanctuary city” policies wherein local law enforcement are barred from assisting in federal immigration enforcement. Trump has targeted cities and states that have adopted such laws, and last week a federal judge in Rhode Island ruled the administration cannot withhold emergency funding from Illinois and other states based on those states’ refusal to participate in immigration enforcement.
But this week, Attorney General Kwame Raoul said he learned of another attempt by the White House to divert disaster relief funding from Illinois with four days remaining in the fiscal year “without any notice or explanation.”
Meanwhile, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem visited Illinois again on Friday. Noem has traveled to the Chicago area and Springfield several times this year, including last month when she oversaw an early morning raid in Elgin, where at least one U.S. citizen was arrested.
“Secretary Noem should no longer be able to step foot inside the State of Illinois without any form of public accountability,” Pritzker said in a statement.
On Friday, Noem appeared with Gregory Bovino, commander-at-large of the U.S. Border Patrol, at the Broadview ICE facility with a camera crew, according to Chicago’s ABC 7.
Late Friday, Pritzker also said he’s making state resources available to people affected by a Sept. 30 raid on a South Shore apartment building.
In Chicago’s Logan Square neighborhood, masked federal agents deployed a chemical irritant outside of a grocery store as people and cars lined up to block their advancement, according to the Chicago Sun-Times.
State Rep. Eva-Dina Delgado, D-Chicago, condemned the action, which happened around the corner from an elementary school in her district. Chicago Ald. Jessie Fuentes also alleges she was handcuffed by immigration agents while questioning them at a Humboldt Park medical center.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)After little debate Monday morning but with Democrats voting against, the Utah Legislative Redistricting Committee voted to pick map C — a congressional map that the Utah GOP last week encouraged Republicans to support. 
The map now goes to the full Republican-controlled Legislature to consider during a special session later Monday morning. 
Lawmakers are expected to approve the map and send it to 3rd District Judge Dianna Gibson to consider in Utah’s court-ordered redistricting process, after Gibson determined the state’s 2021 congressional map was the product of an unconstitutional process. She ruled the Legislature overstepped when it repealed and replaced a voter-approved ballot initiative known as Proposition 4 that sought to create an independent redistricting process.

Map C would mix rural and urban parts of Utah, split three cities (Millcreek, North Salt Lake and Pleasant Grove) and split three counties (Davis, Salt Lake and Utah). The state’s Democratic stronghold and capital city of Salt Lake City would remain whole, while Salt Lake County (the state’s most populated county) would be split once. 
Monday marked Utah lawmakers’ deadline to vote on and submit a map to the court for consideration. It’s the same deadline for plaintiffs in the state’s redistricting lawsuit that successfully challenged lawmakers’ override of Proposition 4 to submit their own proposed congressional map. 
Under the 2021 congressional map, Salt Lake County was split four times — which led to a lawsuit from nonpartisan groups including the League of Women Voters of Utah, Mormon Women for Ethical Government and a handful of Salt Lake County voters challenging it as “blatant gerrymandering,” along with claims that lawmakers’ unconstitutionally repealed and replaced Proposition 4. 
Map C would be more competitive for Democrats compared to the 2021 map — but would still result in four congressional districts that would lean in favor of the deep red state’s dominant party, the GOP.
Gibson is expected to ultimately pick a replacement map — either the Legislature’s preferred map or the plaintiffs’ — by her deadline of Nov. 10 in order for it to be put in place in time for the 2026 elections. 
Utah Republican, Democratic party leaders spar over picking preferred congressional map

However, one of the Legislative Redistricting Committee’s co-chairs, Sen. Scott Sandall, R-Tremonton, told reporters if Gibson rejects map C and picks a map not drawn by lawmakers and instead drawn by plaintiffs, the Legislature will likely fight that decision in court as they continue to appeal Gibson’s earlier ruling before the Utah Supreme Court and potentially the U.S. Supreme Court. 
“To be in compliance, to me, with code and the Constitution, the judge only has one option,” Sandall said, though he added she could “either accept this map or come back to the Legislature and say you failed … and you’ve got to develop a map that takes that into account. To me, it’s the Legislature’s responsibility, constitutionally, to do this.” 
The Legislative Redistricting Committee’s only two Democrats — Senate Minority Leader Luz Escamilla, D-Salt Lake City, and Rep. Doug Owens, D-Millcreek — didn’t debate against map C during Monday’s committee hearing and cast their no votes without comment. Owens told Utah News Dispatch after the meeting that Democrats already made their case against the committee’s slate of five proposed maps and in favor of Democrats’ preferred map during two committee hearings last month.

“There was nothing new to say,” Owens said, though he and Escamilla told reporters they don’t believe map C adheres to Proposition 4’s standards because it was drawn using a statistical method that Democrats say unfairly benefits the dominant party, in this case Republicans.
Owens also said if the Republican Party’s preference of map C was taken into account during the legislative committee’s selection process, “that’s improper for the Legislature to take partisan outcome into consideration.”

Owens, however, added there has been “no evidence” that lawmakers were “swayed” by the party’s preference, “but I think it’s telling that the Republican Party itself publicly was pushing for that map because it was clearly the most damaging to Democrats.” 
When asked whether the Republican Party’s support of map C influenced the Legislative Redistricting Committee’s selection, Sandall indicated he wasn’t aware of the party’s preference. 
“Did the Republican party do that? Because quite honestly I’ve been shielded by all of that,” Sandall said. 
The committee’s House co-chair, Rep. Candice Pierucci, R-Herriman, said it didn’t. 
“I mean, we can’t control what happens in public comment, but I haven’t read that email. I’ve been asked that question over the past couple of days, but no,” she said, adding that while the party is “entitled to sharing their opinion, that didn’t come into consideration at all.”

State lawmakers returned to Raleigh in late September for a brief stay, and in the aftermath of a horrific killing that had occurred just weeks before on a Charlotte commuter train, legislative leaders made criminal justice and their stated intention of “getting tough on crime” the central focus. Among the law changes sent to Gov. Stein for his review were provisions that would make it easier to hold people accused of crimes without bail pending trial and jumpstart the state’s death penalty law.
Despite its rapid approval, not everyone on Jones Street was convinced that the “get tough” approach is the answer, and one of those people was State Rep. Carolyn Logan of Mecklenburg County, who told Newsline that she believes the state needs a more creative and comprehensive approach to making her community safer.

(Erin Bamer/Nebraska Examiner)TEKAMAH, Neb. — Within the farm hills of northern Burt County, overgrown grasses and weeds cover some of the headstones at the Tekamah Rural Seventh Day Adventist Cemetery, in contrast to the fresh flowers and gifts scattered amongst the graves.
The cemetery hasn’t been mowed since May, and it has lasting damage from severe rain and wind storms earlier this summer. Prior to this year, visitors say their local cemetery board had cared for the grounds for decades.

Now, the only treatment it’s received in months has come from a few visitors who live nearby, neighbors who have been pleading with their local cemetery board to take care of it.
A group of these residents contend that the Tekamah Cemetery District has been favoring the region’s main cemetery — Tekamah Cemetery — at the expense of three rural cemeteries also within the district. After months of lodging complaints and no progress, they may have found a solution in the idea of creating a new rural cemetery board.
The dispute began early this summer, when Victor Jensen and several other members of the area’s Seventh Day Adventist Church noticed their cemetery wasn’t being cared for anymore. Prior to this year, Jensen said he believed the district had ensured the cemetery was mowed a minimum of three times per year, mostly during warmer months.
This led him and others to take notice of other rural cemeteries lagging in care. Most were not being regularly mowed, and at Arizona Community Cemetery in western Burt County, Jensen said maintenance workers tore out some of the cemetery fencing and left it in a pile on the grounds.
At its latest meeting Sept. 18, board members clarified that crews got around to mowing Arizona Cemetery the week before the meeting, but did not specify when the other cemeteries had last been mowed. Tekamah Cemetery District Clerk John Chamberlain said the board would not comment further until its next meeting Oct. 8.
In comparison to the others, Tekamah Cemetery is pristine. Geographically larger than the others, the cemetery covers a hillside overlooking a fountain and a neighborhood of nice homes, with an even layer of grass all the way through.

“When you see the scale of it, it’s so one-sided,” said another church member Lisa Anderson.
When residents questioned the Tekamah Cemetery District about this, Jensen said board members offered several defenses. Jensen said the frequent rainfall this year had proved challenging, for example.
At the meeting, board member Ron Tobin said the reason why the church’s cemetery hadn’t been cared for is because the board decided earlier this year that they couldn’t because the land is privately owned by the church. It was unclear at the meeting whether the decision was made independently or with input from others.
Meeting attendees pushed back on the argument, countering that while the ground is private, the cemetery itself is public. Anderson said many of the church cemetery’s visitors pay taxes into the district to care for all cemeteries in the region and don’t realize that their money isn’t helping their cemetery anymore.
At the Sept. 18 meeting, the board voted on its annual budget covering the care for all cemeteries, approving just over $154,000 in general fund spending through the year, with a cash reserve of roughly $296,000. This is by far the largest budget of five cemetery districts in Burt County. The others list general fund spending ranging from $10,000 to $31,000 for fiscal year 2024-25.
This difference left some meeting attendees suspicious, especially because the district’s budgets aren’t itemized, so there’s no way to know how the funds are being spent.
“I would just like to see (work being) done at the level that Tekamah is,” said one attendee Greg Brummond. “There’s gotta be some carryover with $150,000. It can’t cost that much to do that.”

One of the three workers who maintains the cemeteries was present at the meeting and said mowing is a lot more time-consuming and expensive than attendees think. The last time Arizona Community Cemetery was mowed, he said it took four hours to finish, and it costs about $50 per hour to mow.
Anderson came to the meeting with her own research that painted a different picture. She estimated maintaining the three rural cemeteries in the district — including mowing, grave repairs, trash disposal and other treatment — would altogether cost about $16,000 per year.

Based on these estimates, Anderson and others proposed the idea of forming a new cemetery board within the district to care for the three rural cemeteries. The new board would syphon off a portion of the funding allocated to the original Tekamah Cemetery District.
Though some board members had reservations about the idea being proposed so suddenly, they ultimately voted unanimously to approve the $154,000 budget with a stipulation that up to $16,170 of those funds could be allocated to the rural board. This is contingent on Anderson and others properly establishing the new board.
“I guess we’re going to find out how much it actually costs,” Anderson said.
How the new board would work is still a bit murky — multiple board members called it “a head-scratcher” at the meeting. But the process is already underway, as Anderson said they’ve already figured out who will serve.
Anderson said the rural board will have five members, one representing each of the four townships within the district, plus Jensen, who will serve at-large. Anderson herself will not be a board member, but she will assist with operations, she said.

Anderson is now in the process of filing the paperwork to establish the board, she said. It’s uncertain yet when the new board’s first meeting would be, as Anderson said cemetery board work typically slows during colder months, but she said this unique situation might require more meetings ahead of next spring.
Jensen said the outcome of the Sept. 18 meeting was better than he expected, after months of no movement from the board. He said their group first reached out to the State Auditor’s Office for help, but were turned away. Had the idea for the rural board not worked, he said their next step was likely suing in district court.
“I just want it to be fair,” Anderson said.

The North Carolina General Assembly was back in Raleigh in late September to enact legislation that leaders say will quote “get tough on crime” by limiting access to bail and pre-trial release for more criminal defendants and jump-starting the state’s long un-used death penalty.
Shortly after lawmakers departed the capital, Newsline caught up with an attorney who has studied this kind of legislation and its impact on crime in several states — the Chief Counsel of the Justice System Reform team at the Southern Coalition for Social Justice, Jake Sussman. And sadly, Sussman says there’s no evidence that lawmakers’ “get tough” approach will make a meaningful difference. To do that, he says, lawmakers will finally need to muster the courage to engage with complex and expensive policy solutions like fixing the state’s desperately underfunded mental health system.

This story was originally reported by Kate Sosin of The 19th News.
Five years ago, the United Nations concluded that conversion therapy could amount to torture and recommended it be banned. On Tuesday, the Supreme Court will consider a case that could greenlight it for LGBTQ+ youth across the nation.
It is the first of three blockbuster LGBTQ+ cases on its docket this term, as the court’s October-to-October annual cycle is known. Chiles v. Salazar, brought by Christian counselor Kaley Chiles, seeks to overturn Colorado’s ban on conversion therapy, a pseudoscientific practice in which providers attempt to change a youth’s sexual orientation or gender identity, often through extremely harsh methods.
Conversation therapy is condemned by every major medical association in the country, including the American Psychiatric Association, the American Psychological Association and the American Medical Association.

It has historically involved acts of physical, psychological and sexual abuse against minors — electric shock, masturbation reconditioning, starvation, chemically induced nausea and hypnosis, among others.
Nearly 700,000 adults are survivors of conversion therapy, according to the Williams Institute at the University of California, Los Angeles, School of Law, which submitted an amicus brief encouraging the court to find Colorado ban on the practice constitutional.
In a statement, Ilan Meyer, distinguished senior scholar of public policy at the Williams Institute, said that research shows conversion therapy “is ineffective at changing a person’s sexual orientation and gender identity and is associated with significant harm, which is why major professional organizations have overwhelmingly rejected the practice.”
Twenty-three states and Washington, D.C., have conversion therapy bans on the books. An additional four states and Puerto Rico have made efforts to limit the practice. The majority of those laws still allow therapists to discuss sexual orientation and gender identity with youth, but practitioners are not allowed to promise that they can help kids change their gender identity or sexual orientation — nor are they allowed to pressure them into doing so.
Tuesday’s hearing could change all of that. While the case focuses on Colorado’s ban, which was enacted in 2019, its outcome could have major implications for conversion therapy bans across the country.
Kelley Robinson, president of the Human Rights Campaign, the country’s largest LGBTQ+ rights organization, said in a statement that while the organization urges the court to affirm the constitutionality of Colorado’s ban, the expectations are low given the court’s conservative majority.

“In recent years, we have seen decisions out of our highest court that have rolled back our rights and cleared a pathway for discriminatory legislation that targets LGBTQ+ people and other marginalized communities,” Robinson said. “From access to critical health care to inclusivity in our schools, this shift is nothing short of alarming — and now the safety of our children is once again up for debate.” 
The case comes down, in part, to an argument over free speech. Chiles argues that her right to practice conversion therapy is protected under the First Amendment. The Trump administration has weighed in to support Chiles, along with 19 state attorneys general.
But opponents argue that conversion therapy should be classified as conduct,not speech. Federal appellate courts in the Ninth and Tenth Circuits ruled that Chiles’ practice amounted to conduct, while the Eleventh Circuit concluded it was protected speech. The Supreme Court will make the final call.
The Supreme Court will hear two other major LGBTQ+ cases this fall — BPJ v. West Virginia and Hecox v. Little. Both involve challenges to statewide bans, in Virginia and Idaho, respectively, on transgender participation in sports.
The court is expected to issue its opinion on the cases in the spring or summer.

North Carolina is now into the second year of Hurricane Helene recovery and as we discussed in a special edition of News & Views last week, while there have been many encouraging and inspiring aspects to this story, the hard truth is that we have a very long way to go. And as Newsline learned recently in a conversation with policy analyst Alex Campbell of the North Carolina Budget and Tax Center, the main reason for the slow pace of the recovery is funding – or more precisely, the lack of it from both the federal and state governments. Indeed, Campbell believes unless elected officials do something soon to inject billions of additional dollars, western North Carolina is in for many more tough years.

(Photo: Adam Glanzman/Bloomberg)Jack Daniel’s is terminating a decades-long program that provided the company’s corn byproduct “slop” to local cattle farmers at low or no cost, allowing the farmers to inexpensively feed their cattle.
The “Cow Feeder Program” will end on March 31 as the company transitions to a new partnership with Ohio-based Three Rivers Energy, which will instead convert the waste into renewable fuel and fertilizer.
The change has left farmers in and around Moore County reeling, searching for ways they might continue to earn a living through raising cattle. 
Livestock makes up 89% of Moore County’s farm earnings, according to the most recent U.S. Census of Agriculture.
Danny Anderson, a 56-year-old cattle farmer, said his family has fed their animals the byproduct from Jack Daniel’s for decades. The so-called “slop” is primarily water mixed with leftover distillers’ grain.
“I can remember when I was probably eight or nine years old, going with my grandfather to get it … back then we hauled it in old milk cans,” Anderson said.
When Anderson took over the operation of the 207-acre farm, he used a 1,000-gallon tank to retrieve the feed. He eventually upsized to a truck with a 4,000-gallon tank, paying less than $9 for each load.
He partnered with another Middle Tennessee cattleman, bulking up around 300 to 500 of his business partner’s cows while separately building his own herd of 130 cows. They all ate slop, supplemented with hay, salt and minerals. 
“You’re talking about feeding 200, 250 head of cattle on $8 a day. There’s nothing else out there that compares,” Anderson said.
But Anderson will not be able to feed cows for his business partner after the program ends next year. The cost just won’t be feasible for either of them, he said.
He had been hauling about 185,000 gallons of slop each month. Starting in October, the company will reduce his allotment to 144,000 gallons. In January, it will shrink to 43,200 gallons before cutting off entirely at the end of March.










I think Jack Daniel’s here in little old Lynchburg is getting a bad rep for it, because the people that run Jack Daniel’s here had to come out and tell the farmers, ‘Hey, look, this is over.


– Danny Anderson, Moore County farmer


Anderson has already sold 50 head of his own cattle, and plans to keep a herd of 50 cows and try to feed them on a mix of grass, hay, and occasional feed mix during winter months. Moore County’s rough hillside land isn’t much good for anything but cattle farming, he said. 
“That slop made it to where you could take a piece of land that wasn’t very valuable, and you could feed that slop, and you could make money doing it,” Anderson said.
Jack Daniel’s new partnership with Three Rivers Energy contractually requires the distiller to deliver between 350,000 and 500,000 gallons of spent distiller’s grain each day — the company’s entire current volume. 
“This decision follows years of careful consideration and was communicated with advance notice, starting with our initial announcement back in March 2022,” a Jack Daniel’s representative stated in an email to Tennessee Lookout. The partnership with Three Rivers Energy “allows us to achieve key environmental standards and secure the future of our brand, ensuring our continued ability to market and sell Jack Daniel’s globally.”
“We understand this change is significant, and we remain dedicated to our neighbors as we all adapt to this new era,” the representative stated.
Anderson adds that the decision to stop the program was made by Brown-Forman, Jack Daniel’s corporate owner. 
“I think Jack Daniel’s here in little old Lynchburg is getting a bad rep for it, because the people that run Jack Daniel’s here had to come out and tell the farmers, ‘Hey, look, this is over,’” Anderson said.
What happens now?
The University of Tennessee Institute of Agriculture held a meeting last week to discuss potential paths forward for farmers who had relied on the “slop” as their primary feed source. 
UTIA Livestock Marketing Specialist Andrew Griffith said while not all of the cattle in the Moore County area are eating slop, “the biggest percentage of them are.”
In the short term, Griffith said feed produced by a feed company is probably going to be the best bet for farmers, “mainly to be able to determine if it’s worthwhile for them to keep feeding cattle.”
“This way they won’t have some large investment … for infrastructure change,” he said.
Farmers can also continue to feed hay, and some may create their own feed blends of commodity crops like corn or soybean meal. 
The economic viability of cattle farming is measured in the “cost of gain,” or the cost of feed for each pound of weight gained by the animal, Griffith said. It’s not simple to determine how much more it might cost a cattle farmer to feed their animals with purchased feed versus the slop, because the costs of retrieving the slop includes time, gas, equipment and other variables. Griffith, however, said it’s likely going to be more costly for farmers to feed alternative rations instead of the byproduct that was largely free to them.
Griffith said the change shows how important flexibility is in the agriculture business.
“Things can change, and if we’re not flexible or adaptable, that’s when we get left behind and lose out,” he said. “And certainly, in this case, there are going to be some people that don’t want to adapt, and maybe rightfully so. Maybe it’s best for them to not raise cattle anymore. But at the same time, if it’s your only business and you want to stay in it, you do have to have some flexibility and adaptability to stay in the business.”
Ripple effects and national context
Anderson said he expects the end of the program to have a “trickle-down effect on everything.”
Local livestock sale barns may struggle from less business when herds like his shrink, he said. He’s looking at cutting some of his insurance policies on hay barns, tractors and the feed trucks that will now sit idle. And he won’t be spending as much on fuel once the slop dries up; he currently puts about $400 in his big feed trucks every 21 days.
And while the demand for beef is strong, the U.S. Department of Agriculture reported a 1% drop in cattle and calves on feed for the U.S. slaughter market in September. 
U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said in September that the USDA is working on a plan to bolster the country’s beef herd, which is at its lowest inventory since 1951. But those plans focus on risk-mitigation tools and opening more working lands, and will not include payments to beef producers.
Griffith said while inventory is low, farmers today produce more beef per cow than they did even a decade ago. 
“We have larger carcasses, larger frames, so we don’t need as many, but we do have a low cattle inventory relative to consumer demand for beef, and that’s why prices are so high,” he said.

“Nuclear energy is one option that deserves careful study,” Matt Meyer said. “This task force will bring together experts to evaluate the safety, cost, and environmental impacts.”
WILMINGTON, Del. (Oct. 6, 2025) — Energy policy took center stage early Monday as Dave Stevenson, director of the Caesar Rodney Institute’s Energy Policy Center, joined A Better Delaware Chair M. Jane Brady for the latest installment of a weekly  public webcast, “A Better Discussion.”  At the 8 a.m. session, Stevenson urged Delaware lawmakers to embrace small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs) and roll back state carbon-pricing mandates, which he says have driven up electricity costs and risked grid reliability heading into winter.
But while Stevenson and Brady see nuclear energy as part of Delaware’s long-term solution, Governor Matt Meyer and environmental advocates are taking a more cautious — or opposing — stance.
In announcing the creation of Delaware’s Nuclear Energy Feasibility Task Force in September, Meyer said the effort is about exploring all possible options to address rising costs.

“Delaware families and businesses are facing rising energy costs,” Meyer said. “We owe it to them to explore every possible solution to provide reliable, affordable, and clean energy.”

He added that nuclear deserves review, but not without scrutiny.

“Nuclear energy is one option that deserves careful study,” Meyer said. “This task force will bring together experts to evaluate the safety, cost, and environmental impacts before any decisions are made.”

Not all advocates agree the study is worthwhile. In its 2025 Legislative Recap, published in July, the Delaware Chapter of the Sierra Club reaffirmed its opposition to nuclear power as part of the state’s future energy mix.
The group instead urged lawmakers to:


Prioritize renewables such as solar and wind paired with battery storage;


Invest in energy efficiency and demand reduction, the most cost-effective strategies;


Avoid “costly, slow, and risky” nuclear projects that could leave waste and safety burdens; and


Focus on regional grid improvements and renewable integration rather than new nuclear feasibility studies.


The Sierra Club summarized its position by saying that while Governor Meyer believes nuclear “deserves careful study,” the organization sees it as “a distraction from cleaner, faster, and safer solutions.”
Stevenson’s Case for Nuclear
Stevenson said Delaware’s decarbonization mandates — not PJM’s market design — are “the root of reliability and cost problems.” He warned that “we could be looking at a blackout this winter” and claimed the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) adds “about 2 cents per kilowatt-hour for coal and 1 cent for natural gas,” making local generation uncompetitive.
He said Delaware now imports roughly 60 percent of its electricity.
Brady noted that the General Assembly’s new task force will consider small modular nuclear reactors as one potential future energy source. Stevenson said three units could supply Delaware’s entire power needs — “two at the Indian River site and one at Edgemoor.”
“These modern reactors are smaller, safer, and can operate with almost no evacuation zone beyond the plant fence line,” Stevenson said.
Cost, Jobs, and Timeline
Stevenson compared energy costs at about 4 cents per kilowatt-hour for natural gas, 8 cents and falling for nuclear, and 18 to 20 cents for offshore wind, noting that offshore wind “runs a little over a third of the time” and has a lifespan of about 20 years compared with 80 for nuclear.
He said federal tax incentives and grants could make Delaware an early mover.“With acreage and transmission already at Indian River, you could colocate a data center and use the power on-site,” he said.
Citing University of Tennessee research on a similar project near Oak Ridge, Stevenson said Delaware could generate $3.5 billion in economic impact and 1,800 direct jobs by constructing three SMRs.

Recycling Nuclear Fuel
Stevenson also discussed advances in reprocessing, saying that 95 percent of spent nuclear fuel can now be recycled, turning a waste challenge into a potential $40 billion-per-year national industry.
He said draft federal legislation could allow states to bid for temporary storage and recycling facilities, potentially creating high-wage jobs tied to the next generation of nuclear technology.
Policy Path Forward
Both Brady and Stevenson agreed Delaware should avoid repeating past decisions to close plants before replacements were ready.“If we act quickly, we could become a net exporter of energy,” Brady said. “Stable, low-cost power could attract businesses and data centers to Delaware.”
Stevenson added that combining SMRs with ending the state’s carbon tax “would restore reliability, lower rates, and position Delaware for growth.”

What Is a Small Modular Reactor?
Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) are compact nuclear plants built in factories and shipped for installation. Their design allows for passive safety systems, shorter build times, and smaller sites — often on the grounds of retired fossil-fuel plants that already have grid connections.
Supporters say SMRs offer 24/7 carbon-free energy to balance intermittent wind and solar. Opponents point to high upfront costs, long permitting times, and uncertainties over long-term waste storage.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/transmission-electric-lines.jpg,,,2025-10-06 10:58:49.957631

The nation’s highest court is considering three redistricting cases, including a Mississippi case, that could significantly alter the Voting Rights Act, a federal law stemming from the Civil Rights era that Black Mississippians have used for decades to prevent discrimination at the ballot box.
Attorney General Lynn Fitch last month appealed a ruling from U.S. District Court Judge Sharion Aycock of Mississippi. The ruling concluded that state lawmakers must redraw the state Supreme Court districts because they weaken Black voting strength. 
That ruling, which forbids the state from using those maps in future Mississippi Supreme Court elections, is pending before the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals. However, the appellate court has paused all proceedings in the appeal until the U.S. Supreme Court rules on its redistricting cases.
The litigation over the Mississippi Supreme Court includes a group of Black voters and candidates who in 2022 sued state officials, alleging that Black candidates face unfair difficulties getting elected to the state’s high court.
However, while the U.S. Supreme Court considers other cases that could impact the Mississippi Supreme Court cases, Aycock’s lower court in the meantime can proceed with determining how and when lawmakers will need to change the state districts.
One of those three cases the nation’s highest court is considering is another Mississippi case involving state legislative districts. 
A federal three-judge panel last year ordered lawmakers to redraw their districts in three areas of the state to give Black voters a fairer shot at electing candidates of their choice. Special elections for these races are currently underway, with the general election scheduled for November. 
Fitch’s office also appealed this ruling and asked the U.S. Supreme Court to sharply curtail the federal Voting Rights Act by declaring private voters cannot sue to prevent discrimination at the ballot box. 
If the U.S. Supreme Court rules in Mississippi’s favor, it would mean only the Department of Justice could sue to enforce the Voting Rights Act. 
In both of the Mississippi redistricting lawsuits, private citizens — not the federal government — filed the lawsuit. So if the U.S. Supreme Court rules in Mississippi’s favor, it could prevent individual voters from filing future redistricting cases. 
Another case pending before the U.S. Supreme Court that could limit redistricting cases is Louisiana v. Callais, a suit over Louisiana’s congressional districts. The central question in the case is whether factoring race into the drawing of congressional districts violates the U.S. Constitution.
The U.S. Supreme Court will hold an oral argument in the Callais case on Oct. 15.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/06101021/HB-1020-appeal1.jpg,,,2025-10-06 10:58:49.957631

The state is appealing a federal judge’s September order. The order prohibits the state from enforcing a new law that moves the election-year filing deadline for ballot-question petitions from May to February. That would shrink the circulation window by three months and, according to the judge, violate petitioners’ First Amendment rights. 
The law enforcing the earlier deadline started as legislation last winter from state House Speaker Jon Hansen, of Dell Rapids, who is one of several Republican candidates for governor next year.
The filing deadline dictates the amount of time petitioners have for gathering signatures to put a question on the statewide ballot. Petitioners need 17,508 signatures from registered voters to propose a law, which is known as an initiative, and the same number of signatures to put a bill passed by legislators on hold for consideration by voters, which is known as a referendum. The number of signatures required to propose a state constitutional amendment is 35,017.
Dakotans for Health, which has worked on numerous ballot-question campaigns, is represented in its lawsuit by attorney Jim Leach, of Rapid City. The state is represented by Assistant Attorney General Grant Flynn.
The litigation is part of a broader struggle over citizen lawmaking. Numerous Republican legislative efforts to restrict ballot questions in recent years have come in response to voter approval of measures that raised the minimum wage, expanded Medicaid eligibility and legalized medical marijuana, among others.

The debate largely hinges on health care tax credits that most Republicans would like to see end, while Democrats have sought to extend them to prevent skyrocketing health care costs for thousands of Mainers and millions of Americans. 
Golden, a Democrat who often breaks with his party on votes, was the sole House Democrat to back Republican’s short term spending deal. Dunlap has criticized Golden for shirking his party in his votes on a variety of issues and not being willing to stand up for Mainers against President Donald Trump on issues such as health care. 
“This is something that’s a matter of real survival for folks,” Dunlap said, adding that the health care discussion is “a fight worth picking.”
However, Golden said after his vote that he opposed cuts to Medicaid and would like to see certain health care tax credits extended, but the shutdown hurts Americans, the economy and “the irony is it has only handed more power to the president.”
Dunlap also said former Gov. Paul LePage, the likely Republican nominee for the 2nd District, would make matters even worse by going along with cuts to Medicaid as well as Trump’s tariff policies, aspects of which Golden has also supported. 
A resident of Old Town, Dunlap is currently the Maine State Auditor and previously served as Secretary of State for seven years. While he knows he will have to focus on winning support from Democratic voters in his primary run against Golden, he said his message that “we can do better” is meant for everyone. 
Golden is in his fourth term representing District 2, a rural district that comprises the geographic majority of the state north of Augusta. Second District voters have routinely split tickets, reelecting Golden while going for Trump each time he’s run for president. 
In addition to health care costs, Dunlap underscored the importance of election integrity and preserving democracy. He said it’s a topic he knows well from his work as Secretary of State handling Maine’s elections, which he described as some of the strongest in the country. 
Dunlap made a national name for himself during Trump’s first term when serving on the president’s voter fraud commission. 
Dunlap refused to hand over sensitive Maine voter information that the commission requested (which current Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows cited when defending her decision to do the same). He also won a lawsuit against the group after its Republican leadership intentionally excluded him from deliberations. And, after it was disbanded, Dunlap publicly accused the commission of being set up to validate Trump’s voter fraud claims.

The Kigluaik Mountains stretch across the Seward Peninsula of western Alaska like a spine, their jagged ridges keeping a record of time. The Inupiaq have long read these ridges and valleys as a living story: Fire and fracture have marked the rock, and glaciers’ slow grind polished it. The talus slopes gleam in the low fall sun, meltwater from the snowfields spilling into streams that thread across the map of caribou trails on the tundra below.
Hidden beneath these remote valleys lies one of the world’s largest known graphite deposits. Over millions of years, carbon deep within the earth was subjected to immense heat and pressure, forming crystalline sheets black and soft as pencil lead. Canadian company Graphite One plans to mine the valuable material for batteries and strategic minerals — despite many residents’ objections, and so far, without the federally required tribal consultation with the nearby communities of Teller, Brevig Mission, and Mary’s Igloo.
The area slated for development drains into Imuruk Basin, an estuary fed by four rivers that create one of the continent’s most biodiverse ecosystems. This vital hunting and fishing area is essential to residents’ food security and the traditions that tie them to the land. As Lucy Oquilluk, president of Mary’s Igloo Traditional Council, told the federal government, sidelining her community denied it “the opportunity to have our voice heard on issues that directly impact our communities and ways of life.”
After President Trump invoked emergency powers to produce critical minerals this spring, the federal government fast-tracked the mine’s permitting. Three of the four local tribes have vehemently opposed the project, and say the public review process has been short-changed. (The fourth, Nome Eskimo Community, has not joined the opposition, and did not respond to an interview request.)
In June, Graphite One became the first Alaskan mine — and among the first in the country — to qualify for FAST-41, a process that expedites federal approval of critical infrastructure. This hastens environmental reviews to as little as 30 days. The complex choreography of federal permits — spanning the Army Corps of Engineers, the Bureau of Land Management, and the Fish and Wildlife Service — is now moving with unprecedented speed.
The company, which did not respond to requests for comment, envisions carving a sprawling operation into the Kigluaik: To access the remote site, it will need to use 30 miles of public road and lay 17 miles of new road, cutting across salmon streams and archaeological sites. It plans to truck the ore year-round over public roads to a temporary holding facility in Nome until a deep-water port can be built. From there, the material will make its way to Ohio, where the company plans to build a processing facility on a brownfield once used by the Department of Defense.
Graphite supply is vital to both the battery industry and national defense, and China dominates the global market. Company CEO Anthony Huston said the site “is the perfect home for the second link in our strategy to build a 100-percent U.S.-based advanced graphite supply chain.” Yet the company plans to rely on a Chinese manufacturer, Hunan Chenyu Fuji New Energy Technology Co., for design, construction, and operations — underscoring how even “domestic” supply chains remain tied to global networks and exposed to geopolitical risks.
On the strength of its promises to reduce reliance on overseas sources, the venture has received significant subsidies. In 2019, Republican Governor Mike Dunleavy nominated it as a high-priority infrastructure project, streamlining permitting. Four years later, Graphite One secured pivotal support from the U.S. Department of Defense. With funds from the Inflation Reduction Act, the company received a $37.5 million grant to expedite its feasibility study. Framed as a national security measure under the Defense Production Act, the funding aimed to develop domestic supplies of critical minerals. The resulting analysis estimated the mine could generate $43 billion in revenue for the Canadian company. In 2023, Graphite One received an additional $4.7 million from the Defense Department to develop a foam fire suppressant. Earlier this month, the company received $570 million from the Export-Import Bank of the United States, the official credit agency of the federal government.
This kind of governmental support has helped fuel a surge in mining across Alaska, where state officials are encouraging rapid development. Dunleavy recently decreed that if a state agency misses a permitting deadline, the project gains automatic approval — raising concerns of a regulatory free-for-all. Earlier this month, for example, the state approved a United States Antimony Corporation operation near Fairbanks, just three months after the company acquired the mine, saying it met permitting exemptions under state law.
In Graphite One’s case, fast-tracking has pushed tribal input to the margins. In September 2023, the tribal governments of three Inupiaq communities sent letters to the U.S. Department of Defense, protesting the fact they had not been consulted as legally required before the agency funded the project’s feasibility study. It did not respond until the White House intervened. “After the fact doesn’t count,” said Austin Ahmasuk, a Nome Eskimo Community tribal member.
During a Zoom meeting more than a year later, the department finally acknowledged the oversight, but the tribes report they never received the promised meeting notes or any follow up. The feasibility study the company produced with that federal funding explicitly tries to exclude tribes as “cooperating agencies,” limiting their ability to influence project planning and environmental assessments. (The U.S. Army Corps told Grist this was incorrect, and that relevant tribal entities have been invited into the FAST-41 process.) All of this “violates free, prior, and informed consent,” Ahmasuk said, referring to a requirement under the U.N. Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, or UNDRIP, that tribes be consulted and involved in any decisions affecting their lands.
A similar pattern is emerging with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. It initially estimated an environmental review would take over two years, but after a 2023 Supreme Court decision narrowed the definition of “waters of the United States,” the agency reduced the review’s scope, despite the company’s plans to expand the size of the mine, and accelerated its timeline. Tribes have insisted on the required consultation before this permit is issued, and while the Corps has agreed in principle, Graphite One submitted an application in August, while a meeting has not yet been confirmed. These expedited reviews, said Hal Shepherd, a consultant who works with tribes on water policy, turn consultation from a meaningful process into a bureaucratic checkbox. “Even if consultation does take place, the tribes are in an uphill battle to have any meaningful input for this project,” Shepherd said.
Such consultation is more than a courtesy — it is a legal and ethical requirement. Multiple federal laws and statutes require agencies to engage with tribes on projects that affect their lands. Yet across the country, critical mineral projects are pressing ahead with minimal input from the Indigenous peoples whose lands and resources they affect. In Nevada, the Thacker Pass lithium mine moved forward in February without free, prior, and informed consent. In Minnesota, tribes report being sidelined as the Department of Defense funds mineral projects, while in Arizona, a transfer of federal lands to a copper mining company was just greenlit despite a lawsuit from the Apache Stronghold.
Canada also has moved to require meaningful Indigenous consultation. Although Canadian regulations generally don’t extend to operations abroad, British Columbia, where Graphite One is based, became the first jurisdiction in Canada to enshrine Indigenous rights under UNDRIP in 2019. In 2021, Canada’s Parliament followed, requiring federal laws to align with the U.N. declaration.
Amid these broader Indigenous rights debates, Alaska Native communities are voicing their concerns: Tribal leaders from around the Kigluaik Mountains gathered September 20 to oppose Graphite One. They discussed its “irreversible damage,” the potential violence against women that often accompanies the arrival of a large workforce in remote locations, and the generational impacts to the landscape. Tribal leaders also brought up the Trump administration’s executive order eliminating federal diversity and anti-discrimination policies, which they worry will undermine potential job opportunities at the mine for community members.
Although some Nome residents support the mine for its potential economic benefits, others are upset that the Bering Straits Native Corporation, a regional for-profit entity where many tribal members are enrolled as shareholders, invested $2 million in the project without a shareholder vote. “The tribe has the treaty responsibility and the right to government-to-government consultation,” said Nome Eskimo Community tribal member Addy Ahmasuk, who is Austin’s daughter. “But the corporation has taken up a lot of power as the owner of the subsurface rights.” When corporate interests exploit divisions within Native communities, she said, sovereignty debates can turn into conflicts over profit rather than a community’s well-being.
These divisions are compounded by accelerated reviews, which Austin Ahmasuk worries means environmental risks will be overlooked. “Even now, at the exploration stage, there’s a very noticeable change in the landscape,” he said, including the construction of roads, which he said will likely damage cultural sites. “You simply cannot avoid the archeological history. You essentially stumble across it everywhere,” he said.
On a recent afternoon, he tried to imagine what his hometown would look like once the mine was built. The company plans to build a facility almost as large as the town itself to store its ore. The public road the trucks would rumble down crosses numerous salmon streams, where families go to put away fish for the winter. “This mine needs so much infrastructure,” he said. “That’s a significant change to the community.” New sections of road risk disturbing wildlife habitat and may prevent access to hunting grounds and fishing sites generations have depended on. Without these lands, he said, families risk losing their main sources of food. Oversight of the mine, he added, will fall largely on the community “to even understand potential violations,” noting that state and federal regulators are rarely present in the region, and in his experience, provide only minimal monitoring. “People who really care about this area, we feel sort of hopeless,” he said.
Addy Ahmasuk, meanwhile, fears the toxic tailing ponds mining creates will pollute Imuruk Basin, which sustains the surrounding communities. Graphite One plans to mill and burn the ore to concentrate it prior to shipping, releasing graphite into the wind near a lagoon many families depend on for potable water, especially communities like Teller that lack running water. “Graphite dust makes water undrinkable,” she said. The ground naturally contains sulfides that, when disturbed by mining, will create a significant risk of acid drainage that will require long-term management. “Pretty much every mine that’s mining in sulfide material has some sort of water quality impact,” said Dave Chambers, founder of The Center for Science in Public Participation. The nonprofit provides technical support on mining and has been following the project closely.
He notes faster permitting has historically led to mining projects that go awry, pointing to the Rock Creek Mine, an open-pit gold mine near Nome that benefited from accelerated oversight. “Not only did the mine not even open because their engineering was so sloppy, but they killed a couple people,” Chambers said. “That’s a really good example of what happens when you try to grease the skids and get a project through as fast as possible.”
For Addy Ahmasuk, the lesson isn’t just to slow down, it’s to rethink what activism can look like. This land is central to her tribe’s creation myths. She’s launched a grassroots organization, Sacred Kigluait, aimed at restoring and sharing the stories that colonization and boarding schools sought to erase. In doing so, she hopes to protect more than just the land under threat from Graphite One — she’s fighting for the living traditions rooted in it. “The center point isn’t stopping a mine,” she said. “The center point is coming together to remember our creation stories and start telling them again.”

(Campaign photo)Former Marine fighter pilot Amy McGrath has launched a campaign for Kentucky’s open U.S. Senate seat, her second U.S. Senate bid after losing to longtime Republican incumbent Sen. Mitch McConnell in 2020. 
McGrath in a social media post Monday morning featured a video of her walking up to a lone chair while saying, “This isn’t just a chair. It’s an open seat.” McConnell, 83, the Senate’s longest-ever party leader, set off what promises to be a fierce fight for his seat when he announced in February that he would not seek an eighth term.

McGrath is joining three Democrats already vying for the open U.S. Senate seat.
McGrath wrote in her social media post that “democracy was under siege” and “cowards in Washington are bowing to Donald Trump.” 
“Kentuckians deserve someone battle-tested and ready to fight for them on day one. I’ve spent my life stepping up when the mission was tough and the stakes were high, first as a Marine and now for Kentucky. I’m ready to complete the mission,” McGrath wrote in her post launching the campaign. 
McGrath said in her video that Kentucky’s open U.S. Senate seat “will decide the balance of power in the Senate.” 
The veteran fighter pilot spent more than $90 million as the Democratic U.S. Senate candidate challenging McConnell in 2020, losing by over 400,000 votes. She previously ran for Congress in 2018 to represent Kentucky’s 6th Congressional District covering Central Kentucky, losing to Republican U.S. Rep. Andy Barr by 3 percentage points in a significantly closer election. 
Barr is now among the candidates in the Republican primary also seeking the U.S. Senate seat, along with former Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron and Lexington businessman Nate Morris.
In response to a Lexington Herald-Leader article published last month reporting that McGrath was considering launching a campaign, Barr wrote in a post on X: “Bring it on, Amy. This will be fun. I beat you once, and I’ll beat you again.”

Evergy and the Kansas Department of Commerce are exploring the idea of building a Natrium plant in Kansas. (TerraPower)TOPEKA — Increasing energy demands and the need to stabilize aging infrastructure are pushing countries around the world to consider building the next-generation of nuclear power plants, which many are calling a nuclear renaissance.
Kansas may join the revival. The Kansas Department of Commerce and the state’s largest electric company recently announced a memorandum of understanding with TerraPower to determine whether the company’s Natrium nuclear power plant might be appropriate for Kansas.
Kansas Reflector sat down with Andrew Richards, TerraPower’s vice president of government affairs, to discuss how the Natrium nuclear power plant differs from Evergy’s Wolf Creek Nuclear Generating Station that went online in 1985.

Andrew Richards, TerraPower vice president of government affairs (Submitted)

How do older nuclear power plants, like Wolf Creek, operate?
The Wolf Creek power plant is a pressurized water reactor, operating at a very high pressure in a container and using water as its coolant, Richards said.
“The fuel rods are enriched uranium, radioactive,” he said. “They lower into the water, the water boils, the boiling water creates steam. That steam spins a turbine to create electricity. The water also acts as a coolant.”
How does TerraPower’s nuclear power plant operate?
The Natrium reactor uses liquid sodium rather than water as a coolant, Richards said. With a boiling point of 800 degrees Celsius, or 1472 degrees Fahrenheit, the liquid offers less chance of boiling off in case of an accident, he said.
The reactor operates at atmospheric pressure, meaning it works in a lower pressure environment than traditional nuclear reactors, Richards said.
“At a very high level, the coolant is probably the biggest safety case for our reactor,” he said.
Additionally, the fuel is substantially different, he said.
Reactors like Wolf Creek use low-enriched uranium, which is enriched up to 5%, Richards said. Uranium enrichment is a process of increasing the amount of a specific isotope, U-235, that is in the uranium, according to the World Nuclear Association.
The Natrium reactor uses uranium enriched up to 20%, called Halo, Richards said.
“That means it’s more efficient and we don’t need as much of it, which essentially creates less spent nuclear fuel or nuclear waste,” he said.
Another difference is layout of the facility, which is split into two separate sections, a concept unique to TerraPower’s plant, Richards said.
In a smaller area, about 170 square feet out of the total development of 738 square feet, is a “nuclear island” where the reactor sits, he said. That area is the only part of the project that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission oversees for licensing, and it’s built using nuclear-rated cement and with other safety precautions.
A separate area, referred to as an “energy island,” houses molten salt energy storage tanks, which are large tanks where the heat from the reactor is stored, Richards said. That heat is then used to turn the turbine to create electricity.
A unique design used by TerraPower for its Natrium nuclear power plant is to separate the reactor area from the area where energy is stored, as shown in this graphic. (TerraPower)
Can the Natrium ramp up and down to easily respond to energy demands?
Richards said the Natrium provides a base of 345 megawatts of energy but the salt storage tanks allow it to ramp up to 500 megawatts for up to about 5.5 hours.
For comparison, the two natural gas plants Evergy is planning to build will each add 710 megawatts of power to the company’s generation portfolio and have an expected life of 40 years. Generally, 1 megawatts will power 1,000 homes, so the addition of 1,420 megawatts will power about 1.4 million homes.
Where else are you developing Natrium nuclear reactors?
The first Natrium is under construction in Wyoming, Richards said. The company also is talking to other countries, including the United Kingdom and South Korea, where Richards said many of the company’s investors are from.
Richards said it’s important for TerraPower, a company founded 18 years ago by Bill Gates, to get the Wyoming plant online. Many people don’t understand how real the project is because a lot of projections have been made about nuclear energy, he said.
“There’s a lot of nuclear companies and there’s a lot of promises being made. For TerraPower, we’re under construction. We’re moving ahead as fast as possible for a Wyoming reactor,” he said. “We anticipate it coming online by 2030 so we’re less talk and we’re more action. We’re eager to show the world that, yes, we can do this.”
Cost for nuclear energy has been considered prohibitive, and the Wyoming Natrium plant is estimated to cost $4 billion. How do you foresee a project of that cost working in a regulated utility environment like Kansas?
“The MOU we just announced allows us to begin having those conversations with Evergy,” Richards said. “It’s still very early days in terms of pricing or how it would work in Evergy service territory.”
However, Richards said Wyoming offers one option for managing costs.
“The Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program created by Congress in 2020 allowed us to do the project in Wyoming,” he said. “It’s a 50-50 partnership with the U.S. government and TerraPower. Each Congress has appropriated a substantial amount of money to push this plant forward, and it’s not just the plant that we’re building. It’s the entire Natrium supply chain — that means the supplying, the reactor vessel, the fuel, the licensing, the workforce.”
Does the current administration, which has been pushing for more coal power, support nuclear energy?
“I think the administration has been very supportive of the nuclear industry,” Richards said. “President Trump in May signed four civil nuclear executive orders that work to amplify and accelerate the industry. We’ve seen a lot of support under this administration and bipartisanly from Congress for our project.”
What are the benefits of nuclear energy?
Nuclear energy is emission-free, Richards said. The concern about the nuclear waste generated is something that his company acknowledges and is part of the plan for the future.
“Nuclear offers baseload energy — clean, viable base load energy — 24/7,” he said. “I believe Evergy and the Southwest Power Pool are estimating about 134% energy increase by 2034.
What about concerns about nuclear waste?
It’s understood that waste is part of the plan and will have to be addressed, Richards said.
“There are 94 operating reactors in the United States, in 34 states,” he said. “What our plant does is no different than what is done today. We will have spent nuclear fuel, it will be removed from the reactor, put into a pool to cool down. Once it’s cooled down, it will be put into a cement cask and will remain on site until the federal government has a final repository. It’s safe. It’s secure. It is no threat to anyone.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/TFF-foundation-complete-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-06 09:56:13.990205

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)A federal district judge said Kilmar Abrego Garcia can proceed with his claim that human smuggling charges filed against him in Tennessee were done in retaliation for successfully challenging his deportation in another court and should be dismissed.
U.S. District Judge Waverly D. Crenshaw Jr. of the Middle District of Tennessee ruled Friday that Abrego Garcia had shown a “reasonable likelihood of vindictiveness” in the filing of the human smuggling charges.
Those charges were filed this summer, more than two years after the traffic stop they were based on — and just days after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled against the Trump administration in Abrego Garcia’s deportation.
Abrego Garcia said the Tennessee charges were only filed to punish him for exercising his right to challenge his deportation in court, pointing to statements by Trump administration officials that “celebrated the criminal charges against him.”
Those included social media posts by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem that called Abrego Garcia a gang member and human trafficker — he has not been convicted of any criminal charges in the U.S. — and Attorney General Pam Bondi’s statement in a press conference that “Abrego would be found guilty, sentenced, and ‘returned to his home country of El Salvador.’”
“While many of the statements made by the Executive Official Defendants about Abrego raise cause for concern, one stands out amongst the rest,” Crenshaw wrote in his 16-page ruling, citing televised remarks by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blache, the Justice Department official overseeing the acting U.S. attorney in Tennessee.
Abrego Garcia transferred to Pennsylvania facility, against lawyers’ wishes

Crenshaw wrote that Blache “told the public on television on the day of Abrego’s arrest that the government started ‘investigating’ Abrego after ‘a judge in Maryland . . . questioned’ the government’s decision to deport Abrego, found that it ‘had no right to deport him,’ and ‘accus[ed] [the government] of doing something wrong.”
“Deputy Attorney General Blanche’s remarkable statements could directly establish that the motivations for Abrego’s criminal charges stem from his exercise of his constitutional and statutory rights to bring suit against the Executive Official Defendants, rather than a genuine desire to prosecute him for alleged criminal misconduct,” Crenshaw wrote.
Abrego Garcia is entitled to discovery and a hearing on his claim, Crenshaw said, and he ordered attorneys for both sides back in his court Oct. 10 for a status hearing in the case to discuss the scope of discovery.
Abrego Garcia is a native of El Salvador who said he came to the U.S. illegally as a teenager in 2011 to escape gang violence at home. He was arrested on immigration charges but in 2019 was granted “withholding of removal” status by an immigration judge because of the danger he would face from gangs if returned to El Salvador.
The withholding status allowed Abrego Garcia to stay and work in Maryland, where he was married and raising a family. Despite that status, Abrego Garcia was pulled over in a traffic stop by Immigration and Customs Enforcement in March and deported to El Salvador — a deportation the administration later acknowledged was a mistake.
Abrego Garcia’s wife quickly filed suit seeking his return from CECOT, the terrorism confinement center in El Salvador where he was held with hundreds of other U.S. deportees. Trump administration officials said he was out of their jurisdiction in CECOT, while Salvadoran officials said the decision on his placement belonged to the U.S., not them.










Deputy Attorney General Blanche’s remarkable statements could directly establish that the motivations for Abrego’s criminal charges stem from his exercise of his constitutional and statutory rights to bring suit against the Executive Official Defendants, rather than a genuine desire to prosecute him for alleged criminal misconduct.


– U.S. District Judge Waverly D. Crenshaw Jr.


Ultimately, the courts made the decision for them, ordering Abrego Garcia’s return. The Trump administration appealed to the Supreme Court, which ruled unanimously on April 10 that the administration must “facilitate” Abrego Garcia’s return.
Just days after the Supreme Court’s ruling, the Department of Homeland Security reopened an investigation into a Nov. 30, 2022, traffic stop in Putnam County, Tennessee, when Abrego Garcia was pulled over for speeding with a car full of passengers.
Tennessee Highway Patrol officers who stopped him at the time did not charge him and “sent him on his way,” Crenshaw wrote. They referred the stop to Homeland Security Investigations, which took no action on it until March 12, 2025 — three days before Abrego Garcia was pulled over in Maryland — when the Tennessee case was officially closed.
The case was reopened in April, shortly after the Supreme Court ruling, and by May 21 a grand jury in the Middle District of Tennessee had indicted Abrego Garcia on the human smuggling charges. Only then was he returned from El Salvador and arrested on June 6.
“HSI [Homeland Security Investigations] reopened that investigation, after closing it the month prior, only 24 days after Abrego filed his civil suit, 13 days after he obtained relief in the District Court, and a mere seven days after he prevailed against the Executive Official Defendants on appeal at the Supreme Court,” Crenshaw wrote. “All of this stands in stark contrast to the 832 days the HSI investigation into Abrego remained pending, without referral to the U.S. Attorney’s Office in the Middle District of Tennessee for prosecution.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Crenshaw noted that in 15 years of criminal cases stemming from traffic stops throughout the entire 6th U.S. Circuit, only Abrego Garcia faced charges “filed significantly — 903 days — after the date of the traffic stop. This supports his contention that there may be an improper motive for his prosecution.”
Friday’s ruling comes just days after it was revealed that an immigration judge in Maryland had denied Abrego Garcia’s request to reopen his asylum case.
It also came two days after the federal government shutdown — which led Justice Department attorneys to request a delay in Abrego Garcia’s case in Maryland, where his immigration status is at issue, because they were furloughed in the shutdown and cannot appear.
Abrego Garcia’s attorneys opposed that motion, arguing that the case should proceed during the shutdown, and that their client, currently held in a detention center in Pennsylvania, should be released to home detention.

HOST: Jennifer Smith
GUEST: Michael Leary







IN SOME WAYS, health care providers in the more far-flung regions of Massachusetts are running into the same problems as everyone else, like the primary care crisis, specialist staffing shortages, and coverage fears from looming Medicaid cuts. Adding in narrow roadways, a dispersed and aging population, and fierce New England hill town weather only makes the access math harder. 
This week on The Codcast, CommonWealth Beacon reporter Jennifer Smith talks with Michael Leary, director of media relations for Berkshire Health Systems. The system has three hospitals, including the 298-bed Berkshire Medical Center in Pittsfield as the county’s primary hospital. Two critical access hospitals – Fairview Hospital in Great Barrington and North Adams Regional Hospital – anchor the southern and northern edges of the county. 
They dive into what makes Berkshire County such a complicated puzzle of health care access, even with the re-opening of the North Adams hospital after a decade of closure.  
“I vividly remember the day” the hospital closed, said Leary, a North Adams resident for over 30 years. A good friend worked as his communications counterpart at North Adams Regional, which at the time was managed by the separate Northern Berkshire Healthcare. 
Leary said his friend called on a Tuesday morning, “and said, ‘You know, I just wanna let you know North Adams Regional is closing.’ And I said, ‘When?’ And he said, ‘Friday,’ which was a shock to everybody.” 
The hospital was not financially sustainable because it did not qualify for critical access hospital status, which comes with dedicated federal Medicaid and Medicare funding. At the time, Leary noted, federal legislation said that if the center was within a certain number of minutes or miles from an acute care hospital, it did not qualify. North Adams “fell right into the narrow edges of that” with Berkshire Medical Center and a hospital in Bennington, Vermont. 
Through finagling by US Rep. Richard Neal, the language was changed to include a carve out for hospitals accessible by just a two-way road like North Adams. With the designation in hand, the facility re-opened a decade after closing. 
But access issues persist, Leary said. “Transportation is always an issue in the Berkshires due to the wide geography,” he said, “and the fact that we are limited with the type of rural main roads that we have here in the county.”  
And the dispersed population makes maintaining infrastructure like maternity units difficult. The North Adams hospital had a full maternity unit before its closure, but on re-opening as a critical access site it didn’t have the expected numbers that would make a maternity unit sustainable, Leary said. People looking for more than an OB/GYN have to travel to Pittsfield or further. 
The other open question is the impacts of federal funding cuts to Medicaid programing, which would not take effect until after the 2026 midterms. Berkshire Medical Center and Fairview Hospital will receive part of a $17 million allocation – with the specific hospital-by-hospital amount not yet released – from $122 million in state funding announced in September to shore up acute care hospitals. 
Berkshire Medical Systems has not publicly announced plans to pursue some of the $50 billion rural health fund included as part of the Trump tax law signed in July. 
“We are keeping a very close eye on [the Medicaid cuts] and whatever impact it would have here on the Berkshires,” Leary said. “We are very fortunate to have had a very good sustainable financial model for a number of years now. We consider ourselves to be a very good financial performer. It doesn’t mean that we’re not worried, it doesn’t mean that we’re not challenged, but we are keeping an eye on everything, and we will continue to serve our patients as best we can.” 
On the episode, Leary discusses the difficult geographic features of Berkshire County (2:45), challenges with recruiting staff (11:25), and health policy changes on the federal level (21:25).",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/The-Codcast_Wide-Banner.png?fit=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-06 09:56:13.990205

After decades of population decline following deindustrialization, waves of immigration from Muslim-majority countries have helped revitalize this Michigan community. Today, crime rates in immigrant-heavy neighborhoods are significantly lower than in other parts of the city. Small businesses line the streets, families walk to school and the community has regained much of the vitality it had lost.
This might seem unexpected to those who follow recent political rhetoric around immigration and crime. In April, when a Michigan lawmaker characterized immigrants as “violent gangbangers, perverts, scammers and all sorts of other criminals,” he was speaking to widely held but unsupported concerns following a surge in immigration. So, what does the evidence actually show?
Consider what U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s (ICE) own data tells us. According to ICE’s September 2025 records from Michigan, the overwhelming majority of those detained, 86%, are classified as having “No ICE Threat Level,” with no prior criminal convictions. Decades of research have actually found that people who are undocumented are more than 30% less likely to commit crimes than native-born Americans. 
What we’re seeing in Hamtramck reflects a broader trend documented across the country, where immigrant communities often contribute to neighborhood stability rather than undermining it. In fact, of the top 10 Michigan cities with the highest proportion of foreign-born residents, the majority had lower than average property crime and violent crime given both their size and poverty levels.

Why would this be? Laurence Benenson, policy liaison at the Law Enforcement Immigration Task Force — a group primarily composed of police officers — observes that immigration is highly self-selective; the people willing to uproot their lives are typically motivated, law-abiding individuals, not criminals looking to exploit the system. This explains why crime rates often drop as immigrants move into an area. 
Yet media coverage tells a dramatically altered story. Between 2022 and 2024, Fox News aired nearly 1,000 segments on “migrant crime,” with coverage jumping 880% in early 2024. These broadcasts increased even as violent crime declined nationwide and research continued to confirm lower crime rates among immigrants. At the same time, claims that the U.S. is under invasion by transnational Latin American gangs, such as MS-13 and Tren de Aragua, have been used to justify the use of the Alien Enemies Act, enabling deportations without due process. 
But Maya Barak, who teaches criminology at the University of Michigan-Dearborn and specifically studied transnational Latin American gangs like MS-13, says these groups tend to be concentrated on the coasts and aren’t considered a significant public safety threat in Michigan. She adds that most gang violence is between and among rivals and tends not to extend into the community, where they don’t have a foothold. 
Under the Trump administration’s mass deportation campaign, with H.R.1 transforming ICE into the highest-funded domestic enforcement agency, arrests have increased 150% in Michigan. Raids can now proceed at schools, churches and hospitals. Six Michigan cities and counties have signed potentially costly 287(g) agreements, deputizing local law enforcement for immigration duties and paving the way for mass deportation. 
This enforcement environment undermines public safety. According to Barak, it pushes people underground out of fear, endangering community trust and limiting law enforcement. Current policies are terrorizing immigrant communities, preventing them from contacting emergency services, which are often intertwined with local police, discouraging life-saving calls. Washtenaw County Sheriff Alyshia Dyer says federal immigration enforcement demands divert local resources from urgent public safety issues like human trafficking.
Behind these public debates is a human reality. One of the largest polls of asylum seekers in the U.S. shows that nearly 70% of immigrants come to the U.S. seeking a better future for their children, with about 6 in 10 Central American immigrants fleeing crime. These aren’t profiles of violent criminals — they’re profiles of people escaping crime, seeking the same opportunities and security that have drawn people to America for generations.

This story by Marion Umpleby was first published in the Valley News on Oct. 1, 2025.
WHITE RIVER JUNCTION — When collaborators Michelle Ollie and James Sturm set out to start a school for cartooning in the early 2000s, they were met with incredulity. 
Cartooning was still considered a lightweight art form, at least in the eyes of the general public, and a school devoted to the craft, in rural Vermont no less, seemed like a far-fetched endeavor.
“People were like, ‘Oh, you’re making a clown college?’” Sturm said in a recent interview. “It was such a reach for the public imagination.”  
But despite the raised eyebrows, the Center for Cartoon Studies, now in its 20th year, has grown into a hub for burgeoning talent and seasoned cartoonists alike. School alumni include Tillie Walden, whose autobiographical graphic novel “Spinning” earned her a Will Eisner Award, and drag queen Sasha Velour, whose art has appeared on the cover of The New Yorker.
In honor of the milestone, an exhibition is opening in the school’s Colodny building that features cartoons and mock-ups from the center’s early days. The show’s opening reception is set for the end of this week as part of White River Junction’s First Friday festivities. 

As CCS has continued to advance over the years, so has the state of cartooning. Back in the early 2000s, notions of what cartooning could look like were still evolving, and Sturm felt like he could “wrap my head around” their place in the zeitgeist. 
Now bookstore shelves are lined with comic books whose subject matter range from cookbooks to personal memoirs to political manifestos. 
The digital age has also given rise to a culture that communicates through the rapid exchange of symbols and visual imagery, be it with emojis, memes or Instagram posts. 
“Cartoons have been doing that forever,” said Sturm, who turns 60 this month.
Cartooning has also gotten a lot more queer, and so has CCS. In the school’s early days, classes were mainly male, now CCS has so many women and non-binary students that Sturm said he’s surprised “we don’t have a target on our back from the Trump administration.” 
Over the years, the center’s faculty has also grown, too. The school currently has around eight faculty members, many of whom are alumni at the school, in addition to dozens of visiting cartoonists who teach classes over the course of the year. 
“I used to wear 50 hats, now I wear about four,” Sturm said.
One of those hats is director of the school’s Applied Cartooning Lab, which works with national organizations to create educational cartoons about topics such as health care, civic engagement and mental health. A couple years ago, the Lab published “Health and Wealth,” a comic book in which an eclectic cast of animals break down the complexities of the U.S. health care system. The guide, which was a collaboration with students at Harvard College, was distributed to all 535 members of the U.S. Congress.

While CCS has continued to develop work with some of the industry’s most notable cartoonists, with only three facilities concentrated in downtown White River Junction and about two dozen students in the full-time programs, in many ways it remains a humble operation. 
“We punch way above our weight class,” Sturm said.
In addition to the MFA program, CCS also offers one-year and two-year certificates as well as fellowships and summer courses. Tuition for the MFA program for this academic year is $29,750 before scholarships and aid.
CCS’ small scale works for Sturm and Ollie. For one, it makes it easier to enact administrative and curricular changes quickly, but it also helps foster a tight-knit community among students and staff. 
The school’s small operation also feels fitting given that cartooning, by nature, is a medium that can pack a punch even in the tiny margins of a sheet of notebook paper or the back of a napkin. 
CCS is currently in the process of further consolidating the campus. In November, the school plans to start renovations on the town’s historic telegraph building to accommodate classrooms, a production lab, archives and offices.
The completion of the project, slated for next fall, would mean bidding goodbye to the Colodny building on South Main Street, which the school has used since it opened. A historic building that was once a department store, the Colodny’s basement flooded five years ago and as the school turns 20, it’s time to make a change.

Here’s why Los Angeles is the frontline,Ben Christopher,,,,,https://calmatters.org/housing/2025/10/measure-ula-howard-jarvis-ballot-mansion/,A low-tax advocacy group seems intent on making the Los Angeles “mansion tax” the face of their statewide tax-capping ballot measure campaign.,"In summary
A low-tax advocacy group seems intent on making the Los Angeles “mansion tax” the face of their statewide tax-capping ballot measure campaign.


In 2022, the Los Angeles electorate voted to slap the sale of mansions and other high-value real estate deals across the city with a hefty tax. 
Locals have been debating Measure ULA ever since. Supporters call it a vital lifeline for the city’s unhoused and housing insecure who stand to benefit from the hundreds of millions of dollars the initiative has already raked in. Critics call it an economic own-goal that has choked off new apartment construction in a city where new housing is in excruciatingly short supply.
That debate is about to go statewide.
The Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association, a low tax advocacy group, is currently gathering signatures to put a measure on California’s November 2026 ballot. A central part of their pitch: No more Measure ULAs. 
The proposed constitutional amendment takes aim at two types of taxation common across California:

Transfer taxes on the sale of real estate. The measure would cap rates at a little more than one-twentieth of one percent of the value of the property. Los Angeles’ highest rate is one hundred-times higher.


Local tax measures put on the ballot by voter-backed campaigns (as opposed those put there by city councils) that are earmarked for a particular purpose. The tax-capping proposal would raise the electoral support needed to pass these types of “special” tax measures to two-thirds, up from a simple majority of more than 50%. 

Municipal governments across the state stand to lose billions of dollars (with taxpayers standing to save just as much) if the measure ultimately succeeds. Voter-proposed tax hikes have been approved by simple majorities in cities and counties across California. Transfer tax hikes have also been a popular funding source for certain local governments. 
Measure ULA, which 58% of Los Angeles voters backed in 2022, happens to be both. The Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association and its political allies appear happy to make it the face of the statewide campaign.
Putting a lid on both citizen-initiated tax measures and high transfer taxes “is something that we have always had as a priority,” said Rob Lapsely, president of the California Business Roundtable, a coalition that has yet to take a formal position on the measure but which backed an earlier version. “The question was, ‘can we actually find the right opportunity?’” 
“And then suddenly, along came Measure ULA.”
The fight over the “mansion tax”
The City of Los Angeles’ measure was sold to voters as a “mansion tax,” because it sticks new, elevated transfer fee rates on only the highest value sales: 4% on properties between $5 million and $10 million and 5.5% for those above that. Those numbers have inched up with inflation. All sales below those thresholds are taxed at roughly half of one percent.
Since going into effect in 2023, the measure has raised some $830 million for affordable housing construction, subsidies for cash-strapped renters and legal assistance for tenants facing eviction. It is by far the largest single contributor to the city’s overall homelessness spending.
But ULA has its critics. Not just a tax on mansions, the high rates apply to commercial, industrial and multifamily residential projects too, including land sales for new apartment developments. Apartment construction has indeed slowed to a crawl across the city in recent years and developers and researchers have laid at least some of the blame on the city’s high transfer taxes which they argue has driven new construction down further than in surrounding cities. One report by researchers at UCLA and the Rand Institute estimated that the measure has resulted in 1,910 fewer apartments per year, including 168 fewer affordable units. Another study by researchers at Harvard, UC Irvine and UC San Diego, found that property tax collections fell steeply as a result of the dramatic slow down in sales, off-setting an estimated 63% of the collect transfer tax revenue, if not significantly more. 
Backers of the mansion tax have taken issue with the UCLA study in particular. They also note that the program is currently accepting applications for its first major distribution of funds, with plans to push nearly $400 million out the door, which could ultimately ramp up affordable housing development across the city.
But there’s growing concern, both in Los Angeles and among Democrats in Sacramento, that ULA as it currently exists has become a political vulnerability — and one that could fuel the campaign behind the statewide tax busting measure.
“Measure ULA is the tail wagging the dog,” said Mott Smith, a developer and board member of the California Infill Builders Association who co-authored another study that found a chilling effect on the housing market. “Anyone with assets in Los Angeles is like, ‘please where can I send my check to Howard Jarvis?’”

In the final days of the California Legislative session, Mayor Karen Bass and former Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg tried to hammer a grand bargain into state law. Senate Bill 423 would have exempted certain new residential developments from the tax, offering a reprieve to many multifamily housing developers. It would have also given the city more flexibility to renegotiate affordability requirements on housing projects funded by the measure, addressing concerns by some developers and financiers that ULA cash comes with too many strings attached to be of use. 
The bill would have also exempted homes destroyed in the recent wildfires. 
But there was a catch: The ULA tweak would only go into effect if the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association pulls its ballot measure or it fails to qualify for the ballot.
All of that ultimately proved too complicated, contentious and of questionable legality to ram through the Legislature in the final days of the session. Long Beach Sen. Lena Gonzalez and Inglewood Assemblymember Tina McKinnor, both Democrats, vowed to pick it up again in January.

But that may be too late to neuter the anti-tax campaign. The Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association is already gathering signatures and raising funds. 
“This was an attempt to cut us off early in the process, but since we’re moving forward I think the attempt to leverage this is not going to prevail,” Jon Coupal, the association’s president. “Their opportunity to ambush us is now over.”
That’s given local government groups billions of reasons to worry. Along with making it more challenging to raise revenue in the future, cities with existing high transfer taxes would see them slashed. Parcel taxes currently on the books that were approved by majorities of less than two-thirds would be similarly nixed. 
Cities would lose between $2 billion and $3 billion each year if the measure becomes law, according to an analysis commissioned by the League of California Cities, a lobbying group. That includes hundreds of millions of dollars in foregone funding dedicated for new housing and homelessness services in Los Angeles and Santa Monica. But it also includes hundreds of millions more for cities that don’t use these transfer dollars for new, specific purposes and projects, but simply to top up their budgets.
The City of Berkeley, for example, stands to lose between $33 million and $63 million, according to the League’s analysis. That’s the equivalent of between 15-30% of the town’s general fund.

California’s favorite fight
Californians have been having some version of this fight for nearly half a century. 
In 1978, voters passed Proposition 13, which capped property taxes and put strict limits on local and state governments’ ability to raise revenue. Defending, rolling back and revising those limits in court battles and subsequent state ballot measure campaigns is now a storied California political tradition.  
The latest chapter begins in 2017 when the California Supreme Court ruled in a case against the southern California city of Upland that citizen-initiated special tax measures only need to get more than 50% of the vote to pass. Up until that point it was presumed that the required threshold was the much more electorally formidable two-thirds. 
Since then cities and counties have passed two dozen of these measures by margins of less than two-thirds. That includes taxes on parcels, sales and gross receipts that have been used to fund local schools, parks, street repairs and housing and that have been put on the ballot by homeless advocates, environmentalists and organized labor groups. It also includes Measure ULA.
And since then, business groups have been clambering to close the “Upland loophole.”
“This is now the vehicle for unions and others to be able to try and pass new taxes on targeted business sectors using a majority vote,” said Lapsely. “That only hurts job growth.”
Over that same period some cities have also turned to transfer taxes as a new source of revenue. It’s a fiscal avenue only available to a select number of cities. Under state law, most municipalities max out their  transfer taxes at 55 cents for every $1,000 in sale value. But for “charter cities” — local governments with their own municipal constitution — there is no upper limit. Twenty-six have taken advantage of that fiscal opportunity.
They include Santa Monica, which passed its own version of a high-value transfer tax (Measure GS) in 2022, and Los Angeles. Voters in cities across the San Francisco Bay Area have voted to make more modest or incremental hikes over the last 10 years. 
Electoral hurdles to come
The transfer tax trend has particularly irked landlords and real estate developers. 
Last year, they joined forces with anti-tax advocates and other business groups to rein in both types of bothersome taxation with a ballot measure. The California Supreme Court took the unusual step of striking it from the 2024 ballot, ruling that it proposed too “substantial” a change to state government to be enacted by a mere ballot measure. 
This year’s version is much more carefully targeted making it less likely to hit this same constitutional snag. 
But even if the signature gathering effort is successful, the Howard Jarvis campaign has its work cut out for it — even for a conservative-coded measure in reliably blue California. In late 2023, the Legislature floated its own head-spinning ballot measure that would require future initiatives that want to hike the threshold needed to pass other measures (see: the business-backed measure) to meet that same higher threshold (in this case, two-thirds) before becoming law. 
That effort to hoist the Howard Jarvis Taxpayer Association on its own petard is already slated for the November 2026 election. If it passes, it would apply to any other measures also on the ballot.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/040425_Palm-springs-House_GETTY_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-06 08:57:21.779811

Newsom should know better than to let L.A. set state policy on housing.","Guest Commentary written by

Marc Vukcevich
Marc Vukcevich is the director of state policy at Streets For All, a pro-transit and smart land use organization.


Gov. Gavin Newsom has a decision to make.
On his desk is Senate Bill 79 by state Sen. Scott Wiener, legislation that meets the moment on California’s climate, housing and transportation needs by allowing the construction of more homes near transit and existing job centers — exactly where California needs them most. 
Signing it should be an easy call, especially after how heavily amended the bill was in the legislature. But there’s pressure to block it, and much of that pressure is coming from Los Angeles.
L.A. is in no position to set the state’s housing policy. Newsom should know that.
The city hit a 10-year low in housing permits last year, all while rents soar and homelessness persists. New York City, a city about twice as large as L.A. and also experiencing a housing crisis, is on track to build 50,000 units this year. Meanwhile, L.A. had permitted 3,100 as of July.
The housing that does get approved isn’t thanks to local leadership, either. Much of it is the result of state mandates like California’s density bonus law and the legalization of accessory dwelling units. 
Without Sacramento’s intervention, Los Angeles would be building next to nothing.
Yet some of L.A.’s most powerful voices are asking the governor to pull the plug on SB 79. Mayor Karen Bass, Councilmember Traci Park and City Attorney Hydee Feldstein Soto have emerged as the city’s three chief NIMBYs.
In addition to gutting her own flagship affordable housing policy, ED 1, Bass has used her influence to secure an exemption from SB 9 in the Palisades, shielding one of the city’s wealthiest enclaves from modest duplex reforms. That compromise might be understandable — sensitive hillsides and fire zones aren’t the best places for new housing. But if we’re going to restrict growth there, then we have to make up for it elsewhere — especially in the urban, transit-rich parts of L.A. where new homes make the most sense.
Instead, Bass now argues that SB 79 somehow undermines a “pro-housing city like Los Angeles.” If L.A. were truly pro-housing, its permitting record wouldn’t be scraping the bottom.
Park and Feldstein Soto, in addition to campaigning against housing, have worked to block the Venice Dell affordable housing project on city-owned land — an already city council-approved project designed to house Angelenos most in need. 
Rather than championing urgently needed homes, they’ve thrown up obstacles and delays time and time again.
The truth is clear: Los Angeles has failed to lead on housing, and when it has moved at all, it’s only because state law forced its hand. Giving L.A. a veto over state policy would doom California to more of the same — rising costs, worsening displacement and endless obstruction.
Newsom has pledged bold leadership on housing. Now is the moment to show it. SB 79 is not about punishing cities; it’s about ensuring that homes get built where they make the most sense — in urban, transit-rich areas where people can thrive without long commutes or car dependence.

He should sign SB 79, lead the state forward and send a clear message: California’s future won’t be held back by NIMBY politics.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/020422-ELLIS-ACT-BUILDINGS-BG-CM_02.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-06 08:57:21.779811

Thousands of Californians could return to homelessness as the feds reportedly plan to disinvest from permanent housing.


The latest blow in a seemingly endless barrage of bad news for the California agencies tasked with fighting homelessness looms: President Donald Trump’s administration is expected to deeply cut federal funding for permanent housing. 
The news has sent counties throughout California into a panic. The state is bracing to lose hundreds of millions of dollars for permanent housing, which is the one thing experts agree on as the most effective way to solve homelessness.
Across the state, homeless service providers and local leaders are convening emergency meetings to figure out just how bad the cuts are going to be and what to do about them. Some are scrambling to move money around or even re-label their programs to save hard-won housing. Others have already started helping fewer people in anticipation of the cuts.
But they agree on one thing: If these cuts go through, thousands of California’s most vulnerable residents likely will be evicted from their subsidized housing, and may end up back on the street. 
It would likely reverse recent progress made in fixing the state’s severe homelessness problem. 
“I don’t know what they think is going to happen with all these people,” said Maryn Pitt, chair of the Stanislaus County Continuum of Care, which manages the county’s federal homelessness funds. “We’re just going to turn them out and they’ll just disappear? I have no idea, but it seems rather inhumane.”
Her county has 17 permanent housing projects funded with money at risk from federal cuts.
Already reeling from upcoming state cuts to homeless funding, California’s homelessness agencies have been bracing for federal cuts for months, without knowing exactly what to expect. Now, some of those cuts have come into sharper focus. The Trump administration intends to redirect a significant chunk of money away from permanent housing and into temporary housing — while also adding requirements for people to qualify for that temporary aid, according to reporting from Politico, which cited internal HUD documents and interviews with anonymous HUD employees. 
If that happens, only 30% of federal homelessness funds would be available for permanent housing — down from the current rate of 87%. Nationwide, that means the money available for permanent housing will shrink from $3.3 billion down to about $1.1 billion, Politico reported.
That would be a major strategy shift. For years, the Department of Housing and Urban Development has prioritized permanent housing over temporary housing and shelter. Permanent housing is designed to end someone’s homelessness for good, while temporary housing and shelter is a Band-Aid solution: It gets people off the street, but only for a limited time. 
“Losing that much permanent housing will have an impact for generations to come.”Gita O’Neill, interim CEO, Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority
When CalMatters asked the agency to comment on the reported funding cuts it responded with an automatically generated email: “The Radical Left has shut down the government. As a result, HUD’s Office of Public Affairs is operating in a limited capacity, which impacts our ability to promptly engage with the mainstream media.”
The federal government is expected to issue a “notice of funding opportunity” this fall for its continuum of care program, the country’s main source of federal homelessness funding, laying out how much money is available, what it can be used for and what rules apply. That’s where the feds are expected to give official notice of the permanent housing cuts.
Los Angeles County, which has the largest homeless population in California, has $217 million at stake. More than 80% of that goes toward keeping people in permanent housing, said Jessica Reed, associate director of continuum of care planning for the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority. If the projected cuts go through, more than 8,000 units of housing would be at risk, she said. 
It would be “absolutely devastating,” Reed said.
People living in subsidized permanent housing tend to be among California’s most vulnerable, including those who have chronic disabilities and were homeless for years before moving indoors. Many live on meager disability benefits. If their housing subsidies dry up, there’s no way they’ll be able to pay their rent, Reed said. 
Those renters also often have criminal records, poor credit and a history of evictions — making it almost impossible for them to compete for housing on the open market, even if they could afford rent, Pitt said.
Santa Cruz County’s latest continuum of care allocation was about $7.7 million — of which about 82% is for permanent housing, said Robert Ratner, director of Housing for Health for the county. About 290 people live in those units.
If the spending cap takes effect, Santa Cruz County likely would try to shift some state money to cover the housing no longer eligible for federal funds, Ratner said. 
“We’re going to end up having to close most of these programs, because there’s not enough state money,” he said. “There’s no way the math works.”
To prepare, Santa Cruz County has already started winding down some services. 
“We’re helping far fewer people,” Ratner said.
Typically, Santa Cruz County helps between 40 and 60 households move from homelessness into housing each month. If the permanent housing cuts take effect, Ratner expects that to eventually drop by as much as three-quarters. 
To make matters worse, when awarding homelessness grants, the feds plan to deduct points for organizations that have used “racial preferences” or recognized transgender people, according to Politico. The Trump administration already has attempted to impose similar restrictions on other homelessness grants, prompting multiple lawsuits.
Ratner worries those new rules could mean Santa Cruz County isn’t eligible for any money.
Other counties are making similar dire predictions.
Santa Clara County estimates at least 1,000 households would be at risk of homelessness if the feds cap funding for permanent housing at 30%, said Kathryn Kaminski, director of the county’s Office of Supportive Housing. 
Sacramento County, which dedicated about 86% of its $40 million in federal continuum of care funding to permanent housing in 2024, worries the cuts could displace residents, slow housing placements and force service providers to lay off staff. 
The scariest part is that this funding change signals the federal administration is turning its back on the long-standing belief that permanent housing solves homelessness, said Gita O’Neill, interim CEO of the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority. And the feds are making that shift suddenly, giving service providers no time to wind down their programs.
“Which is going to be devastating across the country, no matter where you are,” O’Neill said. “Losing that much permanent housing will have an impact for generations to come.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/102524_Unhoused-Voting_FG_CM_12.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-06 08:57:21.779811

Every house weatherized means more dollars in the local economy, less carbon in the atmosphere wreaking havoc and healthier, more comfortable living for Vermonters.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Marisa D. Keller: Weatherization for a more affordable and sustainable Vermont.","This commentary is by Marisa D. Keller, of Montpelier. Keller is a former weatherization technician, a communications professional, a climate justice volunteer and a part-time staffer with 350Vermont.


On a hot day this summer, I sweated in an attic with a small crew of 350Vermont volunteers, packing an older couple’s possessions into boxes and carrying them down two flights of stairs to a storage container. Our work that day would allow the home to be weatherized (insulated and air-sealed) after two years on a waiting list for a weatherization assistance program that saves households an average of $1,000 a year on energy bills. But the benefits of weatherization go far beyond one household’s savings.
Vermont faces a housing crisis, an affordability crisis and a climate crisis. At the same time, our federal government is canceling grants for low-income solar projects, flood resilience for farms, and local food in schools, while fossil-fuel billionaires are pouring money into opposing clean energy solutions that would help us switch to less costly sources of heat and electricity. 
In this time of crises, we need commonsense solutions that address the big-picture problems while also making people’s lives easier right away. That’s why 350Vermont is working on weatherization. We are a nonprofit with a mission of climate justice — a world in which everyone has access to clean, affordable energy and safe and healthy communities. 
This year our volunteer network is working to support weatherization initiatives across the state, from clearing out attics for the Weatherization Assistance Program to building insulating window inserts for WindowDressers to doing outreach about the many weatherization resources available to Vermonters.
Why weatherization?
Weatherization makes a home more energy efficient by improving insulation and reducing air leaks, while also increasing the health and resilience of our communities and even mitigating the injustices of our world. 
Weatherizing a house brings obvious benefits to the individuals or families living there. It can save a household hundreds of dollars a year in energy costs. It reduces drafts and makes a home warmer in winter and cooler in summer. It can also reduce mold and pests, making the home a healthier place to live.
The benefits of weatherization also ripple out to the community. A third of Vermont households who got help weatherizing their homes last year had previously received fuel assistance from the state because they could not afford to heat their homes. In addition to helping families in need, weatherization makes our communities healthier: Burning less oil, gas and wood reduces air pollution that causes asthma, cancer and heart disease. Less dependence on fossil fuels makes us less vulnerable to global-supply-chain disruptions and price hikes. It also keeps more of our energy dollars in the local economy. And the less energy we need, the better we can supply it for ourselves with clean sources like solar, wind, and thermal energy.
When we take an even broader view, we can see weatherization as a way of fighting climate change and the economic injustices that drive it. The U.S. gives the fossil fuel industry an estimated $757 billion per year in direct and indirect subsidies, which enriches some of the world’s richest and most destructive companies and undermines clean energy solutions. When we buy less oil and gas, we take power back for ourselves and our communities. 
We also make the world a little less unjust: The negative effects of extracting and burning fossil fuels are disproportionately borne by low-income communities, indigenous people and people of color — both in the U.S. and abroad. 
Dramatically reducing the amount of fuel we burn by 2030 is the best way to prevent climate devastation and secure a safe, equitable future for ourselves and our children. Every house weatherized means more dollars in the local economy, less carbon in the atmosphere wreaking havoc and healthier, more comfortable living for Vermonters.

Former U.S. Sen. and Gov. Evan Bayh announced the news in a post to X, followed by a news release.
“I’m proud to announce that my son, Beau, filed his candidacy for Indiana Secretary of State today. A 7th generation Hoosier, Marine Corps infantry Captain, Harvard graduate, and attorney, Beau will bring new leadership to an office that desperately needs it,” he wrote.
Beau Bayh, 29, has been attending key political events and considering a run against Republican Diego Morales.
“Right now, the Secretary of State’s office shows exactly what’s gone wrong,” Beau Bayh said. “Instead of serving Hoosiers, that office has been used to cut backroom deals, with our tax dollars funding perks for politicians and their insider friends. Hoosiers work hard for our money, and it’s being wasted. There’s no accountability. We deserve a Secretary of State who works for the people.”
His plan for the office includes:


Ensuring accountability for every tax dollar by calling out corruption, wasteful spending, and government abuse wherever it exists.


Opposing excessive taxes that are crushing working families.


Overseeing fair and secure elections.


Supporting the thousands of new businesses that create jobs and fuel our economy.


“I know what we’re up against. The secretary of state has a pretty good thing going for himself and his buddies,” Beau Bayh said in his launch video. “They won’t give that up easily. But I’m a Marine and we don’t run from a fight. And we’re all sick of self-serving politicians dividing us for their own benefit. Enough already.”
Morales has been a lightning rod for controversy in his first term, which began in 2023. He has been criticized for excessive travel, giving no-bid contracts to political donors, hiring his brother-in-law and giving massive bonuses to employees.
Democrat Blythe Potter is also running. She served in the U.S. Army Reserves and is a small business owner.
Morales challengers line up as criticism over international trips mounts

Republican Knox County Clerk Dave Shelton ran against Morales in the 2022 convention but fell short in the final tally. He announced he will run again in April days before Morales posted about his intention to run for reelection. Fellow Republican Jamie Reitenour is also challenging Morales.
Libertarian Laura Shillings will seek her party’s nomination.
The party nominees will be chosen at conventions in the summer of 2026 by party insiders and then will face off in the fall.
While in the Marine Corps, Beau Bayh rose to the rank of captain and graduated from the Scout Sniper Unit Leader’s Course.
Following his honorable discharge in 2023, he earned a law degree from Harvard University and served as a judicial law clerk in Bloomington for Judge David F. Hamilton on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.
In August, Beau Bayh was on the SnydeReport podcast and talked about his interest in public service. He also has a twin, Nick.
“Growing up in a family, with my granddad as well, being surrounded by public service, that was always something that was interesting to me,” Beau Bayh said on the podcast. “I had been given all these great opportunities…to whom much is given much is expected and we all have an obligation to give back.”
He follows in the footsteps of his father, who served Indiana in multiple offices for more than 20 years. Evan Bayh’s first office was also Indiana Secretary of State in 1986. Before that, his grandfather, Birch Bayh, also served in the U.S. Senate for almost 20 years.

Applications for the new model open on Jan. 1, 2026.
“We are pleased to offer an alternate path for licensure,” Utah State Bar Executive Director Elizabeth Wright said in a statement. “We were keenly aware that one size doesn’t fit all, and providing an option equips those who excel outside of a traditional exam with practical skills for a successful career in the legal profession.”
States like Oregon and Washington have already implemented the alternative, and multiple other states are exploring similar approaches to licensure. Citing evolving needs of both the profession and the public, the Utah State Bar said the new method is meant to complement the existing bar exam format, a two-day test that Utah administers twice a year. 
The Utah Supreme Court’s approval came after a Bar Admissions Working Group explored alternatives to the traditional bar exam “in response to growing national and local calls for a licensure model that better reflects real-world skills, reduces economic barriers, and supports workforce readiness,” according to the release. 



Let us know what you think...


 


The group was composed of 15 members from the state’s legal community, including judges, practitioners and academics. The method is also backed by research that demonstrates skill-based assessments can be more effective than a standard test alone.
The group emphasized the pathway doesn’t lower the current licensure standards, but modifies how competence is demonstrated.
“This is not about making it easier to become a lawyer,” Utah Supreme Court Associate Chief Justice, and working group chair, John Pearce said in a statement. “It’s about making it smarter. This option gives graduates a financially viable way to begin practicing law without months of unpaid studying and the potential of thousands of dollars in prep costs. The Utah Supreme Court is convinced that this path will produce attorneys who are better prepared to immediately practice law.”

Alabama isn’t alone in seeing rising insurance costs. According to an analysis by KFF, a nonprofit health policy research organization, insurance premiums could more than double for 11 to more than 24 million Americans enrolled in Obamacare.
Experts cite several reasons for the increases, including health care worker shortages, rising drug costs driven in part by tariffs, and the possibility that enhanced subsidies for Affordable Care Act (ACA) plans will expire at the end of the year, possibly affecting people’s abilities to buy health insurance. 
The ACA subsidies are at the center of negotiations amid the federal government shutdown. Democrats in Congress want to extend the funding for the subsidies through the continuing resolution (CR) needed to keep the government funded. Republicans, who control both chambers, claim the extension is partisan and does not have a place in their funding bill.
Provider shortages 
Amanda Williams, the former president of the Medical Association of the State of Alabama (MASA), said in an interview that the cost of practicing medicine has gone up. She said recruiting providers to Alabama is difficult, which contributes to the rising costs. She said the nation’s aging population contributes to an increasing demand for care, but there are not enough providers to meet it, which drives prices up. 
“Nurses is the same kind of problem. So then it makes it more and more expensive to try to get travel nurses to come in,” Williams said. “That can be a big burden for hospitals.”
In addition to recruitment struggles, malpractice rates are also increasing, she said. 
“When we have such a shortage and we have people leaving the state, then it’s more of a burden on all of the other providers,” she said. “You’re reducing access to care. When you reduce access to care, you lead to more hospital visits, more ER visits, when it may have been something that could have been addressed in office, but we don’t have enough physicians. So there’s not enough offices, and then there’s sometimes redundant tests ordered when that happens.”

Drug costs and tariffs

Matthew McGough, an expert in private insurance at KFF, also said pharmaceutical prices and tariffs are also driving costs up. Some increasingly popular medications, like GLP-1s, are causing drug plan premiums to rise because there are many people who qualify for the diabetes and weight loss medication, he said. 
According to ClinCalc DrugStats, a data resource that is managed by pharmacist Sean Kane, almost 5.4 million Americans were prescribed semaglutide, one of four major GLP-1 medications, in 2023. It was the 19th most prescribed medication at almost 26 million prescriptions. It was also one of the most expensive. The average drug cost was $1,322 per prescription with an average out-of-pocket cost of $53 per prescription, according to ClinCalc. 
“Because they are so high cost and so many people could be eligible for them, for weight loss or other conditions, then it can drive up premiums for everyone,” McGough said.
McGough said that a lot of pharmaceuticals and medical equipment are manufactured overseas. Sweeping tariffs enacted by President Donald Trump in April also impact health costs, McGough said. While manufacturers have increased domestic production, he said, it is not easy or quick to alter the production line.
“Companies have been increasing their domestic manufacturing of drugs, and that may be one way that they’re trying to get around these tariffs or gain favor with the administration,” he said. “Because everything’s sort of happening on a country-to-country basis, it’s hard to know what can be done to get around them.”
Trump also announced a 100% tariff on pharmaceuticals Thursday, on top of 25% tariffs on pharmaceuticals imported from Europe announced in July.  

ACA subsidies

Americans nationwide, especially the elderly and those in rural areas, will see increased costs for their health care if Congress does not extend enhanced subsidies by the end of the year. According to Cover Alabama, a nonpartisan advocacy group, and Alabama Arise, which works on issues related to poverty, a couple in their early 60s who make $82,000 a year will see premiums for a benchmark plan jump from around $7,000 to more than $27,000 annually without the subsidies. 
These federal subsidies, enacted under the American Rescue Plan Act and extended by the Inflation Reduction Act, have been critical in keeping health insurance accessible for Alabama families, according to the advocacy groups. 
“Without congressional action, families will face impossible choices between paying for health insurance or putting food on the table,” said Debbie Smith, Cover Alabama campaign director at Alabama Arise. “These are small business owners, older adults and working families who can’t absorb a hike in premiums. Congress has the power to prevent this crisis.”
The expiring subsidies could also create a generally sicker, uninsured population if people currently enrolled in the Affordable Care Act can no longer afford their premiums after the tax credits expire, McGough said.
“If these tax credits were to go away, enrollment is expected to decline,” McGough said in an interview. “A lot of people who have joined the marketplaces over the past few years may decide that they can assume the risk of no longer having health insurance and become uninsured, leaving a sicker, higher cost pool of people that insurers have to cover, thus driving health care costs.”

How can I save money?

Williams and McGough said that a complex issue like rising health costs has an equally complex solution that is completely out of their hands. Even with the rise of costs, however, Williams said the most practical way to say money is to invest in preventative care.
“The best medicine is preventative medicine,” Williams said. “So the more we can keep people well, the better off we’re going to be from a cost perspective. Even though sometimes that means we spend more money up front to make sure people are getting appropriately screened, and vaccines and all the things they need to stay healthy, making sure people are doing their wellness checks. Those kinds of things aren’t free, but can save a whole lot of money in the long run.”
Beyond eating healthy and exercising regularly, Williams also encouraged preventative screening for various cancers, getting vaccinated and getting routine bloodwork.
“If somebody’s blood pressure is getting elevated and they don’t know it, that can lead to strokes and heart attacks and all kinds of really awful things,” she said. “If we caught that sooner, we could have addressed it and it wouldn’t have been a problem.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/waitingforcare2025-1024x769.jpg,,,2025-10-06 08:57:21.779811

If you're using a big share and it's more cost-effective, then that's going to need to be the target,"" said a co-author of the study. (Photo: Bureau of Reclamation Flickr, CC BY-SA 2.0)The most cost-effective and quickest way to conserve the Colorado River’s shrinking water supply amid persistent drought and rapid population growth is changing how states handle the largest use of water on the river: agriculture.
Agriculture uses about 80% of the river’s water, but the good news is that paying farmers not to use water allotted to them has proved to be remarkably cost-effective. 
That’s according to a comprehensive study examining 462 federally funded Colorado River conservation and supply projects using available spending data from the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation. 
The study, published in the Journal of the American Water Resources Association last week, was conducted by UC Riverside’s School of Public Policy in partnership with the Utah Rivers Council.
The water projects examined – ranging from large-scale infrastructure such as reservoirs and wastewater treatment plants to agricultural water use – totaled about $1 billion in federal funding between 2004 and 2024.
“How much water is actually being saved for every dollar we are spending?” asks Mehdi Nemati, an assistant professor of public policy, co-author of the study. “If we want to be more efficient or gain more water saved per dollar spent, then answering this question matters.”
“The big message is not all water savings are equal. Some projects saved water at a fraction of the cost of others,” he continued. 
Agricultural conservation programs conserved water for as low as $69.89 per acre-foot. On average, agricultural conservation programs cost about $417 per acre-foot, while local supply projects —such as reservoirs, wells, and wastewater treatment facilities—cost more than $2,400 per acre-foot on average. (An acre-foot is the amount of water needed to cover one acre of land to a depth of one foot, or about 325,851 gallons.)
“Spending money to conserve water within the agriculture sector seems to be one of the most cost-effective ways. There’s also a lot of room to improve and save more water in this sector,” Nemati said. “About 80% of the water goes to agriculture. If you’re using a big share and it’s more cost-effective, then that’s going to need to be the target.”
Historically, farmers have been reluctant to lower their water use out of fear the government might take their water permanently. But the study found that agricultural conservation programs, particularly those that provided financial incentives to promote behavioral changes among farmers, were successful at delivering water savings at a relatively low cost.
The most common type of agricultural conservation program was paying farmers who rely on the Colorado River to reduce their water use on crops during certain non-critical periods, saving an average of 747 acre-feet per year at a cost of about $140 per acre-foot.
Paying farmers to temporarily leave their fields empty – particularly for water-intensive crops like alfalfa – produced an average annual water saving of 17,500 acre-feet per year at an average cost of about $193 per acre-foot, according to the study.
“Grass, alfalfa, corn pasture, these are all water intensive crops. That’s where we get our most savings per dollar, and there is huge room for savings. I would say these are low hanging fruit,” Nemati said.
Other programs studied paid farmers to replace flood irrigation with precision methods such as drip or sprinkler systems, which demonstrated substantial efficiency improvements while maintaining agricultural productivity.
The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation spent about 30% of water conservation funding between 2004 and 2024 on agricultural projects.
Agricultural conservation projects had an average lifespan of about three years, meaning once those short-term projects end water savings are expected to gradually decline. 
Water-intensive crops are where the savings are
Much of the funding used to pay farmers to conserve Colorado River water was provided by the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act, which helped double agricultural water conservation from 1.5 million acre-feet of water to over 3 million acre-feet of water, according to the study.
Water recycling and treatment facilities also proved to be a cost-effective way to conserve substantial amounts of water in the long-term, despite higher initial construction costs. Water recycling and treatment facilities had an average lifetime cost of $385 per acre-feet with an average annual water savings of about 18,600 acre-feet.
Despite the large potential for water savings through water reuse projects, only about 7% of the bureau’s water conservation funding was spent on reuse projects. California got the lion’s share of that funding, about 80%. Upper Basin states received only 4% of reuse funding, while Tribal areas received no funding. 
There’s a lot of room for improvement in water recycling across states that rely on the Colorado River. One recent study found that Upper Basin states – Colorado, Utah, Wyoming and New Mexico – recycled less than 5% of their water, as compared to Lower Basin states – California, Arizona and Nevada– which recycled more than 30% of their water.
The study also revealed a major disparity in federal funding for water conservation projects between the Upper Basin and Lower Basin states.
Between 2004 and 2024, Upper Basin states only received about 6% of overall water conservation spending by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, while about 75% was directed to the Lower Basin, and about 19% was designated for Tribal areas, some of which extend across both regions.
Nevada received nearly $6 million for 28 water conservation projects for an average annual savings of roughly 1,500 acre-feet at a cost of about $3,800 per acre-foot. 
It’s a stark contrast to Upper Basin states like Colorado, which received about $610,000 in federal funding for 47 water conservation projects for an average annual savings of about 2,100 acre-feet at a cost of about $285 per acre-foot. 
It’s an example of how federal dollars could be more efficiently used to conserve water across the Colorado River Basin by rethinking funding priorities.
“In some areas in Nevada there has been tremendous investment in the urban side and efficiency gains in the urban side. But if you’re looking at the lowest dollar per acre feet, water-intensive crops are the areas we want to target,” Nemati said.
“There are areas in the Upper Basin that could save water for a fraction of money being used in Nevada or southern California,” he said.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/52627025695_ab463b4dc5_o-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-06 08:57:21.779811

Now, Californians and Hawaiians alike can search through every word uttered in public hearings, every dollar given to a politician, every bill introduced and every vote taken in their state legislatures.


CalMatters’ innovative Digital Democracy project is now bringing government transparency to other states, starting with Hawaiʻi. On Sept. 21,  Digital Democracy Hawaiʻi launched in partnership with the Honolulu Civil Beat.
Now, just like Californians, Hawaiians have the power to search through every word uttered in public hearings, every dollar given to a politician, every bill introduced, every vote taken and more in Hawaiʻi’s Legislature. In California, having that level of transparency and data has powered dozens of CalMatters stories.
“We believe the eyes of everyday citizens on the public process will encourage legislators to make better, more thoughtful decisions based on what the people want, not what legislative leaders, lobbyists or other powerful interest groups tell them to do,” wrote Civil Beat Executive Editor-in-Chief Amy Pyle and Ideas Editor Patti Epler about the launch.
CalMatters’ key Digital Democracy funders, the Knight Foundation and Arnold Ventures, are making it possible for CalMatters to bring Digital Democracy to other states.
Already, Digital Democracy Hawaiʻi has triggered the Hawaiʻi State Ethics Commission to fix its state campaign finance data.
A CalMatters Digital Democracy engineer found that a third of the data entries from the state’s campaign finance data were duplicates. After further investigation and contacting the ethics commission, the public data on the commission’s website has been fixed. Colleagues at Civil Beat said that we’ve “helped the entire citizenry” before launch.
And the impact of Digital Democracy California continues to grow.
Most recently, the data behind Digital Democracy powered our personalized My Legislator newsletter, which told Californians what their California state legislators said, voted on, introduced and more every single week. My Legislator ran a beta version for four weeks and is returning in January when the state legislature reconvenes.
People used the newsletter as:

An impetus to contact their legislators, asking about why they voted (and didn’t) on specific legislation.
A way to stay informed that was previously impossible: watching what their California state legislators said, voted on, introduced and more.
A resource to learn about key legislative topics and follow hearings and votes on issues that are important to them.

The Digital Democracy team was awarded the Punch Sulzberger Prize for Journalism Innovation and an Emmy award from the Northern California chapter of the National Academy of Television Arts & Sciences for a collaboration with CBS-TV, “Using new AI, grieving moms discover California lawmakers killed popular fentanyl bill by *not* ​voting.”
We are also honored that Digital Democracy is a finalist for the Trust in American Institutions Challenge, which aims to find and scale “a bold solution that will build and restore public trust.” Our entry, one of 375, rose to the top five finalists after several rounds of judging. Regardless of whether Digital Democracy will be awarded the final prize, the concept is now commended to be, as one judge said, “a strong example of what a bold solution can look like — imaginative, relevant and ready to grow.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/050124-Digital-Democracy-FG-11.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-06 08:57:21.779811

Credit cards, debit cards, cash, checks, wires or sending money to others using a P2P (person-to-person) payment app are examples of the many ways consumers can pay for everyday transactions. To help protect their money from scammers, it’s important for people to understand that how they pay matters, especially when buying something from someone they don’t know or trust.
Here are some examples of common scams impacting payment types:
Checks:
Although declining in usage, many people still regularly use checks, particularly for business transactions. Check fraud can happen in various ways, such as writing bad checks, stealing and altering someone else’s check, forging a check, or depositing the same check twice (once through a mobile app and again at a branch).

Here’s What You Can Do: Never make checks out to “cash.”  Use permanent ink and write the amount in numbers and words. Don’t leave a check book unattended and always send a check directly from the post office or through secured mailboxes; don’t leave them for pickup in your mailbox at home. When possible, opt for electronic payment methods instead of checks.

Person-to-Person Payments:
Person-to-person payments through services like Zelle® can be quick and convenient ways to send money to others you know and trust (e.g., friends and family or your dogwalker). Don’t use Zelle to buy things online, especially through social media marketplaces or messaging apps. If you send money for something that turns out to be a scam, it’s very unlikely you’ll be able to get it back.

Here’s What You Can Do: If you are purchasing goods or merchandise, including things like concert tickets, a credit or debit card that offers purchase protection may be a better option. If at any time you feel pressured, the deal seems too good to be true, or you otherwise suspect it’s a scam, don’t proceed with the purchase.

Credit and Debit Cards:
When you pay with a credit or debit card, you are not responsible for unauthorized charges if your card is lost, stolen or fraudulently used, as long as you report unauthorized charges promptly. Use your card’s security features to help keep it safe.

Here’s What You Can Do: Two-factor authentication can help block anyone who gets your banking information from using it, and setting up credit monitoring helps you know if your card is used fraudulently. Keep your card safe. If you misplace it or think it is lost or stolen, contact your bank immediately, and lock your card from additional charges.

Scammers may try to get you to send a payment to them to pay for something (like concert tickets) that you then never receive. Credit and debit cards may offer some protections that can help you get your money back for purchases you make if you don’t receive what you paid for. If you pay with a credit card, your bank will likely reimburse you for your payment if you don’t receive the goods. If you paid with a debit card, your bank will try to get your money back from the scammer’s bank, but if the scammer has disappeared with your money, they won’t be able to get the funds back, and your bank is not required to reimburse you.

Here’s What You Can Do: Watch out for sellers who require forms of payment that do not provide purchase protection. Before you pay, always ask yourself: “Am I sure this is not a scam?” Always remember: If you’re unsure, walk away.

Wire Transfers:
Wire transfers are convenient and secure, and they work like cash. Only send a wire when you know the details of the recipient and never feel pressured or urged to send one. Wire transfers are a target for scammers because they are often used for high dollar transactions—like homes or cars—and once sent, they cannot be reversed. Scammers can impersonate companies, banks, and government agencies to quickly receive your hard-earned money, move it to another account and disappear. 

Here’s What You Can Do: Never provide your bank account details to unfamiliar or suspicious individuals and avoid wiring money to people or businesses you are unfamiliar with, especially if prompted by suspicious phone calls or emails. 

In a world of growing payment options, it’s important that people make informed choices about how to pay for purchases, especially when buying from a person or business you aren’t familiar with, to help keep their money safe.

“Self-deport” is how our leaders describe people without legal status choosing to leave the country. It implies they did so freely, with no coercion.
And it’s nonsense, as the hell that descended on two Alabama immigrants shows.

University of Alabama graduate student Alireza Doroudi went to Iran after Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested him in March. Giovanna Hernandez-Martinez went to Mexico after Leeds police sent her to ICE this summer
But let’s not pretend either choice was voluntary. Officials kept Doroudi, who had no criminal record, locked in a jail in Louisiana. There, his mental health, hearing and vision deteriorated. The Trump administration eventually acknowledged that it had no evidence for the charge against him.
Yet the judge overseeing the matter, Maithe Gonzalez, refused to release Doroudi on bond. Gonzalez inexplicably and cruelly ordered another hearing in his case. Again, the Trump administration said it could not back the charge against Doroudi.
Doroudi decided to go back to Iran. This was not a choice. It was a rational reaction to a dadaesque application of the rule of law, in which procedure counts more than justice.
Hernandez-Martinez also lacked a criminal record. Far from being a threat to the public, she was improving this state by mentoring youth looking to go to college. But her family told al.com that after being held for weeks, she went to Mexico due in part to a lack of health care in the place where she had been detained.
Hernandez-Martinez came to the United States as a child, just under the cutoff for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which otherwise might have protected her.
“I am struggling to accept that I have left behind my family,” she wrote in a Facebook post last week. “My rock. My friends, loved ones, my community. I am grieving a life I lived since I was 7 years old.”
Only the most crazed racist could see either person as a threat. Doroudi was studying mechanical engineering at the University of Alabama. Hernandez-Martinez earned bachelor’s and master’s degrees from Jacksonville State University.
And yet our government forced them behind bars. They languished there for weeks on the thinnest pretexts. They “chose” to leave the country in the same way that a mugging victim “chooses” to give their wallet to a gunman.
Doroudi and Hernandez-Martinez were not the problem. The law is.
Alabamians who smirk and shrug at these injustices like to tell us that you have to immigrate “the right way.” There will be no problem, they tell us, if you just follow the law.
So I went to the U.S. Customs and Immigration Services website on Tuesday to search the wait times for immigrant visas.
For an I-140 — an immigrant petition for alien workers — the wait was over a year for those classified as unskilled workers.
For an I-130 — a petition for permanent residency for a spouse or a child considered an “alien relative” — the site said 80% of cases would be processed in 97.5 months.
That’s a little over eight years. Forcing people to wait a decade to live with their children? It’s a legal process that discourages people from using the legal process.
And that doesn’t account for processing fees, legal expenses, or the ambushes ICE sets for people trying to follow legal paths to residency. The government makes it next-to-impossible for the vast majority of people who want to immigrate to do so “the right way.”
Nearly all of us have ancestors who came to the United States to find a better life. I guarantee that the government forced few if any of your forebears to live outside the law, or to submit to official thuggery.
Those of you who claim to care about legal processes but have zero interest in making legal immigration feasible should tell us which immigrants deserve legal protections and which do not.
Because it looks to me that the laws governing who gets to be in the country are little more than tools to harm people at the margins for the pleasure of the sadistic or the narrow-minded.
How else do you explain how a woman mentoring Alabama teenagers got thrown in a jail cell? What cynical, violent sophistry can sucker you into believing that makes Alabama a better place?
What kind of soulless automaton thinks an expired visa warrants six weeks in detention and slow torture from neglect?
Our immigration system has cost us two Alabamians who were doing a lot of good. And if you think those cases exemplify law and justice, I’ve got another Orwellian word for you: doublethink.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/gettyimages-2219519292-1024x683-1.jpg,,,2025-10-06 08:57:21.779811

Alabama College Application Week runs through Friday and will allow high school seniors to apply to certain colleges and universities at no charge.
The Alabama State Department of Education said in a news release Wednesday the initiative started over a decade ago to increase the number of students, especially those who would be first generation and low-income students, enrolling in postsecondary education.

“During this event, local high schools will be hosting special college application celebrations with students submitting applications to colleges nationwide,” Monica P. Mack, the coordinator of the Alabama College Application Campaign (ALCAC) said in the statement. “Last year, more than 300 Alabama schools participated and nearly 30,000 students applied to colleges nationwide.”
Chandra Scott, executive director for Alabama Possible, a nonprofit organization that works to “break down barriers to prosperity in Alabama through education, collaboration, and advocacy,” said in a statement Friday the initiative benefits the entire state.
“In Alabama, it’s common for public universities to charge $30–$50 per application fee. When a student applies to multiple colleges—say, 5 or 6—the total fees can quickly climb into the hundreds of dollars, which may discourage some from casting a wide enough net in their college search,” she said. “When more students apply, more students enroll and ultimately, more Alabamians are equipped with the education and skills our state needs for long-term prosperity.”
Jim Purcell, executive director of the Alabama Commission on Higher Education, said in a statement Friday the week allows for equal opportunities in postsecondary education.
“Application fees can be a real barrier for many students and families as they consider their postsecondary options. [Alabama College Application Week] is an important initiative that helps remove that barrier and encourages more students to take that critical first step toward their educational goals,” he said. “By waiving application fees, institutions send a strong message that college is accessible and that every student should have the opportunity to apply without financial hesitation.”
The Cash for College FAFSA initiative, Alabama College Application Campaign and Decision Day were combined into a single campaign, Alabama Goes to College, to help more K-12 students apply for college and complete their Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) application.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-06 11:30:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Breaking down the problem with sewer overflows in Connecticut,John Moritz and Angela Eichhorst,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/06/connecticut-river-untreated-sewage/,CT's combined wastewater systems discharged more than 1.2 billion gallons of wastewater overflows in 2024. Here's what to know.,"A stinky situation in Massachusetts is starting to irritate the senses of politicians in Hartford.
In recent months, Connecticut lawmakers have pointed fingers at their northern neighbor — and each other — over the issue of sewer systems overflowing into the Connecticut River, which runs through the middle of both states on its way to Long Island Sound.
Fed up with complaints from constituents about raw sewage floating down the river, Reps. Tami Zawistowski, R-East Granby, and Devin Carney, R-Lyme, wrote to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency last month asking it to intervene to improve water quality monitoring, discharge alerts and the outdated infrastructure responsible for sending millions of gallons of “contaminated water” into the river.
Those comments drew a rebuke from Democrats, who accused their colleagues of painting an inaccurate picture of the problem. 
Overflows are usually triggered by heavy rains that overwhelm outdated sewer and wastewater infrastructure, they noted. The resulting discharge, while it may contain some untreated sewage, is mostly made up of rain.
“As residents of this district know all too well, the Connecticut River has a history of becoming unsafe for swimming and fishing, particularly after significant rainstorms,” Rep. John Santanella, D-Enfield, said in a press release. “That is a longstanding fact. But what is not true are the exaggerated claims suggesting that millions of gallons of raw sewage are being dumped into the river during these weather events.”
If you’re wondering what causes sewer overflows, and whether you should be worried about their impact on water quality, here’s what to know.
Why are sewer pipes overflowing?
When the first municipal wastewater systems were developed during the 1800s, they collected everything from household sewage and industrial waste to rainwater into a single network of pipes which then deposited that untreated mix into the nearest river or other body of water.
The next century saw the development of treatment plants to clean wastewater prior to discharge. These combined sewer systems, however, still may become overwhelmed during large storms, necessitating additional overflow pipes to prevent the mixture of sewage and rain from backing up and flooding local homes and businesses.
Historically, Connecticut had as many as 13 combined sewer systems that would occasionally spill over into local waterways.
In 1987, the state established the Clean Water Fund within the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection to assist municipalities with wastewater projects. Since then, the state has invested more than $5.3 billion to reduce the number of combined systems down to four: Hartford, which discharges into the Connecticut River, and Norwich, Bridgeport and New Haven, which release into local rivers and the Sound.
Additionally, the mostly-separated wastewater systems in Waterbury and Norwalk have a small number of locations from which overflows still occur.
The remaining combined systems are required to submit plans to DEEP outlining what steps they are taking to reduce overflows. The biggest of those projects currently underway involves digging a four-mile-long tunnel in South Hartford capable of holding 41 million gallons of storm-related overflows. Afterwards, that wastewater will be slowly released from the tunnel into the city’s sewage treatment facility.
The tunnel project is expected to be completed next year at a cost of over $500 million. 
How often do they overflow?
Connecticut’s combined wastewater systems discharged more than 1.2 billion gallons of wastewater overflows in 2024, according to data collected by DEEP. 
The state’s largest source of overflows is the combined system in Hartford, which released 796.8 million gallons of wastewater into the Connecticut River last year. That was more than the entire volume of overflows reported by three systems in Massachusetts that also discharge wastewater into the river: Chicopee, Holyoke and Springfield.
Local critics, however, have pointed to ongoing improvement efforts, such as the Hartford tunnel project, to argue that Connecticut is taking a more proactive approach toward minimizing overflows. 
“I feel a little more confident doing more finger pointing now because Connecticut is ahead of Massachusetts,” Zawistowski said.
Will Healey, a spokesman for DEEP, called overflows a “state, regional, and national issue,” and said the agency is working closely with its counterparts in Massachusetts as well as the EPA’s regional offices in Boston to reduce their impact along the Connecticut River.
In western Massachusetts, officials currently have $15.2 million invested in sewer separation projects and upgrades to water treatment facilities, according to Fabienne Alexis, a spokeswoman for the state’s Department of Environmental Protection.
“Through municipal partnerships and billions of dollars in investments, we are working to update aging infrastructure, construct underground storage, and expand nature-based solutions to mitigate stormwater impacts,” Alexis said. “These projects are expensive and proposed federal funding cuts unfortunately threaten long-awaited progress to eliminate combined sewer overflows.” 
Should I be concerned?
While most of the discharge from overflows is made up of rain, officials do caution that the presence of untreated sewage and other pollutants raises serious environmental and public health concerns.
“You do not want to go in the water when there’s combined sewer overflows happening because there’s untreated, or partially treated sewage going in,” said Bill Lucey, the Soundkeeper for the environmental nonprofit Save the Sound.
In addition to the risks for humans, Lucey said that the overflows from combined systems can lead to harmful algae blooms or an excess of nitrogen and other nutrients in Long Island Sound.
For years, he said, the group has been pushing lawmakers to approve funding for an electronic alert system that will notify swimmers, fishermen and boaters whenever an overflow has impacted water quality within a specific area. Similar systems already exist in New York and Massachusetts.
DEEP currently publishes information about sewer overflows on its website as well as the social media platform X.
Zawistowski said the overarching concern from her constituents has to do with visible amounts of sewage floating down the river, and occasionally washing up in areas such as the Windsor Locks Canal State Park.
“It’s been a problem for years, but its being paid attention to now,” she said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/tunnel-boring-machine-crane-lowering-into-tunnel-1024x576.png,,,2025-10-06 07:57:30.276618

The trial, which is expected continue through much of October, is the culmination of a nearly four-year investigation into Diamantis, a former Democratic lawmaker who climbed to the highest levels of the state government before he became the target of the federal criminal probe in late 2021.
The 16 jurors and alternates, who were chosen Friday, are expected to hear from a host of witnesses involved in Connecticut’s construction industry, as well as several current and former government officials.
As the jurors learned last week, they may also hear testimony from Connecticut’s sitting Democratic governor, Ned Lamont.
During his first term, Lamont promoted Diamantis to the position of deputy director of the state’s Office of Policy and Management.
But Lamont later fired Diamantis from that job in October 2021, after investigators subpoenaed the state for a long list of records related to Diamantis and several public building projects he oversaw.  
[The Kosta Diamantis timeline: What you need to know]
Federal prosecutors officially charged Diamantis last year with 22 federal counts of bribery, extortion, conspiracy and lying to federal investigators, and they alleged that he set up a pay-to-play scheme within Connecticut’s school construction office.
The indictment filed in the case alleged that several construction officials provided cash and checks, as well as a job and tuition money for Diamantis’ daughters, in return for him steering lucrative contracts to their companies. 
As the investigation advanced in recent years, Diamantis repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, and he insisted that he saved state and local taxpayers millions of dollars while overseeing the school construction program for more than six years.
Diamantis’ attorney, Norm Pattis, said last week that his client also intends to take the witness stand during trial to testify in his own defense.
If he does, that testimony could open Diamantis up to cross examination from federal prosecutors, who have spent years sweeping up evidence from banks, the state government, school construction companies, local school officials and Diamantis’ own cell phone.
In court records, the U.S. Attorney’s office has cited numerous text messages in which Diamantis allegedly demanded money from contractors and threatened to boot them from the construction projects if they didn’t pay up.
“Bottom line, have him give you 40 for Monday or he is out,” Diamantis wrote in one such message. 
Three construction officials who pleaded guilty to bribing Diamantis last year are also expected take the witness stand during the early days of the trial. 
Prosecutors are expected to portray Diamantis as a powerful, and vindictive, state official who had unfettered control over billions of dollars in state grants that were awarded to school projects all over the state.
And they will attempt to prove that he used his authority to manipulate local officials and other construction firms into hiring the companies that were secretly paying him and his daughter.

Still, the university is at a difficult crossroads. Enrollment is down nearly 20% over the past six years across all of the university’s campuses. State and federal cuts are adding to financial pressure, and more tuition hikes could be on the way.
The WSU Board of Regents held a meeting in mid-September in which they discussed enrollment trends, costs of attending the Pullman-based university and heard new President Elizabeth Cantwell’s plans to turn the school around.
“This is the beginning of what we are calling redesigning the WSU system for the future,” Cantwell told the regents on Sept. 18. “This process will take about a year.”
On the flagship Pullman campus, total enrollment dropped from 20,976 students in the fall of 2019 to 16,248 this fall, the school said. That’s a loss of more than 4,700 students.
Including its branch campuses in Spokane, the Tri-Cities, Vancouver and Everett, WSU total enrollment has fallen from 31,607 in fall 2019 to just 25,477 this year, a drop of 6,000 students.
The rate of decline has slowed. This fall, WSU’s Pullman campus is down only about 200 students from last fall, the school said.
By contrast, the rival University of Washington has seen modest enrollment increases in recent years.
Further tuition hikes looming
Meanwhile, if the regents vote on Nov. 13 to increase tuition and fees for the 2026-27 school year, it would mark a decade of yearly increases since the state government reduced funding for higher education in 2015.
Washington State University students already face the highest mandatory costs among the state’s public institutions.
Resident undergraduates at WSU can expect to pay $13,888 for the upcoming school year in tuition and fees, according to figures provided to the regents.
The University of Washington still has the highest tuition in the state, but WSU’s mandatory fees put its total expected costs for resident students up by $486, said Leslie Brunelli, an executive vice president for finance and administration.
The proposed tuition increase does not have a set figure yet, as the maximum increase allowed will be set later by the Washington State Office of Financial Management. 
WSU officials expect the increase to be more than 3.3%. Taking the full amount would bring tuition, not counting fees, to at least $12,060 for the 2026-27 academic year.
Further complicating the issue is a 1.5% cut in state funding, or $9.9 million, compared to the 2023-25 budget. A multibillion-dollar state budget shortfall prompted the Washington Legislature to make spending cuts to a number of public institutions.
Last budgeting cycle, the state provided 66 cents of every dollar WSU needed, Brunelli told the regents. Now the state is only providing 56 cents on every dollar.
“We have a bigger gap to fill in,” Brunelli said.
Charting a new course
WSU’s new president told regents she is taking steps to deal with complex issues of enrollment, declining federal research grants and huge challenges to athletics.
Cantwell, who was hired in February to replace Kirk Schulz, also wants to change WSU’s identity. It is time for the university to shed the underdog mentality that has haunted it for years, she said.
“We are really looking at modernizing that 19th-century land-grant mission to meet 21st-century needs,” Cantwell told the regents.
Recruiting new students is one solution, but those students must remain in school.
Provost T. Chris Riley-Tillman said that for the past few years, around 20% of WSU students drop out before their second year.
Bolstering student support services, job placement programs and removing barriers to degree changes are some of the ways Cantwell hopes to ensure those arriving at WSU graduate.
One bright spot is that the number of new first-year students enrolled through WSU’s online arm, WSU Global, grew by 11% last year. Cantwell sees an opportunity for more growth there.
Research has been a key part of Cantwell’s career. She is a former Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory staff member, senior vice president of research at the University of Arizona and president of Utah State University.
By 2035, Cantwell wants to see WSU research output double.
She also wants to burnish WSU’s image, she said, because the success of the university and its students, alumni and faculty depends “on our collective identity.”
The Cougars’ brand must be celebrated and promoted, whether it is a laboratory breakthrough, athletic success, or post-graduate accomplishment, she said. 
Jolt from Pac-12 shakeup 
One key component of that image is athletics. Washington State was long a member of the prestigious Pac-12 Conference. But the Cougars and Oregon State were left behind when 10 of the Pac-12 members jumped to other conferences.
Washington State and Oregon State have succeeded in luring other schools to rebuild the Pac-12, but it is no longer considered a top-tier conference. That sharply reduces the television dollars coming to athletics.
Cantwell said major challenges ahead include raising money to pay top athletes, so they are not lured away by richer programs. 
In addition, the athletics department is nearly $100 million in the red from past decisions to improve athletic facilities and other costs.
Cantwell said the athletics budget will be closely monitored to ensure the department is hitting goals while the university looks for other ways to raise money.
“We really need and will focus on cultivating a nationally competitive and character-driven athletics program,” Cantwell said.
Washington State also needs to burnish its image in western Washington, she said.
“We want to elevate WSU’s visibility in the greater Puget Sound region,” she said.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/washington-state-university-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-06 07:57:30.276618

(From Lake County Solid Waste Management District)Indiana is finalizing a new vision to manage Hoosier waste — from food, construction, technology, textiles and more — and boost the economy.
The project, spearheaded by the Indiana Department of Environmental Management and British contractor Eunomia, will replace a 20-year plan that has been in force for more than three decades.
That plan “was centered on disposal and basic waste handling,” IDEM Commissioner Clint Woods said in a late August news release. “Today, we need a forward-looking plan that reflects 35 years of innovation, shifting markets, and evolving environmental priorities. … Building a circular economy can strengthen Indiana’s economic future.”
IDEM won about $600,000 from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for the updates, according to the transcript of a 2023 meeting.
The plan may consider recycling requirements, commercial food waste diversion requirements and a per-ton surcharge on landfilled or incinerated waste, according to a late July meeting. That’s alongside the infrastructure investments, public education and more intended to advance the state’s goal of recycling 50% of its waste.
The final product is expected by the end of 2025. It will “act as a blueprint” for the state, solid waste management districts, industry and more, IDEM spokesman Barry Sneed said.

Local units of government can use the resulting guidelines, templates and pass-through dollars to revisit their own antiquated plans. IDEM also hopes to uplift recyclers and manufacturers using recycled goods.
“You know, 1991 was the last (plan). Think about all that’s changed,” Natalie Rodriguez, an agency spokeswoman, said at September open house. “Think about all the electronics that are now in the waste stream, and the fact that we can recycle some of that as well … It’s a commodity!”
Landfill gates lead to a lofty goal
Indiana made its first foray into solid waste regulations in 1953, when the General Assembly authorized county commissioners to establish dumps and adopt garbage-related ordinances “for the protection of public health.”
Some were burn dumps. Lawmakers enacted an air pollution law in 1961, according to an IDEM history, but federal Clean Air Act amendments four years later spurred more changes. The state banned the open burning of waste in 1969, the same year cities and towns gained the power to manage their own waste facilities.
Indiana didn’t issue its first modern landfill permit until 1974, per IDEM, or its first waste management plan until 1980. The latter was a prerequisite for continued EPA funding.
That year, Indiana had about 150 permitted landfills. Almost half of them had filled up and closed down within a decade, leaving 79 in 1990.
“Gates continue to lock on landfills … Yet we still throw away tons of recyclable materials every single day,” then-Gov. Evan Bayh wrote in the introduction to the 1991 plan, which sought to “avert a garbage crisis.”
It was one result of a sweeping law that mandated county solid waste management districts and set a 50% recycling goal for 2001.
But two decades past that deadline, the state is recycling somewhere between 9% and 15% of waste — and has just 34 landfills open, according to contractor Eunomia and a 2021 IDEM study. Districts are optional, too.

Those remaining “keep pretty attuned” to IDEM’s activities, said Carla Striegel-Winner, who leads the Dubois County Solid Waste Management District and is on the board for the Association of Indiana Solid Waste Management Districts. They go to the agency for grants, technical expertise and more — but “currently, that plan is not something that we would even think about on a day-to-day basis.”
“With it being a new plan, that could easily change,” Striegel-Winner said. 
“I see it being more the big picture,” she continued, and “as being sort of the glue that could kind of pull us together.”
Contractor’s strategy
Eunomia’s contract — worth up to $300,000 — began last October and lasts a year. At July’s online meeting, the consultant unveiled a short list of proposals that could help Indiana reach that 50% goal:

Requiring commercial food waste generators like grocery stores or restaurants to divert the surplus from landfill to alternatives like composting or donation.
Investing in sorting and processing infrastructure to increase facility capacity or improve how much material they can recover.
Investing in collection pathways, like adding drop-off sites and curbside recycling options, or hosting community collection events.
Educating Hoosiers on recycling practices and to raise awareness.
Requiring that Hoosiers separate recyclable materials from trash.
Setting interim targets for the state as it works toward the 50% goal.
Adding a per-ton surcharge to landfilled or incinerated waste.

IDEM’s Sneed noted the plan will “provide data and insight to help inform decisions” but said that any recommendations for new legislation, regulations or actions — including fees — would “be up to the appropriate rule-making bodies.”
The proposals were developed methodically.
Contractors gathered data and conducted research on Indiana’s waste management systems to create a “baseline” model of the status quo and a “business-as-usual” view of the future.
They focused on the methods and materials that would make the biggest difference. Indiana’s economy is losing out on more than $400 million annually when valuable materials like metal, plastic, paper and more are trashed instead of recovered, according to the presentation.
“By prioritizing these materials for the model, we can focus on where we can feasibly have the greatest potential impact,” Project Coordinator Iris Liu said.

The consultants also conducted surveys and interviews with stakeholders, like solid waste management districts and recyclers. IDEM staff held open houses around the state to hear from more.
They compiled a long list of ideas, then narrowed them down using a scoring sheet — with considerations like implementation costs and stakeholder pushback — and IDEM’s input.
The next step was to model the impacts of those proposals. Last is collecting it all in the state’s new plan.
Help wanted
In Dubois County, Striegel-Winner’s team is “super small.” Even as director, she does everything from answering the phones to doing payroll and even working at the site.
The county of 47,000 residents is largely rural. One processing center takes old paint, household chemicals, electronics and bulky waste. Recycling is done at eight drop-off sites for free, while trash incurs a fee.
But the logistics are challenging.
“We have a limit to the type of recycling that we can take. Those limits aren’t because that can’t be — in some way, shape or form — recycled,” Striegel-Winner said. “Those limits are because it’s not feasible to try and get that from point A to point B, where somebody would want to purchase that and … turn it into something new.”
The county can take glass, unlike others in southern Indiana. Clear and colorful glass must be separated, then stored until there’s enough to transport for recycling. Only plastics labeled 1 and 2 are accepted — also manually sorted, because there’s no specialized sorting facility nearby.
“People have to choose to do that sorting, and so we probably get a little less than if you just had a curbside bin out,” Striegel-Winner noted.
She’s interested in the prospect of sorting and processing aid.

“We do not have access to a lot of that infrastructure,” she said. “We need businesses that will set up in our area, and be able to make money from sorting our stuff. … All of that is going to be a huge improvement.”
Public education is also key.
“There’s still tons of stuff going into landfill that shouldn’t,” Striegel-Winner said. “I feel like we’ve become more of a throwaway society.”
“We get people thanking us all the time for … the time that we take with them to help them understand. They don’t know about us until they need us — and when they need us, we’re here,” she later added. “We’re here with those answers. We’re here with those recycling and disposal options.”
For others, food waste is the next frontier.
It represents a whopping 40% of the waste stream at Indiana University’s Bloomington campus, for instance. That’s according to Chief Sustainability Officer Jessica Davis, whose team advises all of IU’s campuses.
“It’s a pretty significant hit if we aren’t able to recover that, which is why we’re focused on solutions,” she said.
The Bloomington and Indianapolis locations had “pretty robust” composting programs pre-pandemic. Amid the chaos, many companies serving big institutions like IU stopped offering those services or even went out of business, per Davis.
“So, really, how can we extract the highest value out of this material ourselves?” she said. Bringing composting in-house “also kind of mitigates that risk of being overly reliant on external vendors.”
IU is piloting a food waste dehydrator purchased through a state grant. Removing the water makes it lighter and more compact, and therefore cheaper to dispose of, Davis described.
But the university is interested in using it — like for soil or biofuel. It’s already submitted another grant application to buy an in-vessel composter to speed up the decomposition.
Those efforts come in addition to a wide variety of existing programs, many of which bring financial perks alongside environmental ones.
The university’s used but serviceable items are sold back to campus, so that employees, students and community members can “go shopping” among the surplus. Huge amounts of stuff are collected from on-campus housing during the springtime move-out, and are collected for free reuse or paid surplus instead of becoming “a really big trash bill.” Recycling contracts at some campuses include a per-ton rebate, too.
Others programs are for the “mission,” Davis said, like “fix-it clinics” or free bicycle repair services in the fall and spring.
“Any skills that we can equip (students) with, even if it’s maybe an outside-of-the-classroom skill, is of value,” she continued. “… Students might have financial struggles, so if they can repair something for free or very, very cheaply, it might be just one less stressor in their life.”
The plan is also expected to include a focus on preventing waste.

“If we’re not doing something about the waste that we currently have, we’re drowning in waste,” Purdue University Professor John Sutherland said. “But, you know, if we’re trying to be smart, we should be able to walk and chew gum at the same time. … We should be taking efforts to … reduce the amount that we’re generating in the first place.”
Sutherland leads the institution’s Laboratory for Sustainable Manufacturing and environmental engineering program. He’s a fan of “lean” manufacturing that cuts out unnecessary materials, motions and more in pursuit of efficiency.
“If I wait until I have waste, it’s going to cost me,” he said. “… By being smarter about the system that you create, not only do you reduce what you have to pay at the back end (for disposal) but you’ve undoubtedly saved money by using less resources.”
Government action can make unwanted behaviors more expensive. But Sutherland was confident the incentives go deeper.
“I was doing this before the regulations were there,” he said. “I was helping companies get better without (those).”
Decades ago, Sutherland helped Ford Motors eliminate expensive and dangerous metal-working fluids — along with related procurement and health costs. The move also meant less environmental remediation.
Now, his lab is working to make it easier to recycle rare earth elements, among other projects. They’re used technology from smartphones and wind turbines to medical and defense systems.
“It’s an energy security issue, right? We’re too reliant on non-domestic sources for these materials that are vital to the economy,” Sutherland said. “To me, you know, recycling and remanufacturing of the stuff that we already have here — it just makes sense.”

This is a change from previous language, which required “fair, courteous, and respectful treatment” from Michigan judges. The order came seven months after the rule was initially put forward by the court for public comment, and did not include any concurring or dissenting opinions.
The final rule is less specific than the initially proposed version, which included a long list of protected characteristics: “race, color, sex, gender identity or expression, religion, national origin, ethnicity, disability, age, height, weight, sexual orientation, marital status, familial status, socioeconomic status, [and] political affiliation.” It is based on the American Bar Association’s Model Rule 2.3 — these model rules are designed to provide guidance to judges and lawyers around the country. 
The proposed rule change, which had been paired with another proposal to change attorney conduct rules to similarly include anti-bias and anti-harassment rules against specific protected classes, drew strong criticism during its open comment period, especially from Christian and Catholic legal groups that took issue with language that would require both judges and attorneys to respect LGBTQ+ identities. 
The Catholic Lawyers Society of Metropolitan Detroit, for example, criticized the requirement in the rule to align with “gender ideology [that] is incompatible with the Catholic faith.”
But some groups, like Citizens for Racial Equity in Washtenaw, expressed strong support for the rules, writing, “These amendments represent critical steps toward creating a more equitable judicial system by explicitly prohibiting bias, prejudice, and harassment based on protected characteristics.”
The attorney conduct rules were not included in this final decision by the Supreme Court, with those changes to the Michigan Rules of Professional Conduct being “held for further consideration by the Court,” the order notes. Those are based on the American Bar Association’s Model Rule 8.4(g), which has garnered controversy in the legal profession, especially in conservative legal spaces. 
Many of the comments submitted in opposition to the changes noted potential First Amendment issues with the proposal, with a number singling out the attorney conduct rules that have yet to be decided on. The Christian Legal Society argued that it would impose a “speech code” on lawyers, while the Diocese of Lansing wrote that it would “impermissibly regulate speech and infringe the free exercise of religion.” 










“These amendments represent critical steps toward creating a more equitable judicial system by explicitly prohibiting bias, prejudice, and harassment based on protected characteristics.”

And it’s not just Christian groups expressing concerns — the Council on American-Islamic Relations Michigan wrote that the proposal was “threatening to discipline judges and attorneys who express or act upon sincerely held religious beliefs.”
According to Lambda Legal, an LGBTQ+ legal advocacy organization, Michigan had previously been one of just three states without any specific bias or harassment language in its judicial code of conduct, along with Alabama and North Carolina. It will now join Arkansas, Louisiana, and Virginia as the four states that have only general anti-bias language without any reference to specific groups.
OUTreach, a student-led pro bono law project at the University of Michigan Law School centered on the LGBTQ+ community, also submitted a comment in favor of the changes. 
“By accepting the outlined changes, Michigan will put itself on the right track towards fulfilling its commitment to all its citizens,” the group wrote. “While the proposed rules are slightly more expansive, they indicate the Court’s commitment to equitable justice for all people and the evolving standards of respect within our society.”
Justice Brian Zahra, the only GOP- nominated justice on the court, would have declined to publish the proposal for comment at all, the initial proposal notes. 
It marks the second change to judicial conduct rules in Michigan focused on inclusivity, after a 2023 order from the Supreme Court required judges to address defendants, litigants, attorneys and others in court by the pronouns and salutation that they select. 
That change also provoked backlash, especially from conservative and Christian groups.

Members of the Paramus Visibility Brigade often show their messages from an overpass on Route 4. (Photo courtesy of Paramus Visibility Brigade)Robert Quinlan used to vent his frustration with the Trump administration at political rallies.
“The demonstrations were always energizing, maybe cathartic. But I realized that after a while, it’s the same 100 people walking around in circles, carrying their signs, showing them to each other,” the Readington retiree said. “I didn’t feel it was reaching very many people.”
Then he heard about the Visibility Brigade, in which protesters seeking a bigger impact take their dissent on the road — literally. They line highway overpasses with giant letters to form messages for the thousands of motorists hurtling by underneath. After attending one earlier this year, Quinlan was hooked, so he helped organize a brigade in Hunterdon County whose 280 members have held 24 actions since spring, usually over Route 78.
“We average about 4,000 vehicles per hour. Sometimes we’re out there for up to two hours, that’s 8,000 people,” Quinlan said. “We reach a lot more of an audience. It’s just more effective.”
Since it first formed in 2020 in Paramus, the brigade has grown into a bona fide movement — with about 270 chapters around the country — because of opposition to President Donald Trump, said Dana Glazer, one of its founding organizers. He calls the group’s actions “rush-hour resistance” and a “defibrillator for democracy.”
“There are, unfortunately, a lot of very misguided people who have been manipulated, primarily by billionaires, to do their bidding,” Glazer said. “But we’re not there for them. We’re there purely for the people who haven’t lost their minds — and are deeply concerned but maybe aren’t doing enough about it or are pretending like it’s not happening — to remind them that A, they’re not alone, and that B, we all have a role to play in this.”

Recent messages have addressed everything from Trump’s military deployments (NO TROOPS IN CITIES! in Cape May) to immigration crackdowns (STOP ICE CRUELTY in Newton, Massachusetts) to comedian Jimmy Kimmel’s suspension (BAN FASCISTS NOT COMEDIANS in Spokane, Washington).
Chapters come up with their own messages.
“I think of this as a giant creative art project,” Glazer said. “There’s a degree of poetry involved. Words have power. They have a magic to them. We only have a very few words to put forth, and we debate them very vigorously.”
Sometimes, participants aim to educate, as the Paramus group did in July in alerting motorists that the Trump administration plans to detain migrants at Fort Dix with the message “STOP FORT DIX CONCENTRATION CAMP.”
Occasionally, they go for humor in messages Glazer dubs “laughterism,” like May’s “MAKE NAZIS AFRAID AGAIN” and April’s “HEGSETH LEAK NEEDS PLUMBER” after Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth shared classified material in an unsecured group chat.
One popular message riffs on German theologian Martin Niemöller’s famous “First They Came” quote condemning the complicity of those who failed to challenge the Nazis during the Holocaust. “1ST THEY CAME FOR IMMIGRANTS,” Ann Arbor, Michigan, participants messaged in May. “THEN THEY CAME FOR A MAYOR,” the Paramus group messaged the same month, after federal authorities arrested Newark Mayor Ras Baraka outside a migrant jail in his city.
The group prohibits profanity or any calls for violence.
“The idea is to activate people and engage them, not to repel them,” Glazer said.
The overpass signs aren’t exclusively about Trump. Earlier this year, the group in Paramus touted its support of Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop, who was one of six Democrats seeking his party’s nomination for governor in June. Last week, the groups announced they would launch a statewide effort supporting Democrat Mikie Sherrill’s gubernatorial bid.
Their activism occasionally irks opponents, who sometimes report them to police or more often shout things like “get a job!” as they pass. Organizers hold regular de-escalation trainings, urging participants to avoid confrontations with critics by seeking help from police if they persist, Glazer said. He said the brigade actions require courage as political violence escalates, a theme that shows up in some messaging like “BE BRAVE WITH US.”
“What we’re doing on the overpass, every time, is an act of bravery,” he said. “There’s a targeting aspect to this, a degree of safety that’s involved. It’s a paradox — this is the Visibility Brigade, and we’re trying to be as visible as possible. At the same time, we have families. We have to be thoughtful about their safety.”

Despite such fears, a majority of New Jersey residents support people taking their political concerns to the street in protests and rallies, with 80% of voters surveyed last fall regarding them as “always” or “sometimes” justified, said Ashley Koning, director of the Eagleton Center for Public Interest Polling at Rutgers University.
She does not think they move the needle much at the ballot box.
“They really are much more about symbolism and participating in the political process in some way, more than they are about really convincing voters,” Koning said.
Richard Krasney of West Orange said the bridge actions give him an outlet for his fears that Democratic leaders haven’t done enough to oppose Trump’s actions.
“My parents had Vietnam, and my grandparents had World War II. My generation really has never faced a war before. I’ve never ‘served my country before,’ so to speak, quote, unquote,” he said. “I felt like this was my country needing me to step forward to do something, and this was what I felt like I was drawn to do.”
For Pamela Lynn Brause of Hunterdon County, it’s how the administration carries out its policy priorities that really rankles. Brause, who’s an attorney, said Trump has an unacceptable contempt for courts and the rule of law. She regards many of his actions as “an authoritarian power grab.”
“I don’t want you taking somebody off the street because they have to ask for a glass of water in Spanish,” Brause said. “If you believe that a person is here illegally and that there should be deportation proceedings, file the proceedings in court. Give the person due process and have a judicial determination. Snatching people off the street and leaving their little kids behind is not what we want.”
Quinlan, a retired police chief, seconded that sentiment. He pointed out that Trump vowed during his campaign to deport “the worst of the worst,” such as undocumented immigrants who commit crimes.
“I don’t think many people would oppose that. Instead, masked ICE agents have aggressively pursued hard-working, decent people with no criminal record, leaving their families without the breadwinner. It’s just all so un-American,” Quinlan said.
He has friends from various marginalized groups who have felt unsafe and even fled the country as anti-immigrant rhetoric ramps up, he said.
“My parents had close personal friends who were Japanese Americans. They were naturalized citizens, yet they were rounded up and placed in internment camps near the West Coast during World War II. What we’re witnessing now is no different. The country is just demonizing a different group of people,” he added.
As more people join the brigade, members have experimented with expanding the idea of visibility, including with “Crush ICE” car caravans to condemn Trump’s deportation policies. In Hunterdon, Quinlan plans to stick with overpass messaging.
Holding a sign on a bridge might not convert those passing by, as politics becomes increasingly polarized, he conceded. But that’s not the point, he said.
“People drive along the highway, listening to often terrible news from around the country, from the White House, from different places, and they look up and they see us — and we give them hope,” he said. “That’s our real mission.”

(Getty Images)Many hard-working Hoosiers will be in for sticker shock when they start shopping for next year’s health coverage in the individual marketplace. For the past several years, thousands of Hoosiers have been able to afford coverage thanks to a temporary life line: enhanced premium tax credits to purchase coverage under the Affordable Care Act. This meant that monthly premium payments were much more affordable. 
Open enrollment for health coverage in the marketplace for 2026 begins soon. But these enhanced credits are set to expire at the end of this year. We all see the headlines about budget disagreements and we’re now in a government shutdown. But unless Congress acts soon to extend the enhanced credit, premium costs could spike for thousands of individuals and families.
Who will be affected? 
Approximately 300,000 Hoosiers get their insurance through the individual marketplace. They have this option because they are unable to get coverage through an employer-sponsored plan or they are not eligible for programs like Medicare or the Healthy Indiana Plan. Think small business owners like barbers and caterers. Entrepreneurs just getting started. And farmers, already squeezed by global trade disruptions.
What will be the effect?
In a nutshell, costs will rise. Using KFF’s calculator, you can estimate what the average change in premium costs will be. Here are a couple of examples of what we can expect:

A family of 4 in Indianapolis earning around $70,000/year could see a $265 per month increase to insure mom and dad. 
A small business employee in Logansport earning around $30,000/year could see a $113 per month increase.

For many families, affordable coverage has been the difference between having a doctor to call, getting prescriptions filled, or skipping care altogether. And in balancing rent, utilities bills, and groceries, it’s not unreasonable to expect people will forego coverage. We could also see a significant increase in individual and family medical debt.
It’s not just the individual families that will face hardship. Skyrocketing premiums could be a drag on our state’s economy by increasing the rate of insured workers. Evidence shows that without health coverage, workers are less productive and have more sick days. And when people don’t have health coverage, local hospitals and health care providers face greater financial uncertainty.
What can be done?
The solution is simple. Congress can extend the enhanced premium tax credits. But, time is running out. With open enrollment starting around November 1st, individuals will start having to decide what they can and cannot afford.",https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/GettyImages-939048116-1024x683-1-700x467-1.jpeg,,,2025-10-06 07:57:30.276618

Zack Stephenson, DFL-Coon Rapids, speaks on the House Floor in 2024. (Photo courtesy of House Information Services)Minnesota House Democrats last month chose Rep. Zack Stephenson, DFL-Coon Rapids, to lead the caucus after the June assassination of their late leader Melissa Hortman.
By picking Stephenson, House Democrats chose continuity, as Hortman and Stephenson were good friends and Hortman was a mentor to the Coon Rapids lawmaker for 20 years. 
As an early 20s college student, Stephenson was Hortman’s 2004 campaign manager. 
As caucus leader, Stephenson will have to work with Republicans in the 67-67 tied House if the Democrats hope to pass any legislation, while also charting a path to majority in the 2026 election. 
The issue of the moment is gun control. Gov. Tim Walz has publicly called for a special legislative session following the mass shooting at Annunciation Catholic Church that killed two children and wounded many more. The special session looks increasingly unlikely but Stephenson — who is also a Hennepin County prosecutor — said his caucus is unified in passing an assault weapons ban because every member was impacted by Hortman’s death. 
“Our caucus is entirely constituted of survivors of gun violence,” Stephenson said. 
Hortman and her husband Mark were killed on June 14 in their Brooklyn Park home in a political assassination by a man who was targeting Democratic elected officials and abortion rights advocates, prosecutors say. 
The Reformer recently sat down with Stephenson to learn more about his background, how he plans to lead House Democrats in Hortman’s wake and what can be done to make life more affordable for Minnesotans.
So nobody knows who you are. Why don’t you tell Minnesotans how you came to this point. What are some essential things about you?
I grew up a mile down the road from the house I live in now. I’m a lifelong Minnesotan. I grew up in a middle-class family. My parents were small business owners, medical sales, surgical sales.
I got interested in politics late in high school. Inspired by Paul Welstone. It was a hard time in some ways for me growing up. 
In 2023, I came out as bisexual, and when I was growing up that was not a safe thing, and it came with a feeling of powerlessness. The thing that attracted me to Wellstone was the fact that this was a guy whose entire political career was organized around the idea that people without power could have power if they work together — grassroots organizing. 
Melissa Hortman represented the district I grew up in. I saw that Melissa’s campaign was just her doing it all herself, and so I had this idea that if I could get a few of my buddies together, we could go to Melissa Hortman or someone else and say, “Hey, we’ll work for you full time. You don’t have to pay us, but you gotta make me your campaign manager.” Melissa would say later, “I had lost twice, and I was crazy enough to try anything, and so did these kids.” The year George W. Bush was reelected, she won the district by 402 votes.
Why did you want to be the next DFL House leader?
When you think about this time, it really calls upon us all to do whatever we can do to make it better, and that call to service that’s something that Melissa Hortman felt her entire life, and something that I have reflected on a lot in the time since she died. I think it calls upon us all to just pick up a shovel and get to work. And that’s what I intend to do.
What’s the work? 
There’s a lot. Right now, we’re talking about gun violence, but you look at the challenges Minnesotans are facing — with affordability, with housing, with prescription drugs, with class sizes and schools — it’s all around you. There’s so much to do.
Well, you can’t do everything. So what are some top priorities?
I picked the ones I mentioned on purpose. Gun violence is obviously top of mind for everyone right now, and it shouldn’t be lost on anyone that the only reason why you and I are talking right now is because of an act of gun violence.
And then what the ordinary Minnesotans out in the community will hear about how hard it is economically right now, how people are squeezed on every front. Cost of health care, cost of child care, cost of housing. So those basic affordability issues have to be front and center for us.
What can you do? Those are big national problems.
But there are local solutions. What we do locally matters. We’re apparently third in the country for child care costs. And then you look at some of the policies that we’ve enacted in recent years and the impact that’s having in helping people afford their lives. There are definitely things we can do. It’s not something where there is just one solution. I wish I could tell you, “This is the bill that solves the affordability crisis.” That’s not reality. 
It’s a lot of little things, and sometimes it’s stuff that isn’t very exciting. When I was chair of the Commerce Committee, we worked really hard to try to go after storm-chasing, fly-by-night contractors who were convincing people to fix their roofs when they didn’t need a fix. When people do that, that’s what’s driving up homeowner’s insurance. Those little things can actually have a pretty big impact on people’s experience
You do face fiscal constraints that have emerged in the last couple years. So it seems like big solutions, like on child care, are going to be hard. How do you square that?
Minnesota is actually in very strong fiscal shape. When we had DFL control in 2023 we ended the budget period with a very significant surplus. We have AAA bond ratings from all the credit agencies. We have a very healthy rainy day fund, and on a month-to-month basis our state’s finances are beating the forecast.
I don’t know that I totally agree that we’re living in a time that’s totally constrained. We have some challenges. I think those challenges are largely driven by some demographic pressures and long-term challenges in the health care space, but I think there’s also opportunities to be creative here.
Can Minnesotans expect you to lead similarly to Melissa Hortman? She was a mentor to you. So are you going to follow her playbook or try to chart your own path? 
I met Melissa Hortman when I was 17. I’m 41 now, and I’ve known her my entire adult life. She was a friend and mentor who taught me a lot. Certainly, there will be some things that are similar. There are some things that she did that absolutely are a guidepost for me, whether it’s treating folks with respect regardless of where they’re coming from or just her commitment to doing the work and not trying to have an ego about it. 
But we’re not the same person. There is no next Melissa Hortman. That’s an impossible task. She was the most consequential speaker in Minnesota history, so I’m not trying to be a carbon copy of Melissa. But there’s a reason we were good friends. We think about this job on a similar basis.
How do you think you’re different? 
She was really someone who liked to do a lot of stuff herself. I don’t always have that do-it-myself mentality that she had. 
Why did you want to be a prosecutor?
I wanted to be in court. I was spending all day staring at a computer screen at the firm Faegre Drinker. I wanted more people time, less computer time and I never made progress at that. Now being a prosecutor, it’s a flip.
I don’t have a caseload any longer. I can’t with the Legislature, and I take 100% leave of absence when the Legislature is in session. I help fill in for people who are on leave or in trial. I do a lot of charging cases.
How has that shaped your view of the criminal justice system?
When you’re a prosecutor, you do believe in accountability, but you also see it as an imperfect system. The criminal justice system can deliver accountability, but it can’t deliver healing, and it can’t really even deliver closure for people who are surviving. That’s not what you’re going to get out of that. It’s important for public safety, it’s important for accountability, but it can’t solve every problem. It can’t make people whole.
What’s one piece of legislation that you’re most proud of getting through in your tenure?
I think some people expect it would be the cannabis bill, which is certainly a huge bill that got a lot of attention, and it was a big challenge to get it done. But I actually found a lot of the work I did as Commerce Committee chair around consumer protections and economic issues a lot more personally rewarding.
The reason why I wanted the job was the less exciting but more consequential piece of it, and there’s a lot of things that we did there that I’m really proud of from some of the stuff we did on prescription drugs or capping insulin costs. We are also a leader in Minnesota on confronting social media companies and trying to put some guardrails around that, so I’m really proud of getting that ball rolling.
You mentioned the fiscal constraints being due to demographic challenges, and it does seem a huge but long-term challenge. Do you have any particular ideas about what to do about that aging population and population stagnation here, which is probably going to cost us a congressional seat?
We’re facing federal headwinds on these fronts where actions from Washington are really constraining our ability to effectively deal with some of the problems like Medicaid cuts and immigration restrictions.

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)No matter what we look like or where we come from, we all deserve a seat at the table. But billionaires and big corporations, and the politicians they bankroll, are working around the clock to take that away from us. 
They distract and divide us from one another, stoking fear so we won’t notice how they’ve captured our democracy. They do it in the halls of government with their lobbyists and paid-for cabinet positions, and they do it on the campaign trail with the politicians they buy. Every step of the way, they’re consolidating power for themselves while working families get left behind. 
Minnesotans understand what’s at stake. We are watching as extremist politicians in Washington hold our government hostage, slashing health care, SNAP, and the programs we rely on — all to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy few. They are weaponizing the Department of Justice against public leaders who dare to hold them accountable. They are sending masked law enforcement to kidnap our neighbors off the streets. And they are weaponizing the National Guard in our cities, turning soldiers against the very people they are sworn to protect.  

At the same time, Minnesota families are facing impossible choices. Parents are working two jobs to provide for their families. Seniors are rationing their medication because of the rising cost of prescriptions. The tariffs are squeezing farmers, rural hospitals are closing due to Medicaid cuts, and so are child care centers, leaving families with limited options for either health care or child care. No Minnesotan should have to face these choices.

The only people these politicians are working for are the billionaires and corporations that bankrolled their campaigns. To these leaders, this was never about cutting waste or a budget; they are dismantling our government piece by piece and selling it off to the highest bidder, all while families like ours are being left behind. 
Two paths lie on the horizon: let our politicians, with all the power, continue to hurt our working-class neighbors — or draw a line in the sand. To us, the choice in this moment is clear.
We are proud that our senators and leaders in Washington chose the latter. They understand what Minnesotans already know, that there is no “compromise” when it comes to sacrificing the health, safety, and dignity of our neighbors. Suppose the alternative to a shutdown is caving to demands that slash the programs people depend on. Refusing to play along is not dysfunction —  it is the only choice. 
Minnesotans know a better future is possible. We believe in an inclusive, multiracial democracy where people, not corporations, have the power to shape our future. We know that getting there takes vision, courage, and fight. It takes leaders who are willing to push back against these corporate-backed power grabs, even when it means taking tough votes. It also takes all of us speaking out, organizing, and refusing to accept politics as usual.

Thank you, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, Sen. Tina Smith, U.S. Reps. Betty McCollum, Ilhan Omar, Angie Craig and Kelly Morrison, for fighting for Minnesotans and defending access to health care, SNAP, and against federal overreach against our neighbors. 
For those who did vote for it, they must remember, now more than ever, democracy is for the we, not the thee. It cannot be bought by billionaires, captured by corporations, or held hostage by billionaires, corporations, and the politicians they back. It can only be defended when we fight together.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2233026155.jpg,,,2025-10-06 07:57:30.276618

(Steph Quinn/Missouri Independent)MOBERLY — Programs to help lower-income Missourians stretch their food benefits allow many families to put fresh produce on their tables, said Kara Bunten, director of the Randolph County Farmers Market, on Thursday, the last market of the year.
Families rely on these programs “to feed their family fresh fruits and vegetables at a reduced rate, so they’re not spending all the money off their cards,” Bunten said.
Those programs, currently supported with $2 million annually of state funds, could get more help under a Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as SNAP or food stamps, waiver application filed last week with federal officials by the Missouri Department of Social Services.
But that same waiver could bar recipients from buying soft drinks, candy and ready-to-eat desserts. And those restrictions, critics say, could mean even fewer choices for consumers in areas classified as food deserts. 
Christine Woody, food security policy manager at the progressive nonprofit Empower Missouri, said that in addition to “headache and complications,” the proposed restrictions could increase stigma and “cause a lot more people to not want to use those benefits.”
The waiver, with a projected implementation in October 2026, needs approval from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which operates the SNAP program. 
The request was filed after Gov. Mike Kehoe issued an executive order Sunday calling on the department to run SNAP “in a manner that prioritizes healthy foods.” It comes as federal changes passed by Congress in July narrow eligibility to receive benefits and impose additional costs on the state to ensure that SNAP users meet stricter work requirements. 
In August, 667,531 Missourians were receiving SNAP benefits, according to the Family Support Division. More than 41% of them were children.
This spring, efforts failed in the General Assembly to prohibit SNAP recipients from buying candy and soda with their benefits.
Gabby Picard, a spokesperson for the governor’s office, said in an email that “while no specific food items are being identified at this point in the process,” the restrictions proposed in the request reflect “initial language DSS plans to use to evaluate specific food items, upon USDA approval.”
Kehoe’s executive order also called on the department to “incentivize the purchase of fresh fruits, vegetables, and Missouri-produced meats and dairy products” with food assistance, without specifics.

‘Headache and complications’
Dan Shaul, executive director of the Missouri Grocers Association, which will participate in the process to implement the waiver, said that wherever Missouri decides to draw the line between “what is healthy and what is not healthy,” the changes will cause “confusion” for SNAP users and retailers. 
Shaul gave the example from Indiana, one of 12 states that has secured USDA approval to restrict SNAP purchases. When Indiana’s waiver begins in January, Shaul said, Snickers bars will be excluded as candy, while Twix will not, due to a definition in the state’s tax code.
“One would think, ‘It’s got peanuts in it, so it’s got to be the food,’” Shaul said of Snickers. “It’s absolutely the candy. The Twix is considered food because it has flour in it.”
The dilemma for SNAP users, Woody said, is knowing which foods are eligible and which are not. 
“You bring a whole cart of groceries, and you put them on there,” she said, “and then they’re like, ‘You can’t have that,’ or ‘You can’t have that.’”
Shaul said that although retailers will bear the upfront cost of reconfiguring their systems to implement restrictions, some of the expense will be passed to shoppers, whether they use SNAP or not.
“There’s going to be administrative costs, there’s going to be training costs, and ultimately, in an industry that [has] normally a 1% margin, any cost is going to be felt at the end, at the consumer,” Shaul said. “We’ll do everything we can to minimize it, but there’s truly going to be issues.”

‘A stick instead of a carrot’
State Sen. Maggie Nurrenbaum, a Democrat from Kansas City, questioned whether the request would help low-income Missourians to eat healthier.
“The issue with using a stick instead of a carrot when it comes to this approach of healthy eating is that we are doing nothing, nothing at all, to actually help get healthy food into the household of Missourians,” Nurrenbaum said.
Kehoe’s executive order called on the state to incentivize SNAP users to buy healthy, locally produced food, but did not specify how the state should do this.
Kehoe called for the expansion of programs like Double Up Food Bucks, which allows SNAP users to double the fresh fruits and vegetables they bring home from select grocery stores and farmers markets.
Karissa Kary, president of the Missouri Farmers Market Association, said vendors would welcome more support for Double Up Food Bucks.
“The state stepping up to help support that further would be incredible, because it allows opportunities for both farmers and people on food assistance to get the freshest, most local food that is in the area,” Kary said.
But Kary said that although vendors would benefit from more incentives to buy fresh produce, they are wary of more state rules on top of impending changes to the program on the federal level. Bakers, for instance, will need “clarity” on what Missouri will count as a “prepared dessert.”
“It is very difficult for farmers markets to get the accreditation and everything they need to accept SNAP dollars,” Kary said. “So the fear of losing it or being fined for doing something inadvertently incorrect is really scary for a lot of small vendors…let alone the farmers they serve.”
Nurrenbaum said many people on SNAP don’t have access to farmers markets and shopping choices are limited in many rural areas. 
“It is whatever [is] on those stalls that that single mom can make quickly before she heads out the door for second or third shift,” Nurrenbaum said. “And God forbid she needs a Diet Coke so she can keep going to go to that third shift that starts at 11 p.m.”

(SeventyFour/iStock Images)Ridding the country of illegal immigrants was the rallying cry, the clarion call, which has morphed into deploying the National Guard and the U. S. military into major cities to reduce crime.
But the real purpose and purge go deeper.
My great uncle Arthur, who lived to be 106, would often say, “Niece, niece, you have to watch those who look you dead in the eyes and make grand promises as they are pulling the rug from under your feet.”
Is that what is happening across America — from the White House and Capitol Hill to state capitals?
There are coordinating and coalescing efforts to remove the democratic principles on which we have stood while falsely claiming to be making things better.
Make things better for whom?
Dramatic and alarming efforts are taking place to keep our focus on the need to deport  immigrants, both undocumented people and hard-working legal residents. Using Gestapo tactics, and deploying the National Guard and troops under the guise of needed additional assistance and to stop crime is to achieve other purposes: distraction, conditioning, and ultimately slow acceptance of oppression.
Seriously consider what is happening, how it is happening, and why.
While all the media drama is occurring, other systemic and defining legislative efforts are taking place in Washington and across the states to diminish, marginalize, and undo the rights, privileges of the majority of American citizens.
Namely, women and Blacks.
While Latinos make up the largest and fastest growing group in the country, women and Blacks have long been, and still are, the most powerful when it comes to the potential of voting in a bloc to bring about meaningful change.
Examining the voting results in the 2024 Presidential election is instructive.
Plus, history shows that women and Blacks voting in blocs was pivotal in getting voting rights, and equal treatment, and what has been achieved when it comes to equal employment, educational opportunities and access to other aspects of life that have always been afforded automatically to white males.
But the White House, Congress, and state legislatures are working overtime to pass laws, policies and practices — to revert, turn the clock back — that will disenfranchise women and Blacks in particular.
It started with the flurry of executive orders to get rid of DEI programs in every sector of American life—educational institutions, government departments and agencies, even private sector businesses either done by edict, monetary punishment or other looming threats.
Who are the primary targets of dismantling DEI? Women and Blacks.
Then there is the wholesale effort to distort, delete, and destroy the role women and Blacks have played and the contributions the have made to  making America what it is today.
This is done by ordering the removal of historical documents, photographs, artifacts and other evidence from our museums, and other public spaces.
This is being done with the selective banning of books from school curricula, libraries—with the goal of censoring and indoctrinating future generations by passing on a distorted, white-washed and false history of who and what America is.
Targeting women, Blacks and other minorities who historically have voted for Democrats more than Republicans is the focus of redistricting efforts taking place in states to ensure that the current political power — doing all the disenfranchisement to reshape America — remains in place.
Whose voting power will be most negatively affected by redistricting efforts?
Who will be most affected by the continuous efforts to ban abortion and other reproductive health care?
Then there is the perennial collateral victim — the working poor, which includes Blacks, whites and other minorities. While many elected officials make hopeful promises to improve their conditions, they are implementing measures to do just the opposite: keep wages stagnant while inflation increases; deny or cut access to health care by cutting and de-funding needed health care services.
What if women and Blacks — and some components of the working poor — decided to come together to stand and fight for their rights and well-being?
Women and Blacks, together, could make up the largest voting bloc.
Just imagine what could be accomplished if they came together in communities, cities and states across America?
Vote as a bloc against elected officials who are not working for policies and laws to meet their needs.
Vote as a bloc against ballot initiatives that could negatively impact or change the  quality of their lives, their families, their communities, future generations.
The changes taking place in Washington and states were not conceived overnight. One could argue that the vestiges of separateness and elements of autocracy run deep and have always been resident in the American way of life. 
But when those vestiges have raised their ugly heads from time-to-time during the last nearly 250 years, like-minded Americans who believe in the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and our common humanity have prevailed.
We should be embolden and empowered by how democracy has withstood past threats.
We should be reminded of the milestones that can be achieved if what ordinarily might appear to be unlikely partners come together to fight and achieve common goods.
There are political groups, active and caring citizens that have a wealth of political will and experience on how to build and mobilize coalitions that can determine if a candidate is elected or a ballot measure is defeated.
Women and Blacks coming together would make a powerful coalition, along with other like-minded and caring citizens.
Mobilizing such coalitions is a dire need to counter and stop the negative political actions taking place.
Not just for the immediate future. But for generations to come.
To show them how democracy is not given, not automatic.
Preserving it requires engagement, participation, vigilance, and coming together when necessary to protect and fight for our common interests.

“I can't tell you when the opinion will be out,” Lynne Boomgaarden told WyoFile, “but it is my best guess that probably by the end of the year, in that timeframe.”
The post Abortion ruling not expected until year’s end, Wyoming chief justice says appeared first on WyoFile .","The Wyoming Supreme Court may not issue its highly anticipated decision on whether the state constitution protects abortion rights until sometime closer to December, Chief Justice Lynne Boomgaarden told WyoFile. 
“I can’t tell you when the opinion will be out,” Boomgaarden said, “but it is my best guess that probably by the end of the year — in that timeframe is kind of where we are on it right now. But I’m making no promises.”
The timeline put a damper on any expectations for a rapidly forthcoming ruling, which court watchers have said could come any day since mid-summer. The justices heard oral arguments in April, and under their basic timeline, they then have 90 days to craft and circulate an opinion — the legal explanation from the majority side. 
But any justice can call for an extension to that timeline as they debate and craft an opinion that satisfies a majority of the justices, Boomgaarden said after WyoFile asked about the decision’s timing in a rare interview Wednesday. Boomgaarden did not offer any indication which way the court is leaning, and said the justices could not discuss case specifics.
The justices are deliberating an opinion that many in the state have waited on for more than two years. 
The case centers on whether a 2012 amendment to the state constitution, which appears to give individuals a right to make their own health care decisions, is overshadowed by language that allows the Legislature to act to protect “the health and general welfare of the people” of Wyoming. 
Lawmakers in 2022 passed a “trigger bill” that would ban abortions in Wyoming if the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the landmark Roe v. Wade case, which it did in June 2022. A group of doctors, women clients and an abortion aid group sued in Wyoming a month later, and a judge temporarily blocked the law. In 2023, the Legislature passed two new, more restrictive bans, including one that rescinded and replaced the trigger bill. The same group of plaintiffs sued again that March, kicking off the legal fight that awaits resolution from the high court. 
Abortion has remained legal in Wyoming during that court fight. In November, District Court Judge Melissa Owens struck down the more restrictive ban, which the state of Wyoming quickly appealed to the state high court.
The justices are not trying to publish the opinion at some opportune moment on the state’s political calendar, Boomgaarden said. “What I don’t want people to think is, ‘oh yeah, it’s going to be two years.’ Or ‘they’re going to wait till after the [legislative] session is over.’ No.” 
A thoughtful and collaborative process is what’s driving the long wait on this particular opinion, she and Justice John Fenn, who joined her in the interview, said.

Boomgaarden and Fenn went on to outline the steps judges take before issuing a decision. 
After receiving legal briefs from both sides — and in this case, but not all, after hearing oral arguments in the court chamber — the judges sit around a conference table and speak their piece. One justice serves as the leader of those discussions — a position that rotates randomly throughout the year, Boomgaarden said. 
“We just go around the table,” she said. “Everybody gets a chance to speak. If we need to speak again … We just keep going around the table.” 
As a majority opinion begins to form and after a straw vote is held, a justice is chosen to write the opinion. Unlike in the U.S. Supreme Court, justices do not have the opportunity to lobby for the opportunity to be the lead author of an opinion because they feel strongly about it or have some expertise in that area of the law, Boomgaarden said. 
The justices “try to keep those assignments as random as we can,” she said. 
Within 90 days of that discussion, the first draft of the opinion gets circulated among all five justices. They have 10 days to vote on whether to join the opinion. But they can also offer suggestions for additional analysis or push for a rethinking of some portion of the opinion. “There’s just a lot of back and forth among the members of the court,” Boomgaarden said. 
Justices who find they can’t join the majority opinion then begin crafting the minority opinion, which goes through the same level of collaborative drafting.  
And justices’ positions can change over the course of opinion writing.
“It’s rare, but you can have a case where you assign it to the majority, the majority opinion is circulated, and someone says I’m going to dissent,” Boomgaarden said. Then they win their colleagues over with them. 
“They write the dissent, and pretty soon they’re in the majority,” she said.
Sometimes, Fenn said, the justices have to get together again in the conference room. “There’s enough to talk about that we want to get the five of us in a room and talk through it again,” he said. 
Though the justices didn’t offer specifics, it’s clear the abortion case is going through some iteration of that deliberative process — and perhaps an even more thorough one than usual, given the weight the opinion will carry in Wyoming and in the lives of women in the state who may seek an abortion. 
“The court is working very diligently on it right now,” Fenn said.

High court maintains business-as-usual approach as justices weigh high-profile cases on abortion, school financing, justices say. 
The post Two Wyoming Supreme Court justices discuss role amid growing legislative, public scrutiny appeared first on WyoFile .","The justices on the Wyoming Supreme Court want the state to understand that, unlike their counterparts in Washington, they don’t select the cases that reach their chamber in Cheyenne.
Any case in Wyoming that’s appealed beyond the district court lands in their courtroom, and requires a resolution from the five justices.
“We just take them as they come. We don’t get to pick and choose,” Chief Justice Lynne Boomgaarden told WyoFile on Wednesday. 
She made the remarks in an hour-long interview, in which she was joined by Justice John Fenn. The rare sit-down between the two justices and a reporter covered topics ranging from the timeline of a highly anticipated ruling on abortion rights to the judicial nominating process to the scrutiny state judges have found themselves under from the Wyoming Freedom Caucus. 
That pushback at the state level joined a national rise in criticism against judges that reached such a crescendo earlier this year that more than 100 Wyoming lawyers and retired judges publicly called on the state’s congressional delegation to condemn the attacks.

Over the weekend, President Donald Trump continued his administration’s conflict with the federal judiciary, criticizing a judge he appointed who blocked his sending of Oregon National Guard troops into Portland. Trump has repeatedly sought to send armed troops into American cities, labeling protests as acts of rebellion against the government. In this case, a federal judge ruled the administration failed to provide sufficient evidence of that claim.
In a response that will likely be seen as defying the judiciary, Trump within a day ordered the California National Guard into the neighboring state instead. 
Closer to home, Wyoming’s high court is increasingly being asked to rule on controversial laws the Wyoming Legislature has implemented in the realms of school finance and school vouchers and abortion access. Lawmakers have at times passed those bills over outspoken warnings from opponents that lawmakers were crossing the constitution.
Amid those pressures, the justices projected a picture of consummate legal professionals, taking on business as usual. 
“Do we have cases in the pipeline now that have a great public interest? I think we do have that,” Fenn said. “But you know, those ebb and flow over time.” 
Pushback from the right
The Freedom Caucus put a spotlight on the state’s courts — specifically Wyoming’s process of selecting judges through a nonpartisan panel and gubernatorial appointment — after lower judges ruled against abortion restrictions and the Legislature’s school finance decisions.
“For far too long, the judicial branch has been seen as untouchable, outside the realm of criticism,” an April 30 post to the group’s substack read. The posts are not signed by a particular author. 
“As our founders knew well, all human institutions are capable of corruption,” the post continued. “It’s time for judicial reform in Wyoming in a way that gives the people a stake in our bench.”
In August, senators on the Joint Judiciary Committee narrowly rejected a proposal to change the state constitution to require lawmaker approval of state supreme court justices. That measure is likely to return and other judicial reform bills may surface, given their popularity in the Freedom Caucus-controlled House. 
Any measure to change the Wyoming Constitution would require approval from voters in a statewide election. 
The two justices said Wednesday’s interview, which was offered to WyoFile by judicial branch officials, did not come in response to legislative scrutiny. It was, instead, part of a broader effort by the court to educate the public on the state judiciary’s role and processes. 
A two-year strategic plan developed by the Wyoming Judicial Council — the courts’ governing body — calls for an increase in public education by the justices. The court has added a new communications director, Jacob Just, to its staff and justices hope to soon begin publishing a public-friendly explainer to accompany the often dense legalese of new court opinions. 
“We are very consciously and intentionally not speaking to the media or anybody in the public in response to legislative initiatives,” Boomgaarden said. Boomgaarden, age 65, was appointed to the court by former Gov. Matt Mead, a Republican, and took her oath of office in February 2018. 
On the other hand, “some of the legislative effort … maybe it verifies the need for awareness,” Fenn added. The veteran jurist served as a district judge in Sheridan for 14 years before Gov. Mark Gordon appointed him to the Supreme Court in December 2021. Fenn is 63. Wyoming Supreme Court justices are required to retire at age 70. 
Voters get the opportunity to remove any judge in the state from office within two years of their appointment. Two supreme court justices, former attorney general Bridget Hill and Robert Jarosh, will be up for retention elections in 2026, according to Just.

The justices pointed to those retention elections as an example of an existing but little-talked-about way to hold judges accountable if they’re believed to be out of line. “The public isn’t cut out of this system,” Boomgaarden said. There is also a council on judicial ethics that fields and investigates complaints about judges. The justices pointed, as well, to the fact that Wyomingites can lobby the governor after the names of three finalists for a supreme court seat are published.
“Our world is changing,” Boomgaarden said. “There is so much misinformation, disinformation, lack of knowledge out there, and that’s why we’re talking in our strategic planning about the need for judges to be more proactive,” in public education.
Considering change to nominating process
In Wyoming, members of the state bar apply for open judgeships. Those applicants are vetted, and some are interviewed, by the judicial nominating commission — a group of three lawyers elected by state bar members and three non-lawyers appointed by the governor. That group of six, with the chief justice serving as a tie-breaking vote, sends three names to the governor for a final decision. 
Lawmakers and other critics who say the selection process is dominated by legal industry insiders want to see the names of all applicants made public. Judicial officials, like Boomgaarden’s predecessor, retired Justice Kate Fox, have indicated they’re open to making such a change. They’ve cautioned, however, that making the names public from the beginning might diminish the pool of applicants, because some attorneys won’t want clients, law firm partners or (in the case of an elected district attorney, for example) voters to know that they’re considering a new job. 
At Wednesday’s interview, Boomgaarden said members of the nominating commission are split on the issue — and that split isn’t simply between lawyers and non lawyers.
The commission just completed its second discussion on the question, Boomgaarden said, and has chosen to poll bar members on whether publication of their names would impact their decision to apply for judgeships. Boomgaarden did not offer a concrete timeline for when the commission might reach a decision, but said “it was possible” they could do so before the 2026 legislative session begins in February. 
And what if, as critics of the Freedom Caucus’ judicial reform initiatives contend, it’s not a lack of knowledge, but dissatisfaction with judges’ rulings, that’s driving the scrutiny? 
In that case, Boomgaarden said, there’s a “disconnect” about the role of the independent judiciary and the constitutional separation of powers. 
Or even, “a lack of respect, maybe, that we take an oath of office to uphold the rule of law, to apply the law fairly and impartially to any case that comes before us. And if somebody is expecting us or asking us to do anything other than that, we won’t.” 
The Legislature always has the opportunity to react to a state supreme court decision by crafting new policy, Boomgaarden and Fenn noted. Attorneys who staff the Legislative Service Office, in fact, each year review the high courts’ opinions and flag for lawmakers decisions they think could merit a statutory review or fix. 
That becomes more challenging for politicians when it comes to a constitutional decision — like the question justices are being asked to resolve around abortion access in Wyoming. If the justices uphold the lower court’s finding that the Legislature’s abortion ban violates a provision in the Wyoming State Constitution regarding individuals’ rights to make their own health care decisions, then abortion opponents will have to make their case to voters for a constitutional amendment. 
But how lawmakers react to their decisions is neither the justices’ problem nor their concern, Boomgaarden said. 
“Our job is to look at the issues that were brought to us, look at the evidence that was presented, and make sure that the law was applied in the correct way,” she said. “When you start talking about what might be important long term or not, or have broader implications, that gets into that policy realm that belongs to the legislative branch.”

But a couple weeks ago, they got a letter from their health insurance company that said their premiums would be hiking. It’d be $400 a month with the same enhanced tax credit, or more than $2,200 without. 
The full price is almost how much the retired school teacher, who lives in Council, Idaho, and his wife earn each month.
“If we spent that much on health care — which we won’t be able to do — we wouldn’t be able to buy groceries, or gas, or pay our utility bills, or anything else,” McMichael told the Idaho Capital Sun in an interview. 
Unless Congress extends them, the enhanced premium tax credits that let people buy cheaper health insurance on exchanges will expire at the end of this year. Without those credits, 25,000 Idahoans are likely to cancel their insurance policies — as average premiums are expected to double, said Pat Kelly, executive director of Your Health Idaho. 
The federal government shutdown this week came after weeks of partisan disagreement over this health policy issue. 
Republicans — who control the White House and both chambers of Congress, but need bipartisan support for most legislation — have blamed Democrats for the government shutdown. Congressional Democrats insisted on extending the health insurance tax credits and repealing Medicaid cuts as part of the stopgap funding bill.
But the vast majority of Americans — over 78% — say Congress should renew the enhanced credits, according to a poll by health policy research group KFF released Friday. Even most Republicans, 59%, say they want the credits extended. 
If the credits end, the rate of uninsured Idahoans will “skyrocket,” said Idaho Supports Medicaid Policy Associate Ivy Walker. 
That’ll likely trigger a ripple effect that strains the entire health care system, she said, forcing hospitals to take on more uncompensated care that private insurance companies will offset — by raising premiums for people still insured. 
“This is all going to feed into a very vicious cycle. And families are going to essentially have to choose between getting health care or feeding their families or paying rent,” Walker said.

 How the enhanced premium tax credits for health insurance work

The enhanced premium tax credits ensure people don’t pay more than 8.5% of their income on health insurance for benchmark plans. 
The credits only apply for health insurance people buy through the federal government’s marketplace created by the Affordable Care Act, and state-based insurance exchanges, like Idaho’s Your Health Idaho. 
Exchanges are a common place for people to buy private health insurance when their jobs don’t offer any, their employer’s policies are unaffordable, or people don’t qualify for public assistance like Medicaid or Medicare. 
In Idaho, the enhanced credits reduced average monthly premiums by more than $400 — knocking down $636 payments down to $179, Walker said. 
Smaller credits already existed for insurance through exchanges. The enhanced credits offer two key new types of help, according to KFF: Boosting aid for people already eligible, and expanding eligibility to people who earn more than 400% of the federal poverty level, which is $106,600 for a family of three. 
After the credits were created, more than twice as many people got insurance through the federal marketplace, according to KFF. Since 2022, enrollment in Idaho’s exchange is up by 84%, Kelly said.
In 2021, Congress created the enhanced tax credits discount in the American Rescue Plan Act. Then Congress extended the enhanced credits through the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022. Former President Joe Biden signed both bills into law.
Extending the credits permanently would cost $350 billion over the next decade, and lead to 3.8 million more people having health insurance, the Congressional Budget Office estimated in September. 
 Why was this part of the federal government shutdown?

As the federal government was about to run out of money set aside by Congress at the end of last month, GOP lawmakers crafted their own temporary funding bill to keep the government running before addressing the next year’s full budget. 
The federal government has partially shut down. What does that mean for Idaho?

But Democratic lawmakers largely voted against Republicans’ bill, calling for extending the enhanced tax credits and repealing Medicaid cuts made through the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.” 
In mid-September, U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson said he viewed negotiations over the enhanced tax credits as “a December policy issue, not a September funding issue,” States Newsroom reported. But open enrollment for the federal marketplace — when people can pick or change health insurance plans — starts Nov. 1 and ends Dec. 15. 
Walker said waiting until December to take up extending the credits “would be far too late.”
The policy positions of Idaho’s congressional delegation, made up of four Republicans, are not immediately clear. 
U.S. Rep. Mike Simpson does not support extending the enhanced tax credits, a spokesperson told the Idaho Capital Sun.
“This has nothing to do with a September 30th funding measure — it’s purely a distraction from the Democrats,” Simpson’s spokesperson, Lexi Hamel, said in a statement. 
Amanda Critchfield, a spokesperson for U.S. Sen. Mike Crapo, who chairs the Senate Finance Committee, said “Crapo welcomes conversations with his colleagues on both sides of the aisle about policies to lower health care costs for all Americans once the federal government re-opens.” 
In a statement, U.S. Sen. Jim Risch criticized Democrats.
“Democrats, not Republicans, set the expiration date on the Biden administration’s enhanced Obamacare credits,” Risch told the Sun in a statement. “These are temporary, COVID-era subsidies. If Democrats wanted to extend them beyond the pandemic, turning them into a defacto entitlement program, they had every opportunity to do so during the Biden administration. They did not. Now, they are using it as a ploy to shut down the government and extort nearly $1.5 trillion in federal spending increases.”
U.S. Rep. Russ Fulcher could not be immediately reached for comment. 
Idaho Democratic Party Chairwoman Lauren Necochea said Democrats pushed for the health care policies as part of the stopgap funding bill “because they know how dire this is going to be for regular American families.”
“Huge health care price hikes are being shoved down the throats of the American people, and Democrats are saying, ‘We’re not going to be part of this. We’re going to fight this,’” she told the Sun in an interview. “And this is the only lever Democrats have to try to stop those huge health coverage price hikes before they happen.”
In Idaho, Walker said the enhanced health insurance credits potentially expiring would pile onto a range of Medicaid cuts — to doctor pay rates, reforms from a state law this year, and federal cuts from the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” — that are priming the state for a health care crisis.
“Idahoans will have such a hard time finding access to health care all over the state. And it won’t matter whether you have insurance or not. It’s going to affect everyone,” she said. 
 Open enrollment for health insurance is approaching in Idaho

Open enrollment for Idaho’s insurance exchange, Your Health Idaho, starts Oct. 15 and ends Dec. 15. 
Kelly, who leads the exchange, stressed the importance of working with an insurance broker or agent on plans for next year. 
“It is more important than ever for 2026 that you work with those professionals. There’s about 1,200 agents or brokers all across the state,” he said. “… They are the experts when it comes to health insurance. So, they can help you find a plan that still meets your needs even with these increases.” 
McMichael, 63, retired three years ago. After retirement, he said he and his wife were on Medicaid expansion — until she tapped into Social Security early, and they earned too much to qualify. Then they got on an insurance plan through the exchange. 
McMichael said he’ll have to wait until open enrollment to see if there’s other insurance that’s affordable. 
“Like the 10s of millions of other people in our situation … we will not have health care. And if one of us gets really sick, then the options are pretty bleak,” he said. 
He said he and his wife are pretty healthy; they aren’t on routine prescriptions, and don’t have serious illnesses. 
A few years ago, he had back surgery. Issues have popped up again, but he can’t afford to fix them.
“But I just kind of live with pain. Because trying to get a treatment plan and all the other hoops you have to jump through, like an MRI and physical therapy, is just — even with the health plan that we have, the out of pocket costs are too much,” he said.

(Photo provided by Craig McVay)OKLAHOMA CITY — Craig McVay said he’s done “every job you could think of in public schools,” and now he’s aiming for the state’s top education office.
The retired head of El Reno Public Schools is the second Democrat to enter the 2026 race for state superintendent. Before retiring as El Reno’s superintendent in June 2022, he held a variety of roles throughout his education career, all spent in rural school districts.
“Teacher, coach, counselor, principal, superintendent, federal programs director, special ed director, transportation director, operations director, all of those,” McVay told Oklahoma Voice. “There’s not a single job that I have not done or participated in or helped with in the public school setting. I think that is because I’ve always served in rural communities where we had to do whatever we had to do. If the yard needed to be mowed, if the gym needed to be swept, that was something that I was always willing to do.”
McVay, who lives on a hobby farm outside of El Reno, saw public school budgets tighten and the teacher shortage worsen over the latter end of his career. 
His administration at El Reno tried to boost its local pipeline of new educators by putting district funds into helping teachers’ aides earn college degrees through a partnership with Oklahoma Christian University.
However, Oklahoma still ranks last among all its bordering states in per-pupil funding, the chief source of most public schools’ budgets, according to the Oklahoma State School Boards Association.
That’s something McVay said he’s determined to change as state superintendent by working with the Oklahoma Legislature to raise public education funding. 
Although lawmakers have increased support for public schools by more than $730 million over the past two years, McVay said the Republican supermajority at the state Capitol has failed to keep pace with inflation. 
Adding extra funding could help districts hire more school counselors and employees focused on improving student attendance, which he said would translate into better high school graduation rates.
“Having 15 years of a supermajority has not worked for our kids,” he said. “And so, I think there’s a different approach that I’ll be taking, especially in the area of, again, per-pupil expenditures.”
McVay will face former Tulsa Board of Education member Jennettie Marshall in the Democratic primary for state superintendent.
Two other school district leaders are running on the Republican ticket: retired Bixby Public Schools Superintendent Rob Miller and current Peggs Public School Superintendent John Cox.
State Sen. Adam Pugh, R-Edmond, joined the race on Thursday. Ana Landsaw, of Tahlequah, is another GOP candidate for the post.
Former Tulsa Public Schools board member Jerry Griffin is running as an independent.
McVay labeled himself a centrist Democrat in the style of Carl Albert, the former U.S. House speaker from Oklahoma. He said he decided to run for office after seeing the website WalletHub rank Oklahoma 50th in education, a ranking that gained significant attention across the state.
“If you want to continue to be in 50th, keep voting for the same people,” he said. “If you want change, I’m going to be the change agent.”

(Photo by Brian Bahr/Getty Images)I found myself stunned when I learned that Oklahoma State University would be paying its underperforming coach $15 million to go away.
Because most Oklahomans who perform below expectation at their jobs are summarily fired, most often without severance or a massive payday.
But not Mike Gundy. 
Despite losing 11 of his last 12 games and proving last year he has no respect for Oklahoma State University’s average fan base, Gundy is expected to walk away with a hefty $15 million payday thanks to a buyout provision in his contract that protects him when he gets fired.
Obviously someone in high places is looking out for him, but who is looking out for the rest of us?
Imagine how many scholarships $15 million could pay for. Or perhaps it could be used to reduce tuition rates for in-state residents.
Gundy’s $15 million buyout comes as Oklahoma’s higher education governing board approved average tuition increases of 1.9%, or about $121 annually. While OSU didn’t ask for a hike, 15 others did, including the University of Oklahoma.
Meanwhile, the average Oklahoma college student carried $32,200 in debt, according to the Education Data Initiative, which collects and analyzes education statistics. That $15 million could erase student debt for hundreds of students.
But don’t worry your pretty little heads about that, we apparently have plenty to invest as long as it’s on winning football teams and coaches.
What message does that say about our priorities?
College football has always been an expensive endeavor, and universities desperate to win are increasingly promising to fork out big money to land top coaching talent. But as the landscape continues to shift with revenue sharing and name, image and likeness deals and ever-shifting player allegiances thanks to a busy transfer portal, I find myself wondering how much is too much to spend on buying out losers.
Someone pointed out that Oklahoma State University got off relatively easy with its buyout compared to what other public universities are potentially on the hook to pay if they want to rid themselves of underperforming head coaches.
Sports Illustrated looked at college football coaches contracts and found that University of Georgia coach Kirby Smart would be owed over $118 million. Former University of Oklahoma head football coach Lincoln Riley, who fans love to hate, purportedly stands to make $90 million if he’s fired from the University of Southern California. The University of Alabama would be on the hook to pay its coach, Kalen DeBoer, around $70 million if he’s fired. Texas Longhorns coach Steve Sarkisian would receive $64 million. And Mike Norvell, who coaches at Florida State, has a negotiated buyout of $63 million.
The coaches at Louisiana State University, the University of Miami, Clemson, Pennsylvania State University and Nebraska round out the top 10 biggest winners if they’re losers, according to Sports Illustrated’s analysis.
If fired, University of Oklahoma head coach Brent Venables will receive his guaranteed compensation, though he’s required to try to find similar work to help offset the university’s costs, The Oklahoman reported in August. Venables is expected to make $7.55 million per season and his contract runs through 2029.
I get that college football is a business, and universities and their fan bases want to win. But are the leaders of our public institutions of higher education being good stewards of their resources if they’re agreeing to pay tens of millions of dollars when they fire people who aren’t meeting minimum expectations?
Former OSU President Kasey Shrum inked her name on Gundy’s latest contract in December 2024. She chose to retain Gundy despite his terrible performance both on and off the field.
Under the terms of the current contract, OSU wouldn’t have had to pay Gundy if he was found to be insubordinate, in violation of athletic rules, had a criminal conviction or engaged in conduct that “brings the employee into public disrepute, contempt, scandal or ridicule or that reflects unfavorably on the reputation or the high moral or ethical standards of the University.”
Having a losing record doesn’t count, though it should.
Last year, Gundy definitely opened both himself and OSU to contempt and ridicule when he said people who were critical of his team’s subpar 3-7 record were “the same ones that can’t pay their own bills” and called those same people “failures.” OSU fans, including donors, were furious. But rather than being fired, Gundy got a new contract that guaranteed the massive buyout and allowed him to have another losing season.
OSU soon will likely enter into negotiations with Gundy’s successor. It will be interesting to see what sort of buyout they guarantee him.
A few months ago, Joe Castiglione, OU’s vice president and director of athletics, told members of the Oklahoma State Chamber that his school is focusing on college athletics as a business, and that his school’s expenses are growing much more rapidly than revenue.
OU sports will have a $225 million budget built by generating its own investments, he said.
“We live by a scoreboard for many people in our world so that’s how they measure whether or not we’re successful,” he said.
That may be true, but let’s not forget what universities are here to do — educate our future workforce and do it in the most cost-effective way possible.
Regents have said they’re planning to press the Legislature to increase their funding.
But maybe Oklahoma lawmakers have the funding allotment correct if two of our largest universities can afford to pay eye-popping amounts to guarantee buyouts of football contracts while the average Oklahoman struggles to afford tuition.

(Carol Waller/Trailing of the Sheep Festival)A new podcast will highlight stories and explore the history and culture of sheep ranching in Idaho’s Wood River Valley.
The podcast, “Sheep Stories,” is produced by The Community Library’s Jeanne Rodger Lane Center for Regional History and features archival recordings and interviews from the Trailing of the Sheep Festival. The series aims to tell the story of Scottish, Basque and Peruvian immigrants who have worked in Idaho’s sheep industry for over 100 years.
The “Sheep Stories” podcast is available through a distribution partnership with Boise State Public Radio. Listeners can find all three episodes on the radio station’s website or listeners can download them wherever you get your podcasts.
“The voices and stories in ‘Sheep Stories’ illuminate the human side of Idaho’s sheep industry,” said Mary Tyson, the library’s director of the Center for Regional History, in a press release. “The new podcast that our summer intern, Vance Cunningham, made, gets me excited for this year’s Trailing of the Sheep  Festival. He picked out great stories from years past. His narration as the host of the podcast is very relatable and conveys an enthusiastic spirit for lifelong learning about sheepherding. I’m so proud of the work that he did to realize this new podcast.” 
The podcast centers on the theme of sheepherders and their culture and place of origin, according tot he press release. The first episode is about sheepherders who emigrated from Scotland and found their way to the American  West to herd sheep. The second episode is about sheepherders from the Basque Country/Euskal Herria, including tales of comradery in a Twin Falls Basque boarding house and the loneliness found in the mountains. The third episode is about sheepherders from Peru. 
Cunningham created the podcast from presentations and recordings from one of the center’s archival collections: the Trailing of the Sheep Festival Archive.  
 Cunningham is a senior at Western Washington University and completed the Patricia Crandall Lane Trailing of the Sheep Festival Archive internship from June through August. 
“His project was to listen to and watch media in the archive and describe it in the inventory,” the press release said. “As he listened, he developed a theme of immigrant sheepherder stories. He is the host of the podcast and narrates the three episodes from his point of view as a newcomer to the valley and as someone who is just  learning about the sheep industry and sheep ranching. 
“My love of history and community storytelling goes back to my time working for the Museum of History and Industry during high school, where I worked on the ‘Rainy Day History Podcast,'” Cunningham said in the press release. “This summer, that work continued at The Community Library, where I created the podcast ‘Sheep Stories.’” 
This is the first podcast created by The Community Library.

Opponents cheered the move, while lawsuits are still pending over whether county regulations can trump state-sanctioned activities on state-managed lands.
The post County zoning sways state board to deny lease extension for controversial Casper Mountain gravel pit appeared first on WyoFile .","Gravel miner Prism Logistics has lost its two final leases on state-owned “school trust sections” at the base of Casper Mountain, where the company’s proposed gravel pit on the west side of town has contributed to a broader controversy over state-versus-local control of industrial activity throughout Wyoming.
The Wyoming State Board of Land Commissioners voted 3-2 on Thursday to deny extending the leases. The board, composed of Gov. Mark Gordon, Superintendent of Public Instruction Megan Degenfelder, Secretary of State Chuck Gray, Treasurer Curt Meier and Auditor Kristi Racines, similarly denied Prism’s request in June to extend the two-year terms for six other leases in the area.
Prism obtained all eight leases in 2023 and met fierce opposition from neighbors and residents throughout the county when the leases came to light in 2024. The Casper Mountain Preservation Alliance was formed in response. The group collected more than 20,000 signatures in opposition to the gravel pit. Casper Mountain is a popular local recreation area, drawing hikers, cyclists and skiers.
“We feel a big relief,” Casper Mountain Preservation Alliance cofounder Carolyn Griffith told WyoFile. “It’s not about [the Preservation Alliance]. It’s about the community, the state and what will be most beneficial for everyone.

“We’re supportive of gravel mining,” Griffith added. “But we’re also supportive of it in the right place.”
The winning argument, which Gray noted in his motion and denial vote, was that Natrona County — after the state leases were issued — banned heavy trucks on multiple roads, including Coates Road, which Prism would solely rely on to access the area. The county also modified zoning to ban mining in the area. 
Those restrictions preempt Prism from obtaining other permissions both at the county and state level, Gray said.
“I don’t believe Prism is going to be able to [obtain] the necessary authorizations, and I think that’s very important when we consider the fiduciary aspects here,” Gray said. He added that mining the state lands, which are adjacent to a rural neighborhood that relies on a shallow alluvial aquifer, would unduly harm private property rights.


What are state trust lands?
Upon granting statehood in 1890, the federal government bestowed some 4.2 million acres of “state trust lands” to Wyoming, and it now manages about 3.4 million acres of trust land. The Wyoming Constitution prescribes that the primary use of those lands, which are scattered throughout the state in a checkerboard pattern, is to generate revenue to support public schools.
The Office of State Lands and Investments commonly leases those lands — often referred to as “school sections” — for grazing and industrial development such as mining and oil and gas drilling.


“Again, this is just wrong,” Gray said.
Prism Logistics Manager Kyle True, as well as his attorney, told board members the controversy has been highly “politicized,” obscuring what should be a simple regulatory process.
“In this small state, those who contribute are asked to serve and function in many ways,” True said. “I think there’s a political realm and there’s a regulatory realm.”
The board, despite the political nature of those who serve on it, True suggested, is obligated to extend the leases based on the company’s due diligence to test the gravel resource and the fact that it filed notice with another state agency for a limited mining operation exemption. He urged the board not to be swayed by those opposed to the gravel pit.
“What we’re dealing with is a veritable tempest in a teapot,” True said. “There are sincere passions by people that don’t understand our industry and are bringing up things that simply are inapplicable here.”
Treasurer Meier and Gov. Gordon voted against Gray’s motion to deny the lease extensions.
“I think this has been politicized, and this necessarily isn’t the right place to play politics,” Meier said. He noted that the Casper Mountain Preservation Alliance is exploring ideas to create recreational and educational opportunities on the state lands that might generate revenue as an alternative to mining.

“It struck me that the course of action that you probably should entertain,” Meier told Griffith, “is to let us run the regulatory aspect of it, but go to your politicians within your district and ask them to make that a state park.” 
State versus local control
True still holds out hope that Prism will eventually win its way to mining gravel at the base of Casper Mountain, he told WyoFile. The board’s denial to extend the company’s leases, he noted, seems to counter its contention that counties may not impose zoning and safety regulations that might impede state-sanctioned activities on state-managed school trust sections.
In fact, the state-versus-county question was already simmering before Prism’s controversial gravel pit.
The state sued Teton County several years ago to prevent it from enforcing its codes and regulations on a glamping operation, which the state had permitted on a school trust section. The state won and, upon appeal, the Wyoming Supreme Court confirmed in April that “the State Board and its permittees on state land are not subject to a county’s land use and development regulations.”
Meanwhile, Prism is asking for judicial review, challenging the Natrona County Board of Commissioners for imposing zoning and safety regulations that were enacted after the company acquired its state leases. Prism has also filed a petition for judicial review in the 7th District Court in Natrona County in July, claiming the state’s lease extension denial in June was “contrary to law” because the company insists it had met conditions qualifying for an extension.
Both lawsuits are still pending.

(File photo by Getty Images)A pipeline company tasked with supplying natural gas necessary to run a proposed power plant in South Carolina’s Lowcountry has sent out letters to 185 potentially impacted landowners as the massive energy project, billed as “generational” for the state, gets underway.
Gov. Henry McMaster, in May, signed into law a sweeping energy package that, among other things, granted permission for Dominion Energy and state-owned utility Santee Cooper to partner on a 2,000-megawatt natural gas-fired plant along the Edisto River in Colleton County.
Utility executives told the SC Daily Gazette they plan to begin the permitting process for that power plant, estimated to cost $2.5 billion, as early as December.
The facility, they say, is essential to meeting South Carolina’s power needs amid rapid industrial and population growth, as well as a proliferation of high-energy data centers that fuel the nation’s ever advancing technologies.
Data centers gobble up energy. Should SC block them from getting special deals?

“We need the energy,” Dominion Energy South Carolina President Keller Kissam said.
But before the first shovel turns dirt at Canadys, the companies need to know they’ll have the fuel to power it.
That’s where another partner — Kinder Morgan — comes in.
The power companies have a standing agreement with the Houston natural gas giant to build a $431 million pipeline, running from the south Georgia border, across Hampton and north Colleton counties, to deliver 325,000 dekatherms of gas per day to the plant site 71 miles to the northeast.
Bridge-Project_v1
 
A number of environmental groups, including Southern Environmental Law Center and Conservation Voters of South Carolina, have already expressed concern over the pipeline’s proposed route — in particular its proximity to the ACE Basin, a 350,000-acre undeveloped estuary named for the Ashepoo, Combahee, and Edisto rivers that feed it.
But one organization dedicated to the basin’s preservation, the ACE Basin Task Force, won’t oppose it, according to chairman Charles Lane.
Lane said the proposed route will have far less impact on the sensitive ecosystem and endangered species than if the utilities had chose to run the pipeline beneath the transmission lines Dominion owns closer to the coast.
The proposed pipeline won’t go into the heart of the basin. In all, it will cross just four miles of land that’s part of the ACE’s larger watershed — where rainfall might eventually drain into the basin — according to Kissam.
Laying plans and laying pipe
The three companies started laying their pipeline plans last year.
As part of that process, Kinder Morgan Vice President of Public Affairs Allen Fore, along with engineers and project managers, took a helicopter flight over the projected route, landing occasionally to see things from the ground.
“One of the things I do on every major project we have across the United States is to see with my own eyes the potential route from the air and to go every mile,” Fore said. “That’s the level of detail that we take on projects, from a very, very high level to an individual conversation with the landowner.”
The company also has met, both publicly and privately, with officials from both counties. Now, they’re asking landowners’ permission to survey the land under which the pipe could run.
Kinder Morgan plans to hold community meetings with the landowners, who received letters last week.
The company will seek to survey a path 300 feet wide but ultimately will need a 50-foot-wide right-of-way, for which they will pay rent to the landowners. How much is unknown. Amounts will depend on the land’s value and negotiations.
Easements will give Kinder Morgan permanent access to the property. Landowners can still use the land, with limitations. They can plant crops or bushes, but not large trees with deep roots, and they can’t build any kind of structure on it in case Kinder Morgan has to come back and dig up the pipe for maintenance. And payments don’t transfer if the landowner sells.
A large portion of the pipeline’s route will run under existing power lines owned by Santee Cooper so as not to disturb more land than necessary.
Once they’ve secured a final path — sometime between April and June of next year — they’ll officially begin the permitting process with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
In addition to permission from the presidentially appointed commission, they’ll need various approvals from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, South Carolina Department of Natural Resources, state Department of Archives and History, and the state Department of Environmental Services.
The partnership
Meanwhile, cleanup and site work at the former gas plant is largely complete, Kissam said.
The Virginia-headquartered power company has now started placing orders for the plant’s specialized equipment, including turbines, steam generators and transformers, which take a long time to have built and delivered.
In addition to the Canadys plant, Dominion is eyeing sites for gas plants in its home state and expects to buy in bulk as a way to save on costs.
“We need to be ordering the equipment,” said Santee Cooper President Jimmy Staton. “But we’re going to wait for the certainty of the certification of the pipeline before we start spending, in my view, major dollars.”
The partnership wasn’t necessarily easy to secure. Legislators and power customers pushed back, still upset over an earlier failed partnership between Santee Cooper and Dominion’s now defunct predecessor, South Carolina Electric & Gas.
The two companies mothballed a planned expansion of the V.C. Summer Nuclear Station in Fairfield County in 2017 amid fraud, mismanagement and cost overruns. Customers of both companies are still paying for the nuclear reactors that have never produced a single megawatt.
Here’s how much SC power customers are still paying for a failed nuclear project

Now, consumer groups say, customers will be asked to pay for a gas plant on top of it.
Under initial agreements, copies of which Santee Cooper provided to the SC Daily Gazette, the two utility companies plan to each have equal ownership and equal cost sharing in the gas plant.
The companies will split that natural gas supply from the pipeline 45/55, with Dominion taking the larger portion and selling off any excess to its customers.
While Dominion Energy crews will handle the power plant’s construction, Santee Cooper’s chief operating office will oversee it, the executives said.
When it’s operational, the plant will employ between 40 and 60 full-time workers in rural Colleton County, which struggled economically following Canadys’ coal closure in 2013.
The access to natural gas the pipeline provides could draw other industry to the area as well, Kissam said.
“Everywhere natural gas comes, businesses follow,” Staton added. “And so, we think it’s not just a great opportunity for us to get the electricity that the state needs, but it’s also a great opportunity for economic development for those areas.”
Kinder Morgan will own and operate the pipeline.
And by working with Kinder Morgan, Staton and Kissam said, they’ll be able to tap in to its vast system. That includes 80,000 miles of pipe that spans 43 states, drawing from every major gas-producing basin in the country.
That means, if something impacts one pipeline — a natural disaster or a maintenance outage — the utilities can get their gas from another Kinder Morgan line without having to pay a higher price to buy from other providers, Staton said.
In addition, the Canadys pipeline is part of a larger $6 billion proposed expansion by Kinder Morgan across the Southeast, with lines across Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia, most of which is following the route of the company’s existing pipelines.
Even without those expanding lines, Fore said, Kinder Morgan already has enough on its existing system to power Canadys.
Environmental protections
To protect the environment, Fore said, Kinder Morgan electronically monitors its pipelines 24/7. With the flip of a switch, and in many cases automatically, the pipeline will shut down if there’s any indication of a leak.
“(The power) plant is state of the art — so is our pipe,” Fore said.
And because the line is carrying natural gas, which is lighter than air, any leak will rise rather than sinking underground or contaminating a water source, he said.
The company has the ability to drill down and run lines some 70 or 80 feet underground without disturbing the ground above. It already has pipelines that run beneath the Mississippi River and the San Francisco Bay. 
When it comes to the power plant, Kissam said, the companies plan to use an air cooling system for the turbines, rather than water. The plant will use 1/100th of the water consumed from the Edisto River by its coal-fired predecessor.
Because natural gas plants are easier to fire up and pull back, tracking right along with power demand at any given time, they also work much better alongside solar power than their coal-based counterparts, Staton said.
Until battery technology becomes more developed, power companies cannot rely on renewable energy alone to keep the lights on. When the sun is shining, gas power can be dialed back. When it’s cloudy, the gas takes over.
“That’s critical for us if we’re going to continue to develop renewable resources around South Carolina,” Staton said.
Currently, Dominion Energy South Carolina has 1,000 megawatts of solar capacity on its system, while Santee Cooper and the electric cooperatives collectively have 638 megawatts.
Under Santee Cooper’s latest long-term plan, the utility company plans to add another 1,500 megawatts of solar power by 2040, largely by purchasing power from solar developers rather than owning and operating its own arrays. One megawatt of solar is enough to power 168 homes, on average, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association.
Kinder Morgan hopes to have the necessary approvals in hand to start constructing the pipeline in early 2029, Fore said.

(Photo by Jeff Beach/North Dakota Monitor) Xcel Energy customers in North Dakota are facing an unusually large increase in their electric bill, which a North Dakota official attributes in large part to the company’s move away from coal. 
Northern States Power Co., part of Minnesota-based Xcel Energy, has asked the North Dakota Public Service Commission to approve a rate increase of more than 19%. Customers will have a chance to sound off with utility regulators next week. 
If the PSC approves the full increase, an average NSP residential customer would pay an extra $22.34 per month over last year’s rate. NSP customers have already seen an interim rate increase this year while the rate case is pending. The increase was nearly 12%, or $11.36 per average residential customer. 
Victor Schock, director of utilities for the PSC, said it would be unusual for the three-person commission to approve such a large rate increase request in full. What is more likely is a negotiated compromise, he said. 
Xcel has about 97,000 customers in North Dakota, including in West Fargo, Grand Forks and Minot. The proposed increase would increase Xcel’s annual revenue in North Dakota by $44.6 million.
North Dakota green lights natural gas power plant

Xcel says that since its last rate increase four years ago, it has invested in North Dakota projects, such as a new Grand Forks service center, a new substation and equipment upgrades.
Schock said the increase is driven by infrastructure upgrades, but also by Xcel’s move away from coal-fired electricity. 
Xcel last year retired one of three coal units at the Sherburne County Generating Plant, or Sherco, near Monticello, Minnesota. It plans to retire Sherco’s remaining coal-fired units in 2026 and 2030, marking the company’s full exit from coal
Xcel instead will use the site for what it calls the largest solar facility in the Midwest and a battery storage facility.
Schock said Minnesota public policy, which tends to favor green energy much more than North Dakota policy, is a driver behind the change. 
“We’re close geographically; policy wise, we’re pretty different,” Schock said. 
He said North Dakota views the Sherco coal facility as an asset that should keep producing coal instead of one that should be retired with costs passed on to North Dakota customers. 
“That is, in my opinion, one thing that is driving their large requested increase,” Schock said. 
Xcel says its North Dakota residential customers’ electric bills were about 28% below the national average from 2019 to 2023, and it anticipates bills will stay well below that average, in part because of federal tax credits for nuclear energy plants. 
Xcel representatives on Oct. 13 will make two presentations on the rate increase, at noon and 6 p.m. in the state Capitol. Public comments will be taken after the presentations. 
The hearing can be seen online through the PSC’s website.
People can watch the hearing and provide in-person comments at the Capitol or these locations:

The PSC has set aside a full week for a formal hearing beginning Dec. 1, but if a settlement agreement is reached before that hearing, it would likely not take that long, Schock said.

(Photo illustration by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)Fewer people crossed state lines to obtain an abortion in the first six months of 2025 than the same period last year, marking the first reported decline in clinic visits since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade in 2022. 
But data contained in a new report by the Guttmacher Institute, a policy organization that advocates for reproductive rights, makes clear that is only a partial picture of abortion in America this year.
While the data shows an 8% decline in patients traveling to clinics in states where abortion remains legal, it does not take into account the increasing reliance on telehealth to obtain abortion-inducing medication. 
That shift to telehealth for abortion services was borne out in Tennessee last year.
Federal judge blocks Tennessee law making it crime to aid minors seeking out-of-state abortions

In 2024, 10,020 Tennessee residents travelled out of state to obtain an abortion, according to data compiled by Guttmacher.
However, an additional 5,840 patients terminated pregnancies with medication obtained through telehealth appointments. The total number of Tennesseans obtaining abortions — both surgical and medication — in 2024 surpassed those obtained before the Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision triggered a Tennessee near-total abortion ban in 2022.
Tennessee women continue to seek abortions at organizations like the The Massachusetts Medication Abortion Access Project, a medical practice established two years ago to provide abortion care via telemedicine to patients in all 50 states.  
The organization serves between 50 and 75 Tennessee patients each month, Dr. Angel Foster, its co-founder, said this week.
“Our patients are largely the same as patients getting in-clinic services in their states prior to Dobbs,” she said. “Financial precarity is shaping their decisions. We also hear every day from women in unstable or abusive relationships and college students early in their careers.”
It operates under a so-called Massachusetts’ “shield law” that allows it to prescribe and mail FDA-approved abortion pills anywhere in the country. The law also protects the organization and its medical staff from out-of-state prosecution.
And many of the Tennessee patients already have one or more children, she said. 
Thus far 22 states and the District of Columbia have adopted so-called shield laws since the Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade, making telemedicine abortion appointments widely accessible to those living in states with abortion bans to obtain a prescription for the two-pill regimen generally prescribed up to 10 weeks of pregnancy.
The increasing availability of abortion pills has prompted a backlash from attorneys general in Republican-led states, including Tennessee, which has laws barring the mailing and prescribing of abortion-inducing drugs.
More than 10,000 Tennesseans travelled out of state for abortions last year, new study finds

Earlier this month, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, was mounting a review of the safety of mifepristone, the commonly prescribed abortion inducing medication, raising alarms for medical providers and abortion rights advocates about looming federal action to limit its availability. 
“It’s unclear what studies they will review, whether they are peer reviewed or junk science reports recently released by anti-abortion groups,” said Dr. Ushma Upadhyay, a professor at University of California, San Francisco in the Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology, & Reproductive Sciences of the Trump administration review.
The Guttmacher report also notes decline in out-of-state travel for abortions was most pronounced in states that implemented six-week abortion bans. 
Before South Carolina’s six-week ban was allowed to take place in August of 2023, it was one of six states that served as a destination for about 100 Tennessee patients seeking an abortion that year.
After a federal court allowed South Carolina’s six-week abortion ban to take effect, Tennesseans ceased obtaining abortions in that state, Guttmacher data showed.

(Photo courtesy of the Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library) The Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library Foundation has tapped into $53 million of a $70 million Bank of North Dakota line of credit to pay for construction costs while private fundraising continues.
Ed O’Keefe, CEO of the Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library Foundation, said the foundation anticipates accessing the full $70 million by the end of the year.
North Dakota lawmakers in 2023 first established the line of credit through the state-owned bank to allow construction on the $450 million library in Medora to continue if donations have been pledged but not yet received by the library foundation. The loan did not get used in the 2023-25 budget cycle. 
Lawmakers voted earlier this year to continue that line of credit. Unlike a traditional loan, a line of credit allows the borrower to access the funds only as needed, saving money on interest, said Kelvin Hullet, chief business development officer for the Bank of North Dakota.
The library foundation began accessing the funds for the first time in July, with the balance now at $53 million, Hullet said Friday. 
Those dollars are needed because construction costs are coming in while some donations have yet to be collected, O’Keefe said.
Some donations to the library are multi-year commitments, he said. For example, a $1 million donation could be paid in $250,000 installments over four years.
“In many cases, we have commitments on the fundraising, but the construction costs, in addition to the exhibits and ramping up operations, are hitting now,” O’Keefe said. 
Under the legislation, the line of credit is required to be repaid, plus interest. There is not a payment due until June 30, 2027, Hullet said.
“Hopefully they can pay the entire line of credit back,” Hullet said. “If they can’t, then we’ll look at some sort of a structure over the course of a couple of years, as their donations come in, then to repay that back.”
Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library launches virtual event series

The Legislature also approved up to $5 million in state funding in the North Dakota Industrial Commission budget to pay for some of the interest. 
Interest is accruing at a market rate, Hullet said, but the library foundation will pay 2% interest, with the state funding covering the difference.
Hullet said he doesn’t expect the full $5 million to be used. That payment will be calculated at the end of June 2027.
The library foundation has raised $344 million toward a $450 million fundraising goal, O’Keefe said. That total includes $50 million in state funds the North Dakota Legislature approved in 2019 for the library’s operational endowment. Those endowment funds are to be used to operate the facility, not cover construction costs. Project construction is estimated at $400 million. 
The library foundation had donor events over the weekend in Medora and has upcoming events in Dallas, Texas and Washington, D.C., said Matt Briney, chief communications and marketing officer for the library.
The presidential library is under construction in western North Dakota, where Roosevelt spent time after the deaths of his wife and mother. He famously said he would not have been president without his experience in North Dakota.
O’Keefe estimated construction was about 70% complete as of Friday and expected to wrap up by May 2026, including the exhibits. Briney said the federal government shutdown will not affect continued construction at the library site since no federal funding was provided for the project.
“You can absolutely count on it, July 4, 2026, the doors will open to this library,” Briney said.
Lawmakers earlier this year rejected a proposal to add another $50 million in state funding to the library’s operational endowment, though proponents signaled the proposal could be back next session. Some lawmakers who opposed the additional funding raised concerns about taxpayers being asked to fill funding gaps with the library.
The presidential library has also received a $4 million Department of Commerce Destination Development Grant and $500,000 from the state Outdoor Heritage Fund. There’s also an effort to secure federal funding for up to $50 million for the library.

Attorneys for the department explained their view of the law in a brief at the request of Raleigh County Circuit Judge Michael Froble. Froble oversees two consolidated lawsuits filed by plaintiffs on both sides of a legal fight over the state’s school vaccine law and religious liberty. 
“Even before the [Equal Protection for Religion Act] came to be, West Virginia law was clear: ‘religion’ ‘in any … dispute concerning religious freedom’ encompasses ‘convictions which form the basis for the moral and ethical aspirations upon which [West Virginians] structure their lives,’” the attorneys wrote in court filings. Lacking any express indication otherwise, the EPRA must “be read in context with th[is] common law.”
“The broad common-law understanding leaves no room to draw arbitrary lines between ‘religious’ or ‘philosophical’  vaccine exemptions,” they wrote. “Whether an exemption request stems from a church doctrine, a spiritual worldview, or a secular moral conviction, the practical effect is the same: a person is considered to have practiced his or her religion so long as he or she rejects vaccination based on a deeply personal conviction about what is ‘right and wrong’ and that belief is ‘held with the strength of traditional religious convictions.’”
West Virginia has not allowed families to opt out of the school vaccine requirements for religious or philosophical reasons, but that could change. Gov. Patrick Morrisey issued an executive order earlier this year requiring the state to allow religious exemptions based on the state’s Equal Protection for Religion Act of 2023. 
The state Board of Education has directed the county boards of education not to allow religious exemptions.  
In one of the lawsuits, families in Raleigh County sued the school boards to accept their children’s religious exemption to the requirement. In the other lawsuit, parents of immunocompromised children are suing the state Department of Health to stop it from issuing religious exemptions. Froble has consolidated the two cases at the request of state Attorney General J.B. McCuskey. 
In July, the judge granted a preliminary injunction allowing families in the Raleigh County case to send their children to school. The ruling applied only to those students. A hearing on permanent injunction in the cases started in September and will continue this week.
At the time of the September hearing, the state Department had processed 570 requests for non-medical exemptions to the state’s vaccine requirements, but health officials had not distinguished between exemptions based on religious and philosophical objections. Froble indicated the difference is important because Morrisey’s executive order is based on the 2023 Equal Protection for Religion Act. Philosophical exemptions wouldn’t apply under the EPRA, the judge said. 
In the brief it filed with the court, the state Department of Education argues that the health department asks the court to expand the state’s religious freedom law beyond what the Legislature contemplated. The court should refuse, they wrote. 
“Even if the Court were to consider expanding EPRA beyond its text, a broader problem remains,” the attorneys wrote. “If ‘philosophy’ is protected by EPRA, those protections cannot reach mere disagreement with a law. Otherwise, all one would need to do to exempt oneself from a law is express disagreement and opt out of it. 
“Therefore, this Court should draw the bounds of the EPRA exactly where the statute’s title suggests they should be drawn: at religion alone,” the attorneys wrote.
They go on to argue that if the law is interpreted to expand to philosophical beliefs, those beliefs should be so deeply ingrained that they’re virtually the same as that person’s belief in God. 
In their brief, attorneys for Marissa Jackson and Joshua Hess, the parents of immunocompromised children in school, argued that the court should rule that the religious protection law does protect philosophical and moral beliefs but the law should be applied with a “a fact-based, individualized analysis.” Jackson and Hess are represented by attorneys with the America Civil Liberties Union of West Virginia and Mountain State Justice. 
They argue that the Department of Health’s interpretation of the religious protection law would  have far reaching implications that would make the law vulnerable to anyone who disagrees with it. 
“If adopted, this interpretation could not be confined to vaccination requirements without raising new, distinct, and significant constitutional concerns,” they wrote. “Under Defendants’ interpretation, every West Virginia law becomes vulnerable to challenge by individuals who simply disagree with its provisions, without requiring explanation of the nature of their objection or its significance in their lives. Criminal statutes, regulatory frameworks, and routine governance mechanisms would all face the most demanding constitutional scrutiny. 
“The West Virginia judicial system would bear an enormous burden reviewing every law through this lens, fundamentally altering how legal challenges operate in this state,” they wrote. 
Attorneys for the parents who are suing the state and Raleigh County boards of education to allow their children to attend school had not yet submitted a brief on the question of religious and philosophical exemptions on Friday afternoon. 
The court hearing on a permanent injunction is expected to continue Wednesday and Thursday at the Raleigh County Judicial Center in Beckley. 
Paul Hardesty, president of the state Board of Education, and Larry Ford, president of the Raleigh County Board of Education, along with acting state Health Officer Dr. Mark McDaniel, have all been subpoenaed to testify, according to court documents. 
Attorneys for the parents of immunocompromised children are also expected to call witnesses from the state Department of Health, including people involved in the reviewing of exemption requests, people who helped create the policies and procedures for reviewing the exemptions and a person identified by the department who has requested a non-medical exemption. 
Miranda Guzman and Carley Hunter, plaintiffs in the case against the boards of education, are also on the witness list, according to court documents. Attorneys for those parents have asked the judge to make the case a class action.

(Photo: Angela Dennis for the Tennessee Lookout)Knoxville College has named former Knox County Commissioner Dasha Lundy, Ph.D., as its new interim president, marking the return of a familiar leader at one of the most pivotal moments in the institution’s 150-year history.
Lundy, who served as chief operating officer and vice president from 2021 to 2023, steps back into leadership as the historically Black college faces a pressing financial crisis and must restart its accreditation process from scratch.
“The most immediate priority is securing the resources or an extension to repay a $4.4 million debt by December 31,” Lundy said. “If we’re unable to meet that obligation, there’s a real possibility that portions of our historic property could be auctioned off. This is about saving an institution that has served generations of Black students, families, and leaders.”
Founded in 1875, Knoxville College has long been a cornerstone of educational opportunity and civil rights activism in East Tennessee. Its Mechanicsville campus once buzzed with student life and civic engagement, but decades of financial strain, loss of accreditation and campus disrepair have left the college operating primarily online and relying heavily on alumni and community support.
One of the hardest blows came last year when a fire destroyed Elnathan Hall, a historic campus building. Lundy described the loss as devastating and said the investigation remains ongoing.
According to her 2023 resignation letter, Lundy said she raised serious issues with the board that she felt were critical to address in order to protect the institution. After a recent vote, school leaders asked her to return.
After fire at historically Black Knoxville College, leaders speak out on school’s status

 “It’s nothing but God,” Lundy said. “I’m a woman of faith and a lot of people didn’t understand why I left, but I had to protect myself and do the right thing. It’s always been about protecting and saving this school.”
“I’ve always believed that KC is the backbone of our community and can help address the Black poverty rate in our city,” she said. “I came back because I believe in what this college means for our community.”
Lundy said the college’s path to recovery depends on being honest about its current challenges, from financial struggles to accreditation setbacks.
“To rebuild Knoxville College, we have to raise money and that includes being transparent about where we stand, what’s broken, what needs repair, and what we can realistically achieve,” Lundy said. “The community, our alumni, and our students deserve that.”
Lundy emphasized the college’s deeper roots, tracing its mission back to 1863, when Rev. J.G. McKee worked in Nashville to help newly freed people with few resources. 
“He probably didn’t have much, maybe nothing at all, but he was driven by a mission, and that mission is still alive today,” she said.
Accreditation and campus challenges
One of Lundy’s first tasks after addressing debt and finances is to restart the accreditation process with the Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools (TRACS) after the college failed audits in 2024. According to records, the college submitted its application in August 2024 and received a list of 23 compliance violations that must be addressed, including leadership clarity, financial stability, and accurate enrollment reporting.
Founded in 1875 by the Presbyterian Church, Knoxville College lost its national accreditation in 1997, a major blow that triggered declining enrollment and deepened financial struggles. Without accreditation, students became ineligible for federal financial aid, making it difficult for the college to attract and retain both students and faculty.
No classes have been held on campus since 2017 due to building safety concerns. Today, all courses are offered online, while several historic campus buildings remain unused, many listed on the National Register of Historic Places.










Knoxville College will look different, but it will continue to stand for the mission that has carried it for 150 years. Educating, uplifting, and empowering our people.


– Dasha Lundy, Ph.D., Knoxville College 


Lundy said addressing the physical campus is as urgent as stabilizing finances and accreditation, and that it could be a process several years in the making.
“There is a lot of work to do and it’s going to take time. Our goal is to create a safe, functional campus that honors the college’s history while meeting the needs of our students.”
She said that online programs and campus restoration are part of a broader vision. 
Local leadership key to revival
Lundy’s appointment comes after a series of leadership changes. Former presidents Leonard Adams and Rotesha Harris both left within the past two years, leaving the college’s top post vacant until Lundy’s return. She began serving as interim president on Oct. 2, an appointment announced during the school’s 150th homecoming celebration.
The college also announced several changes to its board of trustees, signaling a renewed focus on leadership and governance.
Von Smith, a former member of the board of trustees, said Lundy’s leadership represents a fresh opportunity to rebuild with focus and transparency.

“It’s going to take a collaborative effort from the community and alumni,” Smith said. “We need to support the administration that has been chosen to lead us into the next 20 years. Dr. Lundy is here in the city, in the community, and knows the people who can help move this college forward.”
Michael Rodgers, Director of Alumni Affairs, said the school’s survival hinges on both innovative thinking and unity.
“We have to have radical new ideas to move forward, and I think Dr. Lundy brings the outside-the-box thinking that this college truly needs,” Rodgers said. “ We’re at a point where we either pull together or we fall, and that unity piece is huge. I believe she’s a unifier who can bring all these aspects together.”
Rodgers also stressed the importance of a leader deeply rooted in the local community. “We need someone who knows the community, is well connected, and can engage all the movers and shakers here in Knoxville. It’s going to take the entire community to support this effort, not just Black residents, but everyone who cares about the future of this historic institution.”
Looking ahead
Lundy expressed confidence that Knoxville College can regain stability through transparency, accountability, and strong community partnerships.
“This is our defining moment,” she said. “We have an opportunity not just to survive, but to build a stronger, more resilient institution. My goal is to continue the work I started before, strengthening academic programs, improving operational systems, and deepening relationships with alumni and the community so that Knoxville College thrives for generations to come.”
She acknowledged the challenges ahead but said her approach balances respect for the college’s heritage with innovative strategies for the future.
“Knoxville College will look different, but it will continue to stand for the mission that has carried it for 150 years. Educating, uplifting, and empowering our people,” Lundy said. “This is about moving forward together, with vision, purpose, and accountability.”

,Mississippi Today,2025-10-06 10:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,Lawmakers want to expand ‘school choice’ in Mississippi. Here’s what it looks like in neighboring states,Devna Bose,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/10/06/school-choice-mississippi-vouchers/,"Some Mississippi legislative leaders want to join a growing move toward 'school choice,' policies that give families options outside of traditional public education and often include diverting public dollars to private schools.","One by one, universal school-choice programs are expanding across the Southeast.
Now, as state lawmakers are considering doing the same in Mississippi, they’re looking to our neighbors and talking to experts about what happened in those states.
There has been a nationwide push to expand school-choice programs, most of which give families public money to spend outside of traditional public schools. These options range from charter schools to vouchers that pay for private-school tuition. When these programs are available to all students, regardless of family income, they’re described as “universal.”

Rep. Jansen Owen, a Republican from Poplarville and one of the leading school-choice proponents in the House, said he’d like Mississippi to consider a plan with education savings accounts that are at least partially reserved for students of all backgrounds. Education savings accounts, or ESAs, give parents public dollars to pay for their child’s education — that can include tuition to private schools and online education curriculum for homeschooling. Mississippi currently has an ESA program limited to students with disabilities. 
Owen also would like to see expanded open enrollment policies, which would allow students to transfer between public school districts. Owen said he believes parents should be able to make the final decision on their child’s education. He also said parents regularly tell him their local districts don’t offer the ideal educational program.
“They’re telling me that they have no options right now,” Owen said. 
But school-choice opponents say the pricey programs don’t actually give students more options. Private schools can turn away students, unlike public schools. And national data shows school-choice programs are still out of reach for many low-income students, students of color and students with disabilities because of private-school access, transportation issues and tuition costs. 
A Mississippi House committee studying school-choice policies has called on experts from Arkansas and Louisiana, who have lauded school-choice efforts in their states. Owen said he hopes to mimic parts of Tennessee’s plan in Mississippi.
Others from those states often have a different perspective. 
Tennessee
Tennessee’s first two education savings account programs were limited to students with special needs and families in Nashville and in Hamilton and Shelby counties who wanted their children to attend private schools instead of their local public school. 
But a similar program established this year is open to all students in Tennessee.
Half of the program’s 20,000 scholarships are reserved for students who previously qualified for the education savings account program, students with special needs or students in households with income lower than 300% of the federal free- and reduced-lunch guidelines. The other 10,000 scholarships are open to anyone. 
The omnibus legislation also gave public school teachers one-time bonuses and included a “hold harmless” clause that reimburses public schools for any state funding lost from students leaving to participate in the voucher program. 
The income cap will be removed next year, and the program can grow by 5,000 scholarships each year, as demand requires.
And the demand is there, said Tori Venable, Tennessee director of Americans for Prosperity, a national conservative advocacy group funded by billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch. This year, people applied for twice as many vouchers as were available, she said. 
“We saw a groundswell of parents demanding this after COVID,” she said. “We saw schools shut down and parents were dissatisfied with online learning.”
It’s not clear who has received vouchers so far, Venable said. The state won’t release details about who’s enrolled in the program. Some Tennessee lawmakers previously predicted a majority of the money would go to students who already attend private schools. 
The biggest issue for Jenny Mills McFerron, assistant director for policy and research for EdTrust Tennessee, is student performance at private schools. 
There’s little data to show how well students are learning in Tennessee’s voucher program. Private-school students in the smaller initial program generally performed below their public-school peers.
Additionally, the rural nature of Tennessee — similar to Mississippi — presents challenges. 
According to a 2025 report from the Partnership for Equity and Education Rights, five counties host over half of the private schools in Tennessee. More than 30 counties have only one or two, some with fewer than 10 students each.
While some school-choice programs allow parents to use the money to cover transportation costs, the voucher funds are limited and averaged about $6,000 during the 2023-24 school year, according to the Center for American Progress, a progressive think tank based in Washington.
The conservative policy group Empower Mississippi reports that in-state average private school tuition hovers around the same amount, but some schools in Mississippi have rates higher than $15,000. And after voucher programs were established in other states, private schools raised their tuition.
“The private school-choice programs are not really providing choice to the vast majority of rural families, and they divert funding from public schools, leaving rural students with less,” said Paige Shoemaker DeMio, senior K-12 education policy analyst for Center for American Progress.
While a rural student might be able to utilize a voucher program, losing the student could be harmful to the local public school, she said. Rural areas have lower student population and have to make fewer dollars go further. 
“Even when no students from a community use a voucher program, when state-level funding gets cut due to the cost of the practical voucher program, like has been seen in Arizona or in Ohio, rural schools are definitely going to feel it the most because they rely more heavily on state and federal funding,” Shoemaker DeMio said. “We’ve seen this in West Virginia and Indiana, where rural schools are closing or they’re dramatically losing funding as they’re feeling the effects of these programs.”
As federal funding cuts trickle down, McFerron is concerned the program’s costs will continue to increase, putting Tennessee into a tight financial situation.
“Our concern is that the data and accountability are so limited,” she said. “Since we’re in our first year, it’s too early to see large-scale effects.”
Arkansas
The LEARNS Act created an Arkansas education savings account program in 2023. 
The program has been slowly scaled up, and as of this school year, all Arkansas students are eligible. Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders has committed to funding every student who wants to participate.
The majority of dollars so far have been spent on private-school students. During the 2023-24 school year, 64% of students who received funds through the state’s program were already enrolled in private schools, according to a recent report. Data also show Arkansas private schools raised their tuition in response to the voucher program.
Shay Rafferty, director of social media and marketing for Citizens for Arkansas Public Education and Students, said her child’s religious private school charged more for tuition when it started accepting vouchers. 
“Most of the other local private schools have done that, too,” she said. “These students are supposed to get school choice, but they still can’t afford it.” 
Still, Josh McGee of the Office of Education Policy at the University of Arkansas said the program has improved education options in rural areas. He said micro-schools and cooperatives have sprung up in unexpected places, and more parents are opting for homeschooling, thanks to the vouchers. 
According to him, the competition makes everyone work harder to keep students.
“Superintendents would tell you they’re having to think about how to keep parents in their schools for a number of reasons,” McGee said. “The ultimate story is that if folks can leave, you have to deliver the goods.”
It’s a popular free-market idea that’s been embraced by Mississippi conservatives — that more school choices will make public schools better. 
While research shows that in some places, charter school presence has slightly improved the performance of public schools, Nicole Carey from Arkansas Advocates for Families and Children isn’t sure the results are worth the growing price tag. 
If every student who applied for vouchers this year is funded, that will cost Arkansas $355 million — far more than the $277 million budgeted for the program.
“We’re letting in everyone even if we don’t have the specific amount of money appropriated, with the hope that every student will not use their entire amount,” Carey said.
Alabama
Since 2013, Alabama has offered tax-credit programs to parents who send their children to private schools. 
This year, however, they state has widely expanded school choice after the passage of the CHOOSE Act. Now, families of four that don’t make above $93,600 are eligible for the education savings accounts, and by 2027, all Alabama families can opt in.
The program funds the ESAs through refundable income tax credits, so it’s administered by the Department of Revenue, not the state education agency. Money is never distributed directly to parents. Giving money directly to parents created problems in Arizona, the first state to establish a universal school-choice program. Costs ballooned, and parents reportedly spent money on things such as diamond rings and lingerie. 
The tax-credit nature of the program makes it an unlikely option for Mississippi. The state is phasing out in income tax under legislation passed this year.

But Mississippi lawmakers may take note of the accountability measures built into the program, the income caps, the slow rollout and the prioritization of students with disabilities.   
Much of the money has been going to students already in private schools, but Alabama Policy Institute’s Stephanie Smith doesn’t see an issue with that. 
“Lots of private-school parents pay public-school taxes and don’t utilize the service,” she said. 
But Allison King, government relations manager at the Alabama Education Association, said tax dollars go to public education because it’s a public good.
“Public education may not always be perfect for everyone, but we don’t apply this principle to our police or fire departments or any other public service,” she said. “Like if you don’t like your police department, you don’t ask for your tax dollars to hire private security.”
King acknowledged there hasn’t been a mass exodus from public schools due to the tiered rollout of the program, but taxpayers are “certainly” subsidizing students who were already in private school, she said, and the costs are set to grow. 
“The sell, when the bill is running through the Legislature, is that we are doing this to help poor kids get out of failing schools,” she said. “When the dust settles, that’s really not the students that are benefitting at all.”
Louisiana
Louisiana has had a number of school choice programs since 2008, but last year, the Legislature approved the LA GATOR program, which creates education savings accounts across various eligibility groups. By the program’s final phase, the money will be available to all students, regardless of income. 
But the Legislature allocated far less money to the program last year than what the governor and other school-choice proponents wanted. 
It’s resulted in a self-limiting program that hasn’t been able to reach its full potential, said Erin Bendily, senior vice president of the Pelican Institute. 
Bendily said there are more than 30,000 families currently waitlisted for the program.
“The timing of this has just been incredibly frustrating and disappointing for families because they got this news in the middle of the summer, after many of them had already put deposits down,” she said. “Many people just were really counting on this. … The only other option is the public school they’re zoned to.” 
In context, that’s 30,000 students out of 700,000 in public schools, said Jan Moller, executive director of Invest in Louisiana. He suspects many of those thousands of students are already enrolled in private schools. 
Moller disagrees with the idea that there was a “broken promise” on behalf of the state Legislature. 
“This is subject to appropriation,” he said. “Everybody understood that. … To Louisiana’s credit, they saw where this was heading and put the brakes on it.”
Louisiana students using vouchers for private schools were more likely to make lower scores in the four tested subject areas than public-school students, according to research. And by the end of the voucher program’s fourth year, voucher students performed “noticeably worse” on state assessments than their counterparts. 
While Bendily acknowledged most Louisianans are educated at public schools and the important role those schools serve in their communities, there are parents who want other options for their children. 
“There’s a sense of community around your public schools, and you want your public school to be great, but we still have enormous challenges in our public education system,” she said. “We still have needs that are not being met.”
That’s a reality Mississippi lawmakers have grappled with. 
While the state’s public education system has seen great improvement in recent years — improvement that’s been nationally recognized — that doesn’t mean every parent is satisfied with the education their child is receiving.
“We believe that we can do both,” Bendily said. “While we’re making public schools better, we need to make sure that we are also giving families the options that they need.”
The math, however, doesn’t always add up.

Jim Pillen before his press conference at St. Teresa Catholic School in Lincoln on Sept. 29, 2025. (Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN – Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen, like a number of governors nationally, says he would be open to redrawing the state’s congressional maps in the middle of the decade. 
The governor said so during an Examiner interview as White House talk of Nebraska redistricting has cooled — for now.  Pillen’s embrace of the idea appears less bullish than his pushes to alter how the state awards its Electoral College votes for president.
“I’m open to all kinds of conversations,” Pillen said. “Obviously, a couple of states have done redistricting. It was done before I became governor, so that was off my radar … I’ve just not paid attention to how all that works.”
Nebraska, like other states, typically redistricts once a decade after the U.S. Census has finished providing population estimates. The Legislature is tasked with drawing congressional and legislative maps.
Pillen, like many Republican governors with swing or Democratic districts, faces White House pressure to redistrict the state’s congressional districts mid-decade to advantage the GOP in the 2026 mid-term races for the U.S. House.
While all five members of Nebraska’s federal delegation are Republican, the now-open seat contest in the Omaha area’s 2nd Congressional District could prove crucial to national Democrats, who are trying to retake control of the U.S. House. The seat is considered a possible pickup for Democrats after GOP U.S. Rep. Don Bacon retired.

After the 2020 census, the GOP-led majority in the officially nonpartisan Nebraska Legislature redrew the state’s congressional maps. It did so in a way that shored up the slight GOP lean of the 2nd District by swapping some Democratic-leaning residents in suburban Sarpy County with more reliably Republican residents of rural Saunders County. 
The Nebraska Constitution requires redistricting after each census, but the language doesn’t specify whether lawmakers can revisit the maps before the next census. Some have argued the language allows the Legislature to redistrict at different times. Others have argued any effort to redistrict mid-decade would face legal challenges.
President Donald Trump initiated the national redistricting tit for tat when he urged Texas to redraw its map, mainly to give Republicans a better chance of holding onto House control in an off-year election when the party out of power usually fares better. The Texas Legislature approved new maps this summer designed to give the GOP up to five additional House seats in the 2026 elections.

California and other Democratic-led states have since attempted to redraw their maps to counter the GOP’s gains in Texas and to potentially offset other Republican-led states that are also pursuing new maps mid-decade, including Missouri. 
Nebraska has been mentioned as one of the states likely to consider redrawing. Bacon confirmed such talk locally in August. Thirteen Nebraska state lawmakers visited the White House last month for a state leadership conference but said they didn’t hear a redistricting pitch from the Trump team. Some with knowledge of the meeting said plans changed because of media attention.
The governor’s reserved approach to redistricting — at least while the Legislature is out of session — differs from his full-court press for winner-take-all ahead of the 2024 presidential election. Pillen and Trump got personally involved, calling and lobbying lawmakers to shift the state from parceling out some electoral votes to the winner of the presidential popular vote in each congressional district to awarding all five of the state’s electoral votes to the statewide winner, which is typically a Republican.
Nebraska is one of just two states — Maine is the other — that parcel out some electoral votes by district.

Pillen at the time floated the idea of calling a special session for winner-take-all, but only if he received a “clear and public indication that 33 senators are willing to vote.” He also held an 11th-hour meeting at the Governor’s Mansion with at least two dozen GOP state senators about securing support and tried to convince holdouts to support winner-take-all. The 2024 effort died after former Democratic State Sen. Mike McDonnell of Omaha, who had joined the GOP, opposed the change.
The governor pushed again during this spring’s legislative session, despite lacking enough support from GOP state lawmakers to overcome a promised filibuster. The effort fell short.
One possible explanation for the difference in Pillen’s approach: Redistricting mid-decade appears to have less support.  GOP state lawmakers have privately questioned whether such an effort could secure 25 votes, far fewer than the 33 needed to get through a likely filibuster.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Pennsylvania officials say they have few options to prop up federally-funded food assistance programs that are expected to run out of money quickly if the federal government shutdown drags deeper into October.
The Women, Infants & Children (WIC) program could see its funding dry up as soon as this week, absent a special appropriation from the U.S. Department of Agriculture or federal budget resolution. Pennsylvania’s estimate is about two weeks before that happens, according to the state Department of Health.
Nearly 186,000 Pennsylvanians were enrolled in WIC as of July. 
WIC recipients likely wouldn’t see their benefits reduced unless the shutdown and state budget stalemate drag on – in part because they receive cash assistance in three-month increments, according to program administrators in the commonwealth.
“Today, if a client comes into our office, we’re loading three months of benefits on their card,” said Melissa Bishop, director of WIC Implementation and Development at the Family Health Council of Central Pennsylvania.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Bishop noted clients have been asking whether their cards will work at the grocery store or whether organizations like the Family Health Council still are providing a range of services. That’s in addition to money for groceries including nutrition education, breastfeeding support, health screenings, breast pumps for women, and referrals to medical providers and other social service agencies.
“We try to get ahead of it by saying we’re still open, keep your appointments and use your food benefits at the grocery store,” she said. “We just don’t want people to sit there with a benefit on their card, thinking they can’t use it when they absolutely can.”
USDA has about $150 million reserved to draw on for WIC — equivalent to a week or two for the program nationwide, according to the Food Research and Action Center, a nonprofit that advocates for eliminating hunger.
Listen to the audio recap here:

Once that funding is spent, states can use their own money for WIC and expect to be reimbursed after the shutdown. Colorado lawmakers, for example, have appropriated money to fill the gap.
But in the commonwealth, moving around funds is more difficult because the shutdown is overlapping with a state budget impasse now in its fourth month.
The program was funded at $278 million in Pennsylvania during the last fiscal year, according to the Department of Health budget.
The Pennsylvania Capital-Star asked the Health Department and Gov. Josh Shapiro’s office about short-term funding options the administration might have, such as whether declaring a public health emergency would be possible to provide flexibility to operate outside typical processes and procedures.
“In this instance, the Commonwealth does not have the ability to declare a public health emergency and pull down additional funding for WIC, nor can we utilize dollars in the rainy day fund without a General Assembly appropriation,” department spokesperson Mark O’Neill wrote in an email. “We are awaiting further direction from the USDA as it remains unclear whether services will continue without additional action at the federal level.” 
In response to questions from the Capital-Star about their contingency fund and what they’re advising states, the federal Department of Agriculture issued a statement that said, “The Democrat shutdown will cause real harm to American farmers, ranchers, and rural communities. President Trump has made it clear through his support of H.R. 5371 that he wants to keep the government open and support those who feed, fuel, and clothe the American people.”
Pennsylvania’s budget impasse has also affected the state’s ability to utilize federal passthrough money, which funds other health and nutritional assistance programs.

How long social service agencies can stay open in this funding environment will vary.
The majority of more than 100 organizations responding to a survey by the Pennsylvania Association of Nonprofits anticipated running into cashflow problems, running out of contingency funds or both by the end of October, if they haven’t already. And dozens reported planning or already having initiated layoffs, pay cuts and other staffing changes.
Clients might get referred to another office for certain services as agencies shift and share resources to get by, said Tricia Fonzi, president and chief operating officer of the Family Health Council.
During the federal shutdown in 2019, her organization – which also administers programs funded by the federal Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), the Department of Drug and Alcohol Programs and the state and federal departments of health and human services – kept its doors open.
“That’s the same playbook we’re using now until we hear otherwise. Because we really have not received any guidance,” Fonzi said.
She’s optimistic that the organization will similarly weather this storm – and that WIC money will keep flowing. At the same time, Fonzi and Bishop had been expecting an increase in enrollment in the program due to the onset of new work requirements and other rules for the Supplemental Nutrition and Assistance Program (SNAP) – which now also faces a funding crisis in the face of the federal government shutdown. 
Fonzi, O’Neil and others acknowledged the stress created by so much uncertainty.
The National WIC Association said in a press release that the timing of the shutdown, at the beginning of the fiscal year, “puts WIC at risk of rapidly running out of funds.” 
That’s because states have less money to shift around to the program.
“This failure needlessly jeopardizes the health and nutrition of millions of pregnant women, new mothers, infants, and young children who rely on WIC,” the statement said. “Failure to rapidly reopen the government could result in State WIC directors being put in the horrible position of trying to manage their programs with insufficient funds.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/snapphoto_0-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-06 06:56:13.592055

Kentuckians living with addiction can call Kentucky’s help line at 833-859-4357. Narcan, which can help reverse overdoses, is available at pharmacies for sale and through some health departments and outreach programs for free. 

Citing the need for more collaboration in the treatment of substance use disorder, 10 nonprofit organizations from around Kentucky have banded together to form the Kentucky Nonprofit Recovery Alliance. 
Launched publicly on Oct. 2, the founding members — which span from West Kentucky to Ashland — will advocate for Medicaid reforms that prioritize patient outcomes over quantity of services, as well as establish a memorandum of understanding to easily refer patients within the network for the best care. 
This will get recovery advocates out of “our organizational silos” and into a formal system of “warm handoffs and linkages into care between every step in the process,” said Jennifer Hancock, the president and CEO of Volunteers of America Mid-States and a founding board member of the new organization. 
While overdose deaths in Kentucky have declined in recent years, Kentuckians still suffer from opioid use disorder at one of the nation’s highest rates. 
As of 2022, Kentucky had 70.34 treatment beds per 100,000 people, the highest in the country, according to a study released in 2024 by East Tennessee State University’s Center for Rural Health Research. Despite that capacity to treat people, the state has high rates of addiction. 
Jennifer Hancock is the CEO of Volunteers of America Mid-States.
“That dissonance is something that we are deeply concerned about,” Hancock said. 
A national report in May showed Kentucky is one of four states where the rate of opioid use disorder is higher than 2.5% of the population aged 12 or older. The others are New Hampshire, Nevada and Massachusetts. Meanwhile, 1,410 Kentuckians died from an overdose in 2024, according to the 2024 Drug Overdose Fatality Report. In 2023, there were 1,984 overdose deaths, which was a decrease from the 2,135 lost in 2022. 
Even though deaths are down, the high rate of addiction means “the urgency has never waned” when it comes to treating it, Hancock said. 
“Even though fewer people are dying, which is something that we would celebrate, we’re not really seeing that much of an impact in overdoses,” said Abbie Gilbert, the chief policy and external affairs officer with the Kentucky Nonprofit Recovery Alliance. “We have to find other things to show that we’re helping people get healthy (and) move back into the workforce.” 
‘Volume over value’
One disconnect in resources and effective treatment, Hancock said, is the reimbursement system. 
“The current system incentivizes volume over value,” Hancock said. “Because it’s a fee-for-service model … Medicaid is paying providers to deliver a health care activity, regardless of whether or not that activity is producing positive results.” 
Hancock’s organization, Volunteers for America, has “value-based” contracts with Medicaid and its managed care organizations (MCOs), she said: “They are paying us for delivering healthy babies not born substance exposed, graduating a mom who has a living wage job and stable housing.” 
She wants to see other organizations land such contracts. The organization will also advocate for the General Assembly to require demonstrated outcomes in Medicaid contracts, she said. 
The Kentucky legislature convenes for the 2026 session on Jan. 6, but it’s “too early” to say what bills will be introduced on this, Hancock said. Coalition members are “just beginning” to have conversations about this with members of the Medicaid Oversight and Advisory Board, she said. 
“Our coalition believes that the system could be redesigned to incentivize quality outcomes, which would change the behaviors of providers in transformational ways,” Hancock said. “These are significant changes that could be positively disruptive to the system, especially during a time when Medicaid reform is at the top of every policy maker, provider and even citizen’s minds.”

(Capital-Star/Peter Hall)Pennsylvania’s vote-by-mail law has been the subject of a seemingly endless stream of court cases since casting an absentee ballot without an excuse became an option in 2020.
This year is no exception. The state Supreme Court has heard two cases scrutinizing county election officials’ handling of situations where voters made mistakes on their mail ballots. Voting rights advocates argued they shouldn’t be stripped of their constitutional right to vote as a result, while the state and national Republican parties have urged courts to enforce the rule.
In one case from Washington County, the court ruled last month that election officials violated voters’ rights by misleading them about the status of their mail-in ballots. 
And it heard oral arguments in a case from Philadelphia over whether the most common mistake – omitting the date from a ballot envelope – should result in mail ballots being disqualified.
A decision in that case almost certainly will not be made in time for next month’s election, voting rights advocates said. But election officials across the commonwealth are operating under guidance from the Department of State that the date on ballot envelopes is not a factor in determining whether they are valid.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The Philadelphia-based 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said in August writing the date on a mail-in ballot envelope is a minor burden for voters. But the impact of making a mistake or forgetting is too great, rendering it an unjustifiable infringement on the fundamental right to vote.
For the average Pennsylvanian, it’s a lot to keep track of decisions made by the state’s highest court, Commonwealth Court, county courts, federal courts, and even the U.S. Supreme Court. 
So what has changed with voting by mail since last November’s presidential election?
Most voters won’t notice any difference in the process of requesting, receiving, completing and returning their mail-in ballots, election officials and voting rights watchdogs said. 
But they can vote by mail with the confidence that if they do make mistakes, all is not lost, University of Pennsylvania political science professor Marc Meredith said. 
The Supreme Court ruled last month that county election officials must notify voters if an error results in a mail-in ballot being disqualified. That gives voters an opportunity to challenge the decision or go to their polling places on Election Day to cast provisional ballots.
Another high court decision in October 2024 affirmed that voters have the right to cast provisional ballots and have them counted when their mail-in ballots are set aside because of a mistake. In that case, it was voters neglecting to use the secrecy envelopes provided with their ballots.
“Those decisions have provided some clarity about how counties should handle ballots that come in with an incomplete affidavit or missing secrecy envelopes,” Meredith said.
The other vote-by-mail case before the commonwealth’s Supreme Court deals with the most litigated mistake that voters make: Forgetting to date or incorrectly dating the declaration on the outside of the return envelope. Courts have made at least nine different rulings that have changed the rules, but none so far has been definitive.
The Philadelphia-based U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last month that the requirement violates the U.S. Constitution’s First Amendment right to vote and the 14th Amendment right to equal treatment under the law. The GOP has asked the court to rehear the case en banc, in hopes that a larger panel of judges would reach the opposite conclusion.

In oral arguments Sept. 10 before the state Supreme Court, lawyers for the Republican Party of Pennsylvania and the Republican National Committee argued writing the date on a ballot declaration is not such a burden that it unconstitutionally interferes with the right to vote.
The GOP is appealing a Commonwealth Court decision in favor of two Philadelphia voters whose mail ballots were among 69 disqualified in a special election for a state House seat because of missing dates.
Lawyers representing Susan Kinniry and Brian Baxter argued the date requirement violates the state constitution’s guarantee of the right to vote because the date serves no purpose that justifies government interference.
“Even if this date requirement was not intended as a disenfranchisement trap, we now know that that’s what it has become,” American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania lawyer Stephen Loney said during the arguments.
Marian Schneider, formerly senior policy counsel for the ACLU of Pennsylvania, said the Supreme Court stayed the lower court’s ruling in the case last year, noting it came too soon before the election to risk confusion by changing the rules. The court is almost certain to follow the same doctrine with its decision this year.

“I can’t imagine they would change the rule so close to the election, especially when three of them are on the ballot,” Schneider said.
The ruling in the Washington County case could help reduce the number of disenfranchised voters statewide by ensuring they have a chance to vote provisionally, which Schneider noted is a requirement of the federal Help America Vote Act.
That figure was about 22,000 in the 2022 election, when gubernatorial and U.S. Senate races were on the ballot. Revisions to the design of mail-in ballots and the opportunity to fix missing or incorrect dates have reduced the number of disqualified ballots statewide to about 4,500 in last year’s election.
Washington County Commissioner Chairman Nick Sherman said he still disagrees with the state Supreme Court’s ruling on notifying voters. While the Statewide Uniform Registry of Voters automatically generates an email to voters who provide an address informing them of their ballot status, Sherman said he believes that’s at odds with the law. 
Act 77, which amended the Election Code to allow mail-in voting, allows county election workers to begin “precanvassing” or preparing ballots only at 7 a.m. on Election Day. 
“They went a step further in the last election and said we have to review the ballot,” Sherman said, adding that it adds cost and additional labor.
Chantell McCurdy, the elections office director in Butler County, said voters there shouldn’t notice any changes either. If there is a problem with a mail-in ballot, such as a missing signature, the county gives the voter the option of going to the election office to fix the mistake or going to their polling place to vote provisionally. 
Lehigh County Chief Elections Clerk Tim Benyo said the recent decision won’t change procedures in his office, which has been notifying voters of mail ballot problems for years. 
“We have adapted over time to the different court rulings but these don’t necessarily change anything for us,” Benyo said.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DSC_7466-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-10-06 05:56:53.182134

(Photo by Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star) Graham Platner, the progressive, union-backed oysterman challenging longtime Republican U.S. Sen. Susan Collins, has been making national headlines and turning out large crowds at town halls in southern and coastal Maine. But how does his candidacy fare where votes may be most consequential? 
On Saturday, Platner brought his pitch to Collins’ hometown. Hosting a town hall at the American Legion Post 15 — situated one block from the senator’s Caribou office and about a block in the other direction from a storefront of her family’s sixth-generation lumber business — Platner said, “Maine deserves better than Susan Collins.”
Leading up to Platner’s visit, when asked if they knew about him, several area residents responded, “Who?” 
But about 200 people from Caribou and surrounding towns packed his town hall, a smaller crowd than he’s been drawing elsewhere in the state but much larger than his campaign expected, leading volunteers scrambling to find more seats while some attendees stood or sat on the floor.
Gail Goodblood of Woodland, a Democrat who was once unenrolled, had no problem securing her spot an hour early, when Sweden Street, which runs through downtown, was still largely empty. Goodblood didn’t know much about Platner prior, but she liked what she saw of his stances on social media and decided to come to the town hall to learn more. 
“He appears like he’s going to be forceful and speak out and we need that so bad,” Goodblood said, before pausing to question, “As a matter of fact, what is he? I don’t even know. What is he running under?”
Drawn to his policies and persona rather than political party, Goodblood’s thinking appears to be exactly what Platner is after. 
“Everyone in Maine — Republican or Democrat, Trump supporter or progressive — when you walk around this state, you ask any working person in the state, ‘Do you think that you live in a system — a political system, an economic system — that has your best interest at heart?’ Nobody says yes to that,” Platner told the crowd. He was wearing jeans, a t-shirt and a hoodie from the latest record of the ​​American Celtic punk band Dropkick Murphys, titled “For the people.”
That exact phrase was repeated by many attendees explaining their enthusiasm for the political newcomer and military veteran. They were particularly keen on his push for Medicare for All. In a county where the health care system was already sparse, federal cuts made by the GOP have exacerbated access and affordability issues. And thousands of Mainers are anticipating higher insurance premiums, as the future of health insurance subsidies — the issue Democrats tried to leverage to avoid a government shutdown, to no avail — remains unclear.

While the turnout was sizable for a Republican-leaning town, not all attendees were set on Platner just yet. For those who are members of the Maine Democratic Party’s local chapters, it’s because of the party’s neutrality policy before the primary. But even so, many said they still want to hear from other candidates.
There are seven other Democrats, an independent and two Republicans also running, most of whom are also political novices like Platner.  
Meanwhile, Democrats in Washington, D.C., have been pressuring Maine Gov. Janet Mills to enter the race. Though she has yet to announce, she’s been touring the state more frequently in recent weeks in her capacity as governor, including making a stop in Caribou in late September for a ribbon cutting of Maine’s first Amazon delivery warehouse. 
The crowd Platner attracted was not enthused by an establishment candidate of any kind, even though many commended Mills for standing up to Trump. As Woodland put it, “We have to make a big change.” 
A movement beyond the man
While Platner is critical of the Democratic establishment, he said he has faith that the party can be turned back into one of and for working people. And despite his critiques, he does believe there are people in the Senate doing good things. 
Smoking outside after the town hall, Platner rattled off some current U.S. senators who he admires: Independent Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Democrats Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, Brian Schatz of Hawaii, Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, Ed Markey of Massachusetts. On the other side of the aisle, Josh Hawley of Missouri. 
“We don’t see eye to eye on a lot of things, but he has been fighting for stuff,” Platner said. “For instance, trying to ban stock trading. Yeah, I’m into that,” notably the opposite stance Collins has taken.
But what Platner is not interested in is being what he considers a “reform candidate.” Even the politicians he likes he doesn’t believe are thinking big enough. 
He’s pitching a return to a Democratic Party that backs major structural change. As an example, he pointed to his personal hero, Frances Perkins, a workers rights advocate who served as U.S. Secretary of Labor under President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the first woman ever to serve in a presidential cabinet. She wasn’t “looking to make little changes around the margins” or “trying to figure out how to use a tax credit here or a block grant there,” he said. Perkins, whose family had a homestead in Maine, invented something entirely new: Social Security.
While Platner often repeats that the extent of his political career before his bid for Senate was serving as harbormaster of Sullivan, he has experience when it comes to grassroots organizing, previously leading efforts through a local political group called Acadia Action along with his friend-turned-campaign-staffer Daniel Pelt of Surry.

Pelt, who quit his job as a carpenter building boats to help with Platner’s campaign, said Platner has rejected previous calls to run for local offices, but when Maine labor leaders and community activists approached his friend about challenging Collins, he saw it as an opportunity to not just become a senator but build out a structure for grassroots politics in the Pine Tree State.
He and Platner share a belief that effective resistance must come from the bottom up.
“This race, for me, is not just about beating Susan Collins. It is not just about flipping the Senate back to a Democratic side,” Platner told the crowd. “It is about building in the state of Maine an organized working class power that we have not seen in generations.”
That’s appealing to Beth Paradis of Van Buren. She first met Platner at an Aroostook County Democrats meeting when he shared his interest in running before he’d officially announced, accompanied by gubernatorial hopeful Troy Jackson, who Paradis said she used to babysit. 
“He was like a normal person,” Paradis said of Platner, comparing him to Jackson. “He knows what it’s like to be me, to live check to check, and wondering how I’m gonna get through the winter.”
Paradis said she had voted for Collins until the last time Collins was up for reelection in 2020. “Now, I think she’s totally lost her way,” she said, before adding the caveat, “We’re in a very, very heavy Collins area. I’m careful.”
A senator from The County
While those who turned out Saturday knew of Platner, the candidate hasn’t exactly broken through with Aroostook Republicans. Shane Hill of Caribou had no idea who Platner was, or any of Collins’ challengers for that matter.
Hill, the facilities maintenance manager for the Mi’kmaq Nation, explained that his party affiliation accounts for some of why he continues to support Collins. He’s business-minded, he said, and wants an elected official who promotes self-sufficiency, which he tied back to the Wabanaki Nations’ fight for tribal sovereignty. (Recognizing tribal sovereignty is a main plank of Platner’s campaign.)

While Hill said he’s generally a proponent of term limits, he believes Collins’ long tenure is ultimately beneficial because “just to have the recognition, being a little spot on the map, it helps us.”
“She is from the area, that gives her a bit of buy-in for us,” Hill said. 
It’s also a matter of understanding the way of life in The County. If Congress is voting on a measure related to heating oil, he gave as an example, those from farther south don’t personally understand the implications for many of their constituents. 
“They’ve never shoveled snow off of their roof in Caribou,” said Hill, whose neighbor happens to be Collins’ brother. Everyone knows each other, he explained. That’s true of the Mik’maq Nation but also the broader community. 
Despite being geographically large, The County has comparatively few residents as much of it is forest. And Collins’ history cannot be separated from the history of the area. 
Founded by her ancestors in 1844, Collins’ family lumber business, S.W. Collins, touts the slogan “the pioneer lumber yard.” Samuel Collins, the first in the family to come to the area, is described in archives as a “poor collector of debts,” giving credit freely to help others get their start. 
Four generations of Collins family members, including Samuel, served in the Maine Legislature, also proving staying power by being elected for multiple terms, similar to Susan Collins today. And, locally, both of Collins’ parents served as mayor of Caribou.

Will present concerns trump hometown ties? 
Hometown appeal is what led Alison Willette of Houlton to vote for Collins in the past, even though she’s been a registered Democrat since she was old enough to vote. 
Now, Willette, who grew up in Linneus, said, “I am horrified to admit that I have voted for her in the past, just trusting that she’s from The County… so she must be great and she must understand our way of life up here.” 
Before 2024, Willette described herself as a “lazy voter.” The turning point for her to get more involved in politics was Trump’s reelection, which she described as terrifying for a number of reasons, notably cuts to health care as part of Trump’s signature legislative achievement.
She knows the failures of the system intimately as a mother of three who works as a nurse at the Houlton County Jail, which is affiliated with Houlton Regional Hospital. 
In May, Houlton Regional Hospital closed its labor and delivery department. It now has no provider for obstetric care. Throughout this year, Waldo Hospital in Belfast, Mount Desert Island Hospital in Bar Harbor and Northern Light Inland Hospital in Waterville also ended all of their maternity services.
Willette’s concern, she said, is exacerbated by the fact that Northern Light Health, which essentially has a monopoly on health care in The County, and the insurance company Anthem haven’t been able to reach an agreement to keep the system’s hospitals and doctors within the insurer’s network.
Willette did not attend the town hall, but Platner echoed many of her concerns, including calling out the Northern Light and Anthem dispute when criticizing the U.S. for its poor health outcomes despite spending more on health care than other developed nations. 
“We just have what might be the most inefficient system of providing health care that you could possibly think of, and the reason we have it is because it was built to make a couple rich people even richer,” Platner said. 
Northern Light Health, Aroostook County’s leading provider of healthcare services, has a facility in Presque Isle. (By Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star).
Medicare for All is a fundamental plank of Platner’s campaign. It’s a key reason George Gartley of Presque Isle, a retired nurse who now relies on Medicare, is drawn to him. The Affordable Care Act gave Americans breathing room, he said, but it didn’t fix the system. 
“With the shutdown, they finally got some balls,” Gartley said of Democrats, “but it’s almost too little, too late.”
Friday night before the town hall, an agreement to reopen the federal government failed again, for the fourth time. Democrats are holding out support to try to get Republicans to extend the enhanced premium tax credit, the subsidies that lower the cost of health insurance for people who buy coverage through the Affordable Care Act marketplace, including tens of thousands in Maine.  
Last month, Collins, who chairs the Senate Appropriations Committee, told Maine Morning Star that she supports extending the credit but believed it should be addressed outside a must-pass spending bill. 
Turning Trump’s message on its head
In a city and county where there are more unenrolled voters than those affiliated with the Democratic Party, Platner will have to appeal to more than this already enthusiastic Democratic base, especially given Maine’s semi-open primaries.  
In 2024, Maine switched from a closed primary system — when only voters enrolled in a party can vote in that party’s primary — to one that allows unenrolled voters to vote in a party’s primary, though members of another party cannot. 
Collins will effectively clear the Republican field once she officially announces, which could lead to many unenrolled Mainers voting in the Democratic primary because it’ll be the only game in town for the U.S. Senate race.
“Depending on how many of those voters do that, that could have an impact on the outcome,” said Mark Brewer, chair of the political science department at the University of Maine. He wonders if this will encourage candidates to adjust their campaign strategy to try and talk to those unenrolled voters.










This race, for me, is not just about beating Susan Collins. It is not just about flipping the Senate back to a Democratic side. It is about building in the state of Maine an organized working class power that we have not seen in generations.


– Graham Platner, candidate for U.S. Senate


When Maine Morning Star asked Platner about his pitch to unenrolled voters, he said, “It’s the exact same.” 
“Look, at the end of the day, I don’t care if you’re an independent or Republican or Democrat in the state of Maine,” Platner said. “If you work for a living, you know for a fact that you’re getting screwed. And you know that we have a political system that is run by establishment politicians who have been screwing you. The pitch is: let’s stop doing that.”
That pitch is working for some people who have historically voted for different parties on the same ticket. 
Bill Bartlett of Danforth was raised in a Republican family and has voted for both Republicans and Democrats, though he said that was before he stopped voting for a while. That changed during the last presidential election when he voted for Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris. 
Bartlett volunteered at Platner’s town hall in Caribou, as well as one earlier Saturday in Houlton that drew about 100 people. It’s the first time he’s ever volunteered for a political campaign. 
“This is the first time I’ve heard someone worth campaigning for,” Bartlett said.
As Bartlett shared his enthusiasm for Platner, his wife Holly Gilleo was busy assigning tasks to other volunteers, often taking breaks to dance, exclaiming how energized she was by Platner’s campaign. Gilleo, a Democrat, had previously been a Republican but described herself as a “never Trumper.” 
Fueled by polarization, the country overall has seen Senate outcomes become more aligned with presidential results. However, Maine voters have bucked the trend and continued to split tickets.

Between the 2016 and 2020 Senate elections, Maine was the only state to vote for Senate and presidential candidates of opposite parties. Many Mainers’ split tickets again in 2024, when Trump won reelection. 
Many Mainers who voted for Trump told Maine Morning Star at the time that they believed he would solve their affordability concerns, such as high taxes and food prices, but also that they were just exasperated with the status quo. 
Both are appeals Platner has been relying on so far, though he’s made his opposition to Trump abundantly clear.  
While Platner’s progressive policy positions may not necessarily be appealing to a lot of Republican or unenrolled voters, Brewer said, stylistically Platner might be a better fit for those voters than an establishment candidate, whether it’s Mills or Collins.
“A relatively big part of Trump’s appeal is, and has always been, this anti-establishment outsider — ‘I’m going to stand up for the average person in a way that typical political insiders don’t,’” he said.
For that reason, some people are fans of both Trump and Sanders of Vermont, an independent and self-described democratic socialist. Sanders has endorsed Platner and joined him for a Labor Day rally in Portland in September.   
Platner made a direct comment about reaching Trump voters on Saturday, telling attendees, “We need to be there with open arms to welcome back many of our neighbors who were lied to.”
Referring to Trump supporters, he said, “They’ve been robbed of access to real information, and through that, they’ve been robbed of their empathy and their compassion.” 
He continued, “But I honestly don’t think that many of them did it willingly. I think people are misinformed. I think people are propagandized, but I don’t think people are stupid. I think at its core, people know that they’re being screwed. And Donald Trump came along with a message that that was true.”
Democrats did not have the answers to that anger, Platner said. Now he hopes everyone can get behind pointing fingers at “the oligarchy,” which he said includes Collins. 
And, placing himself firmly on the opposite side of the small elite group in power, he added, “What’s amazing to me is I’m continually told to not use that word because somehow people aren’t supposed to know what it means. And yet, every single time I use that word, everybody cheers. So, I assume we’re a bit more literate than the political class actually thinks we are.”

(Quentin Young/Colorado Newsline)The Denver mayor’s newly released 2026 budget makes one thing clear: Denver faces hard choices.
A projected $200 million deficit is forcing cuts across the city, including a reduction of about 6% in spending. Every Denverite knows that in tough times, families and businesses have to tighten their belts. But in the mayor’s scramble to balance the books, he has made a dangerous misstep that needs to be called out. Attempting to cut the independent agencies that do not answer to the mayor, especially those that keep city hall honest, is a damaging precedent.
Both Clerk and Recorder Paul López and Auditor Timothy O’Brien recently raised alarms about the mayor’s budget proposal. López warned that a reduction could translate into fewer ballot drop boxes, longer lines at polling places, and slower election results. O’Brien accused the mayor of interfering with charter-protected independence and warned that “forcing budget cuts for this office is short-sighted; it sets a dangerous precedent.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
They are right to sound the alarm. These are intentionally independent agencies so no mayor could tilt the playing field or muzzle the watchdog.
The Denver Auditor’s Office is tasked with scrutinizing city contracts, construction projects, technology systems, program performance and city spending. It is empowered to challenge whether taxpayer dollars are being used effectively and appropriately.
The clerk and recorder administers the free and fair elections that give Denver residents their most fundamental right as Americans.
When funding is reduced for either, the consequences are real. An auditor with fewer staff conducts fewer audits or is forced to cut corners, leaving waste or mismanagement unaddressed. A clerk with diminished resources may have to scale back voter access.
The office of Mayor Mike Johnston has argued that “every agency must share in the sacrifice.” That talking point reflects a deep misunderstanding of the checks and balances of government and ignores the fact that oversight is not a passive function that can be slashed or disregarded. Cutting watchdogs to close a budget gap is like balancing a family budget by canceling health insurance. You might save money in the short-term, but you face greater risks in the long-term.
The risk here is not just about a single budget proposal. It is about precedent. If a mayor can force cuts on the auditor or clerk, then every future mayor will feel entitled to do the same. Independence that voters deliberately wrote into the charter becomes meaningless if it can be undone by the budget process. The auditor needs to be able to call out mismanagement, waste, abuse and fraud without fear of reprisal. Once that boundary is blurred, it may never be restored.
None of this is to deny the reality of Denver’s fiscal challenges. Responsible government demands efficiencies and every agency should be expected to operate leanly. But that is not the same as deliberately weakening oversight or overstepping the bounds of independence. The right path is to cut redundancies, streamline processes, identify inefficiencies, and insist on smarter management.
The Denver City Council faces a critical decision. Members will have the opportunity to amend the mayor’s proposal and to weigh the short-term savings against the long-term costs. If the mayor insists on pressing ahead, it is up to City Council to defend the independence voters demanded when they created the Denver Auditor’s Office and the clerk and recorder.
Denver is right to have a conversation about fiscal responsibility, but responsibility is not achieved by silencing accountability. Families do not balance their budgets by turning off smoke alarms. Cities cannot balance theirs by stripping resources from offices that ensure our city is working for the people. We need strong, independent watchdogs. It’s non-negotiable.

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)During my recent twin pregnancy, pain and discomfort were constant companions. Early on I had three separate episodes of heavy bleeding. Certain conditions can cause bleeding, including miscarriage, something I’ve experienced four times before. 
Fortunately I was able to carry my twins for 37 weeks, but it was hard, I got sick with a fever, and there were times I wasn’t sure I’d be able to get out of bed from pain. I took acetaminophen only when my doctor said it was appropriate and only when the pain was unbearable.
That wasn’t impulsive, it was evidence-based care. Which is why the current administration’s sweeping warnings that pregnant women shouldn’t take acetaminophen are not just reckless; they’re dangerous.
Blanket pronouncements from politicians flatten nuance into fear. They don’t sit with the patient who hasn’t slept from back and pelvic pain. They don’t weigh the risks of untreated fever. They don’t field the midnight calls from women scared to swallow a tablet their own OB recommended.
I lived that fear. After years marked by miscarriage, a fatal fetal diagnosis, and the trauma of delivering a baby I knew would never cry, I have learned to ask careful, specific questions and to follow medical guidance exactly. I shouldn’t have to second-guess my doctor because a podium statement turned a routine medication into a moral toughness test.

I know what happens when politics crowds the exam room. In past pregnancies, I navigated laws that pushed care later and made every decision feel suspect. Now, a simple, clinically sound choice, taking acetaminophen for severe pain or a fever, gets recast as irresponsible. That stigma doesn’t protect anyone. It isolates patients, handcuffs clinicians, and replaces informed consent with confusion.
If leaders want to help, they can fund maternal health, expand access to obstetric care, and align public guidance with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, not undermine safe, standard treatments with sound bites. Respect for life includes respect for accurate information.
We deserve to share our struggles openly and to receive care grounded in evidence, not ideology. 
I will not apologize for following my doctor’s advice. I will not accept a politics that makes women choose between untreated pain and public shaming. 
Women are capable of making careful, informed decisions with their physicians. That is the correct chain of command in health care, patient and doctor, not politician and microphone.
We don’t have to pretend. We have trusted medicine. We have support. And we have ourselves. Being vulnerable is human. Being safe should be nonnegotiable.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/rfkjrsept222025-2048x1397-1-1024x699.jpeg,,,2025-10-06 05:56:53.182134

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)The Washington Bridge audit report cast a harsh spotlight on the state officials and transportation employees who failed to notice or remedy the highway’s deteriorating condition. 
Still in the shadows: whoever leaked a portion of the analysis on Instagram on Sept. 26, prompting Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha to publish the entire 64-page report online that night on his office’s website.
“I felt it was better for the real article to be out there than some outlet dribbling it out in dribs and drabs, creating chaos around it,” Neronha said in an unrelated press conference on Sept. 30. “It had gotten to the point where it can be manipulated when that happens. I thought, the best way to handle this is just for you to see the real article.”
Neronha identified the account, “What’s Going On In Rhode Island,” that first published an excerpt of the report. But he did not name the person or people, because there are none listed on the Instagram page, nor its corresponding website and Facebook page. Online forms offer a chance to submit news tips or propose business ads without any contact information. A 2025 business incorporation filing with the Rhode Island Department of State lists a business development service, with an office in Pawtucket, as the resident agent for the Delaware-based LLC.
Rhode Island Current contacted the account through its Instagram page and website. The Instagram page sent an automated reply, but no person followed up.  
Despite, or perhaps because of its anonymity, the social media platform has a wide reach: 232,000 followers, with several thousand likes on some posts and dozens of comments. Described as “Rhode Island life,” the account features photos of iconic local landmarks side-by-side with pets available for adoption, recently sold homes, traffic updates and short news reports.
The post that set off the audit’s release came just after 8:30 a.m. on Sept. 26. The first image shows the bridge’s graffiti-splattered underside, with headshots of Gov. Dan McKee and Rhode Island Department of Transportation Director Peter Alviti. Bold red-backed type declares “EXCLUSIVE.”
The accompanying 390-word description promises to share parts of the forensic report over the next few weeks before releasing the entire document.
“No other media outlet in RI has access to the report,” the post stated. 
A Sept. 26 post on the What’s Going in Rhode Island Instagram account was the first leak of the now-public Washington Bridge audit report. (Screenshot)
Exclusive? Maybe not.
That same day, reporters at WPRI-TV 12 were working feverishly to authenticate the document, which had been leaked to the station separately. WPRI posted a full story, outlining the findings report and including comments from McKee and other state officials, at 6:39 p.m.
Neronha published the entire document moments earlier, despite his belief that the findings should have been kept private because it’s part of the state’s lawsuit against various contractors who worked on the bridge. 
The complaint seeking damages for the state’s losses from the bridge closure is tentatively scheduled to go to trial in late 2027.
“You don’t try your case in the press,” Neronha said. “We’re not going to put 30,000 pages of discovery up on a website for uninvolved experts to opine on, so when it’s time to pick a jury we can’t find anybody who can sit on it. There’s too much at stake here.”










We’re not going to put 30,000 pages of discovery up on a website for uninvolved experts to opine on, so when it’s time to pick a jury we can’t find anybody who can sit on it. There’s too much at stake here. 


– Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha


That’s the same explanation McKee and Alviti have shared when asked why the state held on to the highly-anticipated document for more than a year after its completion.
Amid outrage over the bridge’s closure, McKee repeatedly promised a “day of reckoning,” which included unveiling the findings of the state-commissioned forensic audit. He stopped publicly referencing the report soon after the Virginia-based consulting firm finished the April 2024 draft.  
But news outlets continued to pester the state about the highly-anticipated analysis, which documents nearly two decades of inspections and repairs to the cantilever bridge — including multiple warnings about its worsening condition that went ignored.
The report doesn’t call out McKee, Alviti, or other state officials by name, though it makes clear that a host of longstanding problems with the cantilever bridge demanded attention.
“Many of the issues highlighted in this report show that program managers, bridge inspectors, and designers should have and could have been aware of problems that were developing,” the report states.

The blame game 
The expose prompted swift and mounting criticism against McKee and Alviti, both for the negligence on the bridge, and in keeping an unflattering depiction of their leadership veiled from public view. 
Among the critics is the person or people behind “What’s going on in Rhode Island,” which often uses its platform to suggest duplicitous or manipulative behavior on the part of state officials.
Take, for example, a July 25 post. It begins with a straightforward recap of the widely reported news that the state amended its contract for the bridge demolition to expand the scope of work — with an extra $38.4 million cost. Then, it shifts to a series of questions:

“Will the demo change order actually cost $38.4 million, or is the real cost closer to $10 million, leaving a potential $28.4 million windfall for the contractor?” 


“How much of this $38.4 million change order will find its way back into the pockets of the people that awarded the work, or obtained the grants? 


“What else could we spend this money on to improve our infrastructure?”

There is no evidence cited to back up this line of questioning.
Similarly, the Sept. 26 post about the audit report draws upon four select pages about bridge inspections, along with 2019 concept drawings for a bridge replacement, to pose a series of questions implicating RIDOT and its contractors in the bridge’s degradation.

“Why did RIDOT want to replace the bridge in 2019?” 


“Was VHB legally bound to inform the Barletta/Aetna Joint venture that they had done this work prior to joining them on the phase 2 work?” 


“Who paid AECOM to lie for the state?” 

It ends with a tease of what’s to come.
“We dig deeper next week into this politically motivated cash-cow of a bridge.”
While the full report is now available online — and widely reported by news outlets statewide — the Instagram account continues to post “exclusives” about the findings, including a series of emails between the audit report’s authors posted to its website on Friday. 
In the same post, the account also defended its publishing of the materials, noting that the firm hired to audit the bridge was never classified as an expert witness in the state’s case against the contractors.
“AG Peter Neronha is a smart man. He knows what he is doing. He paved the way for the WJE report to be leaked, then quickly added it to his page as soon as it was. Why? The timing wasn’t great for potential political opponents, so….”
Neronha denied that he or his team were involved in the leak during a Sept. 30 interview with WPRO’s Gene Valicenti.
The post continues by criticizing “investigative journalists,” who it claims choose not to run stories because of ties to the state government. A previous post, published Oct. 1, also alleges that local media in Rhode Island get paid by the state government, creating leverage for government officials to kill unflattering stories about them by threatening to pull state funding to their outlets.
This is not correct.

Drawing a line 
Traditional journalism and anonymous, social media-based content are different — most importantly in the process that leads up to publishing a story or piece of content. 
“If a legitimate news outlet is going to get this document, they’re going to vet it to find out if it’s genuine,” said Dan Kennedy, a journalism professor at Northeastern University and national media commentator. “They’re going to give government officials a chance to comment, and give them a chance to make their case that ‘you shouldn’t report this.’ It’s the ethical thing to do.”
Tim White, Target 12 investigative reporter and managing editor, offered a glimpse of what happened in his newsroom after it obtained the leaked audit report during a Sept. 30 panel event hosted by The Boston Globe’s Rhode Map. While the document sent to the station looked official, White and his coworkers did not want to publish it without confirmation that it was the real thing.
“If your mother says she loves you, check it out,” White said, referring to the beloved adage among reporters on the importance of confirmation.










If a legitimate news outlet is going to get this document, they're going to vet it to find out if it’s genuine.


– Dan Kennedy, a journalism professor at Northeastern University and national media commentator


The What’s Going On in Rhode Island account did not explain how it got the report, or whether it first sought to verify its authenticity. The first time Neronha was asked to confirm if the leaked document was real was when White called him that afternoon, he said.
The Target 12 story, and subsequent articles by other mainstream news outlets, including Rhode Island Current, feature comments from McKee, and related state officials. What’s Going On in Rhode Island does not indicate in any of its posts that it asked for comment from any state officials or outside experts.
Still, that doesn’t diminish its value in Kennedy’s eyes.
“This anonymous account performed a service in getting this information out there,” he said. 
The source not being a traditional journalist or news publication was far less important than the content it provided, and prompted in turn from state officials, he said.
First Amendment protections
While Neronha has made clear he’s not happy that the information was forced out, he acknowledged the leaker didn’t violate court rules.
“If anyone bears the risk here, it’s me,” Neronha said during his appearance on WPRO. “I am the one who put it on our website.”
Indeed, there’s a deep and strong history of constitutional protections for anonymous speech that would make it difficult to sanction the Instagram account, said Justin Silverman, executive director for the New England First Amendment Coalition. 
Like Kennedy, Silverman was glad to have the information made public despite state officials’ insistence that it compromised the legal case.
“Generally, those in government are often arguing that there are documents that shouldn’t be released,” Silverman said. “That doesn’t necessarily make it true.” 
However, Silverman added that who publishes the information — and more importantly, the motives in doing so — still matters.
“One of the benefits of having that information come from a newsroom is that if the information turns out to be false, we know who to hold accountable,” Silverman said.
Neronha told Valicenti that he thinks he knows who’s behind the Instagram account, which his team has been “monitoring” for over a year.
“But I don’t spend too much time worrying about it,” Neronha said.

Amanda Batten are squaring off in a high-stakes rematch for Virginia’s House District 71. (Photos courtesy of campaigns)In Virginia’s House District 71, Democrat Jessica Anderson and Republican Del. Amanda Batten are back for a rematch that was decided by just 667 votes in 2023. With control of the House in play, the stakes — and the spending — are markedly higher this fall.
Redistricting turned the district into one of Virginia’s truest swing seats, combining historic Williamsburg, established neighborhoods in James City County, and the fast-growing suburbs of New Kent. The mix of a university town, suburban bedroom communities, and booming exurbs has reshaped both the politics and commuter patterns of the Peninsula’s western edge, making the district a priority for both parties.
The contrasts across the district drive its competitiveness: New Kent is now one of Virginia’s fastest-growing localities, Williamsburg’s economy is powered by the College of William & Mary and Colonial Williamsburg, and James City sits in between, balancing suburban growth and long-time residents. Those cross-pressures have fueled debates over housing costs, school capacity, wages in a tourism-heavy economy and traffic along I-64 — all issues central to this year’s campaign.
Politically, 2023 underscored just how narrow the margins are here. Batten finished with 50.9% to Anderson’s 49.1%, a districtwide spread of 18,152 to 17,485. It was one of the closest House races in the state — and a clear signal that modest swings in Williamsburg turnout or New Kent persuasion can flip the seat.
The cash chase reflects the district’s importance. According to data from the Virginia Public Access Project, Anderson has raised $741,837 so far in the 2025 cycle, compared with Batten’s $443,718 — a reversal of 2023, when Anderson was outspent two to one. Statewide coverage has repeatedly listed House District 71 among the key races likely to shape the House majority this fall.
Early voting has also fueled the “tipping-point” narrative. Republican-leaning districts jumped out to an initial turnout edge, while competitive seats like House District-71 are being watched daily for movement as absentee and in-person totals update. 
Since last year, Batten has helped organize an informal “Purple Caucus” of Republicans in swing districts, part message shop and part defensive line for incumbents on competitive turf. Anderson, meanwhile, has leveraged name ID from 2023 and a larger volunteer corps to scale up paid communication she largely lacked last time.
 Jessica Anderson

The Democratic nominee casts herself as a grounded candidate rooted in the experience of her district. A lifelong Virginian and longtime Williamsburg/James City County resident, Anderson has worked in the front office of a local elementary school while raising two daughters. She says those roles — as parent, neighbor and community member — shape how voters see her.
“People know me outside of a political hat, and they know my heart,” she said in a recent interview with The Mercury. “There is this concept that I don’t know the issues, and once people meet me and really hear me articulate it, they realize real fast that what they’ve heard is wrong.”
Anderson’s story often returns to her experience of divorce in 2014, losing health coverage and relying on Medicaid and SNAP benefits. “That was life-saving,” she said, “but the programs aren’t set up to really help you be successful.” She emphasized that experience informs her focus on health care affordability and protecting Medicaid.
In 2023, Anderson mounted what she calls a “very grassroots campaign,” knocking on more than 6,000 doors but running without TV or digital ads. This time, she says, the caucus is investing in her race, her own fundraising has surged, and volunteers are plentiful. “We are on TV, we are on digital, we are in mailboxes,” she said.
Education is central to Anderson’s platform. She argues the state’s funding formula is outdated, pushing for reforms that would add early childhood education for 3- and 4-year-olds, expand pre-K, and strengthen incentives for teacher pay and retention. She noted Williamsburg/James City County already has infrastructure through its Bright Beginnings program that could be scaled up.
Anderson also highlighted challenges in K-12 transportation, citing her own daughter’s 0.7-mile walk to a bus stop. “That’s unacceptable,” she said, urging the state to lift support caps and raise pay for bus drivers and other support staff.
In the district’s tourism-heavy economy, Anderson supports raising the minimum wage to $15 statewide, but notes that in parts of Virginia, even $20 to $23 an hour may be necessary. She wants to ensure small businesses have a seat at the table while also arguing that “raising the tide” helps all.
On housing, she advocates for first-time homebuyer grants, incentives for retirees to downsize, and revitalization of vacant properties. She also calls for regulatory tweaks to expand supply. On infrastructure, she emphasized accountability in the I-64 widening project and closer cooperation with VDOT.
Anderson pledges to protect reproductive rights, supporting Newport News Democratic Del. Cia Price’s contraception bills and a constitutional amendment to enshrine abortion access. “Any delegate that votes against any of these constitutional amendments is telling on themselves, because they don’t trust voters,” she said.
Anderson also supports universal background checks and stronger safe-storage laws for firearms, citing the 2023 case in Newport News where a 6-year-old shot his teacher. 
“Accessibility to firearms should be protected in state law, but we should have the highest penalty for families or guardians who do not maintain that,” she said.
If elected, Anderson said her first bill would be to expand early childhood education funding, ideally with bipartisan support. 
Her turnout strategy, she said, is to energize Williamsburg’s Democratic base, persuade voters in New Kent, and win swing precincts in James City. Early voting, she added, has the bonus of “removing yourself from being inundated by the campaigns at large.”
 Amanda Batten

Amanda Batten has represented the area since 2019 and is seeking her third full term. A James City County resident, she previously served as a legislative aide before winning election. She is now chair of the House Republican Caucus, a role she says sharpens her understanding of bills while allowing colleagues to rely on her for policy briefings.
“As far as signature accomplishments, frankly, a lot of it has to do with my role in leadership,” she told The Mercury in a recent interview. “I read every bill that goes up on the floor, I listen to what my constituents are asking for, and I carry those bills.” Recently, that has included a proposal to reform foster care placement and bills for law enforcement.
Batten emphasized that her leadership role in her caucus and her representation of her district are distinct. “I represent my constituents, and there’s a period at the end of that sentence,” she said. “We don’t take caucus positions … every member is free to vote independently.”
Batten highlighted New Kent’s rapid growth and said her experience in James City allows her to advise constituents on how to prepare. On housing, she supports reducing regulatory costs she said add about 25% to home prices and favors leaving zoning to localities. She opposes limits on investor home purchases, saying it’s not a concern that’s raised locally.
On transportation, she noted progress on I-64 widening and expects it to remain a state priority, rejecting tolls as an option. She also points to the upcoming 250th anniversary celebration as a tourism driver and touted her relationships with William & Mary leadership.
Batten favors economic incentives and site readiness to attract private-sector jobs, citing the AutoZone distribution center in New Kent as a success. 
On data centers, she anticipates the state will need to regulate energy and water use but encourages innovative power sourcing.
Batten supports public access to curriculum and library content and backs education savings accounts with guardrails, while opposing full vouchers. 
On abortion, she opposes the constitutional amendment as written, saying it could override parental notification and allow late-term abortions without sufficient limits. She supports exceptions for rape, incest, life of the mother and viability.
On gun policy, she defended the Second Amendment and said current background checks are adequate, though she wants stronger prosecution of misuse. 
On resilience, she warns against over-development in flood-prone areas and recommends leaving most land-use decisions local.
She said much of her funding comes from the party and national GOP organizations and favors transparency over contribution caps. If re-elected, she plans to reintroduce foster care reform bills.
Batten’s pitch is straightforward: “I have the experience of advocating successfully for legislation that benefits our district. It’s my home, and I’m very connected to my constituents.”

Still, one division is actively disputing the charge.
The Essex, Northumberland and Loudoun county school divisions’ misuse of federal money for special needs students became widely known after the Virginia Department of Education (VDOE) investigated Loudoun County Public Schools in May. 
VDOE later confirmed to the Mercury that school divisions in the Essex and Northumberland counties had also been found in violation of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. This law requires school divisions to meet a Maintenance of Effort (MOE) obligation, which stipulates that spending on children with disabilities fueled by local or state funds not dip below the level of the preceding fiscal year. 
Essex, required to pay around $450,000, is disputing the agency’s claim, asserting that the shortfall calculation was substantially misreported due to a terminated employee’s error, a letter from the division’s attorney states. The division is currently conducting a forensic audit, but in the meantime, has requested that payment be held in escrow pending review and reconsideration of the division’s request.
 Essex schools responds, VSP investigation in Northumberland, Loudoun also navigating federal challenges

VDOE, in a letter to Essex, stated that it did not qualify for an allowable exception because the division was informed that it had previously received technical assistance, and if it had not met the MOE compliance, it would be required to repay the funds.
“Essex County Public Schools has paid its Maintenance of Effort penalty in protest, and is very hopeful that the Virginia Department of Education will either grant us an allowable exception or support our request for review of the penalty to the U.S. Department of Education,” said Scott Croxton, chairman of the Essex County School Board.
He later told the Mercury that the school division “doesn’t want to be on any list that implies that we’re not properly educating our special education population, because that’s just not true.” 
Loudoun, the largest of the three, was hit with the most significant bill of $28,997,133. Essex, with $451,036, and Northumberland, billed $243,607.80, represent a fraction of the size of Loudoun’s enrollment.
A VDOE spokesperson stated that the agency had not received any direct appeals or hearing requests from the three school divisions. The department would be responsible for considering any such case.
However, Essex’s attorney wrote in a letter to the agency that the division is submitting the payment “under protest” and not admitting liability to begin the process of requesting a review through the USDOE’s General Education Provisions Act hearing process with the assistance of VDOE. 
Croxton said VDOE was made aware that Essex lost five personnel through termination or departure who directly impacted the division’s special education program. The division said it also let the department know it has initiated an ongoing forensic audit in coordination with the Virginia State Police to investigate financial irregularities, including issues that may have affected special education spending and compromised the integrity and accuracy of the MOE data submitted. 
“Despite these challenges, ECPS has an exceptional leadership team and instructional staff in place, and tremendous achievement gains are being made,” Croxton said. “We firmly believe that our transition to a County-School Centralized Services model for financial and human resources functions will be a key component for improved fiscal oversight and stewardship of taxpayer dollars.”
Northumberland’s case comes as the Virginia State Police Bureau of Criminal Investigation and Office of the Northumberland County Commonwealth’s Attorney conduct an “inquiry,” or preliminary review gathering and assessing information to determine if further action is warranted, according to Jessica Shehan, a VSP spokesperson.
In Loudoun, the school board agreed to repay its funds after reports revealed an accounting mistake that led to some of the funding being used for English Learner (EL) programs. 
“Historical support of special education services has not been impacted nor will current and future special education services be impacted,” said Sharon Willoughby, LCPS chief financial officer, in a presentation to the school board at an Aug. 12 meeting, adding that spending on special education students continues year-over-year.
Willoughby said last spring was the first time VDOE conducted an in-person fiscal compliance review. The division was also surprised, given its years of successful compliance submissions to VDOE. 
“I don’t know what the catalyst of that was, but that’s what started this whole process,” Willoughby said at the business meeting. 
The repayment case has also raised concerns among school board members amid warnings the division could lose other federal funding after the U.S. Department of Education determined LCPS violated Title IX and retaliated against male students. That determination came after three male students expressed they felt “uncomfortable” when a student, who identified as male but was assigned female at birth, changed clothes in a boys’ locker room and recorded the event.
Loudoun, along with five other school divisions in Northern Virginia, is also being targeted for its transgender policies. School divisions in Alexandria, Arlington, Fairfax, and Prince William have also faced scrutiny.
The Mercury contacted Loudoun and Northumberland for comment, but they did not respond.

(Photo by Charles Paullin/Inside Climate News)RICHMOND, Va.—You might think the state that is the undisputed epicenter of global internet traffic has a leg up on managing the challenges of the artificial intelligence arms race.
So far, it’s not working out that way.
Nationwide, that push by Silicon Valley is gobbling up energy, increasing average customers’ electricity bills and threatening progress on decarbonization. In Virginia, data-center developers warned the utility Dominion Energy at the end of last year that their upcoming projects would need 40 gigawatts of electricity—the energy equivalent of increasing Virginia’s households nearly fourfold.
Dominion plans to respond by building more natural gas power plants, which could raise utility bills for households and businesses both here and beyond the Mid-Atlantic state.
Virginia’s legislators certainly took notice. At least 33 unique bills were introduced in the last session to address various data-center dilemmas, an Inside Climate News analysis found.
“We are practically providing data centers for the entire world and I don’t want that cost to be borne by ratepayers in my district,” said state Del. Shelly Simonds, a Democrat representing the port city of Newport News.
But almost all of the bills ran aground, meeting cumulative resistance from tech businesses, local governments, labor unions and Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin.
Of the four that made it into law, only two were more than a symbolic measure.
The data-center growth spurt was already putting pressure on the state’s power supplies before this year. Virginia overtook California, the most populous state, in 2023 to emerge as the top importer of electricity, driven by rapid growth in commercial power consumption.
That means the impact of Virginia’s data-center decisions extends to the wider region. It shares an interconnected grid with much of the Mid-Atlantic, and that grid’s operator is increasingly under pressure from state governors as costs spike.
“Virginia cannot produce the amount of power needed for the data centers, so we’re going to have to pipe in power from neighboring states. And if Maryland is enhancing its grid and building infrastructure, then odds are Marylanders are going to be paying for that when the power is coming here,” said Del. Ian Lovejoy, who sponsored four data-center bills last session, none of which passed.
The skyrocketing power demand is also creating hurdles for the state’s ambitions to completely wean its two largest electric utilities off planet-warming fossil fuels in the next few decades. Many data centers also have on-site diesel generators that are meant for backup power but are being run more frequently, worsening air quality and prompting noise complaints from residents.
As a result, “the rapid growth of data centers [has] surpassed all environmental issues in Virginia practically, so it’s something that demands our attention,” Simonds said.
But the failure last session of nearly all 33 bills on the subject, most without even getting a hearing, underscores the challenge of legislating on data centers in a state home to the greatest number of them.
 Legislative roadblocks

The most ambitious of the five data-center bills that the Virginia General Assembly passed was vetoed by Youngkin.
That bill would have required jurisdictions considering a data-center proposal to mandate a noise study if the site is close to homes and schools, and to review with the local utility any electric substation upgrades that would be needed.
The majority of bills, 22, never even made it out of committee. That’s the stage where a bill must get approval from a smaller group of legislators before it advances to the full chamber.

Some of the bills had bipartisan backing. But interviews with a dozen state lawmakers pointed to a range of hurdles—chief among them a muscular lobbying effort by tech companies as well as the fraught politics of treading on the decision-making domain of local officials.
Nineteen of the 33 bills were primarily sponsored by Democrats, while Republicans were the primary sponsors of the other 14. Geography, rather than politics, helps explain who pushed for change.
“In areas that are affected most egregiously by overdevelopment of data centers, you have bipartisan support for regulation,” said Lovejoy. The Republican’s district covers part of Prince William County where a local rezoning fight is unfolding over an upcoming 1,700-acre data center corridor.
“It’s when you move away from the blast zone of the impact of the data centers, people become less concerned,” Lovejoy said.
The legislative proposals covered a variety of issues: improving transparency, reforming tax incentives, protecting ratepayers, increasing state oversight and overhauling data-center siting and zoning.
Two bills that would have required data centers to disclose their often-massive water and power usage died in committee. Another seven bills that sought to change the tax incentives for data centers—some by requiring clean energy use, higher energy-efficiency or wage minimums—also all died in committee.
A handful of bills sought to explicitly protect ratepayers from bearing the costs of infrastructure that will be built to accommodate data-center growth. Under the current system, everyone pays. Two of those measures got merged, and variants passed in the House and the Senate. But the chambers could not resolve the differences.
One ratepayer-protection measure did make it into law, and it’s a meaningful change—but only for the roughly 700,000 customers served by the state’s nonprofit electric co-operatives, a fraction of the total customer base in Virginia. The new law creates a path for the co-ops to create an affiliate to serve large electricity users in order to reduce their impact on average ratepayers.
Of three bills attempting to increase state oversight, one became law—after an amendment wiped out nearly all the extra oversight it would have brought.
The original version would have required electric utilities to create a separate classification for data-center customers. The enacted version requires the state utility regulator to exercise authority it already has: to determine whether existing customer classifications are reasonable when considering rate increase requests from Dominion or Appalachian Power Co., the state’s biggest electric utilities.
Dominion now has a rate case before that regulator, the State Corporation Commission, with the powerful utility and big tech companies squabbling over what fair rates for data centers should be.
“The issue is none of this stuff has enough teeth,” said Del. Michelle Maldonado, a Prince William County Democrat who voted for the weakened bill and had sponsored one of her own that stalled. “What ultimately got passed was a significantly watered-down version.”

Del. Irene Shin, a Fairfax County Democrat, proposed the bill about the State Corporation Commission. She thinks the law it became sends “a clear signal to the SCC with what the General Assembly wants them to do.”
Those wants include “safeguards that protect ratepayers like your normal, average Virginia family, and prioritize their protections over what the big corporations need,” Shin said, “because we’re talking about billion-dollar corporations, multi-billion-dollar corporations that can absolutely afford to pay the cost of getting the energy that they need.”
Her region is taking a hit from the Trump administration’s big cutbacks to federal employment, and she’s worried about further economic consequences to residents from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Adding the proposed increase to Dominion customers of about $20 every month for typical households starting next year, she said, is “insane.”
Del. David Reid, a Democrat who represents part of Loudoun County, sponsored two of the four data-center bills that made it to the finish line.
The first offers an incentive for large electricity users to install battery storage.
He also sponsored legislation to build transmission lines with advanced conductor technology to deliver power more efficiently. What ultimately made it into law was diluted from a requirement to a suggestion: to “consider the prudency of using advanced conductors.”
“I was probably trying to accomplish much more in the earlier version, and then you get to the point where it’s like, OK, we can all agree to this this year,” Reid said, pointing to varying perspectives that crop up during the session. “The process works. It’s just that sometimes, in Virginia, it doesn’t work very fast.”
Over a dozen bills, more than for any other data-center issue, would have changed how localities handle siting and zoning for the facilities. None of them made it through.
One was vetoed. Another was voted down by the Senate. Two were turned down in committee, and the rest languished and expired without making it even that far.
The bill vetoed by Youngkin, which would have required a noise study and information about substation needs from data centers, had been more ambitious in an earlier iteration. Initially, the measure would have required details on the electricity generation within a locality that would serve any proposed data centers.
“The bill that we started with, that I wanted, does not look very much like the one that passed,” said Del. Josh Thomas, a Democrat representing parts of Prince William County, who sponsored the measure in the House.
In his explanation for vetoing it, Youngkin said the bill “limits local discretion and creates unnecessary red tape” and warned it “could chill investment and hinder economic development.”
“Do we need to make sure that citizen voices are heard? Yes,” the governor said afterward at an event announcing a $9 billion investment from Google. “Do we need to make sure that local leaders are empowered to make decisions about where they go? Yes. Should that be decided in Richmond? Absolutely not.”

Thomas said his constituents are frustrated about seemingly inexplicable siting decisions being made locally, and they wanted state intervention.
“The current Republican administration in Virginia has made it very clear that they are unabashedly and, at times, irrationally pro-data center,” Thomas said. “Why we would continuously build industrial sites that have diesel generators on top by schools is beyond me but yet the industry keeps pushing to have that happen.”
 Following the money

The downfall of data-center legislation in Virginia speaks, in more ways than one, to the role of money in politics, advocates and state lawmakers told Inside Climate News. The state is among the minority of states that set no contribution limits on campaign finance.
“Nobody’s immune to taking a lot of money,” said Ashish Kapoor, senior energy and climate advisor with the Piedmont Environmental Council, an advocacy group.
Dominion, which opposed two of the data-center bills, is the top political donor in the state. The company contributed more than $13 million to both parties from 2024 through Aug. 31, according to data from the Virginia Public Access Project. Powerful Silicon Valley giants have also poured money into the state in recent years, through the Data Center Coalition—which testified against many of the 33 bills—and associated political action committees.
The Data Center Coalition and Dominion Energy did not respond to requests for comment.
“Anything that makes it more difficult to lubricate the wheels of commerce from data-center development that people are making a lot of money off of is going to be met with the typical sorts of issues in subcommittees where some of these bills go to die,” Kapoor said.
Another source of pressure: localities that reap the financial benefits of this data-center growth.
“We essentially have inadvertently created a monstrous money-making machine for local governments,” said Simonds, the Newport News delegate. “A huge number of cities and localities across Virginia are lining up to have a data center because of the tax revenue.”
Loudoun County, for instance, collected $733 million, almost a third of its total tax revenue, from data centers in the 2023 fiscal year. That kind of revenue allows local governments to avoid taking the unpopular step of raising real estate taxes.
“There’s a lot of folks in rural parts of the state, we’re all for data centers,” said Del. Terry Kilgore, the Republican House minority leader representing parts of several counties in Southwest Virginia, an area that has struggled to recover from the downturn of coal.
The political cost for state lawmakers to be seen as stepping on the authority of localities is especially high during a big election year. Virginia, with a Democratically controlled Senate not up for election until 2027, will vote on a new governor and all 100 House of Delegate members in November.
“The General Assembly doesn’t like to get involved in local siting issues because they don’t want to open that can of worms, so to speak,” said Lovejoy, the Prince William County delegate.
The result is an uncoordinated system in which local decisions about data centers create fallout for the power grid that will affect everyone’s pocketbook if the state doesn’t intervene.
“It’s like an orchestra where you’ve got certain instruments playing loud and unwieldy and then you’ve got other areas where they’re not playing at all,” Simonds said. “We need somebody to be the conductor of this orchestra.”
There’s also an unlikely political alliance at play.
“You have businesses and unions agreeing on something. And that doesn’t happen that often. But it’s happening over data centers,” Lovejoy said.
The support of organized labor is largely coming from the construction trades and electrical workers’ unions. In Virginia, data centers support an estimated 74,000 jobs and generate $5.5 billion in labor income, according to a study by the state’s Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission.
Most of these jobs, however, don’t last beyond the construction stage. And “there are other unions that might be really concerned with what’s going on,” said Kasia Tarczynska, senior research analyst at Good Jobs First, a policy group that seeks to hold companies and governments accountable on economic growth.
“For example, public sector unions might be concerned that the states are losing revenue and there’s less money” to hire teachers and firefighters, she said. Virginia forgoes close to $1 billion in yearly revenue over its tax exemptions to attract data centers.
The Virginia Economic Development Partnership contended there’s a 14 percent average annual local and state tax return on the exemption incentive for the years 2022 through 2027. But there’s spirited debate across the country about whether states dangling incentives would get this development either way. And that return on investment figure doesn’t account for the extra power costs.
Economic overdependence on data centers might also prompt companies with job-intensive investments to look elsewhere with more available power supplies, Tarczynska added.
 Climate and costs

The huge increase in expected demand for power is throwing a wrench in the state’s progress toward fulfilling its legal mandate of using 100 percent carbon-free electricity by 2050. The General Assembly set that target in the Virginia Clean Economy Act of 2020.
“You can’t have your cake and eat it too,” said Sen. Russet Perry, a Democrat whose district encompasses parts of Loudoun and Fauquier counties. “You can’t continue to not regulate and to sign off on these massive data centers, each one of which often requires more power than your average city, and simultaneously say, ‘OK, we’re going to get to 100 percent clean energy on this deadline.’”

Del. Rip Sullivan, a Fairfax County Democrat, was the primary sponsor of that clean-energy law in the House. He thinks all is not lost.
“I’m not blind to the fact that it makes the road steeper, makes the challenge harder,” he said. But “if we were to put as much energy—pardon the pun—political energy into accelerating the Clean Economy Act as some opponents that you see are putting into trying to kill it, if we put all that energy into trying to improve it and meet those goals, I have every confidence we could meet them.”
One of his bills this year, which made it through the legislature but was vetoed by the governor, would have set targets for how much energy storage capacity utilities must build or buy in the next couple of decades. If enacted, it would have been a market signal for energy storage companies to come to Virginia, he said.
Ratings from the regional grid operator show solar’s effective load carrying capacity, its ability to produce energy when it’s most needed, is as low as 33 percent without storage but as high as 75 percent when paired with it.
Asked for his views on battery storage, Youngkin cited the costs of the technology, supply chains dominated by China and “great alternatives” that are available.
“If people want to invest in battery storage, God bless them. All of the above—we need everything. But to mandate what the answer is based on misinformed facts, I firmly believe is a mistake,” Youngkin said.
Meanwhile, the way that electricity rates are set by utilities and approved by state regulators is putting a disproportionate burden on households and businesses.
“We are effectively seeing customers across the Mid-Atlantic subsidizing the electrical infrastructure that’s needed for Northern Virginia’s data centers,” said Cathy Kunkel, a North America energy consultant with the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, a  global think tank with a mission to accelerate the energy transition.
Multiple state lawmakers spoke of their constituents’ electric bills while explaining their motivations for sponsoring data-center legislation.
“You have certain counties getting rich and then in other places, like my city of Newport News, I have constituents hopping mad about their energy bills going up,” Simonds said.
Thomas, the Prince William County delegate, was also concerned about declining property values. “Residents who were living in an area first, and then a data center was built later, had pretty much lost their largest wealth-building tool, which is their home value that’s plummeted because now there’s an industrial building a hundred feet from their back deck,” he said.
Legislators hoping to raise oversight to shield their constituents aren’t giving up. Sen. Danica Roem, a Prince William County Democrat, said her work for the next session can begin with the 13 Senate members who voted for a water-protection bill introduced by Sen. Richard Stuart, a Republican who represents parts of the Middle Peninsula northeast of Richmond. They just need eight more votes to get the bill out of the Senate.
“I need to bring in four more Democrats. Richard needs to bring four more Republicans,” Roem said.
House Speaker Don Scott (D-Portsmouth) and Senate Democrat majority leadership did not respond to requests for comment.
Ultimately, voters can influence what happens next.
“The pushback has to come from the ground and it has to come from the people,” Piedmont Environmental Council’s Kapoor said. “The more these legislators, whether they’re rural or urban, feel the pushback from their constituents, those [proposed bills] will have increasing resonance.”
From Sullivan’s perspective, it’s not too late for Virginia to chart a nation-leading course that avoids sticking residents with the tab for data centers, from their electric bills to the climate consequences.
“This is an immense challenge, and it is going to take a concerted effort to meet that challenge,” he said, “but the difficulty of the challenge should only embolden us rather than cause us to give up.”

Joro spider. Carly Mirabile, University of Georgia, Bugwood.org On top of everything else that’s going on, now Georgia is being invaded by giant spiders.
If you live in north Georgia, there’s a good chance you’ve come face to cephalothorax with the Joro spider in the last few years. The behemoth black and yellow arachnids hitched a ride to Georgia from East Asia around 2014 and have been growing in population ever since – last year’s count from the University of Georgia’s Center for Invasive Species and Ecosystem Health turned up more than 2,200 spiders, up from around 1,900 the year before.
Joro spider distribution in the South. EDDMapS. 2025. Early Detection & Distribution Mapping System. The University of Georgia – Center for Invasive Species and Ecosystem Health. Available online at http://www.eddmaps.org/; last accessed October 2, 2025.
The actual population is likely much higher. Female Joros, whose leg span can exceed three inches, lay up to 500 eggs at a time starting in mid-October.
The eight-legged critter’s bite poses no danger to people or pets, and they are inclined to flee rather than fight when disturbed, though that’s likely cold comfort to anyone unlucky enough to wander face-first into their thick, sticky webs on a dark front porch or forest trail.
The little pests also don’t appear to pose any threat to Georgia crops or to its ecosystem, but the keyword is appear, said Rebekah Wallace with UGA’s Center for Invasive Species and Ecosystem Health.
“We don’t know that at this time. They’re still being researched,” she said.
With some invasive species like the honeybee-killing yellow-legged hornet, researchers know ahead of time that they are bad news.
“With Joro spiders, it wasn’t on the radar for most of the people doing this type of research,” Wallace said. “And so they’re still trying to understand what impacts they could be having. Whereas something that came in that is going to be a known impact on some of our crop species, they know ahead of time, ‘OK, this is going to impact this crop species, which is potentially going to have these economic impacts.’ But we didn’t have that kind of head start for Joro spiders.”
Citizens can help researchers track the spiders’ spread at jorowatch.org, which was developed by the University of Georgia, by filling out a form and attaching a photo.
Peak Joro spotting season lasts from August through October, and starting Monday and running through Oct. 12, people who submit Joro reports can enter their spider photos into a contest for bragging rights and spider stickers.
Wallace said the contest is a big help in collecting data – last year’s contest period brought in more than 500 confirmed reports.
Wallace said people often confuse Joros with a native species of spider called the golden silk orb weaver, but there are some ways to tell them apart.
For Joros, the adult female has an abdomen that is black on the back with a belly that is black and yellow and has an orange splotch towards the end of it. Their legs are usually black and yellow, but occasionally all black.
For golden silk orb weavers, the body is more orange with whitish, silvery spots, and the legs are yellow with brownish bands.
“And the bands have huge tufts of hair on them,” Wallace said about the orb weavers. “They look like they’re wearing leg warmers.”
Experts say some invasive bugs like the Spotted Lanternfly are too dangerous to be allowed to live and should be killed on sight, but the Joro is not in this category.

(Photo by Dave Cummings/New Hampshire Bulletin)In the months since the New Hampshire Supreme Court ruled that the state is underfunding its public schools, lawmakers have been divided over how to respond.
Democrats have called on the state to meet its court-ordered obligations. Republicans have denounced the ruling and said the court is infringing on the Legislature’s domain. But no detailed plans have been released. 
Now, one Republican says he has a possible answer: increase — and redistribute — statewide property taxes. 
At a committee hearing last week, Rep. Walter Spilsbury of Charlestown said he plans to file a bill next year to more than quadruple the Statewide Education Property Tax. Doing so would raise an extra $1 billion per year — enough, Spilsbury says, to satisfy the court’s requirements. 
The proposed bill, whose text has yet not been released, would expand the tax so residents across the state would pay about $5 per $1,000 in property valuation toward the SWEPT, according to Spilsbury. In total, the tax would raise about $1.5 billion per year, Spilsbury said. That amount could allow the state to distribute about $10,000 per student to public schools. 
That approach would be a major departure from the present system. Cities and towns must currently raise $363 million in SWEPT, not $1.5 billion. And the state currently pays out a base amount of $4,266 per pupil, not $10,000.
In August, in its decision in Contoocook Valley School District v. New Hampshire, the Supreme Court wrote that the current amount is too low, and it agreed with a lower court that the state should spend at least $7,356.01 per pupil to sufficiently cover the basic cost of education. 
But Spilsbury’s proposed bill would change the current tax system in another way: All revenue raised by the SWEPT would go to the Department of Revenue Administration and would be redistributed across the state. That would end the process by which wealthier towns are able to retain “excess SWEPT” revenue that they don’t need to fund their schools and use it to offset other local taxes. 
Built into his proposal is some tax relief: New Hampshire residents would get a 20% reduction in the SWEPT paid on their primary residence; people who did not have children in the school system would get a 10% reduction in the SWEPT; and people over 65 would also receive a 10% reduction. 
Spilsbury said the bill “probably will become a lightning rod.” “It’s ambitious,” he said before the House Education Funding Committee. “Maybe it’s too ambitious.”
And the idea comes as few in Concord appear eager to grapple with the implications of the Supreme Court’s ruling. 
In its 3-2 ruling, the court said that the Legislature and governor must fix the current funding system in order to increase the amount the state sends to public schools. But the court did not lay out exact timelines or methods for doing so, with the majority writing that doing so would be an inappropriate breach of separation of powers.
Some Democrats have proposed immediately raising the state’s school adequacy formula to address the court ruling. 
A bill by Hopkinton Rep. Dave Luneau, House Bill 651, would increase the base per-pupil adequacy rate to $7,356.01 — exactly the amount ordered by the court — at a price of about $576 million per year. But Republicans have said that move would be too fast, and on Tuesday, the House Education Funding Committee recommended HB 651 be killed, with Democrats voting against killing it. 
Other Democrats have embraced studying approaches to addressing the court orders. Democratic leadership has said lawmakers should work to find a solution, but that it is the responsibility of Republicans, who hold power, to present ideas.
“That’s not something Democrats can solve on our own,” said Rep. Alexis Simpson, the House Democratic leader, at a press conference last week. “It just isn’t. And I would say the first step is I would invite Republican leadership from the governor on down to come to the table and actually look for real solutions.”
Meanwhile, Republicans have denounced the court ruling and have begun openly questioning a pair of landmark opinions in the 1990s, known as the Claremont decisions, which established the state’s constitutional requirement to guarantee an adequate education in every school.
The Claremont decisions centered on an interpretation of the word “cherish” in the state constitution. Part 2, Article 83 states that legislators have a “duty” “to cherish the interest of literature and the sciences, and all seminaries and public schools.” The court said this duty means the state must make sure it is providing an adequate education.
Those decisions have influenced how the state pays for education for three decades. But Republicans say they are flawed.
“That word ‘cherish’ is probably the most expensive word in the New Hampshire Constitution, according to the Supreme Court,” said Rep. Daniel Popovici-Muller, a Windham Republican. “I do intend to follow the guidance of the Supreme Court, but to say that the word cherish clearly means that is more than I’m comfortable saying.”
Even Spilsbury says he opposes the court’s interpretation. He clarified Tuesday that he is proposing to expand SWEPT not because he agrees with the court rulings, but because doing so would be beneficial to towns with struggling public schools.
“I’m not here because a court said this is what we have to do,” he said. “We don’t need a court to tell us what we ought to do. I think this committee should proceed because we have a clear understanding that our constituents expect us to do something.” 
For progressive Democrats who have been pushing for the state to dramatically increase its funding to public schools, Spilsbury’s proposal has earned a mixed reaction.
Former Executive Councilor Andru Volinsky, a Concord Democrat who helped bring the Claremont lawsuits against the state in the 1990s, said that on the one hand, he is heartened that Spilsbury is seeking solutions to the problem of funding.
“I think Representative Spilsbury deserves a great deal of credit for actually representing his constituents, rather than some strained ideology,” he said in an interview.
On the other hand, Volinksy argued, addressing the funding gap by increasing statewide property taxes is not the most fair way to fix the problem. 
Property taxes are regressive and hurt poorer homeowners more than wealthy ones, he said, unless a “homestead exemption” were built into the tax that would exempt a set amount of the home’s value from taxation. 
“The problem of a property tax is that it’s inelastic. It doesn’t vary with the homeowner having more or less income, being well or ill,” he said.  “… If you’re increasing SWEPT it’s better than relying heavily on unequal local property taxes, but it doesn’t address the inelasticity problem.”
Jeanne Dietsch, a former Democratic state senator from Peterborough who once proposed an income tax on wealthy Granite Staters to pay for education, agreed that property taxes could not solve the problem alone.
“It’s still all on you — all on the property tax,” she said in an interview, speaking on Spilsbury’s proposal. 
To Dietsch and Volinsky, the only way to fairly raise the money needed to support schools is to seriously consider an income tax targeted at the wealthy. 
“I think we should backtrack on a couple of the four business tax cuts that we’ve given. And I think we should reinstate the interest and dividends tax … or have an income tax with a very high (floor),” Dietsch said. 
Fellow Republicans, who oppose income taxes, called Spilsbury’s proposal an interesting start. 
“Four times our Statewide Education Property Tax: That has pluses, but it all has negatives too,” said Rep. Rick Ladd, a Haverhill Republican and the chairman of the Education Funding Committee, in response to Spilsbury’s proposal. “It’s going to cause some hardships on those towns which are going to be contributing the bulk of the money.”
”I heard things I liked and things that made me raise my eyebrows a little,” agreed Popovici-Muller. “… It’s always good to hear those complex proposals that are unlikely to survive as they are, but they are a great starting point.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Classroom1-1024x648.jpeg,,,2025-10-06 05:56:53.182134

Here’s the enrollment data for fall 2025: 

Bowling Green State University — 20,383 students (3.5% increase)
Cleveland State University — 13,107 students (6.62% decrease)
Miami University — 22,281 students (1% decrease)

Central State University did not respond to the Capital Journal’s request for data. 
Ohio public universities saw a decrease in international student enrollment compared to last fall. 
International student enrollment for fall 2025: 

Bowling Green State University — 599 students (33.2% decrease)
Cleveland State University — 1,249 students (34% decrease)

Ohio State University has 3,226 students from China, 777 from India, 321 from Korea, 162 from Taiwan and 135 from Canada, according to university data. 
Cleveland State had the biggest decrease with 34%, followed by Bowling Green with a 33.2% decrease, and then Miami with a 22% decrease.  
“It’s tough,” said Cleveland State’s Vice President of Enrollment Management Randy Deike. “I think there are a lot of families that still see U.S. education as the best in the world. It’s just so many things are up in the air. Families are concerned about safety and all kinds of other stuff.”
A new higher education law recently took effect in Ohio that bans diversity efforts, prohibits faculty strikes, and regulates classroom discussion at Ohio’s public universities. 
The law also creates post-tenure reviews, puts diversity scholarships at risk, sets rules around classroom discussion, and creates a retrenchment provision that blocks unions from negotiating on tenure, among other things. The law affects Ohio’s public universities and community colleges. 
Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine signed Ohio Senate Bill 1 into law in March and students threatened to leave the state if S.B. 1 became law.
International students have faced challenges under the Trump administration. Many international students across the United States had their visas revoked for a period of time earlier this year, but then the Trump administration ultimately restored the visas at the end of April. 
The Trump administration issued an executive order on his first day in office ordering the State Department to review all visa programs and make sure foreign nationals do not pose a threat to national security. 
In June, the Trump administration announced a 19-country travel ban. Afghanistan, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Myanmar, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen have a full travel ban. Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela have a partial travel ban.

“These events are an opportunity for North Dakotans to connect with one of the nation’s foremost voices on the history and future of America’s public lands,” Shannon Straight, executive director of the Badlands Conservation Alliance, said in a news release announcing the tour.
The dates and locations are:

Oct. 14 at Dickinson State University’s Beck Auditorium
Oct. 15 at the North Dakota Heritage Center in Bismarck
Oct. 16 at the University of North Dakota’s Gorecki Alumni Center in Grand Forks

Each film will start at 6:30 p.m. and will be followed by a question-and-answer segment with Dabney. Discussions will be moderated by local conservation leaders.
Dabney worked in parks including Yellowstone, Grand Teton, Yosemite, Grand Teton, Everglades and Mount Rainier, eventually serving as superintendent and chief ranger of the National Park Service. 
In the news release announcing the tour, he said he’s an admirer of President Theodore Roosevelt, who established the country’s National Park System. 
“Much of the land we enjoy today — and that many depend on for their livelihoods — would not exist without Roosevelt’s actions before he left office in 1909,” Dabney said in a statement.
The tour is a joint effort by the Badlands Conservation Alliance, North Dakota Wildlife Federation, North Dakota Natural Resources Trust, North Dakota Backcountry Hunters & Anglers, North Dakota Chapter of The Wildlife Society, North Dakota Sierra Club and the Dakota Resource Council.

(Photo by Samantha Robson, courtesy of Azure Bouré)CHANDLER, Ariz. — Art Martinez has seen the power of ceremony.
Martinez, a clinical psychologist and member of the Chumash Tribe, helped run an American Indian youth ceremonial camp. Held at a sacred tribal site in Northern California, it was designed to help kids’ mental health. He remembers a 14-year-old girl who had been struggling with substance use and was on the brink of hospitalization.
On the first day of the four-day camp, Martinez recalled, she was barely able to speak. In daily ceremonies, she wept. The other kids gathered around her. “You’re not alone. We’re here for you,” they’d say.
Traditional tribal healing practices are diverse and vary widely, unique from tribe to tribe. Many include talking circles, sweat lodge ceremonies with special rituals, plant medicine and herb smudging, along with sacred ceremonies known only to the tribe.
Martinez and the girl’s counselor saw her mental health improve under a treatment plan combining tribal traditional healing and Western medicine.
“By the end of the gathering, she had broken through the isolation,” Martinez said. “Before, she would barely shake hands with kids, and she was now hugging them, they were exchanging phone numbers. Her demeanor was better, she was able to articulate.”

Indigenous health advocates have long known the health benefits of integrating their traditional healing practices, and studies have also shown better health outcomes.
Now, for the first time, tribal traditional healing practices are eligible for Medicaid coverage in California and three other states under a new initiative. Last October, the federal government approved Medicaid and Children’s Health Insurance Program coverage of traditional healing practices at tribal health facilities and urban Indian organizations in Arizona, California, New Mexico and Oregon.
These were approved under a federal demonstration provision that allows states to test new pilot health programs and ways to pay for them.
Arizona’s waiver went into effect Wednesday. While California’s waiver currently only covers patients with substance use disorder, like the girl in Martinez’s camp, any Medicaid enrollee who is American Indian or Alaska Native is eligible in the other three states. Officials have said California’s program will expand to have such coverage in the future.
Under the waivers, each tribe and facility decides which traditional healing services to offer for reimbursement. Services can also take place at sacred sites and not necessarily inside a clinic, explained Virginia Hedrick, executive director of the California Consortium for Urban Indian Health.
“If a healing intervention requires being near a water source — the ocean, creek, river — we can do that,” said Hedrick, who is of the Yurok Tribe and of Karuk descent. “It may involve gathering medicine in a specific place on the land itself.”
Tribes, long shut out from their own health data, fight for access and sovereignty

Tribes long had to practice out of sight. The U.S. government’s assimilation policies had targeted tribal languages, cultural and religious practices — including healing. It wasn’t until 1978, when the American Indian Religious Freedom Act was enacted under President Jimmy Carter, that they regained their rights.
“It was illegal to practice our ways until 1978 … the year I was born,” said Dr. Allison Kelliher, a family and integrative medicine physician, who is Koyukon Athabascan, Dena. “Traditional healing means intergenerational knowledge that have origins in how our ancestors and people lived generationally to promote health, so it’s a holistic way of looking at well-being.”
Last month, Kelliher and hundreds of others gathered at the National Indian Health Board’s health conference on Gila River Indian Community land in Arizona. During a panel discussion about the waivers, tribal members discussed how health centers will bill for services, ways to protect the sacredness of certain ceremonies, and how to measure and collect data around the effectiveness of the treatments, a federal requirement under the waivers.
But teasing out those new protocols didn’t dull the enthusiasm.
“This is where we really start intersecting the Western medicine as well as traditional healing, and it’s exciting,” said panelist Dr. Naomi Young, CEO of the Fort Defiance Indian Hospital Board in Arizona.
The Trump administration announced earlier this year that it doesn’t plan to renew certain other Medicaid waiver programs approved under the Biden administration. But it hasn’t announced any changes around the traditional healing waivers.
Studies have found that Incorporating sweat lodge ceremonies and other cultural practices in treatments led to substance use recovery and emotional health, and better quality diets when incorporating traditional foods, according to analyses of research by the National Council of Urban Indian Health.
“When there is an opportunity to braid traditional healing with Western forms of medicine, it’s very possible, and the research is indicating, we may get better health outcomes,” Hedrick said.

Traditional practices
Decades of historical trauma, such as displacement and forced assimilation in boarding schools — where American Indian and Alaska Native people were forbidden from speaking their languages — are behind their disproportionate rates of chronic illness and early deaths today, tribal health experts say.
Tribes have long offered traditional healing — both outside brick-and-mortar health care settings as well as within many clinics. But health centers have been paying out of pocket or budgeting for the services, said retired OB-GYN Dr. John Molina, director of the Arizona Advisory Council on Indian Health Care and member of the Pasqua Yaqui and Yavapai Apache Tribes.
Molina said the new Arizona waiver may help clinics afford to serve more patients or staff more traditional healers, and build infrastructure, including sacred spaces and sweat lodges. For other clinics, “They’ve been wanting to start, but perhaps don’t have the revenue to start it,” he said.
“I’m hoping that when people engage in traditional healing services, a lot of it is to bring balance back into the lifestyle, to give them some hope,” Molina said.
That’s the effect traditional healing practices have had on Harrison Jim, who is Diné. Now a counselor and traditional practitioner at Sage Memorial Hospital in Arizona, Jim, 70, said he remembers his own first all-night sweat lodge ceremony when he returned from a military tour.
“I [felt] relieved of everything that I was carrying, because it’s kind of like a personal journey that I went through,” he said. “Through that ceremony, I had that experience of freedom.”
Lackluster investigations may perpetuate high Native infant mortality rate

Kim Russell, the hospital’s policy adviser, who also spoke on the panel about the traditional healing waivers, told Stateline her team hopes to bring on another practitioner along with Jim.
Tribal health leaders have expressed concern about people without traditional knowledge posing to offer healing services. But Navajo organizations, including Diné Hataałii Association Inc., aim to protect from such co-opting as it provides licensures for Native healers, Jim said.
Push in Washington
Facilities covered under the new waivers include Indian Health Service facilities, tribal facilities, or urban Indian organization facilities. In Arizona, urban Indian organizations can get the benefit only if they contract with an Indian Health Service or other tribal health facility.
In Oregon, Yellowhawk Tribal Health Center spokesperson Shanna Hamilton said that while the center can’t speak on behalf of other tribes or clinics, many are still in the early stages of developing programs and protocols. She called the waivers a “meaningful step forward in honoring Indigenous knowledge and healing practices.”
Meanwhile, in neighboring Washington state, a bill that would have required the state to submit an application for a waiver by Sept. 1 died in committee.
But the state doesn’t need the legislative OK to apply. It’s still going to submit an application by the end of the year, the Washington State Health Care Authority told Stateline in a statement, emphasizing that each tribe would determine its own traditional health services available for reimbursement.
Azure Bouré, traditional food and medicine program coordinator for the Suquamish Tribe, a community along the shores of Washington’s Puget Sound, called the waivers “groundbreaking.”
“We’re proving day in and day out that Indigenous knowledge is important. It’s real, it’s worthy, and it’s real science,” Bouré said.
On a brisk summer day in 2009, Bouré recalled, she had attended a family camp hosted by Northwest Indian College. It was then she tasted the salal berry for the first time. A sweet, dark blue berry, it’s long been used by Pacific Northwest tribes medicinally, in jams, and for dyeing clothing.
“It was just that one berry, that one day, that reignited that wonderment,” Bouré said. For her, it unlocked the world of Indigenous plant medicine and food sovereignty, a people’s right to the food and food systems of their land.
Dental therapists, who can fill cavities and check teeth, get the OK in more states

She got her bachelor’s in Native American environmental science and now runs an apothecary, teaches traditional cooking classes, recommends herbs to members with ailments and processes foraged foods.
One day she could be chopping pumpkins or other gourds and the next, cleaning and peeling away the salty-sweet meat from dozens of sea cucumbers harvested by shellfish biologist divers employed by the tribe.
Bouré’s grandmother died when her mom was 12 years old. “That’s a whole generation of knowledge that she lost,” she said. One way she unearths that lost knowledge is by learning tribal medicine and teaching it, and holding on to memories like watching her great-grandmother Cecelia, who wove traditional sweetgrass dolls even when she was blind.
“I think that I come from a long line of healers,” she said. “It just skipped my mom and my grandma that passed, but I really relate to my great-grandmother Cecelia in that way.”
Dr. Gary Ferguson, who is Unangax̂ (Aleut), is the director of integrative medicine at the Tulalip Health Clinic about 40 miles north of Seattle. He’s certified in naturopathic medicine in Washington and Alaska.
His health center already has a variety of integrative medicine offerings, he said, including traditional ones grounded in Coast Salish traditions of the Pacific Northwest. He said he hopes the waivers and continued support for Indigenous ways of healing will help tribes address health disparities.
“These ceremonies and ways are part of that deeper healing,” he said.

(Photo by Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)Two years ago, Brian Miller said he was still unsure whether to sign up the rural Arkansas hospital he runs for a federal program that promised more financial stability.
DeWitt Hospital and Nursing Home is now a rural emergency hospital, which draws more federal funds to rural hospitals if they reduce or eliminate inpatient services and focus on emergency and outpatient treatment. Five Arkansas hospitals have made this trade since September 2023.
The DeWitt hospital has had “nothing but success” since receiving rural emergency designation from the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) in May 2024, Miller told the Advocate in August. The extra funding from Medicare, which insures the elderly, has been particularly helpful for the facility’s nursing home, he said.
The facility has also added cardiology, wound care and “some things like that that have generated a little more cash,” Miller said.
While rural emergency status has benefited the DeWitt hospital and its patients, it’s not necessarily the right fit for all rural Arkansas hospitals. The Southwest Arkansas Regional Medical Center in Hope will not be applying for rural emergency status, Chief Administrative Officer Shelby Brown told lawmakers in September.
Rural hospitals with no more than 50 beds are eligible to apply for rural emergency hospital (REH) status. If accepted, they are subsequently licensed for zero inpatient beds.
Brown said in an interview that giving up the Hope hospital’s inpatient beds would not serve the health needs of Hempstead, Lafayette, Miller and Nevada county residents.

“We want to be able to, if we need to admit someone, to put them in our hospital so they can stay home locally,” Brown said, adding that rural emergency hospitals’ primary goals are to “treat, stabilize and transfer” to a larger facility.
Brown also said the number of patients at Southwest Arkansas Regional’s emergency room can range from 30 to over 50, which exceeds rural emergency hospitals’ typical patient volume.
Southwest Arkansas Regional instead received approval Sept. 19 to become a critical access hospital, a federal designation for facilities located no fewer than 35 miles from other hospitals and maintaining no more than 25 beds.
CMS subsidizes critical access hospitals for inpatient treatment of Medicare recipients. The DeWitt hospital was a critical access facility before it converted to REH status.
Southwest Arkansas Regional reduced its beds from 48 to 25, and two of the eliminated beds were in its geriatric psychiatric unit, Brown said.
She petitioned the Legislature’s Joint Public Health, Welfare and Labor Committee on Sept. 11 for more state funds for rural health care.

Rural Arkansas hospitals weigh trading inpatient care for new federal funds


“The big scheme of rural health in the state of Arkansas is in a crisis mode,” Brown said in an interview. “I would always think it’s better to have a rural emergency hospital versus no hospital.”
 Other considerations

Two counties and 50 miles east of Hope, Ouachita County Medical Center reduced its beds from 65 to 49 in preparation to apply for rural emergency hospital status.
The hospital in Camden is under three miles too close to the hospital in Fordyce to be eligible for critical access status, said Glenda Harper, who took over OCMC as CEO in August.
OCMC is a prospective payment system (PPS) hospital, meaning it receives Medicare reimbursements based on predetermined amounts. If it becomes a rural emergency hospital, it will receive an additional 5% reimbursement rate for outpatient services. Harper said this extra money will be crucial to financial stability.
There’s a catch: the Camden hospital would have to scale back its labor and delivery services.
Patients’ average stay at a rural emergency hospital over the course of a year must be no more than 24 hours, according to federal eligibility requirements. Delivering a baby via Cesarean section requires two or three days in a hospital for post-birth observation, so OCMC would have to limit its obstetric services to low-risk patients only, Harper said.
Aside from Camden, Southwest Arkansas has only four delivery hospitals: two in Hot Springs, one in Arkadelphia and one in Mena. Texarkana, Arkansas, no longer has a hospital, and the facility on the Texas side of the state line does not accept Arkansas Medicaid.
Ouachita County’s labor and delivery unit “does not make money at this point.” Administrators have considered closing it, but decided to keep it open “because our community needs it so badly,” Harper said.
“Our fear was that if we closed it, we’d have women presenting in labor who had had little or no prenatal care, and we’d have people delivering in ambulances on the way to a place that did have OB services,” Harper said.
For some rural communities, a stripped-down hospital is better than none at all

The extra money brought in via rural emergency status should make it possible for OCMC to keep both its labor and delivery unit and wound care unit open, she said.
Arkansas’ five existing rural emergency hospitals did not have labor and delivery services before receiving the designation. In addition to DeWitt, the other REH hospitals are in Pocahontas, Eureka Springs, Osceola and Helena-West Helena.
Thirty-three hospitals in 22 of Arkansas’ 75 counties have labor and delivery units, and six maternity wards have closed since 2020, including the one in Helena-West Helena.

City zoning laws don’t permit outdoor cannabis cultivation in the neighborhood where Jason Struthers lives. He says he’s had a state license since before those laws were adopted.

An Essex Junction resident who recently lost his ducks to new city zoning regulations is now fighting to hold on to his cannabis cultivation operation.
“I’ve been growing cannabis for 20 years. This has never been an issue,” said Jason Struthers, 48, at his half-acre backyard Tuesday where rows of bright green cannabis plants, heavy with flower, glistened in the bright sunlight.
It’s harvest season and he has been hard at work for more than 10 days. Most of the plants near him were about 5 feet tall, but they’ve been trimmed. Some of them grew to be 14 feet high this year, he said, pointing up to a trellis framing the blue sky. There was an odor but it was not noticeable from the street or outside the tall fence that shades the backyard from public view.
But, if the city gets its way, this may be the last crop of the Struthers strain — a sativa-dominant hybrid that he spent 10 years perfecting and said is good for doing work and being creative during the day.
Since neighbors complained about smells and noise from his ducks and weed, Struthers has been embroiled in a yearslong battle that has led to yelling matches, police visits, lawsuits, appeals, letters to legislators and contentious public hearings.
Struthers’ farm is located in a section of Essex Junction that is zoned for residential use. At the heart of the dispute is his right to farm versus the city’s fairly new zoning rules.
The conflict began in 2023, when the city’s development review board voted to prohibit Struthers from having ducks in an area designated as Residential-1. Struthers appealed, lost, and sold his ducks two months ago.
On May 30, the Vermont Supreme Court reversed a lower court’s decision and a yearslong practice, with justices reasoning that municipalities in Vermont can regulate both cannabis cultivation and farming practices by enforcing local zoning laws.
On July 14, Christopher Yuen, the city’s administrative officer, issued Struthers a notice of violation because “agriculture was defined and was not permitted in the R1 district,” and because some of his cannabis plants are within the town-required 50 feet setback.
And last month, the city’s Development Review Board voted unanimously in line with the courts to prevent agricultural cannabis cultivation in residential neighborhoods.
State vs. local regulation
Struthers began growing outdoor cannabis on his property at 8 Taft St. in July 2022. He received his cultivator’s license from the state on July 29, 2022. On May 4, 2023, he received his farm designation from the Vermont Agency of Agriculture, Food and Markets, according to town documents.
Vermont legalized marijuana in July 2008. In July 2022, cannabis cultivation was not a defined use in the new city’s development code. However, agriculture was defined and was not permitted within the Residential-1 zoning district per the city’s land development code amended in February. Struthers’ growing is categorized as agriculture.
Struthers says he has been cultivating outdoors for three years with state approval. His state-issued license predates Essex Junction passing a charter change to become a city in 2021. So he claims the use is grandfathered.
The city’s review board determined on Sept. 22 that the use is not grandfathered because it was never compliant with zoning regulations to begin with.
Between the complaints and the appeals, Struthers feels the city is discriminating against him due to the stigma surrounding cannabis, even though he is licensed by the state.
“I’m not trying to be a nuisance to anybody, but at the same time I followed the law to the letter,” he said. 
City Manager Regina Mahony wrote in an email Wednesday that the city “has an obligation to uphold the land use regulations in a way that is consistent with state statute and judicial interpretation.”
Struthers contends none of his neighbors, despite voicing opposition in local meetings or filing letters, has stopped by to talk about their problem, whether it’s the smell or the proximity or just the idea of growing weed. “There was never a discussion. Not once,” he said.
While residents have voiced concerns over the years about the operation being too close to, or less than a mile from, Essex High School, administrators from the Essex Westford School District said this week they have not received any complaints.

Statewide impact
The case has become a touchstone for cannabis  growers and agriculture statewide, highlighting issues of state versus local authority and legal ambiguities that could set precedence for the future of farming in the Green Mountain state.
Where previously lower courts ruled that the city could not regulate Struthers’ duck raising and cannabis cultivation operations since they’re exempt from municipal bylaw under Vermont’s Required Agricultural Practices Rule and state law, the May Supreme Court decision has reversed that.
Now that he’s lost the appeal in Essex Junction, Struthers, who currently holds a state-issued Tier 1 outdoor cultivator license and a Tier 1 manufacturing license, said he plans to challenge the board’s decision in court within the 30-day appeal period underway. If he loses, he loses his livelihood.
“It’s a bummer I lost the ducks, but if I got to choose one to keep, that’s gonna be the cannabis,” he said this week.
Like Struthers, cannabis and agriculture entities in Vermont are also wrestling with new and changing rules governing the highly regulated cannabis industry. Some claim Vermont’s adult-use cannabis marketplace does not adequately support small growers and manufacturers.
“I think this is a good case of where this question of scale-appropriate regulation and who’s regulating what really has come to the fore in Vermont,” said Graham Unangst-Rufenacht, policy director at Rural Vermont, a grassroots member-based organization that advocates to improve equity in food and agriculture systems.
He visited Struthers’ farm last harvest season and said he didn’t find any issues with the operation in the suburban neighborhood. 
He has also come up against the “reality of the stigma around cannabis” in the Statehouse. “It’s a bipartisan issue and I think we see that play out a little bit in Jason’s case,” he said.
In January 2024, two state representatives from Essex Junction introduced a bill, H.549, to prohibit outdoor cannabis cultivation in densely populated areas that are served by municipal water and sewer and have 500 or more persons per square mile — a bill that, if it returns next session and passes, could effectively end Struthers’ operation.
Rep. Karen Dolan, D-Essex Junction, declined to comment while Struthers’ case “continues to unfold.”
Rep. Lori Houghton, D-Essex Junction, did not respond to a request for comment. At the time, she insisted it was not “an anti-cannabis bill,” but one that was asking the state to consider density when issuing outdoor cultivator licenses.
Canary in the coal mine
Historically, the state has regulated cannabis and farming. But the Supreme Court decision sets a new precedent. Justices reasoned that towns and cities in Vermont can regulate both cannabis cultivation and farming practices by enforcing local zoning laws. They also clarified state law “does not prohibit all municipal regulation of farming.”

The ruling has dramatically shifted things from an agricultural perspective, according to  Unangst-Rufenacht. “In a sense, cannabis was a little bit of a canary in the coal mine, I think, for changes related to broader agriculture,” he said.
Geoffrey Pizzutillo, executive director of the Vermont Growers Association, said the ruling unnecessarily poses a threat to farming statewide and that the case extends beyond cannabis cultivators. After all, the states’ municipal zoning statute is not narrowly defined for cannabis but applies to all farming activities.
On its face, the Vermont Supreme Court decision seems to be a solution in search of a problem, detractors say. “It amounts to a disruption of a core tenet of Vermont as a right-to-farm state. That is significant,” Pizzutillo said. 
Specific to Struthers’ case, Pizzutillo said, “It is challenging to see how that situation in Essex is anything other than discriminatory.”
Meanwhile, Rural Vermont and other organizations put out a call last month for stories and signatures to “demonstrate the importance of the farming exemptions from Municipal Zoning and Act 250 for the working lands community.”
“The court’s ruling will impact the Vermont farm community at a time when farmers are already grappling with many emergent challenges, including flooding and other impacts of a changing climate, lack of federal funding, and widespread inflation,” the Sept. 2 letter reads. 
“Opening the door for municipal regulation of farms contradicts the longstanding policies, culture, and precedent that has protected Vermonter’s right to farm on the land they have access to, hindering Vermont’s ability to produce its own food, and by extension compromising the state’s food security,” according to the letter.
James Pepper, chair of the state Cannabis Control Board, said the board typically doesn’t take a position on the efficacy of policy decisions. The intent of the original legislation created in 2020 was to find creative ways to get cannabis cultivators out of densely packed residential neighborhoods, he said, taking into consideration factors like municipal wastewater.
The cannabis board has encouraged the Legislature to very intentionally not have zoning apply to outdoor cannabis cultivators, Pepper said, because the whole point of legalization was to encourage former and legacy growers to join the regulated market.
 In a January report, the board outlined the potential impacts of the municipal setback authority that precipitated this dispute.
If municipal zoning is too restrictive, it could  “paint entire swaths of a town out of cultivation,” he said. In Pepper’s view, Struthers’ situation was inevitable. “Someone was going to have a farm where the odors were going to impact their neighbors,” he said.
And equity in cannabis cultivation has been much talked about in Vermont. In January, the cannabis board submitted a legislative report on equity that recommends implementing direct sales for small producers. As of now, cultivators are only allowed to sell directly to retailers.
Singled out
Although Struthers has been growing hemp – and more recently, cannabis – for two decades on his property, the town sees the operation as an unallowed use per Essex Junction’s new land regulations. 
The state issued Struthers his license to grow cannabis in July 2022, around the same time that the village of Essex became an independent city. His license was renewed this year, the Cannabis Control Board confirmed.
A year ago local officials tried to shut down the cannabis operation before admitting they had little power to void Struthers’ state grower’s license. State officials have since renewed the license.
All of it makes him feel like the city is singling out his one-man, outdoor, fenced-in operation and trying to regulate him out for what is, he claims, a grandfathered use in a state that promotes and celebrates agriculture.
“They are just biased against cannabis. Don’t let them fool you,” he said.
Struthers is one of four cultivators in Essex Junction and one of 369 cultivators in Vermont, according to the state Cannabis Control Board’s data, of which 119 are outdoor cultivators. 
“It’s way more environmentally friendly,” Struthers said of his outdoor plantings. “We use the sun. We don’t use any electricity. We don’t produce any greenhouse gasses. In fact, we sequester carbon, if anything.”
Struthers turned to medical marijuana after he injured his back and sustained a spinal injury while skydiving in 2011. He said he secured his medical marijuana license soon after.
“It’s medicine for me. And it’s a far greater source of income than duck eggs and tomatoes. And I enjoy it more,” he said with a chuckle.
Without his operation, Struthers said he isn’t sure what he would do, as he walked around the grassy yard interspersed with groups of cannabis plants and an arched trellis brimming with yellow and red cherry tomatoes.
He is licensed by the state to have 125 plants but said he has a lesser number that he declined to share. A view from inside the backyard reveals at least 60 plants.
He says it’s a lot of work for a one-man operation. He usually starts the seeds in March or April, and puts the baby plants outside, weather permitting, on Memorial Day weekend. Then he starts to harvest in late September and early October. This year he started on Sept. 20.
His situation would have been different had he lived a mile down the road in Essex town – which has three cultivators and a very different attitude towards cannabis cultivation, he said. 
“They fully allow anybody to have a dispensary or cultivation and manufacturing” without “the limitations” Essex Junction is trying to impose, Struthers said. 
“There is where I allegedly could buy property and do exactly what I’m doing and it’s perfectly respectable. But because I’m here, even though I’m in the same 4.5 square mile city, they’re legal, I’m not legal… That just doesn’t make any sense.”
The only rule governing personal and commercial growers in Essex is the state-required license and a 500-foot buffer zone around schools, an Essex zoning official confirmed. Aside from the three commercial growers, the town does not track people who are growing from private residences. There have been no complaints filed for any of them, a town official said.
While the case plays out through town hearings and court cases, it is business as usual in the fenced up verdant backyard on Taft Street, now free of the quacking that neighbors once complained about.
“I am doing what I want to do, continuing as usual,” Struthers said. “I just want to be left alone. I want to cultivate my flowers. I want to create products for people to use and just be happy.”

The year-to-year decrease was small but continues a broad downward trajectory in abortions since the mid-1990s.
In all, there were 21,829 induced abortions in Ohio in 2024, compared with 22,000 in 2023; the abortion rate per 1,000 residents declined from 8.7 to 8.4.
The vast majority of procedures continue to happen early in pregnancy. More than 64% involved a pregnancy of less than nine weeks, and another 23% involved pregnancies of 9-12 weeks.
Non-surgical abortions, using drugs like Misoprostol or Mifepristone, made up a little less than half the total.

Ohio’s new reproductive protections stand out among many of its neighbors, and that appears to be showing up in the data as well. For most of the last 10 years, out of state residents made up about 1,200 of those seeking abortions in Ohio in a given year. In 2023, even before Issue 1 passed, that figure jumped to more than 2,700, and in 2024 in climbed again to 3,113.
Supporters and opponents reactions
Despite passage of Issue 1, which guarantees Ohio officials can’t “burden, penalize, prohibit, interfere with, or discriminate” against an individual making their own reproductive decisions, abortion access remains a live issue.
In March, Ohio Right to Life filed a complaint with the Department of Health about a company offering reproductive care via telemedicine. The laws the company was supposedly violating had been put on hold by a judge more than a year prior.
This summer, two Planned Parenthood clinics closed following federal changes to Medicaid. Even after a judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration’s efforts, the clinics decided it was too risky to continue. Republican state lawmakers even filed a bill defining life at conception in a bid to circumvent Issue 1 and outlaw abortion and IVF treatment.
Abortion opponents welcomed the decline in the most recent report but promised to keep fighting.
“Given that Ohio has some of the most liberal abortion laws in the country and we have radical judges pushing this agenda, these numbers are encouraging,” Ohio Right to Life Executive Director Carrie Snyder said.
“We aren’t satisfied with the loss of any innocent pre-born child, and our efforts to protect them will continue,” she added.
Snyder highlighted “disturbing trends” like Black mothers making up a disproportionate amount of the state’s procedures and the continued rise in out-of-state abortion seekers.
“This is another reason why we have called on Governor (Mike) DeWine to sign an executive order prohibiting any Medicaid funds from going to abortion providers,” Snyder said. “Taxpayer dollars should not (be) used to support the practice of abortion in any way, and even more so on people not from the Buckeye State.”
Kellie Copeland from the organization Abortion Forward compared the current moment to the brief window in 2022 when Ohio’s 6-week abortion ban took effect — cutting off access to abortions before most mothers know they’re pregnant.
“For 82 days in 2022, Ohioans were forced to travel out of state for the abortion care they needed,” Copeland said. “Thankfully, those days are behind us, and abortion is protected in the Ohio Constitution.”
Still, she said her organization has work to do.
“People must be able to plan if, when, and how they start a family, and government should be ensuring they have access to education and resources to make that plan for themselves,” Copeland said. “Unfortunately, Trump, Congress, anti-abortion organizations, and their friends in the Ohio Legislature continue to do everything they can to impede access to reproductive healthcare.”
Copeland criticized lawmakers threatening Medicaid funding and leaving tens of thousands of Ohioans without access to medical services. She’s concerned about the number of out of state abortion seekers, too — but not for the same reasons as Snyder.
“I am glad that those people could come to Ohio for the care they needed,” Copeland said, “but they should have been able to get the care much closer to home.”
“No one should be forced to cross state lines for health care,” she insisted.

“Legislators legislate with their lived experience, and right now, too few lawmakers in Congress know what it’s like to navigate childcare, school pick-ups, and the cost of raising kids in America,” Vote Mama Foundation Founder and CEO Liuba Grechen Shirley said in a statement. “The U.S. does not support parents.”
The report found nearly 30 states do not have a mom of a minor children in Congress: Ohio, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Delaware, Idaho, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.
“That’s not just a gap in representation; it’s a crisis,” Shirley said in a statement. 
Ohio U.S. Reps. Greg Landsman, Max Miller, and Mike Carey, along with U.S. Sen. Jon Husted, are all fathers of minor children, according to the report. Landsman is a Democrat while Miller, Carey and Husted are Republicans. 
There are 39 moms of minor children and 124 dads of minor children in Congress, according to the survey. 69.2% of moms of minors are Democrats and 61.3% of dads of minors are Republicans.
A Vote Mama report from last year found only about 6% of Ohio’s state lawmakers are moms with children under 18, ranking the state 37th in the nation. At the time of last year’s report, eight of Ohio’s 132 state legislators are moms of children under 18. 
California, Florida and New York have the most moms of minor children in Congress with four, according to the report. 
Delaware, Idaho, Mississippi, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Nevada, Wisconsin, and Wyoming have no parents of minor children in Congress. 
Vote Mama had eight recommendations for Congress: 

Create a reasonable voting schedule that does not require members to leave their families at unpredictable times. 
Normalize parents making the decision to live in their district or in the capital based on what is best for their families. 
Allow members to vote by proxy or virtually so they can perform their duties remotely when they or their families have increased care needs. 
Normalize members of Congress using campaign funds to pay for child or dependent care, and allow them to use campaign funds to pay for security expenses. 
Normalize federal candidates using campaign funds to pay themselves a living wage and cover dependent care. 
Create an official family leave policy to allow members to care for their families without stigma. 
 Install changing tables in all members’ bathrooms, regardless of gender, and ensure accessibility of pumping rooms in all legislative buildings. 
Expand House and Senate childcare centers to reduce waitlists and better meet the needs of legislators and staff.

(Getty Images)Every October, Substance Use and Misuse Prevention Month provides a reminder of the lives at stake in the fight against substance use disorders (SUDs). For New Hampshire, this year brings signs of real progress.
After nearly a decade of drug-related mortality rates falling above the national average, the Granite State is now experiencing record declines in drug-related fatalities. A closer look at the data suggests that sustained investments in prevention, treatment, and recovery may be paying off.
Drug-related deaths in New Hampshire, once among the highest fatality rates in the country, have begun to fall sharply. From 2013 to 2020, Granite Staters experienced drug-related fatality rates well above the national average, peaking in 2017 when an estimated 490 people died from drug-related causes, nearly five times higher than the number killed in traffic-related accidents in the state. But by 2024, deaths had declined to 287, the smallest number recorded since 2014 and the sharpest year-over-year decline across the previous decade. Early data suggests that this trend may continue into 2025: an estimated 77 Granite Staters died from drug-related fatalities the first half of this year, a decline from the 122 people during the same period in 2024.
These declines follow a decade of increasing state and federal investments in SUD prevention, treatment, and recovery services. Since 2014, New Hampshire has invested more than $835 million in SUD services, with spending increasing by an estimated 450% from 2014 to 2024.
Medicaid, the single largest payer of SUD services, has been vital for increasing access. The passage of Medicaid expansion in 2014, now commonly known as Granite Advantage in New Hampshire, expanded health coverage for adults up to 138% of the federal poverty guidelines. Of the almost $58 million spent on Medicaid-funded SUD services in 2024, nearly 80% was financed services under Granite Advantage. Opioid abatement funds resulting from legal settlements with drug manufacturers have also added funding support. By late 2024, New Hampshire had received close to $96 million in settlement money, although around half remained unspent. As of January 2025, it is estimated by the Kaiser Family Foundation that New Hampshire will receive more than $168 million in future payments, combined with a large continuing balance allowing for more spending flexibility across the state.
Yet despite these gains, access to treatment remains uneven, and many Granite Staters are still left behind. In 2022-2023, nearly 3 out of 4 Granite Staters who needed SUD treatment did not receive it, due in part to barriers such as provider shortages, regional disparities, coverage limits, and housing instability. Social determinants of health also play a role in which services people are able to obtain and can impact engagement with treatment and sustained recovery. Nationally, people identifying as Black or Native American experience disproportionate health outcomes from substance misuse. Research also shows that communities with greater income inequality experience higher drug-related fatality rates.
In New Hampshire, over half of drug-related deaths in 2024 occurred among people age 30 to 49, although shifting demographics have impacted fatalities, with older adults age 65 and older comprising around 13 percent of drug-related deaths. Men have accounted for around two-thirds of fatalities each year across the previous decade, and rural counties, including Coös and Sullivan counties, also report higher mortality rates, likely reflecting limited service availability resulting from workforce shortages.
In addition to better health outcomes, an investment in SUD services contributes to longer-term economic and social benefits. Increased prevention, treatment, and recovery services can reduce costly emergency health care spending, decrease burdens on the criminal legal system, and help keep more people engaged in the workforce.
However, new federal and state policy changes could undermine this progress. Although Medicaid has remained the largest source of funding for SUD services, new state and federal changes could impact access to health care across New Hampshire. Both the new federal reconciliation law and the latest state budget add work requirements for Granite Advantage adults, requiring people to prove employment or engagement in an eligible community engagement activity to obtain health coverage. While people in SUD treatment are exempt from the new requirements, differing state interpretations of the law, as well as difficulties with exemption paperwork and redeterminations could mean coverage losses for people in treatment and recovery. Early national research suggests that as many as 156,000 people across the country could lose access to medication-assisted treatment, resulting in an estimated 1,000 additional opioid-related deaths each year. These Medicaid changes come at a time when access to services is already limited.
As this year’s Substance Use and Misuse Prevention Month arrives, New Hampshire’s recent experience demonstrates that sustained investments in prevention, treatment, and recovery services can save lives. This progress, however, may be fragile. Without continued investment and innovation, the advances made in reducing drug-related deaths could stall, or even reverse, putting more families and communities at risk.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/drugaddiction-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-10-06 04:56:12.911408

(Pool photo by Yui Mok/Getty Images)Have you heard the one about a ceremonial sword, the Trump administration and the Dwight D. Eisenhower Presidential Library in Abilene?
It’s no joke, unfortunately.
It’s also not as cutting an anecdote as you may think. After hearing from ousted library director Todd Arrington, I’m left with more questions than answers. National and local media covered the story in such a way that readers could believe that Arrington was fired after refusing to give the Trump administration a fancy sword from the Eisenhower library. The president wanted to present a memento to Britain’s King Charles during his September state visit.
In reality, Arrington worked with the administration to secure a saber from West Point and was complimented about his handling of the situation.
“The day that the president gave the sword to the king, I got a message from my boss’s boss saying: ‘The sword has been presented. It all went great. You did a great job. Thank you for all your help,’ ” he told me.
So we don’t know for certain why Arrington was ousted from the job where he served for a bit more than a year. To hear him tell it, he had gotten on well with staff and the Eisenhower family and was making connections to Abilene.
A lifetime civil servant and Army veteran, Arrington has written books about presidential history and previously served at the James A. Garfield National Historic Site. Nothing in his record or interactions about the sword suggested someone trying to make a political point or otherwise grandstand. He’s just not that kind of guy.
When I reached him by phone Saturday, he was driving his father from the Wichita airport. Arrington still wasn’t quite sure what had happened.

Todd Arrington served as the director of the Dwight D. Eisenhower Presidential Library. (National Archives)

“I have no idea,” he said. “I don’t know. I never had any indication that anyone thought I’d done anything wrong. So what happened is a mystery to me. I have no idea. I would love to know. I have reached out to superiors at the National Archives, and I have not had anyone call me back.”
In our conversation, the former librarian was at pains to tell me that none of the national or local reporting about his departure had been 100% accurate. That’s catnip to a journalist like yours truly, who’s always on the search for untold stories.
Arrington didn’t single out any account for praise or blame, but he said he didn’t think President Donald Trump or First Lady Melania Trump had any inkling of issues with the sword.
“At no time did anyone express to me that the president or the first lady had anything to do with this,” he said. The former library director added that “I thought we provided some good service. We helped them find the thing they were looking for by getting them eventually to West Point.”
For reference, Eisenhower was raised in Abilene and served as Allied commander during World War II. He briefly served as president of Columbia University, helped found NATO and then served as president from 1953 to 1961. He was a moderate Republican, a sober statesman and an implacable foe of fascism. Who knows what he would make of this moment in history, or how he might advise his fellow Americans.
I’m no Ike, and you don’t have to like me. But I have some thoughts.
Throughout the past nine months, I’ve repeatedly urged my family, friends and Kansas Reflector readers to exercise caution with news media consumption. Not because we don’t live in challenging and scary times, but precisely because of that. When humans believe they’re under siege, they see threats everywhere. They’re more likely to believe scary stories of government overreach and brewing authoritarianism.
They might be right! Regardless, we live in an attention economy, driven by social media gadflies and AI slop. Commentators abound who will feed your fear no matter the facts. Be wary of them.
It may be that some MAGA world dispute drove Arrington’s forced resignation. But he doesn’t know that, and we don’t know that. Living with uncertainty is OK.
We can, however, reach some conclusions about those in the Trump administration. We know that at least a few people wanted to take a sword from a presidential library and use it as a gift for another country’s kind. We know that they were willing to do so regardless of federal law (read Anthony Clark’s in-depth account on his “The Last Campaign” blog).
This alone tells us a lot.
It tells us that the Trump administration sees the nation’s treasures and heritage as possessions of the president. It sees our shared institutions as storehouses of plunder that it can hand out to impress peers. Arrington’s refusal to meet that initial demand was principled and courageous. He showed good faith in helping locate a replacement blade, but I worry that gave the initial request more legitimacy than it deserved.
He had big plans for the library in Abilene. He was preparing for America’s 250th birthday next year and overseeing new initiatives.
“We were looking forward to a lot of success,” Arrington said. “We were planning a new film. So we were working with a great company to get a new film made. We were just looking into the future, both short term and long term.”
For now, Arrington has been left unemployed. As too often happens in today’s hyper-partisan world, headlines focus on firings and palace intrigue, while discounting the actual human cost.
“All I care about right now is I need to find a new job,” he said. “I have a wife. I have children. I am trying to pick up the pieces and find the next thing. I’ve told everybody I’ve talked to if there was any way to go back to this job, it really was a dream job for me. And if there’s a way to get back to it, I would love to do that. I don’t know if that’s possible, or if anybody would consider that, but that would be my best-case scenario.”
I hope that Arrington can continue to serve the people of Kansas. I fear that too many people think they know the punchline to let him do so.

While Maine doesn’t have any big ticket statewide races, there are two referendum questions that will go before all Maine voters, as well as numerous local races and referenda. 
Question 1 will ask voters if they want to make a series of changes to state election laws, including requiring voters to show certain photo ID when voting and adding restrictions to absentee voting.
Question 2 asks voters if they would like to implement a red flag law, officially called an Extreme Risk Protection Order, which would make it easier to temporarily confiscate one’s guns if they are deemed to be a threat by law enforcement or their family members.
Here are some details about in-person absentee voting in Maine.
Who can vote absentee?
Any eligible voter can request to vote absentee in Maine. No special circumstance or reason is required. Absentee ballots can be requested online, by mail or by calling the municipal clerk in the town or city where they are registered to vote.
As of Tuesday, more than 19,350 absentee ballots had been requested, per data from the Maine Secretary of State’s office, which will be regularly updated in the lead up to the election.
More than 7,200 ballots have been issued and none have been returned yet. Thirty-eight ballots have been rejected.
Here are the big questions that will appear on Maine’s November ballot

How do I find out details about where and when to vote absentee?
The hours and location details vary, based on the municipality where a person is registered to vote, but contact information for municipal clerks and registrars is available on the Secretary of State’s website.
Can I track my absentee ballot?
The Secretary of State has a new tracking system for voters to monitor the status of their absentee ballot.
When does absentee voting end?
An absentee ballot request must be received by the municipal clerk by the close of business on Thursday, October 30, unless special circumstances exist. Voted absentee ballots must be received by the municipal clerk by 8 p.m. on November 4, 2025

(Kristyna Dvouleta/Nebraska News Service)Nebraskans have spoken. If only some people would have listened. 
In November, Nebraska voters said no to Referendum 435, which repealed Legislative Bill 1402, a school voucher measure born in the state Legislature. 
Last week, however, Gov. Jim Pillen announced that the state would opt into a federal school voucher plan, part of H.R. 1, the Big Ugly, which Congress passed earlier this year. Among the celebrants joining him in sidestepping the will of Nebraska voters were U.S. Reps. Mike Flood and Adrian Smith, both of whom voted yes on H.R. 1.
This end run around Nebraska voters continues a troubling trend in the state where the voting public’s voice, in part, has been questioned, hedged — or, in this case, muted.
The federal plan, which starts in 2027, will allow up to $1,700 a year in federal tax credits to those donating to organizations providing scholarships for students to attend private and religious K-12 schools. To be eligible for scholarship funds, a family’s household income must not exceed 300% of the “area’s median household income.” According to census data, in Scottsbluff that makes eligible any family earning as much as $180,000 a year; in Gretna it’s $350,000.

During his enthusiastic endorsement of the opt-in, Pillen said Nebraskans “totally agree” on “school choice,” the PR term used to sell school voucher programs. Not sure from where he culled that data, because when Nebraskans spoke against school vouchers last November, they did so loudly, too. The final tally was 57% to 43%, a clear, decisive victory. Nor was the win an urban/rural split. The referendum carried only five of the state’s 49 legislative districts.
The governor also questioned the process, saying initiatives such as 435 are beholden to writers of big checks who pay to gather petition signatures to get initiatives on the ballot. While he’s right about modern petition gathering, you still have to get the votes once it’s there.
Governing by ballot initiative does have its own set of problems, not the least of which are time consumption and ballot language. Nevertheless, we shouldn’t forget that petition drives that end up on ballots are part of a process known in its origin story as a “redress of grievances” and are, like speech, religion, assembly and press, enshrined in the First Amendment of the Bill of Rights. 
Nor should Flood and Smith overestimate the popularity of the Big Ugly, which, according to a number of research firms including KFF and the Pew Research Center, remains underwater by  14 points to a whopping 29 points. Flood did not specifically tout this part of H.R. 1 when he held a town hall in Lincoln in early August. Maybe now we know why.
While the votes were the votes and the numbers are the numbers, the state will nonetheless be offering the federal voucher program to families in the state starting in 2027. As they did in last year’s campaign against 435, opponents such as Nebraska State Education Association president, Tim Royers, pointed out that the program “… diverts public resources into private systems without accountability or limits.” 
The federal dodge of last fall’s ballot box is on brand for a worrisome way the state has responded to voter intentions. In 2018, Nebraska voters chose to expand Medicaid coverage by a margin of 53.5% to 46.5%, not really close as elections go. Then-Gov. Pete Ricketts and his administration slow-walked the implementation of the law for nearly two years, using a series of add-ons and requirements that gummed up the works needed to enact what Nebraskans wanted … and said so via their votes.
Voters in 2022 passed a ballot initiative that incrementally raised the state’s minimum wage only to watch a concerted effort in the Legislature to weaken the language of the initiative and tack on exceptions, both of which ran contrary to the spirit and the details of ballot measure. 
In November 2024, over 75% of voters supported a ballot initiative requiring the state’s businesses to offer paid sick leave for employees. The Legislature intervened again, fiddling with portions of the initiative over the protests of some senators, unions and other labor groups, who argued once again that the Unicameral was diluting the chorus heard in the voting booth. 
The law went into effect last week.
No one is arguing Nebraska students shouldn’t have the best when it comes to educational opportunities. The way to achieve that, per those who took the time to vote, was not, however, school vouchers. Which, apparently went unheard — or ignored — in high places.

OTTAWA COUNTY — Chris Kleinjans still has the servant spirit inspiring him.
“My name is Chris Kleinjans and I’m a Democrat … yes, that Democrat. And I’m running to be your next state senator,” the Park Township resident says in his website’s campaign video.
The Ottawa County Democrat has announced his bid for Michigan’s 31st Senate seat, with current Republican Sen. Roger Victory terming out at the end of next year.
“I’m doing this because the system isn’t set up for people like me to run,” Kleinjans said. “So I run because I’m obstinate. Someone has to do it, I can do it really hard, I know how to do it, and I don’t mind losing another six months of life doing it. So here we go.”
Michigan’s 31st Senate District consists of portions of Allegan and Ottawa counties.

 An Ottawa County household name

Kleinjans surged into the forefront of Ottawa County politics in late 2023, when the county’s Democratic Party selected him as their candidate to run against an Ottawa Impact Republican on the county board of commissioners in a special recall election.
The recall targeted then-commissioner Lucy Ebel, a member of the far-right political group, and Kleinjans ultimately defeated her by a 20% margin in May 2024.
“It was a double-edged sword coming in the way that I came in, because there was a lot of animosity, a little bit of resentment, a little bit of grumpiness, a little bit of any number of things,” he said.
The victory was short-lived, however, when Kleinjans was fired from his job as a community nutritional instructor at Michigan State University’s Extension office just weeks later.
The school claimed his employment was “incompatible” with his newly elected office representing District 2 on the board of commissioners. Kleinjans claims he was fired from the school over political pressure from the far-right majority on the board.
He sued MSUE in June 2024, claiming the university violated his First Amendment rights when it gave him the ultimatum of taking an unpaid leave through the remainder of the year or face termination.
He later added the county as a defendant in the lawsuit after emails revealed that former board chair Joe Moss, OI’s founder and president, attempted to pressure MSUE to fire Kleinjans while he ran in the recall election campaign.
The lawsuit remains ongoing; Moss was re-elected to the board in November and no longer serves as chair.
“Thinking back on that period … any of us that followed it or were in it, it was wild,” Kleinjans said. “I mean, that November was just bananas. People’s passions were high, and when passions are high, things get weird.”
When Kleinjans filed the lawsuit, he was already in the midst of running for re-election, as the partial term he secured in May last year was set to expire at the end of the year.
He said he doesn’t want the lawsuit to distract from what he’s trying to offer to voters.
“I realize that people are going to ask me about this when I’m out canvassing, and I’m going to be out canvassing. It’s an unfortunate distraction,” he said. “Because really, when it comes down to the fundamentals and why I’m doing this, it’s based on what I’ve learned so far. It’s based on the good that serving the people can accomplish when it’s done in an honorable way. I still feel that what we’re doing is an honorable thing, and I feel it’ll turn out all right. It’s just taking longer than I thought.”
He said the wheels of justice move slowly, and civil lawsuits take time to sort out. Kleinjans’ lawsuit was one of more than half a dozen filed against the OI-led board in 2023 and 2024.
“Well, obviously I would rather have had this resolved, but if there’s anything worse than trying to get two lawyers to find a workable date for mediation, it’s getting three lawyers to find one,” Kleinjans said. “I’m still very confident in our claim, and everything that’s come out thus far only confirms what I was told by MSUE admin back in November of 2023 regarding the actions of former chair Moss and MSUE.”
In the November general election, Kleinjans lost to Republican Jordan Jorritsma by just 237 votes, and the totality of the previous months took their toll.
“After November, I was pretty bushed. It had been two complete campaigns back-to-back with an intense level of action right from the jump. We didn’t have a long runway to get things going — from the time the recall was certified,” he said.
Kleinjans was tired, but not deterred.
“I loved serving the county. It was exhausting, because it was like the hardest part-time job ever.”
 Why he’s giving elected office another shot

Kleinjans said he decided to jump back into politics because the 31st District seat in the Michigan Senate will be up for grabs in the fall 2026 election. He pointed to gains Democrats made in 2024, when Ottawa County bucked a statewide trend when it skewed two percentage points to the left.
“I looked at the returns after the election, and saw how locally Democrats outperformed the top of the Democratic ticket; 40% of this county is reliably Democratic voters,” he said.
He said, as a Democrat who has previously won a county seat — which he says puts him “in a really small club” — he knows what it takes to win.
“I’m a Democrat. I worked on a commission where I was one of two Democrats and it was a little bit frosty — because of the way that I came in,” he said. “But I didn’t spend all this equity and time and sweat and shoe leather helping move the Democratic Party forward in this county just to see everybody drop a ball on the midterms. It’s on like ‘Donkey Kong.’”
Kleinjans said that, even though he didn’t stay on the county commission, the experience he gained was invaluable.
“I think coming out of that whole environment of 2022 to 2024 really helped ground me and … always focus on the fact that it is the common good and it is the benefit of everybody,” he said. “I want to get us back to that level of governance, where we’re all cognizant of why we’re doing it, and we’re all willing to do a little bit of extra work for it, and to not have it be this coliseum-type event.
“You’re working on behalf of the people. You should be honored to do it — never take it for granted.”

 Why the state Senate?

Kleinjans said his experience at the county level helped him gain valuable skills that are sorely needed at the state and federal levels.
“I’ve worked alongside other elected officials who I didn’t agree with and certainly didn’t agree with me — and made no bones about the fact that they didn’t agree with me. You know, that’s important to have at that next level in Lansing — to have been in some really intense decisions and discussions and events, because it’s one thing to see it outside … it’s another one to be in the room,” he said.
“That kind of perspective is really important; it’s necessary to have that balance. Sometimes I think the reason that things are kind of the way they are now, in addition to all the other reasons, is that there’s not this kind of seasoning of starting out at a lower office and then going up to another higher office,” he said. “I think that what I can bring to it is a much more level-headed kind of approach. I really do try to believe in the best in people, because I think everybody deserves their shot, and everybody should have access to the tools they need to get where they want to get.”
He said the dysfunction in Washington and Lansing isn’t new, and that it’s important to focus on how to move forward.
“It’s a really weird time right now to be in politics. Sometimes it gets really loud,” he said. “If we can create a culture where we’re reminded that this is a service, I think we’ll get better results.”
He pointed to Democrats holding majorities in all three branches of government in Lansing from 2022 to 2024 as the natural “give and take” of the two-party system.
“Two years ago, when the Democrats had the trifecta, they got some things done. And yes, those were some things that didn’t really appeal to the GOP, but they were things that were part of the platform. However, there were a lot of things where there was a lot of agreement,” he said.
Republicans were able to make gains in both legislative houses in 2024, and now the GOP controls the House and Democrats have just a one-seat majority in the Senate.
“The Dems have the Senate barely right now; this is a chance for a hard-working person to get a pickup. And I know how to work hard,” Kleinjans said.
He said one of the things that he can offer to constituents is that he’s a listener.
“I’m a big fan of not saying a lot and listening, because I think that is something that has gotten lost in our culture where, if you’re not saying something, your relevance seems to decrease because of social media and stuff,” he said. “But I am a big fan of listening, and I’m a big fan of studying.”
He pointed to his background in history — he has degrees in youth services from Grand Rapids Community College, history and education from Grand Valley State University and a master’s in public administration from GVSU.
“Back when I was in college, one of my really good professors said being a good historian isn’t knowing everything about history. It’s knowing where to look,” he said. “A lot of people think that historians wander around with dates and people locked in their heads — and we do because we’re weird — but it’s knowing where to go, where to find the material and how to tell if the material is good that determines how interpreting history is accomplished.
“I feel it’s the same way in politics.”
 What would he do if elected?

Kleinjans said he has three main goals that he wants to discuss while on the campaign trail: housing, mental health care and food security, particularly for children.
“I don’t see a lot of the things that I support as being incredibly partisan,” he said. “We all want houses. We all want a strong and robust CMH system that takes care of our residents. We all don’t want kids hungry at school. These are things that I feel are good jumping-off points. The difference is in the approach.”
Kleinjans is passionate about creating solutions for the housing crisis that plagues most parts of the country, West Michigan included.
“Even before it cost an additional 20% to build a house, which we now have to deal with because of the tariffs, housing was and is expensive; developments are expensive. It’s an incredibly complex beast,” he said. “I have yet to meet someone who says that we’ve got just enough housing. If anything, I want my kids to live closer. I want my grandkids to live closer. I don’t want my kid living in my basement. We all see the need.”
He applied to serve on the Ottawa County Housing Commission; the new moderate Republican majority, along with the four OI commissioners who remain on the board, voted against adding Kleinjans to the subcommittee when they made appointments at the beginning of the year.
“I don’t see a lot of the things that I support as being incredibly partisan. We all want houses. We all want a strong and robust CMH system that takes care of our residents. We all don’t want kids hungry at school. These are things that I feel are good jumping-off points. The difference is in the approach.” — Chris Kleinjans
“What I wanted to do, at that point, was blow up the Ottawa County Housing Commission, metaphorically speaking,” he said, “and really bring a lot of people to the table — a lot more people.”
He said housing should be a conversation between all stakeholders, including the nonprofits, the developers, the funders, the municipalities and the state.
“You want Lakeshore Habitat. You want Jubilee. And you want Dwelling Place … but you also want, for example, someone from Wolverine [Construction]. You want some people from the larger financial groups that can be the top-line funder for some programs.
“You want a big table, because this is an incredibly complex issue,” he said.
Kleinjans, who has a 25-year history working in the nonprofit sector — including the development of educational programming for the Holland Historical Trust and his time at MSUE — currently works as the housing community impact officer for the Allegan County Community Foundation.
He said the state local units of government can work on adjusting zoning laws to accommodate new developments, but the state also has a role to play.
“If a municipality wanted to do some work on zoning to make things a little bit … more development-friendly, maybe there’s a way to come in and assist with that so that it reduces build costs. The state is helping prime the pump a little bit to get those things going,” he said. “There’s a lot of statewide entities that are leaning into helping local units do the work.”
He said housing will continue to be one of the most pressing issues the state and, more importantly, his district, will face.
“We have a Senate district that has a lot of ALICE population,” he said, referencing those residents who are classified as asset limited, income constrained and employed, meaning they earn more than the federal poverty level, but still struggle to afford the basic cost of living, such as housing, food and healthcare.
“That is a population that is pretty consistently paying more than 30% of their monthly income towards their housing, which puts them in a really delicate situation,” Kleinjans said. “We need to be more engaged and more interconnected with the discussion of getting housing everywhere, literally everywhere, and as a state, raise the amount of stock, and in doing so, kind of drop some of the prices and create an environment where everybody has housing that’s accessible to their income as well as their location.
He said development can be a touchy subject in many communities, as existing residents are resistant to change and expansion.
“That’s a tough conversation, because zoning is hyper-local and hyper-passionate, but it’s important to not let the heat of the crowd, as we’ve sometimes seen in local politics, detract from the long-term good for the project,” Kleinjans said. “I feel that if the Legislature leans in a little bit more, they can help facilitate making some of those conversations easier.”
He also said developments should be discussed at length with communities to get early buy-in, rather than quick approval with little discussion.
“I’m a big believer that these conversations take place over months, not hours, and you want to make sure that everyone’s bought in,” he said. “I think we can do some stuff to encourage local units of government to reinvestigate their zoning to create the things that allow for a wider variety of housing styles and types to be built where there’s already infrastructure.”
Kleinjans is also passionate about community mental health, having previously served on Ottawa County’s CMH board of directors both before and during his tenure as a commissioner.
He said cuts championed by the Trump Administration in July and approved by congressional Republicans include significant funding cuts and policy changes to Medicaid and the Health Insurance Marketplaces, Medicare physician payment and medical student loans, among other health care-related items, all of which will worsen patient access to care, according to the American Medical Association.
“CMH funding relies quite a bit on Medicaid, which flows through [the Department of Health and Human Services] and into the counties, through the Lakeshore Regional Entity,” Kleinjans explained. “That system, which came about after the last period of economic instability 25 years ago, resulted in the regionalization and the operation under the LRE. Now we’re looking at it and going, ‘Oh, well, this isn’t right.’”
He said the state government can help in conducting better oversight of the departments for which it has purview.
“I am not at all a big fan of privatizing components of the mental health system. I have yet to see anything that’s privatized that worked — that operated either more efficiently or more economically than a government service, particularly when it comes to health care and mental health care,” he said.
He pointed to Ottawa County being unique in that it was one of the first counties in the state to approve a county-wide mental health millage, but the millage has limitations.
“The county millage was a groundbreaker when it was passed. It was designed for a very specific use, and it was designed to specifically handle things that weren’t Medicaid-eligible,” he said. “Well, if Medicaid isn’t covering what needs to be covered, the millage is kind of like a blanket that’s just a little bit too short — you can stretch it and pull it and it can do different things, but it can’t quite cover what you really needed to cover.”
He said even if county voters were to re-approve the millage when it appears on ballots in 2026, there will still be an existing “untenable system.”
“What I’d like to see from the state level is a top-down sort of assessment of how we’re doing this,” Kleinjans said. “A Medicaid-eligible person who’s 65 and above is a very different individual than an 18-year-old who is becoming an adult and has a severe cognitive impairment and is going to need complex and nuanced services for the remainder of their life.
“Those differentials are something that needs to be addressed. Do we have the ability at the state level to address these concerns? Or come up with mechanisms within the state to make up that difference? Or is it always going to be a 1-to-1 ratio?”
He also pointed to the rise in autism diagnosis rates, as doctors and researchers are learning more about the neurodevelopmental disorder.
“With the rise in the ability to diagnose autism earlier, and the realization that autism is a multifaceted, nuanced thing that requires a wide modality of treatment options to assist people with being as successful as they can be, these conversations are things I feel we should have as a state,” Kleinjans said. “This is something we owe our residents.”
He said his political and career experiences uniquely position him to help in that space.
“I’ve spent time in Lansing with my new position, doing advocacy and things like that, and when you talk as two people that want to get something done, and you’re doing it with a little bit of humility, you can get some good things … you can approach each other with a little bit more humanity and grace,” he said.
Kleinjans also said that although state officials finally approved a budget last week — which funded meals in schools — the issue needs to stop being a political football every time the budget comes around and the party in power changes.
“I was very disappointed when the state House removed the free breakfast and lunch program that had been implemented just a couple of years earlier, when the Democrats had the trifecta,” he said, referencing House Republican efforts to strip the funding prior to the budget’s approval.
“I worked in schools a lot in my previous work with my employer, and when I was working in nutrition education, I witnessed firsthand the impact that well-fed students have on the culture of a school,” he said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ONN-Chris-Kleinjans-4638.jpg,,,2025-10-06 14:58:21.067469

The Maryland Food Bank is bracing for a surge in business, one of many agencies looking to help federal workers during the government shutdown. (Photo by Airman Gavin Hameed/U.S. Air Force)The Maryland Food Bank is monitoring traffic at food pantries across the state, its network of about 800 community partners — anticipating a rise in federal workers and contractors hit by the federal government shutdown, which currently has no end in sight.
As the shutdown continues, missing paychecks and the potential pause of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) support could lead to a surge of patrons at food banks around the state, said Chloe Woodward-Magrane, Maryland Food Banks director of communications.
“People should not go hungry because something is happening with their job,” Woodward-Magrane said.
The food bank is just one of businesses, government agencies and nonprofits that have mobilized since last Wednesday when the government shutdown began, an event with an outsized effect in Maryland, where the economy relies heavily on federal spending.
The shutdown threatens the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of federal workers, many of whom were sent home Wednesday morning. Even those who are still coming to work because they were deemed essential workers — airport security, health care workers, customs workers and the like — are feeling the pinch, as they will work without pay until the shutdown ends.
Moore vows to keep some federal programs in Maryland operating – for now

Maryland is home to about 260,000 federal workers and 200,000 federal contractors, and has lost more than 15,000 federal jobs since the Trump Administration took office, according to an email sent Wednesday by the governor’s office.
“Shutdowns don’t just stop the government — they shortchange the people who need it most,” Lt. Gov. Aruna K. Miller said in the email.
As the Maryland Food Bank braces for an influx of federal workers and contractors, other groups are stepping forward to help ease the burden for federal workers during the uncertainty of the shutdown.
Utility protections
Utility companies are prohibited from turning off gas or electric services of impacted workers during a government shutdown or within seven days of the shutdown’s conclusion, according to a statement from the Maryland Public Service Commission. Those who are involuntarily furloughed or who are not paid during the shutdown are eligible.
In a letter to utilities Wednesday, Gov. Wes Moore urged companies to “go further” by exploring payment plans or suspending residential shutoffs during the shutdown, as opposed to requiring customers to reach out to companies themselves. He said that would help lessen the stress of “families who are already facing significant financial stress and uncertainty.”
“Taking this proactive step would demonstrate true corporate citizenship and provide a crucial safety net for all Marylanders, alleviating the need for impacted federal workers to negotiate individually,” Moore wrote in the letter.
WSSC Water, which provides water and sewer service to Montgomery and Prince George’s counties, on Wednesday suspended water turnoffs and waived late fees for federal workers impacted by the shutdown, according to Lyn Riggins, a spokesperson for the utility.
WSSC is also extending its “Get Current” program through November instead of its previous expiration date at the end of October. The program forgives a portion of customers’ balances and waives late payment charges and turn-on fees.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE“While we are a large entity providing critical services, we’re also your neighbor,” said Riggins. “Anything that we can do to help our customers, to help our neighbors — this is what we can offer right now, and hopefully it will ease a little bit of the burden.”
Baltimore Gas and Electric and Pepco, two Exelon gas companies, said they are offering flexible payment options, late payment charge waivers, personalized bill assistance and streamlined verification that does not require proof of government identification.
Housing Protections
Moore, in another letter Wednesday, reminded state judges of a 2019 law that requires Maryland courts to temporarily pause mortgage foreclosures and evictions for federal workers who face a loss of pay during a shutdown.
“The Moore-Miller Administration is committed to ensuring that Maryland families, especially our dedicated federal workforce, are shielded from the consequences of inaction at the federal level,” the letter said.
Credit Union Support
As of Friday, 27 credit unions associated with the MD|DC Credit Union Association had offered assistance programs, such as short-term relief programs, low-rate credit cards, payment deferrals, fee waivers and financial counseling.
“Credit unions have a history of stepping up to serve their members in challenging times,” said John Bratsakis, president and CEO of the association. “We want members to know that credit unions are here with flexible options and solutions to help them through this federal government shutdown.”
How the federal shutdown is playing out across the government

Loan and Job Assistance
Moore announced other resources for Maryland workers impacted by the federal shutdown on Wednesday, including unemployment insurance, housing and utility protections, loan programs and resources for veterans.
“The federal government is stepping away from its basic obligations to Maryland and our people. But despite the challenge, our resolve is unwavering,” Moore said in Wednesday’s email. “I encourage federal government workers to take full advantage of these resources.”
Those who are working without pay during the shutdown can apply for a short-term $700 no-interest loan for essential expenses through the Federal Shutdown Loan program, starting Monday. The loan must be repaid within 45 days of the conclusion of the shutdown.

(Photo by Rosanne Skirble)Abel Olivo wasn’t sure how many people would show up for the fifth annual version of the Latino Leadership Summit held each fall, sponsored by Defensores de la Cuenca — Defenders of the Watershed — a group he leads.
Given the anxiety in the Latino immigrant community over deportations, he feared many would just stay home.
But whatever fears there may have been could not keep a crowd of 100 participants from turning out at Seneca State Park last month for panel discussions, workshops, dancing and a celebration of environmental achievements within their ranks.
Olivo, the founding director of Defensores, said attendance went beyond his expectations, surpassing all previous years.
“That’s a testament to the hard work that we have put in over the years, establishing a level of trust among our participants,” Olivo said. “They felt they were in a safe space.”
Olivo began Defensores in 2020 to connect Latino communities in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. He concedes that it was “strange that one would want to start a new endeavor in a pandemic. But the need to address these longstanding environmental, social and economic injustices was just too great not to take action.”
A fourth-generation Mexican American, Olivo has guided that vision into a robust organization, with a full calendar of events that attracts families to the region’s parks. They, in turn, serve as the backdrop for entry into a suite of programs for participants of all ages.

Defensores Academy trains adult community leaders. Its Youth Corps promotes environmental stewardship among young people and the Defensores Tree Ambassadors are foot soldiers in the urban forest, charged with finding places to host and care for trees. Fifty-two ambassadors have run through its classroom certification. More than half were recognized at the summit.
“This year we have a goal [to plant] 2,000 trees in underserved areas,” Olivo said, citing the 2021 Tree Solutions Now Act, legislation that called for planting 5 million native trees across the state, with at least 500,000 of those in marginalized neighborhoods.
The Sept. 11 event was not entirely without a nod to current circumstances: Olivo said a know-your-rights workshop was inserted in the day-long summit.
“Part of leadership is being knowledgeable about the issues of our time and knowing how to navigate various situations and how to incorporate and address those for the benefit of ourselves and others,” he said.
Chispa, a spark for environmental justice
Among the panelists was Ramón Palencia-Calvo, director of Chispa Maryland, a grassroots program of the League of Conservation Voters Education Fund. He said the group’s mission “is to ensure Latino families have strong leadership and power to identify and influence environmental policies and decisions that affect their lives.”
“Our hope is an environmental movement that is inclusive and just, where there is a diversity of voices, those voices are respected as equals, and we want to see those diverse voices leading the movement,” Palencia-Calvo said.
Among Chispa’s most effective advocates are the “promotores” or promoters, members of the Latino community brought together for skills workshops, where they get the tools they need to address pollution where they live.  Many of its 125 graduates continue this work in committees established across Maryland.
Palencia-Calvo says these activities are ongoing, adjusting to political realities by meeting online or in safe places.
“One of the things that we bring to this moment is solidarity, how communities come together, regardless of where they were born, regardless of the language they speak,” he said, “they come together to support a healthy environment for their families and for their communities.”

Immigrant activist
In that chorus of diversity sits Linda Flores. A physical therapist by training, the El Salvador immigrant came to the United States in 2012 to escape violence, gang activity and extortion in her home country. She is a field worker with the Latino Health Initiative in Montgomery County and has certificates from both Defensores de la Cuenca and Chispa Maryland.
While it is a difficult moment for the community, she says, it hasn’t stopped her from taking immigrant concerns to decision-makers in Annapolis as part of Chispa’s ongoing campaign to replace diesel buses with electric ones.
“We brought our cardboard buses [to Annapolis] and my girls were there, demanding that our political representatives [buy] more electric buses, she said.
She is unafraid to speak out at public events.
“No, I’m not afraid. I served the community during the pandemic, which was a matter of life or death,” she said. “And, now, I have [again] a strong need to serve, and feel like God is protecting me.”
Palencia-Calvo of Chispa — Spanish for “spark” — says that in this work, at this time, connections matter.
“We also have relied and continue to rely very much on partnerships and coalitions, working together with other groups to move the work forward, to continue providing opportunities for engagement and participation.”
Juntos somos más — together we are more
Walkiria Pool is among Chispa’s most powerful allies. An immigrant from the Dominican Republic shortly after high school, Pool comes to the table armed with degrees in psychology and economic development, as well as two decades of experience working with marginalized communities.
In 2006, she founded Centro de Apoyo Familiar (CAF) or Center for Assistance for Families. Her idea was to tap leaders of faith in the immigrant community.

“By empowering them, connecting them with resources, and educating them so that their congregants, who have so much trust in them, could receive the assistance they needed in an integrated way,” she said.
What began in Massachusetts, expanded to Maryland, Washington, D.C., Northern Virginia and Puerto Rico, serving more than 55,000 low-income and immigrant families each year with food distribution, environmental and health and justice initiatives, and housing opportunities.
CAF is also the co-anchor of the Mid-Atlantic Justice Coalition, a statewide-organization focused on economic and environmental justice.
“We have over 40 groups that work on public policies, legislation, education, community engagement, capacity building and fundraising,” Pool said, adding that together they coordinate priorities and advocacy.
Pool says among those priorities in for 2026 is the re-introduction of the CHERISH Our Communities Act, a bill that would reform Maryland’s permitting system to better protect neighborhoods that already face a heavy burden of pollution. She says, their voices matter.
“[They] have the right to approve who does or does not enter their community,” Pool said.
Pool acknowledges these are difficult times to be an immigrant. She tells the majority Latino summit that it is their combined strength that can lift barriers to climate justice.
“We have leaders, committed young people, and a collaborative spirit among us,” she said. “Juntos somos más; together we are more.”

Unemployment rates are creeping up, especially in the public-service sector, and, like many others, Florida’s current governor will soon be out of a job.
He’s got only 15 months left to ride the taxpayer gravy train.
Once a promising presidential candidate, accustomed to hearing himself called “DeFuture,” Ron DeSantis will be DeThroned, DeMoted, DeFunct.
In common with thousands of recently — or soon to be — laid-off government workers, he may experience DePression.
Rumor is he harbors ambitions to again run for the White House — assuming there are elections in 2028.
The problem with this plan is that in 2024, America met him and America said, “Oh, hell no.”
DeSantis was a truly, epically, terrible candidate. They had to remind him to smile.
Polls show him favored by only 10% of Republican voters: Ahead of Marco Rubio but way, way behind J.D. Vance.
When people think you’re weirder than J.D. Vance, you might want to adjust your ambitions and rethink your career path.
Perhaps go for something a little more realistic.
Never fear: DeSantis has plenty of options.
He prides himself in making sure Florida is “Open for Business,” so why not open a business?
Maybe a surf shop in his hometown of Dunedin: Ron Ron.
Sure, Ron Jon might sue, but DeSantis is a lawyer: He can surely handle it.
Speaking of the law, as long as he keeps his bar license current, why not practice whatever it was he learned at Harvard?
Oh, maybe that’s not such a good idea. Lawyers, even Florida lawyers, are expected to perform a certain amount of pro bono work every year, representing the poor and the powerless.
DeSantis doesn’t much like the poor and the powerless.
The university option
Still, he could open a boutique firm, specializing in suing school librarians, middle school teachers, college professors, and anyone else who smells “woke” to him.
Shoot, he could become a college professor himself!
Evidently anyone can.
Seems politicians finding themselves between elected gigs can always find a university home.
Mike Haridopoulos, who now represents the Space Coast in Congress, used to teach at UF and Brevard Community College.
When Secretary of State Marco Rubio got term-limited out of the Florida Legislature, Florida International University paid him 23 grand a year to teach one class — around seven times what your average adjunct pulls in per course.
Maybe DeSantis could teach a political science class called “Authoritarianism for Fun and Profit.”
Other washed-up politicos, including Richard Corcoran, Manny Diaz Jr., and Jeannette Nuñez, all scored top jobs as university presidents. DeSantis could, too.
All he has to do is push somebody out, the way he did at New College or at the University of West Florida, and “suggest” he’s obviously the best possible choice. Given that he appointed most of Florida universities’ boards of trustees, it’s a safe bet he’d get what he wants.
But perhaps he’d prefer to reconnect with those “blue-collar” roots he’s always talking about and do something a bit less exhausting than the day-to-day business of firing academics for mentioning race and gender.
How about opening his own specialty restaurant?
He could lean into Donald Trump’s affectionate nickname for him: Call it Meatball Ron’s Fine Dining, home of the No-Lab-Meat Polpette.
He likes to say that while he grew up in Tampa Bay, his true home is the Rust Belt of his parents’ Ohio.
You know, declining Industrial Heartland, home of Real Americans (Real American places do not have beaches, leggy pink birds, or free-range Burmese pythons), casseroles, corn fields, Vice President J.D. Vance, and rampant addiction to opioids.
He could sell farm equipment. Foster our amber waves of grain.
Only thing is, farmers can’t afford tractors. John Deere is losing money and laying off workers, thanks to tariffs on steel and aluminum, retaliatory Chinese tariffs on soybeans, and diminished crop sales owing to Trump’s gutting of USAID.
Back to the roots
On second thought, maybe DeSantis could sell fish bait.
Given the rate of inflation at the grocery store, a lot of us may soon have to start catching our own dinner.
Or go back to his first, best love, baseball, at which — as he reminds us on every other page of his memoir — he was really good, awesomely good.
Luckily, the Jacksonville Jumbo Shrimp, a beloved minor league team located in the governor’s birthplace, are hiring everything from Kid Zone Attendant to Assistant Concessions Manager.
Some day he could even try out for the team.
It would be like a movie!
Maybe not.
DeSantis claims he cares about Florida’s economy, so why not contribute to our agriculture industry?
Given the mass deportations and immigrants’ fears they’ll be dragged off by ICE, even if they’re legally here, Florida farmers can’t find people to harvest their crops.
Strawberry fields forever — also tomatoes, cucumbers, cabbages, and cane.
The governor clearly thinks 12-hour days in our world-renowned Florida sunshine build character: A bill he signed last year bans local government from requiring employers to give workers water and heat breaks.
But let’s get real real. While Ron DeSantis likes to talk up learning a trade instead of getting a degree from a snooty college (or, in his case, two snooty colleges) where you will undoubtedly become a Marxist follower of that Imp of Satan Greta Thunberg, he bleached that blue collar long ago.
In other words, Ordinary Joe jobs won’t cut it.
The man doesn’t fly commercial.
There’s always Disney World
Anyway, he might not leave Tallahassee at all.
It all depends on his wife, and, maybe, his hand-picked Number Two.
Jay Collins, former state senator, former Green Beret, a man whom DeSantis calls “the Chuck Norris of Florida Politics,” says he and his family have been “praying about” his running for governor.
Collins also says he would consider the “brilliant” Casey DeSantis as his running mate.
Floridians will have Thoughts about this.
First of all, Florida’s First Lady has not ruled out her own run for governor, even though the Current Occupant of the White House has endorsed the 30-watt U.S. Rep. Byron Donalds, giving him a large advantage with Florida MAGAs.
She has other political liabilities too, including $10 million in Medicaid overbilling settlement money “donated” to Hope Florida, a charity she founded, which mysteriously (and illicitly) ended up going to an outside PAC.
Investigations continue.
Collins has his own problems. He rejects “the woke mind virus,” but, as right-wing news site “Florida’s Voice” has reported, at Operation BBQ Relief (they provide barbecue meals to disaster victims), the charity he worked for, he was in charge of overseeing their robust DEI policies.
As the few remaining Floridians who aren’t too exhausted to care have noticed, Collins has yet to formally announce his candidacy.
Meanwhile, the seas rise, the heat gets more intense, the water gets dirtier, the rich get richer, the poor can’t afford to go to the doctor, library shelves get emptier, public schools crumble, and people get fired for exercising their First Amendment rights on social media.
This is the Florida DeSantis will bequeath us.
If he and Casey fail to hold onto political power in this state, perhaps they’d like to move to Ohio and immerse themselves in that rich Rust Belt culture.
Or, if all else fails, there’s always Disney World.
Surely, they’d hire him to play a character. Donald Duck, maybe? Or Pluto?
Walking around in one of those big heads, nobody can tell if you forget to smile.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-06 04:01:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Why CT needs single-stair reform,Amit Kamma,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/06/why-ct-needs-single-stair-reform/,A move allowing single-stair exits in five-story buildings is being negated by extremely restrictive fire department staffing and capacity requirements.,"Across Connecticut, outdated fire safety regulations are blocking new homes and exacerbating our cost-of-living crisis. Right now, any residential building taller than three stories must have at least two staircases. That may sound harmless, but the rule drives up construction costs, makes it harder to build on small lots, and prevents many types of critical “missing middle” homes, especially in our town and city centers.
In 2024, Connecticut lawmakers passed “single-stair” reform, aiming to fix this lag in our building codes. While dozens of cities nationwide had already enacted single-stair reform, Connecticut was the first state to actively pass legislation calling for statewide reform, an exciting moment of leadership for us. The legislation directed the State Building Inspector to raise the three-story height limit for new residential buildings with a single staircase, making it possible to build more types of multifamily housing. This reform reflects a modern, safe design approach already in use worldwide, as well as in American states from Virginia to Oregon. But as other states move forward with strong, effective reforms, Connecticut now risks falling short in our execution. 
Last month, the State Building Inspector’s office released draft updates to the codes that attempted to implement the reform. These proposed amendments remain open for public comment until October 11. On paper, the proposal raises the single-stair building height limit from three to five stories. In reality, it buries the change under extremely restrictive fire department staffing and capacity requirements for any town that wants to have such housing.
One mandate, for example, says that a fire department’s “initial full alarm assignment [must] include a minimum of 28 staff,” an unworkable requirement that even relatively large towns with professional fire departments like Meriden and Danbury cannot meet. These requirements will make many otherwise viable constructions impossible, undercutting the reform’s very purpose: to create more homes.
These restrictions in the August draft reflect a common but misguided concern: that taller single-stair buildings are unsafe in fires. The evidence says the opposite. Modern multifamily homes, including single-stair ones, comprise the safest housing stock in America. A recent Pew report found that multifamily homes built since 2010 have one-fifteenth the fire death rate of single-family homes or apartments built pre-2000. Why? New multifamily homes are built with strict requirements to utilize modern life-saving technology, like fire-rated materials, sprinklers, and self-closing doors. For single-stair buildings specifically, Pew found that after New York City passed reform in 2012, the rate of fire deaths in its 4,440 modern single-stair buildings remained the same as in other new residential buildings, which is to say, quite low.
If Connecticut wants to improve fire safety, the answer isn’t to block opportunities to build modern, multifamily housing, but to create more of them. Reforming outdated single-stair rules will make it easier to construct more new multifamily housing and redevelop older properties, which would be categorically safer than most of Connecticut’s existing housing stock, which is the sixth-oldest among U.S. states. In other words, effective single-stair reform doesn’t just promote affordability-—it actively improves fire safety in Connecticut by shifting residents from aging housing to modern buildings with better regulations. The fire community should be leading the charge for this reform.
Connecticut needs a practical and workable code update that matches the intent of the 2024 reform by helping us unlock more types of homes across the state. That means removing the stringent fire department requirements in the current proposed amendment. Otherwise, Connecticut towns won’t be able to adopt this reform, and our housing affordability crisis will deepen while our housing stock continues to age. Lawmakers took the right step in passing single-stair reform. Now, regulators need to follow through and craft codes that balance affordability and safety. 
Done right, single-stair reform can simultaneously expand housing choices and improve fire safety —a win that Connecticut cannot afford to squander.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) EARLING — A mostly red-clad audience at a barn in Shelby County on Sunday asked Republicans, hopeful for the governor’s seat, about the carbon sequestration pipeline and associated concerns of eminent domain. 
The event was also in support of Rep. Steven Holt, R-Denison, and featured state representatives who have been active in opposing the Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline project. 
Lawmakers spoke about their plans to continue opposing the pipeline that would transport sequestered carbon dioxide from ethanol plants in Iowa and surrounding states to underground storage in North Dakota. 
​”Let the words go out from this place in this day: No eminent domain for private gain in the state of Iowa,” Holt said, opening the event. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Holt, along with Rep. Charley Thomson, R-Charles City, have been central to proposing and pushing legislation aimed at limiting the abilities of carbon sequestration pipeline companies to use eminent domain.
In the spring, the duo sponsored several bills that were eventually wrapped into House File 639, which the Senate passed after significant debate on the floor. The bill, which Gov. Kim Reynolds vetoed, caused controversy and disagreement among the Iowa Republican Party. 
Holt said all Republican candidates who have said they plan to run for governor were invited. Rep. Eddie Andrews, R-Johnston, former Iowa Representative Brad Sherman, and former Director of the Iowa Department of Administrative Services Adam Steen, attended the event and spoke about their plans if elected governor. 
U.S. Rep. Randy Feenstra is also running for the Republican slot on the ticket and Sen. Mike Bousselot, R-Ankeny, launched an exploratory committee for governor but has not said if he is officially running. 
Andrews says pipeline issue would end ‘day one’ if elected
Andrews, a Republican representing urban Polk County, where the Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline would not cross, has also been a vocal opponent to the pipeline. While he spoke Sunday, Andrews had a slideshow of selfies he has taken over the years with various landowners at the capitol.
Andrews said he’s often asked why he cares about the issue — which pushed him to run for governor — even though it hardly impacts his constituents. 
“When I raised my right hand to defend the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the State of Iowa, it was to defend property rights and not to add to the pocket of Bruce Rastetter,” Andrews said, referencing the founder of the Summit Agricultural Group which founded Summit Carbon Solutions. 
Rep. Eddie Andrews, who is running to be a Republican candidate for governor, speaks at an event Oct. 5, 2025. (Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)
Andrews said he would support a bill, like one that was enacted in South Dakota, that blocks eminent domain for carbon sequestration pipelines. Andrews said he would also like to pass a constitutional amendment that would “really address property rights.” 
He said he would also support reform for the Iowa Utilities Commission, including an effort to remove the utility’s authority over eminent domain. 
“It disgusts me, quite honestly, that we’ve collectively allowed this to go on so far,” Andrews said. “This will end on day one , if I’m governor, if not before.” 
Sherman calls for transparency, and principles 
Sherman has been a pastor for more than 40 years and served in the Iowa House of Representatives from January 2023 through January this year. 
He called the Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline a “boondoggle” and said the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is regulated by the plants that convert it into oxygen and that carbon dioxide is “not hurting our atmosphere.”
Sherman said he would support a bill blocking eminent domain for CO2 pipelines, if he were elected.

Sherman said a major part of his efforts, if elected governor, would be to put the “founding principles” of the nation into the educational system. 
“So the people know that rights come from God, not government, the purpose of government is to protect those rights, and that the people then understand how to preserve their own freedoms,” Sherman said. 
Sherman also called for “total transparency” on government spending. For example, he alleged some big school districts spent taxpayer money to hire multiple diversity equity and inclusion directors. 
“And of course, we know what DEI is,” Sherman said. 
Sherman said total transparency in the government would alleviate some property tax issues. 
“I think if people could see what’s going on, they would make some – demand some — changes,” Sherman said. “… If the government gets out of the way, business people will get it done. Government doesn’t need to tell people how to run a business, it just needs to get out of the way and get rid of regulations.” 
Steen says it’s time for an awakening
Steen served as Reynolds’ director of the Iowa Department of Administrative Services from 2021 until his recent resignation to pursue the Republican nomination for governor. 
Steen was part of Reynolds’ staff when HF 639 was vetoed, but said the decision was outside his purview. Now no longer part of the staff, Steen said he was “shocked and surprised” by the governor’s veto. 
Steen said he has three farms in his family and would “fight for the rights of Iowans every step of the way.”

“Ain’t no way a private entity is going to abuse eminent domain on my watch,” Steen said. “There’s no chance.” 
Steen also said the pipeline issue and the other issues facing the state of Iowa are examples of “evil infiltrating politics in a way that we have never seen before.” 
Steen, who has labeled himself as a “faith guy” running for governor, said he noticed this when he started living his life intentionally. 
“I didn’t become woke, but I woke up and realized that America is under attack. Iowa is under attack,” Steen said. 
He said Iowa needs someone who will say “enough is enough.” 
Steen said the situation that led to the arrest and detainment of former Des Moines Public Schools Superintendent Ian Roberts, is “insanity at its highest level.” 
Roberts was detained by U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement Sept. 26 and DMPS has since learned the immigrant from Guyana was in the country unlawfully. 
“That doesn’t happen, that doesn’t happen unless it’s a DEI hire that has been infiltrated by the enemy,” Steen said. 
Steen said his priorities if elected would include fixing property taxes, prioritizing skilled labor, “bringing the family back to the dinner table” and reaching up to “revitalize and shake up the local church.” 
“You got somebody who knows how to work with the Legislature, you got somebody who’s going to be a champion for culture, and you got somebody who knows how to operate the state day one,” Steen said. 
Steen said he believes Reynolds is the “best governor the state’s ever had,” but he said he is not “Governor Reynolds, 2.0.” 
Pipeline fight continues for another year 
At the Sunday event, Holt called on the Iowa Senate to pass a bill restricting eminent domain on CO2 pipelines and for the governor to support the bill. He said there were already a number of bills in the works for the upcoming legislative session. 
Thomson called the Summit pipeline project a “dagger aimed at the heart of what it means to be an Iowan” and later a “parasite” on Iowa’s government. 
Summit filed, in September, a petition to amend part of its permit from the Iowa Utilities Commission, and allow the company to explore a different ending location for the pipeline, which is currently slated to end in North Dakota.
 Thomson said the filing has the “smell of desperation.” 
Thomson said while the governor and certain members of the Senate did not act the way he had hoped, but said the previous session forced the “other side” to come “out of the bushes.” 
Thomson said this will be an advantage moving forward. 
Some of the dozen GOP senators who refused to vote on vital budget bills until the Senate debated, and ultimately passed, a bill related to restrictions for hazardous liquid pipelines and the use of eminent domain, were also present at the Sunday event.

Steve Kenkel, a fifth-generation Shelby County landowner who formerly served as a Shelby County supervisor, hosted the event at his farm.
Shelby County, along with Story County, passed county ordinances related to pipeline setbacks and other regulations in response to the pipeline. Summit sued the counties over the ordinances and federal judges sided with Summit in the case. The county supervisors filed a petition for certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court to review the case. 
Kenkel thanked the landowners, lawmakers and groups that have spent time opposing the pipeline, these people he said are the “protectors” of private property rights in the state. 
“We can’t do this by ourselves,” Kenkel said. “So I’m putting a challenge out there to you and the entire state of Iowa … when you go to the polls this next year, and following years, you do your homework and you find out who the protectors are for property rights.”

Yes, and in Hattiesburg, B.R. “Mac” McClendon, a rookie playing his first professional golf tournament, won the first Magnolia Classic, defeating 53-year-old Pete Fleming in a nine-hole, sudden-death playoff at the Hattiesburg Country Club. 
McClendon, fresh out of LSU where he was a three-time Southeastern Conference golf champion, won a not-so-grand total of $2,800 for his efforts. He birdied the ninth hole, his 45th of the day, at dusk, as car lights shone brightly from the parking lot just behind the green.
Few, if any, of us present that damp spring evening in Hattiesburg would have ever believed the little tournament with such humble beginnings would endure for 57 years, but it has.
Fast-forward to Sunday’s breezy, cloudy afternoon at the Country Club of Jackson in the final round of perhaps the final Sanderson Farms Championship. Steven Fisk, a 28-year-old Georgian, fired an 8-under-par 64 with birdies on the final three holes to win the tournament that began so long ago as the Magnolia Classic. First prize this time? Just over a million bucks. The late Mac McClendon surely wouldn’t have believed that.
Just as had happened 57 years before, Sunday’s final round came down to a two-man shootout. Fisk and South African Garrick Higgo trading birdies until Fisk birdied the final three holes with a remarkable display of grit and pinpoint accuracy. 
“I know I’m good enough,” Fisk said immediately afterward. “I knew I could do it. It’s a lifelong dream, honestly. Sometimes you doubt yourself, but I just knew I could do it. Nothing was going to stop me from doing what I wanted today.”
A former Georgia Southern golfer, Fisk turned professional in 2019, but his early professional career was slowed – and threatened, really – by a condition in his left hand called carpometacarpal bossing. If that sounds serious, it was. The injury required surgery and then a change in his golf swing to prevent further problems. Fisk persevered.
Perseverance has also been the story of the Magnolia Classic, turned Deposit Guaranty Classic, turned Southern Farm Bureau Classic, turned Viking Classic, turned True South Classic, turned Sanderson Farms Championship. The event’s  57-year-history has included tournaments at three different golf courses, in three different Mississippi cities, and with six different sponsors. It has endured not only the sponsorhip losses, but also a 100-year flood, two lesser floods, a couple hurricanes, a tornado, a pandemic and a half dozen recessions. In 2005, before so much of that happened, Mississippi’s only PGA TOUR tournament had endured so much that a Sports Illustrated deemed it “the little tournament that could.”
The late Robert Morgan, a Hattiesburg businessman, championed the tournament through its first 40 years and a move from the Hattiesburg Country Club to Annandale in Madison. Then, Joe Sanderson, the Laurel poultry magnate, saved the event and oversaw the move from Annandale to the Country Club of Jackson where the tournament had seemingly flourished until now. 
But Sanderson sold his company in 2022 and the new owners have decided not to continue sponsoring the event beyond this year’s tournament. A new sponsor has not been found, which could spell the end of the “little tournament that could.”
That would be a blow to several Mississippi charities and especially Children’s Hospital. Since 2013, the event has raised nearly $19 million for Children’s of Mississippi and $2.75 million for other Mississippi charities. Said Steve Jent, the tournament’s executive director, “All I can say is that we’d like to find a title sponsor for next year. We want to keep it going.”
Steven Fisk knew little of any of that before he came to Country Club of Jackson for the first time this week. He has quickly learned to adore the tournament which he called “a first-class event on a great golf course.”
Asked about the likelihood of this being the last Sanderson Farms Championship, Fisk, spoke for many when he replied, “If this was the last one, that stinks…”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/05194508/AP25278820577217.jpg,,,2025-10-05 21:56:34.519024
