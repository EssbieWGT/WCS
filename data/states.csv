Susan was dearly loved and is deeply missed by all who knew her.

Barton, 69, a long-time Montpelier resident, passed away peacefully on May 18, 2025, in her son’s home surrounded by love and family until her last moments. Already missing her profoundly are her children, grandchildren, and great grandchildren whom she adored above all else. Her siblings, nieces, and nephews in Maine and Georgia are also deeply mourning — Susan put family first in all that she did, accepted everyone on their own terms and loved them no matter what. Her kindness, generosity of spirit, and dedication to family is her legacy — those of us who knew and loved Susan aspire to live up to these same values.Born and raised in Maine with three sisters and two brothers, Susan went international for a short time and moved to Eel River Bar, a Mi’kmaq First Nation in New Brunswick, Canada and then married her husband, Thomas Caplin. They moved back to Maine and then to Vermont in the early 80s to raise their family of two with a third on the way. As the universe would have it, they parted ways. Susan then met her longtime life partner, Walter Baldwin Sr., and added two more children to the clan, and they raised the five youngsters together: Tin, SueAnne, Jennifer, Crystal, and Walter Jr. Being a Catholic Irish-American, Susan always wanted a large loving family: she is survived by 5 children, 6 granddaughters, 2 grandsons, 3 great grandchildren and 2 more on the way! Susan cherished all her family and traveled frequently to Maine to visit her extended family, while camping and visiting Old Orchard Beach. She especially enjoyed spending time at her beloved younger sister Peggy’s home where she spent days visiting with family. She was predeceased by her sister Peggy, her mother Margaret, her father Charles, and her partner Walter.Susan was a dedicated and hard worker. She found her passion in cleaning: “Cleanliness is next to Godliness” was a phrase heard often in her home — while her family were holding their noses and complaining that she used too much bleach! She successfully turned this value into employment as a commercial custodian and was happy to go to work each day for decades. She was proud to work with Keurig DR Pepper (formerly Green Mountain Coffee Roasters) as a contractor then a full employee for 23 years where she was awarded and recognized for her positive spirit, hard work, dedication, and loyalty. When Keurig moved out of Vermont, she transitioned to a career with the State of Vermont Buildings and General Services Department providing custodial services in several buildings where human services were provided. She said she felt it was her duty to keep things sanitary to help people stay healthy. She doubled down on this commitment through the pandemic being an essential worker. And her new employment brought co-workers who soon became part of her extended family.Susan spent much of her life raising her children and working, but she liked to let her hair down every so often and periodically played Bingo or scratch off tickets and took the occasional trip to a regional casino. She loved the thrill and excitement of possibly winning big bucks!  But even when she won — no matter the amount — she would always split the winnings with her friends and family. She also liked to go shopping for others, finding special gifts for those dear to her. She had a special admiration for angels — her shelves nearly overflowing with angel statutes! She had an artistic and crafty side that she rarely got to express, but one year she skillfully sewed three coordinated Easter dresses for her daughters. She also loved flowers – and though she wouldn’t have considered herself a pro-gardener, she spent many summers digging in the dirt with her children and grandchildren. Her son learnt gardening from her and student became teacher with large gardens and each spring a colorful “Tulipmania” blooming in his yards: her final days were filled with daily bouquets from these gardens. Most of all though, Susan liked gathering family for Sunday dinners or BBQs or birthday parties — she just loved sitting around the table and chatting while sharing coffee and food.Though filled with love, Susan’s life also included some significant hardships — at times being a single mother, living for periods with inadequate economic resources, being homeless three times, and experiencing intimate partner violence — and yet she always remained resilient and worked hard for a better, brighter future. And these hardships along with her faith also galvanized in her the desire to go the extra mile to help anyone else in need. She regularly “adopted” the neighborhood kids and welcomed them to the dinner table just as one of her own. She loved life and would never let anything stop her.  Even when diagnosed with breast cancer and then lung cancer, she resisted the need to be out of work wanting to remain active and maintain her normal routine. And she fought hard to return to work in this final year — she didn’t like sitting idle or letting down her work team, especially as she now considered them family. The support and grace her work colleagues offered as her health declined was a blessing she so appreciated even when hard to accept. For her entire life, Susan gave all of herself to anyone she loved and to anyone in need — and in the end, she was able to finally realize there was so much love and beauty in accepting help too.Susan was dearly loved and is deeply missed by all who knew her.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Susan J.

Jim Clyburn talk to reporters at Clyburn’s annual fish fry Friday, May 30, 2025. (Photo by Shaun Chornobroff/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — Minutes before 10 p.m. Friday, after Democratic speakers led the audience in jeers to Republicans’ efforts to slash jobs and health care and encouraged people to get involved, line dancing broke out.
That mix of politics and fun, mostly the latter, is what makes U.S. Rep. Jim Clyburn’s annual fish fry in the state’s capital city so popular, attendees said.
“We all came out, and everybody’s enjoying themselves,” said Shantell Zimmerman, 58, of Columbia.
“It brings out the community,” agreed Dionne Brown, 55, of Irmo, who’s been attending the event for six years. “Then we actually get to discuss our views and takeaways.”
Hundreds of people attended the event that started in 1992, the year voters first elected Clyburn to the 6th Congressional District, as a thank you to the voters who couldn’t afford the Democratic Party’s high-dollar fundraisers.
Over time, the “World Famous Annual Fish Fry” — which includes free food and drinks — has become a must-attend event for Democrats seeking local, statewide and national office.
This year was no different, even if Maryland Gov. Wes Moore and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz — Kamala Harris’ 2024 running mate — said they’re not running for the 2028 nomination.
“I know I’m not running,” Moore told reporters Friday. “But the thing I’m also very clear about is that anyone who’s talking about 2028 is not taking 2025 very seriously.”
Moore and Walz, as well as Clyburn and former Democratic National Committee Chairman Jaime Harrison of Columbia, emphasized the importance of focusing on what’s happening now in Washington, D.C.
Proposed cuts to government safety nets like Medicaid and billionaire Elon Musk’s efforts to rapidly slash federal spending were among the topics the governors touched on Friday during speeches at the fish fry, as well as the Blue Palmetto Fundraising Dinner the same night.
“I taught school long enough to know it’s because they’re weak and they’re bullies, and when you stand up to them, they fade away,” said Walz, a former high school geography teacher.
Their addresses at the events in South Carolina — which last year got promoted from holding the Democratic Party’s first-in-the-South to first-in-the-nation presidential primary — sounded a lot like campaign speeches.
Walz also spoke at the South Carolina Democratic Party’s annual convention on Saturday.
Lucy Owens, an Anderson County delegate to the state convention, discounted the governors’ refusals, saying the 2028 presidential campaign has clearly begun.
“They’re all going to come through here. They’re the first ones,” she said.
In 2019, the fish fry drew 21 potential candidates hoping to appeal to South Carolina Democrats.
The following year, Joe Biden won the South Carolina Democratic primary, a victory that ended up vaulting him to the presidency, aided by Clyburn’s endorsement. South Carolina’s primary was elevated for 2024 as Biden’s thank you to the state.
‘Cleanup hitter’ 
With Biden gone, the Democratic party in flux, and Harrison no longer leading the national party, South Carolina maintaining its first-in-the-nation status is in question.
Clyburn’s comments Friday suggest he knows the state won’t keep it. He doesn’t care if the state is first, he said, just that it’s early.
“The most important hitter on a team is the cleanup hitter. He comes in fourth place,” Clyburn told reporters at his event.
“I’m not concerned about whether or not we’re first, second, third,” he said. “Please, let us be at least four.”
That would take South Carolina back to having the first primary in the South, potentially behind contests in Iowa, New Hampshire, and Nevada.
In the aftermath of Trump’s landslide victory and the Republican Party gaining control of both chambers of Congress, the Democratic Party is in a reset.
Walz and Moore, the first Black governor in Maryland’s history, are among the early faces of it.
Winning South Carolina, which changed the trajectory of Biden’s 2020 presidential run, will be crucial for Democratic hopefuls.
Owens, the Anderson County delegate, pointed to the stage where Walz and Moore spoke, saying every Democrat who wants to be president will eventually appear in that exact spot.
“They got to come through here. Not South Carolina. They got to go right there,” she said.
Both governors received raucous ovations from South Carolina Democrats, drawing cheers, standing ovations and even a few laughs as they took shots at the GOP.
Owens said “they’re both very great candidates,” and she’s “excited” to hear more from them over the coming years.
That was the general consensus from attendees who spoke with the SC Daily Gazette. However, they were significantly more familiar with Walz because of his time on the campaign trail last year with Vice President Harris.
“I know less about Wes Moore than I do about Tim Walz, but I think he’s a good speaker,” said Laura Lowery, a 69-year-old from Fountain Inn. “I think he’s done a good job in his state as well.”
Moore has recently come under fire for vetoing a bill that would establish a commission to examine state and federal policies from 1877 to 1965 and come up with recommendations for reparations.
South Carolina Rep. John King, D-Rock Hill, asked the state party to remove Moore as the keynote speaker of Friday’s Blue Palmetto Dinner. Party leaders never responded to questions about that request.
But for at least some attendees, the veto perturbed them too. “I didn’t understand why he would do that,” said Tonya Winbush of Anderson.
But once Winbush, a 50-year-old Army veteran, heard Moore speak about his time in the Army, as well as his pardoning of 175,000 cannabis convictions, her opinion changed.
“I think when you don’t know the whole story and you just listen to sound bites, which is what we do a lot, we’ll make brash judgments about people, when we are really fighting the same fight,” she said.

From CalMatters politics reporter Yue Stella Yu: 
Boos. Heckles. Accusations. 
At the California Democratic Party convention in Anaheim over the weekend, some Latino Democrats waged a contentious referendum on their leaders — and won.
Nilza Serrano, a Los Angeles consultant, was elected chair of the party’s Latino caucus, upsetting longtime activist Carlos Alcala, who had chaired the caucus for more than a decade. Serrano was among a dozen Latinos who won caucus leadership positions during the convention under the banner of “La Nueva Voz” — “the new voice” in Spanish.
Instead of settling political differences, the fight was more a referendum on leadership style, as incumbents ran on a platform emphasizing their experience. But the newcomers’ victories exposed deep frustration among Latino Democrats with the exodus of Latinos from the Democratic Party last November, as well as a widespread perception that the party had failed to cement Latino support. The caucus is tasked with building the Latino base for Democratic candidates in California. 

Serrano, to CalMatters: “We did not get the messaging that we were supposed to get (out). There wasn’t a big effort on getting younger people involved in the party, and I think that’s key to our success.”

The election also followed an intense drama between the incumbent caucus officers and the challengers, so acute that the state party had to intervene. Challengers accused Alcala of cheating by allowing some delegates to vote remotely even though they didn’t have disabilities, in violation of party and caucus bylaws. Party officials ruled against Alcala. 
But Alcala decried the decision and argued remote voting was necessary to protect delegates terrified of flying due to their immigration status or those on a limited income, drawing boos.
The Latino caucus’ fight wasn’t the only sign of reckoning at the convention, as Democrats licked their wounds from November and tackled how to step up the party’s ground game ahead of challenging midterms.
Young Democrats also expressed frustration with the party’s failure to resonate with their age demographic. At the convention, they said that in order to mobilize young voters, party leaders and candidates should focus on California’s affordability issues, be willing to tackle progressive issues, and keep the messaging simple.

Carter Beardsley, an 18-year-old Bakersfield resident: “At the end of the day … people want to vote for someone who’s going to make their lives easier.”

Changes for prison searches and death row cases

Let’s dive into some criminal justice news:

Prison searches: Beginning today California prisons will subject anyone entering their facilities, including visitors, staff and attorneys, to a canine search. The new policy is to curb the “introduction of illegal drugs and contraband” into prison facilities, according to a corrections department memo. But criminal justice advocates and family members of incarcerated people argue that increased searches will negatively impact the ability to visit incarcerated people. Said the executive director of California Public Defenders Association: “The contraband is coming from the employees of the institution. But they are blaming everyone else.” Read more from CalMatters’ Cayla Mihalovich.


Death penalty policy change: Alameda County District Attorney Ursula Jones Dickson has moved to walk back resentencing recommendations for people on death row, according to records obtained by CalMatters. The recommendations were originally filed by the previous district attorney, Pamela Price, who was recalled in November. Price recommended resentencing 30 people after being required to launch a review of death penalty cases for prosecutorial misconduct. Since then, 20 were resentenced. But in one of the first major signs that the office is departing from Price’s policies, Jones Dickson is withdrawing the recommendations for at least four of the remaining 10, arguing that her predecessor made flawed legal arguments.

Feds plan to revoke Chinese student visas

Amid growing trade tensions between the U.S. and China, one of President Donald Trump’s latest actions is sowing fear among international students, writes CalMatters’ Adam Echelman.
The Trump administration on Wednesday said it is working to “aggressively revoke visas for Chinese students,” including those connected with the country’s communist party or “studying in critical fields.” The directive has the potential to affect as many as 50,000 students in California.
Because international students pay higher tuition than in-state students, and they help boost local economies, revoking these visas has the potential to reduce by 3% the budgets of the University of California and the California State University system. UC Davis, for example, is the UC with the highest number of Chinese international students, with more than 3,600 students, or over 9%, accounting for its student body.
Some international students also said they were concerned that the new policy would lead to more discrimination.

Huhu, a Chinese international student at UC Santa Barbara: “If we’re in a state where our visa could be canceled at any time, it’s an action that encourages people to discriminate against the international student community.”

The Sacramento County District Attorney’s Office said on Friday that it will not file DUI charges against state Sen. Sabrina Cervantes. The Riverside Democrat was involved in a car crash in Sacramento and police officers cited her for driving under the influence of a drug. Cervantes denied this, and a blood test revealed that she had “no measurable amount of drugs or alcohol in her system.” 
While some are urging the Sacramento Police Department to apologize to Cervantes, the department said officers “remained professional throughout.” Read more from CalMatters’ Ryan Sabalow.

For many Asian Americans, it’s around 84 — on par with life expectancies in Japan and Switzerland.
Americans’ health has long been unequal, but a new study shows that the disparity between the life expectancies of different populations has nearly doubled since 2000.
“This is like comparing very different countries,” said Tom Bollyky, director of the global health program at the Council on Foreign Relations and an author of the study.
Called “Ten Americas,” the analysis published late last year in The Lancet found that “one’s life expectancy varies dramatically depending on where one lives, the economic conditions in that location, and one’s racial and ethnic identity.” The worsening health of specific populations is a key reason the country’s overall life expectancy — at 75 years for men and 80 for women — is the shortest among wealthy nations.
To deliver on pledges from the new Trump administration to make America healthy again, policymakers will need to fix problems undermining life expectancy across all populations.
“As long as we have these really severe disparities, we’re going to have this very low life expectancy,” said Kathleen Harris, a sociologist at the University of North Carolina. “It should not be that way for a country as rich as the U.S.”
Since 2000, the average life expectancy of many American Indians and Alaska Natives has been steadily shrinking. The same has been true since 2014 for Black people in low-income counties in the southeastern U.S.
“Some groups in the United States are facing a health crisis,” Bollyky said, “and we need to respond to that because it’s worsening.”
Heart disease, car fatalities, diabetes, COVID-19, and other common causes of death are directly to blame. But research shows that the conditions of people’s lives, their behaviors, and their environments heavily influence why some populations are at higher risk than others.
Native Americans in the West — defined in the “Ten Americas” study as more than a dozen states excluding California, Washington, and Oregon — were among the poorest in the analysis, living in counties where a person’s annual income averages below about $20,000. Economists have shown that people with low incomes generally live shorter lives.
Studies have also linked the stress of poverty, trauma, and discrimination to detrimental coping behaviors like smoking and substance use disorders. And reservations often lack grocery stores and clean, piped water, which makes it hard to buy and cook healthy food.
About 1-in-5 Native Americans in the Southwest don’t have health insurance, according to a KFF report. Although the Indian Health Service provides coverage, the report says the program is weak due to chronic underfunding. This means people may delay or skip treatments for chronic illnesses. Postponed medical care contributed to the outsize toll of covid among Native Americans: About 1 of every 188 Navajo people died of the disease at the peak of the pandemic.
“The combination of limited access to health care and higher health risks has been devastating,” Bollyky said.
At the other end of the spectrum, the study’s category of Asian Americans maintained the longest life expectancies since 2000. As of 2021, it was 84 years.
Education may partly underlie the reasons certain groups live longer.
“People with more education are more likely to seek out and adhere to health advice,” said Ali Mokdad, an epidemiologist at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, and an author of the paper. Education also offers more opportunities for full-time jobs with health benefits.
“Money allows you to take steps to take care of yourself,” Mokdad said.
The group with the highest incomes in most years of the analysis was predominantly composed of white people, followed by the mainly Asian group. The latter, however, maintained the highest rates of college graduation, by far. About half finished college, compared with fewer than a third of other populations.
The study suggests that education partly accounts for differences among white people living in low-income counties, where the individual income averaged less than $32,363. Since 2000, white people in low-income counties in southeastern states — defined as those in Appalachia and the Lower Mississippi Valley — had far lower life expectancies than those in upper midwestern states including Montana, Nebraska, and Iowa. (The authors provide details on how the groups were defined and delineated in their report.)
Opioid use and HIV rates didn’t account for the disparity between these white, low-income groups, Bollyky said. But since 2010, more than 90% of white people in the northern group were high-school graduates, compared with around 80% in the southeastern U.S.
The education effect didn’t hold true for Latino groups compared with others. Latinos saw lower rates of high school graduation than white people but lived longer on average. This long-standing trend recently changed among Latinos in the Southwest because of covid. Hispanic or Latino and Black people were nearly twice as likely to die from the disease.
On average, Black people in the U.S. have long experienced worse health than other races and ethnicities in the United States, except for Native Americans. But this analysis reveals a steady improvement in Black people’s life expectancy from 2000 to about 2012. During this period, the gap between Black and white life expectancies shrank.
This is true for all three groups of Black people in the analysis: Those in low-income counties in southeastern states like Mississippi, Louisiana, and Alabama; those in highly segregated and metropolitan counties, such as Queens, New York, and Wayne, Michigan, where many neighborhoods are almost entirely Black or entirely white; and Black people everywhere else.
Better drugs to treat high blood pressure and HIV help account for the improvements for many Americans between 2000 to 2010. And Black people, in particular, saw steep rises in high school graduation and gains in college education in that period.
However, progress stagnated for Black populations by 2016. Disparities in wealth grew. By 2021, Asian and many white Americans had the highest incomes in the study, living in counties with per capita incomes around $50,000. All three groups of Black people in the analysis remained below $30,000.
A wealth gap between Black and white people has historical roots, stretching back to the days of slavery, Jim Crow laws, and policies that prevented Black people from owning property in neighborhoods that are better served by public schools and other services. For Native Americans, a historical wealth gap can be traced to a near annihilation of the population and mass displacement in the 19th and 20th centuries.
Inequality has continued to rise for several reasons, such as a widening pay gap between predominantly white corporate leaders and low-wage workers, who are disproportionately people of color. And reporting from KFF Health News shows that decisions not to expand Medicaid have jeopardized the health of hundreds of thousands of people living in poverty.
Researchers have studied the potential health benefits of reparation payments to address historical injustices that led to racial wealth gaps. One new study estimates that such payments could reduce premature death among Black Americans by 29%.
Less controversial are interventions tailored to communities. Obesity often begins in childhood, for example, so policymakers could invest in after-school programs that give children a place to socialize, be active, and eat healthy food, Harris said. Such programs would need to be free for children whose parents can’t afford them and provide transportation.
But without policy changes that boost low wages, decrease medical costs, put safe housing and strong public education within reach, and ensure access to reproductive health care including abortion, Harris said, the country’s overall life expectancy may grow worse.
“If the federal government is really interested in America’s health,” she said, “they could grade states on their health metrics and give them incentives to improve.”

Co-sponsored by House GOP leaders, the bipartisan bill cleared the supermajority-Republican chamber by a vote of 86-18 on April 30, a week before the session ended. It awaits action next year in the Senate.
The House vote came three years after the South Carolina Legislature passed a law providing state employees six weeks of paid leave. That was followed in 2023 with a law making South Carolina the first state in the Southeast to extend that much parental paid leave to K-12 public school teachers.
This year, Alabama, Iowa and Mississippi joined 37 other states in granting paid parental leave to thousands of state workers.
The trend has gathered steam in recent years.
Some experts link it to the cascade of state abortion bans that followed the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2022 Dobbs decision, which dismantled the federal right to abortion. Under fire from critics to do more to care for babies once they’re born, at least a dozen conservative-led states with abortion bans have since granted or expanded paid parental leave for their state employees.
But others say the increasing bipartisan support for measures that help working parents is also a reaction to economic realities.
“What we’ve seen, especially in more conservative states, is the public sector has experienced a lot of turnover,” said Kameron Dawson, legal director of the Southern Office of A Better Balance, a legal organization focused on workplace rights. “They’re looking for tools to recruit younger employees.”
Paid parental leave is the time off granted to workers for the birth or adoption of a baby, to care for a child, or to recover from a stillbirth or miscarriage. Without it, employees are left to cobble together their sick leave and vacation leave — or go unpaid — to stay home with a child and heal.










We’re trying to attract and retain state employees and teachers, and we’re in competition with everyone around us, and the private sector as well.


– Alabama Republican state Rep. Ginny Shaver


Alabama Republican state Rep. Ginny Shaver watched her daughter, a public school teacher, struggle to get the leave she needed after the births of her children in recent years.
“With her second, she had complications in her pregnancy and used up her [paid vacation and sick] leave before she even had the baby,” Shaver told Stateline. Her daughter contracted COVID-19, and the baby had to spend time in neonatal intensive care. “It was a very difficult time, and she had to take unpaid leave.”
Last year, Shaver and Democratic state Sen. Vivian Figures worked to win approval of a paid parental leave bill for state employees. It failed.
But they tried again this year. With the support of Republican Gov. Kay Ivey, the state legislature — which has a Republican supermajority — passed it nearly unanimously.
The new law gives female state employees, including teachers, eight weeks of paid parental leave in connection with birth, stillbirth or miscarriage, and gives male employees two weeks. Adoptive parents get eight weeks for one parent and two for the other.
Shaver said she thinks the law passed thanks to vocal support from the governor and increased awareness of the issue due to the work she and Figures did in previous sessions.
“And the fact that all of the Southeast states around us offered it,” Shaver said. “We’re trying to attract and retain state employees and teachers, and we’re in competition with everyone around us, and the private sector as well.”
 Keeping talent

For many Republicans, the workforce development argument for paid leave is a persuasive one.
For states such as Alabama and South Carolina that have some of the lowest workforce participation rates in the nation, paid leave can be a tool to keep more people — particularly women — working. And it can be a way to retain educators as many states struggle with teacher shortages in K-12 schools.
“For several years we’ve seen state legislatures acknowledging the importance of child care to businesses and the economy,” said Feroza Freeland, policy director at the Southern Office of A Better Balance. “But in the last few years, we’ve seen a growing recognition that paid leave is another piece of that puzzle.”
Advocates say SC law protecting pregnant employees is working

States have taken up the issue because the federal government has not. The United States is a global outlier; among 38 peer nations, it’s the only one that doesn’t mandate paid parental leave, according to the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development. The group comprises 38 democracies with market-based economies.
The federal Family and Medical Leave Act, passed in 1993 and extended in 2020, requires public agencies and companies with at least 50 employees to give up to 12 weeks of leave for parents of newborns or newly adopted children, or caregivers of sick family members.
But it only requires the time off. The leave can be unpaid.
 GOP support

During his first term, President Donald Trump publicly supported some forms of paid family leave and signed a defense bill that gives 12 weeks of paid parental leave to most federal employees.
Paid family leave was a signature issue for his daughter Ivanka Trump, at the time a senior adviser to the president. She even held a paid leave and child care summit at the White House in late 2019.
That set the stage for other Republicans to take up the issue more publicly. And after the Dobbs decision, family-friendly policies have increasingly become conservative talking points in states with restrictive abortion laws.
After the Mississippi House unanimously passed a paid parental leave bill earlier this year, Republican House Speaker Jason White celebrated the bill as a reflection of Mississippi’s status as a “pro-life state.”
In a post on X this week announcing her signing of a new paid parental leave law, Iowa Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds called Iowa “a pro-family state.”
North Carolina was one of the first Southern states to grant paid parental leave to state workers in 2019 when then-Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, signed an executive order. In 2023, several months after the Dobbs decision, the state’s majority-Republican legislature extended paid parental leave to public school employees by tacking it onto a law banning most abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy.
Meanwhile, Indiana Republican Gov. Mike Braun signed an executive order in March to add up to eight additional weeks of paid leave for “childbirth recovery” to the state’s existing four weeks of paid parental leave.
 Running the gamut

The new laws won’t apply to most residents, because they only cover state employees. But they could have a downstream effect.
Shaver, the Alabama lawmaker, said she hopes her state’s new law will not only help the state be competitive with the private sector, but also set a precedent for other employers to follow.
“I hope they will see it’s in their benefit to offer what they can,” she said. “It may not be eight or 12 weeks, but even offering a reduced or flexible work schedule can help families.”
Just over a quarter of private-sector workers have access to paid family leave through their employer as of March 2023, according the most recent data from the U.S. Department of Labor.
Among the lowest-wage earners, that share drops to 6%.
Ultrasounds, pregnancy tests and parenting classes: SC funding for pregnancy centers questioned

State paid leave programs run the gamut in terms of what they offer.
While Alabama’s new law offers up to eight weeks of leave for all state employees, including teachers, Mississippi’s offers six and does not require public schools to offer paid parental leave to their employees.
Iowa’s new law grants four weeks of paid leave for the birth or adoption of a child and one week of paid paternity leave. Tennessee’s law, passed in 2023, offers paid leave only to workers in the state’s executive and judicial branches.
But a few states are already expanding their offerings: Last year, Georgia legislators voted to double paid parental leave from three to six weeks.
And some states have gone further than just state employees: 13 states and the District of Columbia have mandated paid family leave for all workers, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center.
Most of those states are located in New England or on the West Coast and all are Democratic-led. Ten more offer voluntary paid family leave statewide that’s provided through private insurance.
 Sandwich generation

Experts say the shift in attitude toward family-friendly policies can also be attributed to a generational shift.
“A lot of younger lawmakers are more willing to champion the issue of paid leave,” said Freeland, of A Better Balance. “They’re understanding it because they’re seeing it in their own lives, or seeing friends and family members going through this.”
In South Carolina, Bernstein’s bill faced some opposition from members of the state’s ultra-conservative Freedom Caucus and Family Caucus. Some lawmakers questioned the potential costs of the bill, or criticized it as government overreach.

South Carolina state Rep. Josiah Magnuson, vice-chairman of the Freedom Caucus, said he believed the bill would be a financial burden on public school districts that could lead to raised taxes.
“You’re saying, let’s tax the people of South Carolina, most of whom don’t get paid parental leave, and give them to state employees who already have six weeks’ paid parental leave,” Magnuson, R-Campobello, told lawmakers in April before the House voted to pass the bill.
He also said he doesn’t like that the increased paid leave “puts the foot in the door a little more for the government to be involved in the home.”
The opposition frustrated Bernstein, who pointed out that the state’s 2022 law that granted six weeks of paid parental leave passed the Legislature almost unanimously. That legislation, also sponsored by Bernstein, started out as a 12-week bill. The Senate cut the maximum time off in half, and the House agreed to the change to get the measure to Gov. Henry McMaster’s desk.
During the floor debate in April, other Republicans backed the renewed effort for 12 weeks, citing their own families’ experiences following the birth of their children, reported the South Carolina Daily Gazette.
More conservative states are also responding to the needs of “sandwich generation” employees who may be caring for aging parents as well as children, Freeland said.
Earlier this year, Tennessee became the first Southern state to expand its state paid leave policy beyond just parental leave. The state legislature voted almost unanimously to extend its six-week paid leave policy to cover state workers providing end-of-life care to a family member.
“We’re seeing a growing recognition that people need support for these types of family or caregiving needs,” said Freeland, “and that it strengthens the workforce and economy to be able to provide that.”

,California,2025-06-02 12:33:00+00:00,CalMatters,Zombie bills: Why California lawmakers bring back legislation governors kill,Ryan Sabalow,,,,,https://calmatters.org/politics/2025/06/newsom-bills-vetoed-california-legislature/,CalMatters found dozens of examples of previously vetoed legislation returning in subsequent years. A twice-killed bill about driverless trucks exemplifies why.,"In summary
CalMatters found dozens of examples of previously vetoed legislation returning in subsequent years. A twice-killed bill about driverless trucks exemplifies why.


The bill was dead. Twice dead, in fact: Two times in the past two years, Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed legislation to ban California companies from deploying driverless trucks.
Yet lawmakers have resurrected the idea and inserted it into a new bill — with the Teamsters union hoping the third time will be the charm.
There’s no indication Newsom has changed his mind. Still, Democratic Assemblymember Cecilia Aguiar-Curry, representing the Davis area, said she brought the autonomous trucking bill back because it’s good policy aimed at “protecting our public safety and our jobs.” She said it has nothing to do with the Teamsters’ large donations to lawmakers.
Assembly Bill 33 is an example of a phenomenon in the California Legislature: Even when a bill dies one year, and even if a governor kills it, there’s a strong likelihood it will return, especially if big money interests like labor unions and business groups want it signed into law.
A CalMatters analysis using the Digital Democracy database that tracks the more than 2,000 bills introduced this year found at least 80 measures that are similar – some identical – to legislation that Newsom or other governors have vetoed in previous years. Around a quarter of the resurrected bills had support from prominent labor groups; an almost equal number were backed by business.
CalMatters relied on the Legislature’s bill analyses to determine whether a measure had been vetoed before. If a previous veto was not noted in the bill analysis it wouldn’t show up, meaning the figure is likely an undercount. The analysis didn’t tally the dozens of other resurrected bills pending in the Legislature this year that already died before reaching the governor’s desk. 
The previously vetoed bills tackle issues large and small including dangerous cigarette lighters, prevailing wage, jury duty for probation officers, colorectal cancer screenings, reproductive health care access, groundwater use at duck-hunting clubs, statewide guaranteed income, newspaper ads and environmental, labor and social justice measures.
The number of failed bills returning year after year helps fuel one of the Legislature’s most troubling issues. The massive number of bills introduced each year contributes to lawmakers rushing through the democratic process and fosters a culture of secrecy at the Capitol. As CalMatters reported, lawmakers routinely silence members of the public during hearings in order to jam through the huge volume of bills. Lawmakers also regularly make their decisions behind closed doors, in part because there is so little time to debate their hundreds of bills in public.
Experts say that doesn’t necessarily mean bills shouldn’t come back after failing. Some good ideas take time to gain political support. Alex Vassar, a legislative historian at the California State Library, noted that it took decades of failed legislation to pass laws that eventually built the state’s highway system and that gave women the right to vote.
“You can keep an issue on the front of the public’s mind, keep it alive in Sacramento, by using the vehicle of the bill to advance conversations happening outside the capital,” said Thad Kousser, a former California legislative staffer who’s now a political science professor at UC San Diego. “Sometimes, it’s part of a longer-term strategy to move policy forward.”
‘Not here to serve the lobbyists’
The Teamsters union is a major funder in the California statehouse, contributing at least $2.7 million to lawmakers’ campaigns since 2015. Aguiar-Curry received at least $15,950 in campaign cash from the Teamsters and its affiliate unions in that time, according to the Digital Democracy database.
But she said that didn’t influence her decision to try again on autonomous trucking.
“I’m not here to serve the lobbyists,” she said.
Aguiar-Curry said she hopes that tweaks she made to the latest legislation could appeal to Newsom, who has tended to be friendlier to Big Tech companies than legislators are to big labor. The latest proposal would prohibit driverless trucks from delivering commercial goods directly to a residence or to a business, instead of barring all driverless trucks over 10,001 pounds as in previous legislation. Newsom’s press office declined to do an on-the-record interview for this story.

Gavin Newsom to sign a bill that would require a human operator in all autonomous vehicles at the state Capitol in Sacramento on Sept. 19, 2023. Photo by Fred Greaves for Cal Matters
“The governor’s veto messages speak for themselves,” his spokesperson, Izzy Gardon, said in an email. “And our office does not typically comment on pending legislation.”
Citing polling that shows Californians are leery of fully autonomous trucks, supporters say that if Newsom vetoes it again, they’ll just keep bringing it back until he signs it – or until the next governor does. 
“We’re right on this issue,” said Peter Finn, the Western region vice president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. “The only person that’s wrong on this issue is the governor, and just because one person is choosing Big Tech over people and drivers doesn’t mean we should stop pursuing this issue.”
This year’s bill easily passed the Assembly floor on Thursday with only a handful of Republicans voting “no.”
Doctors again fight private equity
Business groups, meanwhile, are pushing at least 20 other bills that Newsom or other governors have vetoed.
A prominent example is Senate Bill 351, co-sponsored by the California Medical Association, which lobbies on behalf of the state’s physicians. The organization wants to regulate private equity groups and hedge funds when they try to buy medical and dental practices.
Last year’s legislation sought to give the California attorney general power to block the sale of health care companies to for-profit investors.

In vetoing the measure, Newsom said it wasn’t necessary. This year’s bill doesn’t go as far, but it contains nearly identical language that would prohibit investors from “interfering with the professional judgment of physicians or dentists in making health care decisions,” according to the bill’s analysis. The measure also would allow the attorney general to sue if an investment firm violates the rules.
“Private equity firms are gaining influence in our health care system, leading to rising costs and undermining the quality of care,” Erin Mellon, a spokesperson for the medical association, said in an email.
CMA has given at least $3.5 million to legislators since 2015, according to Digital Democracy. The doctors lobby also has donated at least $9,500 to this year’s author, freshman Democratic Sen. Christopher Cabaldon, the former mayor of West Sacramento. 
Cabaldon said in an interview that he introduced the bill because it’s about “taking care of the patients.” 
“Doctors and other health care providers,” he said, “are leaving their practices, or in some cases, leaving the industry altogether, because their ability to practice as clinicians and deliver the best possible care has been under threat by overly aggressive private equity operators who are putting the profits first.”
Cabaldon’s proposal passed the Senate last week with Republican opposition.
Lawmakers bring back passion topics
While wealthy groups push for their favored bills to come back, other pieces of legislation return simply because a lawmaker is passionate about the subject matter.
That’s why Assembly Republican Leader James Gallagher, who represents the Chico area, reintroduced a bill Newsom vetoed last year that would have given families legal authority to visit loved ones in health care facilities during pandemics. Gallagher said he hated not being able to visit his dying aunt during the Covid-19 outbreak. 
“It’s wrong, man, especially if it’s a loved one,” he said. 
Newsom vetoed the first measure, saying that California’s pandemic visitation policies struck the right balance, and he was concerned Gallagher’s bill would “result in confusion and create different access to patients.”
Gallagher’s newest version of the bill didn’t get a hearing this year. 
For Assemblymember Tom Lackey, a Republican representing the Palmdale area, it bothers him that victims of the 2020 Bobcat Fire in his district have to pay state taxes on settlement payments they received from the power company whose lines started the fire.
“It’s brutal,” he said. “I mean, ‘Here’s your money to try to restore yourself, but, oh, by the way, you can’t have it all. We want some of it back.’ … It’s a second kick in the mouth.”
It’s why he reintroduced a settlement tax relief bill this year after Newsom vetoed it last year along with a number of other similar bills. 
Lackey said he hopes his latest bill is unnecessary. Newsom noted in his veto message that the settlement tax provisions “should be included as part of the annual budget process.” Newsom’s proposed budget this year includes tax breaks for some disaster settlements. Lackey hopes that will include the Bobcat Fire.
Social justice bills come back
Other previously vetoed bills seek to address social justice issues that are important to lawmakers. They include proposals to create anti-discrimination awareness campaigns, putting non-English language accent marks on government forms and diversity audits for gubernatorial appointees. Newsom has vetoed “substantially similar” diversity audit bills six consecutive times.
Democratic Assemblymember James Ramos, representing the San Bernardino area, is the Legislature’s first Native American member. He believes that California’s first peoples have been silenced and marginalized for too long.
It’s why he’s authored two bills that have been previously vetoed. One would remove requirements from school administrators to approve the cultural regalia students wear at graduations. Former Gov. Jerry Brown vetoed a similar bill, saying “principals and democratically elected school boards” should decide what’s appropriate to wear. Another previously vetoed Ramos bill seeks to expand tribal police forces. He’s also a co-author of a previously vetoed measure seeking to provide resources to locate missing Indigenous people. 
Ramos said he applauds Newsom for doing more than other governors have to apologize for the historic harms done to Native people, but more work needs to be done.
“When the state became a state, they did not include the voices of California’s first people,” he said. “So these bills do a lot more than other bills in the Legislature. These bills educate, and they move forward for reckoning and atonement.”
Should Newsom decide to veto Ramos’ bills again – or any of the others he or other governors have previously killed – it’s unlikely lawmakers will push back.
As CalMatters reported, nearly all of the 189 bills Newsom vetoed last year had support from more than two-thirds of lawmakers — a threshold large enough to override the governor’s veto.
But that almost never happens. The last time the Legislature overrode a governor’s veto was in 1979 on a bill that banned banks from selling insurance.

California prisons will make more use of canine searches on visitors and staff as they attempt to stem the flow of drugs and other contraband among the incarcerated population.


Anyone entering a California prison — including visitors, staff and attorneys — will be subject to a canine search under a new policy rolling out today across the state. 
CalMatters obtained a California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation memo from March 10, announcing the statewide implementation of the policy.
It said the canine searches are meant “to combat the introduction of illegal drugs and contraband into (prisons) and reduce the overall level of narcotics, contraband, and criminal activity within the incarcerated population, thereby enhancing the safety and security of all institutions,” the memo stated. 
Now, visitors and attorneys will not be permitted to visit an incarcerated person in a way that would allow for close contact if they refuse a search. In some cases, a refusal “may lead to exclusion from all (California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation) institutions,” according to the memo.  
All searches, including of staff, will be at the discretion of prison officials.
In recent years, the corrections department has faced mounting pressure over drugs making their way into facilities, but it has been criticized for its approach to managing the crisis.
Last year, a woman received a $5.6 million settlement after she was sexually violated during a strip search while she was trying to visit her husband at a prison  in Tehachapi. 
An oversight agency in 2023 found that drugs continued to get inside prisons during the COVID-19 pandemic when public health protocols prohibited visits. 
“We know where the contraband is coming from,” said Kate Chatfield, executive director of California Public Defenders Association. “People who work in the institutions know where it’s coming from. The contraband is coming from the employees of the institution. But they are blaming everyone. This will have a real adverse impact on the ability of people to visit incarcerated people.”
The Office of Inspector General in its report issued a set of recommendations, including one related to canines. The agency reviewed the department’s strategies to prevent drugs from entering prisons and found that it did not “take full advantage of its canine program.” 
“We understand that reducing the prevalence of drugs in California’s prison system is an ongoing challenge for the department,” the audit stated. “However, drugs have entered prisons even after the department implemented COVID-19 response efforts and suspended in-person visiting.”
Shaun Spillane, spokesperson for the Office of Inspector General, said in a statement to CalMatters that the new memo “is silent regarding the frequency of the searches, so it is unclear how often canines will be used to carry out these drug interdiction efforts.”
The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation found contraband including manufactured weapons, drugs and escape tools in a recent sweep at 11 prisons, said spokesperson Emily Humpal in a statement to CalMatters.
The department “oversees, manages, and is responsible for the safe and secure housing of incarcerated individuals and therefore continues to evaluate ways to improve consistent statewide application of detection and intervention systems,” said Humpal.
The department’s new direction has raised widespread concern among advocates and family members of incarcerated people, who said that random search selection leaves room for bias and will disproportionately target visitors.
“This is scary,” said Christina Brown, executive director of the nonprofit Bridges of Hope. “Families already endure emotional and financial strain to maintain a connection to their loved one. Being subject to these searches, even if they’re innocent, deters future visits because they won’t want to go back.”

Like thousands of other families, in January we lost our Pacific Palisades home to wildfire. Within minutes, every house on our side of the street was reduced to ashes, while those across the street were left untouched.
Five months later, the harsh realities of recovery have set in. We are entangled in a bureaucratic maze: FEMA, the EPA, Army Corps of Engineers, IRS and a patchwork of state and local agencies.
Our home was covered by two insurance policies — one through California’s FAIR Plan and one through a private company — but the multiple federal, state and private agencies don’t coordinate. Even getting someone on the phone can take hours. It’s turned seeking information into a part-time job.
To their credit, most government employees have been courteous and helpful. But the private sector has been another story. For example, we’ve been approached by opportunists offering to file simple forms that require no negotiation — for a 10% cut. In our case, there’s nothing to negotiate: The home is gone and the settlement is fixed.
Our worst experience, however, has been with our mortgage company.
Soon after the fire, the insurer issued a settlement check, but it was made out to us and the mortgage lender. Following instructions, we endorsed the check and mailed it in for co-signing. Instead, the lender cashed it and kept the money.
Now they’re demanding a mountain of paperwork — permits, architectural plans, contractor invoices — before releasing any funds. They refuse to let us use our insurance settlement to pay for the very services required to begin rebuilding. 
Meanwhile, they earn interest on our money. The longer the delay, the more they profit.
We’re not alone. Many fire victims are trapped in the same situation. Assemblymember John Harabedian, with support from Gov. Gavin Newsom, introduced legislation requiring lenders to pay back any interest earned on withheld insurance proceeds to homeowners. The logic is simple: If they delay disbursement intended for rebuilding what was lost, they should not profit from a disaster.

 John Harabedian
 Democrat, State Assembly, District 41 (Pasadena)



Are these tactics legal? Technically, yes. Like many homeowners, we signed a flurry of complex documents while refinancing — a clause naming the lender as a co-payee on insurance claims buried among them. It was not made clear to us that this allows them to hold the funds in escrow and release them at their discretion. 
But California law requires that lenders act in good faith by not unreasonably withholding funds. State civil code makes this clear.  A California appellate court ruling in Schoolcraft v. Ross reaffirms the lender’s responsibilities.  
Harabedian’s bill could make a real difference. In the Palisades, many homes were insured for more than $1 million. At 5% interest, that’s $50,000 a year — up to $200,000 over the four years it can take to design, permit and rebuild a home.
People often ask how they can help. Here’s one answer: Contact Harabedian, Newsom and other state lawmakers. California leaders need to be reminded that the exploitation of disaster survivors must stop. 
Losing your home to wildfire is devastating. Losing your insurance settlement afterward is unconscionable.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/011525-Palisades-Aerial-TS-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-02 09:07:41.389687

Young Californians were disillusioned with Democrats last November. The solution? A simple message, a focus on cost-of-living and progressive causes, and a reckoning with the party’s age problem, say young Democrats.


At age 24, Alan Vargas wants to lead the California Democratic Party. 
Sporting a beige cowboy hat and a pink shirt, the young progressive running for party chair evoked waves of cheers as he vowed to shake things up at the Democrats’ annual convention in Anaheim this weekend.
“I feel our party has moved away from its roots,” he told Democrats Saturday. “We cannot rely on fear to gain votes, nor can we assume the support of any minority, so we must act.”
It was a long shot: Incumbent Rusty Hicks, who did not even show up to make a campaign speech, secured another term swimmingly. Among 2,600 delegates, Vargas persuaded just over 600. 
But Vargas’ attempt sends a clear message: Young Democrats are growingly frustrated with the party’s struggle to resonate with their peers, especially after Democrats hemorrhaged support from young voters, who either shifted toward President Donald Trump or sat out the November election altogether. Turnout plunged among young Californians, particularly Democrats.
Party leaders took notice. Hicks, who deemed the low turnout “gut wrenching,” said Democrats must speak up for marginalized communities and reach out to young voters year round. 
The stakes are high: As California Democrats aim to retake the U.S. House in battleground districts next year, young voters could be key to their victory. Some candidates for governor are already courting their support: Veteran lawmaker Toni Atkins and former Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra headlined the California Young Democrats reception at the convention. Both of them called young people the “now” — not just the future — of the party.  
“You are my future, and I am counting on you,” Atkins told young Democrats Saturday night.
Others hope their affordability-focused policy proposals will resonate. 
All the gubernatorial candidates pledged to build more housing faster to lower costs. Tony Thurmond, the state superintendent of public instruction running for governor, pointed to his push for students to attend college free and to pay back tuition later as well as his advocacy for paid internship programs and workforce training. Former state controller Betty Yee touted her experience managing California’s bank account and stressed her focus on making more reproductive options affordable. Becerra pointed to his effort negotiating with drug companies to lower medical costs. 
But party officials delayed considering a resolution urging a mandatory retirement age for state and local politicians, to the disappointment of many young Democrats who feel disenfranchised and fear many elected officials are getting too old to be effective. 
“When you have 70-year-olds and 80-year-olds running for office, how is that supposed to inspire us when we are living in a completely different world than they ever did?” said Lauren Hassett, an 18-year-old college student from Orange County.
To make inroads with young voters, party leaders and candidates must focus on making California affordable and not shy away from progressive issues that resonate with young people, according to a dozen young Democrats who spoke to CalMatters at the convention. Some stressed that campaigns must also reach young voters at town halls and on campuses and learn to use social media and podcasts to engage them.
But most importantly, the message must be simple.
“At the end of the day, politics is personal, and people want to vote for someone who’s going to make their lives easier,” said Carter Beardsley, 18, from Bakersfield.
Simplifying affordability
There’s a consensus among young Democrats that the party got pummeled on cost-of-living issues in November. Latinos, particularly young Latino men, flocked toward Trump, in part because of economic pain at the grocery store and at the gas pump. 
Feeling like Democrats were absent on “working-class issues” was what inspired Vargas, a son of Mexican immigrants and a content creator from Corona, to run for party chair. While Democrats did try to address economic concerns, the messaging was too complex, Vargas argued.
“A lot of working people don’t have the time to do the research working two or three jobs,” he said. “I think we need a message in a way that is much easier and more digestible for our working communities, so they can listen to it on the radio rather than having to go on the phone and research five different articles.”

Hassett said many Democratic politicians have been criticizing Trump’s economic policies, such as tariffs, without offering digestible policy alternatives. Nor have they successfully explained how their own policies would benefit voters instead, she argued. 
Last November, there “was a lot of ‘Here’s what Trump’s going to do and we are going to do the opposite,’” Hassett said. “A normal voter is not going to know really what a tariff is, really how a tariff is going to impact their life.”
Affordability is still top of mind for many delegates, including young ones. Carter Beardsley, 18, from Bakersfield, said rising health care costs could deter young people from going to the doctor or having a child. And college students fear a hike in tuition, especially as Gov. Gavin Newsom proposed to slash hundreds of millions of dollars from public university budgets.
“Students who might be living off Top Ramen can’t afford that increase,” Beardsley said.  
Despite polls showing that the electorate is shifting away from liberal social views, young Democrats this weekend said they want to see candidates take progressive stances on issues such as LGBTQ rights and the war in Gaza. Young Democrats in California are generally more liberal than their older peers.
Some grew frustrated at Newsom’s comments on his podcast, where he said allowing transgender athletes to compete in girls’ and women’s sports is “deeply unfair.” Trump is threatening to withhold funding from California for allowing trans athletes to participate.
“That’s not an area that I think there’s common ground to be found on,” Beardsley said. “We need to protect trans kids, period.”
And many want to see candidates who will fight to stop the United States from supplying weapons to Israel. At last year’s convention, pro-Palestinian activists flooded the venue as they called on Democrats to support a ceasefire in Gaza. This year’s protest was more muted, with just a dozen pro-Palestinian signs dotting the halls as speakers avoided mentioning the war. 
Let’s talk about age
Though the topic of age was in the air, Democratic leaders postponed discussing a resolution backed by San Francisco Democrats to explore capping the age for state and local officials. The resolution’s  author said it was born out of frustration that former President Joe Biden, 82, remained in the presidential race too long last year, and that some older Democrats — namely former U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein who died at 90 — held onto their seats instead of yielding to younger peers.
Hicks, the party chair, brushed aside concerns about age and defended the party’s decision to delay the discussion.
“At the end of the day, whether you are 25 or 75, the question is: Are you delivering for those that voted for you?” he told reporters.

Some young Democrats agreed, pointing to the success of U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, 83, and former U.S. Rep. Barbara Lee, 78, who was recently elected mayor of Oakland, in connecting with young progressives. 
George Balan, 17, the chair of the California High School Democrats, said what ultimately matters is how much young people feel like they can benefit from someone’s policies.
Many Democrats running for governor argued that age is just a number. Becerra, speaking to a roomful of young Democrats on Saturday night, repeatedly defended Biden’s performance. “Joe Biden will tell you he’s old. But can you deliver?” Becerra said.
Becerra’s speech did not sit well with Annie Koruga, a Bay Area delegate in their early 20s. Being able to deliver is the “whole point of being in elected office,” Koruga argued, and old age could cloud a politician’s ability to do just that.
Koruga noted that several older Democratic members of Congress have died in office since 2022.
“I’m trying to be respectful, but when we have people who are 85, 90 years old in these offices, many of them are not able to effectively perform their functions,” Koruga said.
And other young Democrats told CalMatters they feel turned off when the candidate field is crawling with seniors. 
“There are people in Congress right now that have been there since before the (smart)phone,” said Kelly Merchant, a 22-year-old from Indio.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/053125_CA-Dem-Con_TS_CM_108.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-02 09:07:41.389687

(Photo: Jeniffer Solis/Nevada Current)The Hollywood movie studios seeking $1.4 billion in transferable tax breaks over 15 years have clearly not received a red carpet rollout from the Nevada State Legislature.
Assembly Bill 238, which proposes a twelvefold expansion of the state’s transferable film tax credit program, passed the Assembly late Friday in a 22-20 vote, the thinnest margin allowable since a tie would mean not passing. That left the high profile bill three days to pass the Senate. However, two whole days came and went, leaving the bill with less than 24 hours to make it across the finish line.
The Senate Finance Committee on Sunday appeared to be gearing up for a late night hearing on the film tax credit bill, but instead the full Senate withdrew the bill from the committee and allowed it to take a procedural step it needed in the full chamber.
The bill would massively expand Nevada’s film tax credit program to support the build out and operation of a 31-acre film studio currently referred to as the Summerlin Production Studios Project (after the Las Vegas neighborhood where it would be located). Hollywood giants Sony Pictures Entertainment and Warner Bros. Discovery are attached to the project. Howard Hughes Holdings is developing.
A small army of lobbyists for film studios could be seen entering the Senate Democrats office after the lawmakers adjourned for the night.
Nevada’s film tax credit program is currently capped at $10 million per year. AB 238 would raise that cap to $120 million per year, for 15 years, beginning in 2028. The majority of those tax credits, $95 million per year, would be reserved for productions at the Summerlin studio; $25 million per year would be for productions not attached to the studio.
Altogether, that’s equivalent to $1.8 billion in public subsidies for the television and film industry. If approved by the Senate and signed into law by Gov. Joe Lombardo, the legislation will be the largest public subsidy approved by the State of Nevada, surpassing the $1.25 billion approved by lawmakers in 2014 for Tesla Motors.
While tax credits aren’t issued to companies until they prove they’ve met the qualifications for them, the state must treat them as “negative revenue” when forecasting expected state revenue. That means they do impact the state budgeting process.
Here’s where other high-profile bills stand going into the last day of the session:
Budget bills
All five state budget bills have all passed the Nevada Legislature. Senate Bill 502, known as the capital improvement program (CIP) bill, crossed the legislative finish line on Sunday. The CIP bill must be passed by a two-thirds majority, so it is often used by the minority party as leverage in broader negotiations. That was the case in the 2023 session, when the CIP bill failed to pass the Senate before midnight on the last day. That forced a one-day special session.
The state’s other four budget bills (Senate Bill 500, Assembly Bill 591, Assembly Bill 592, and Senate Bill 501) all passed the Legislature within the last week and have been signed by the governor.
Education bill becomes group project
Senate Majority Leader Nicole Cannizzaro and Gov. Joe Lombardo reached a compromise on their competing omnibus education bills.
Cannizzaro’s Senate Bill 460 was amended to include components of Lombardo’s Assembly Bill 584, including his proposal to establish a statewide accountability system and a salary incentive program for educators and administrators. Components of Cannizzaro’s bill that made it past the amendment include revised evaluation procedures for educators and administrators and additional transparency and assessment requirements for schools receiving funding through the state’s quasi-voucher system, known as Opportunity Scholarships.
The Senate unanimously passed the bill Sunday, and the bill now heads to the Assembly.
Cannizzaro said the bill represents the state taking “significant strides” toward accountability and transparency. Senate Minority Leader Robin Titus also spoke on the floor in support.
Also on the education front: Senate Bill 161, a Clark County Education Association priority bill carried by state Sen. Rochelle Nguyen (D-Las Vegas), passed the Legislature with some bipartisan support and was signed by Lombardo in the last week of the session. The bill establishes an expedited arbitration process for teachers unions and school districts, and, perhaps more consequentially, establishes a pathway for K-12 public school teachers to legally go on strike.
With the passage of SB 161, CCEA will withdraw a ballot measure it had qualified for the 2028 general election ballot. That ballot measure, if approved by voters, would have given teachers the right to strike. The teachers union had previously said it was prepared to defend the ballot measure next year but would prefer to bypass it through legislative action.
It marks the second time the union has pulled this move. In 2021, CCEA qualified two ballot measures — one to raise the gaming tax, another to raise the sales tax — only to pull them after the Legislature established a new mining tax that directly funds the state’s K-12 per pupil education fund.
Lombardo’s other bills

Assembly Bill 540, Lombardo’s housing bill, is currently in the Senate Government Affairs Committee. It has received a hearing but no action has been taken. The bill has already cleared the full Assembly.
Senate Bill 457, Lombardo’s criminal justice bill, passed out of the Senate Judiciary Committee on Sunday after receiving a major amendment. The bill needs to pass the full Senate and the full Assembly.
Senate Bill 495, Lombardo’s health care bill, is prepped for a vote by the full Senate. It will need to be approved by the Senate, then by the Assembly.
Senate Bill 461, Lombardo’s economic development bill, is currently in the Senate Revenue and Economic Development Committee. It received a hearing but no action has been taken.

Banking bill bombs
On Friday, a banking bill sponsored by Assembly Speaker Steve Yeager fell short of the required two-thirds approval it needed to pass the chamber. Assembly Bill 500 would allow for payment banks, a new type of financial institution that focuses solely on payment processing rather than lending.
The Assembly vote was 25-17, a simple majority but three votes short of the two-thirds it needed because it would raise state revenue. On Sunday, AB500 returned to the Assembly floor with an amendment that removed the two-thirds requirement. The amendment was adopted but, in a bizarre turn of events, the vote failed 20-22. The vote was attempted a third time and also failed.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/DSC06367-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-02 09:07:41.389687

The First State’s finest dogs are getting a new task.
The Delaware Department of Correction (DOC) plans to redeploy all canine units across the state exclusively for contraband detection.
The transition marks a significant change from the department’s longstanding use of patrol-focused K-9s for facility security and crowd control.
The shift is part of a broader initiative to improve safety and reduce the presence of illegal drugs, electronics, and other contraband within Delaware’s prison system.
The change is already underway and will be implemented gradually over the next year.
“Our K-9 program transition to a universal contraband detection and mitigation mission aligns with national correctional K-9 best practices and better supports our broad goal of enhancing the safety, security, and wellness of all who live and work within Delaware’s correctional system,” said DOC Commissioner Terra Taylor.
Currently, 18 of the DOC’s 28 K-9 teams are assigned to patrol duties, while the remaining 10 focus on contraband detection.
Under the new policy, all future K-9s will be trained for detection work only.
Unlike patrol dogs, which are bred to be aggressive and are mainly used for deterrence and perimeter control, detection dogs are more social and can operate safely in high-traffic areas such as gatehouses, housing units, and even individual cells.
These dogs are trained to sniff out narcotics, electronic devices like cell phones, and other prohibited items.
DOC officials say the transition will mostly occur through natural attrition as patrol dogs retire.
In two recent cases, younger patrol dogs were exchanged for detection dogs.
All retired dogs are adopted into pre-screened homes, with families receiving financial support for ongoing care under legislation passed in 2023.
The department says this move is supported by a decade of investment in modern, intelligence-based security measures.
These include thousands of new surveillance cameras, improved information-sharing, verbal de-escalation training for staff, and the use of less-lethal tools for conflict resolution.
In addition to providing a safer and more flexible security presence, detection dogs also offer a psychological benefit: their presence alone serves as a powerful deterrent against smuggling efforts.
Officials hope that the expanded deployment of these dogs will help reduce overdoses and other risks associated with contraband inside facilities.
The move is expected to be fully completed by 2026.
“This transition is a clear-eyed response to the persistent threat of illegal and dangerous contraband to our correctional facilities,” Taylor said.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screen-Shot-2025-06-02-at-8.07.25-AM.png,,,2025-06-02 09:07:41.389687

At their headquarters, on a small scale, they show how it’s done.
With the Climate Innovation Center, inaugurated in Salt Lake City last summer, the nonprofit not only searched for a facility that reflected its decarbonization efforts, but one that would create “a teaching tool and living laboratory,” inviting Utahns to watch the workings of a real-life, ultra-efficient, zero-emissions building.

After receiving many industry professionals to showcase the two-story building, with its extensive solar panels and a room with a battery to make intermittent energy available day and night, the organization opened its doors for the first time to the public for an open house on Friday.
“The building is meant to be a model of how we can eliminate emissions from operating the building,” Kevin Emerson, director of building efficiency and decarbonization at Utah Clean Energy said on Friday. “So there’s zero emissions that come from running the building. It’s all electric and all solar powered.”

Not only does the center produce enough energy to power its operations and even electric vehicles in its parking lot with about 39 kilowatts of solar capacity, but it has the ability to help utilities optimize their operations with a 90 kilowatt hours capacity battery. 
That battery, sitting in a small room alongside a heat pump water heater, is part of Rocky Mountain Power’s Wattsmart batteries program, which pays users to incorporate their energy storage into the utility’s smart power grid.
“We think it’s important for our building to be kind of a flexible, interactive, kind of extension of the grid,” Emerson said. “And because ultimately, we want that to be a standard practice, where batteries are located across the electric grid to incorporate more effectively all the renewable energy that you will keep adding.”
Additionally, there’s no gas combustion in the premises. All water features use conservation systems and even the washer and dryer machine installed in the janitor’s closet uses a heat pump.
Outside, the small garden in the facade is highly drought tolerant, full of native and pollinator-friendly plants, as well.

Buildings play a big role in carbon emissions, Emerson told the group of climate and technology enthusiasts who showed up for the tour. According to the environmental nonprofit Architecture 2030, about 40% of carbon emissions come from built environments, either from its operations, or the pollution brought by construction activity itself, including mining, extraction, transportation and manufacturing materials. 
That’s why, Emerson said, during the construction process, the team meticulously chose materials with smaller carbon footprints — from the carpets to the countertops and tiles. 
Embarking in this project saved emissions by opting to preserve many of the features of the building that sat in the lot prior to the nonprofit’s arrival — and also, the staff repurposed wood pieces from the organization’s previous headquarters for this building.

A lot of the center’s energy efficiency comes from its insulation, as well, with contractors paying special attention to a correct airtight construction, Emerson said. Another team also supervised the space’s variable refrigerant flow heat pump, essentially a mechanical system that works like a large air conditioning unit that can provide cooling when it’s warm, and work in reverse to extract warmth out of the air, even on cold winter days.
The organization’s next step is to document all of these features by pursuing third-party certifications for the building, including a zero energy validation, focusing on the emissions it is not producing, and a zero carbon one to certify the materials used in retrofitting the space.
All of those lessons learned while designing and executing the building were included into climateinnovationcenter.org, a website, so others can incorporate non-polluting practices in new constructions or renovations. 
“One of the goals that Utah Clean Energy has is to help all the folks involved in construction across the state realize that building zero emissions as a standard practice is possible,” Emerson added. “And that’s our vision, is that zero emission buildings become a standard practice here in Utah that supports energy affordability.”
Hopefully, he said, more buildings become a big part of solutions for climate and better air quality days in Utah.

(Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)A budget bill passed by the U.S. House of Representatives could impose significant financial and social challenges in Alabama.
The measure could cut food assistance and Medicaid program funding that serve hundreds of thousands of people with low incomes in Alabama, and potentially cost the state hundreds of millions of dollars annually. It’s still unclear if it will pass the U.S. Senate.
The legislation, which passed the House largely along party lines, proposes funding reductions to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and Medicaid. Experts and state officials warn the cuts could lead to increased hunger, loss of health care coverage and other economic consequences across the state, particularly in vulnerable rural communities.
“There are three things in the bill, as it came out of the House, that are problematic for SNAP,” said Carol Gundlach, a policy analyst with Alabama Arise, an organization working on poverty issues. “The first — and the biggest and the most important one — is it shifts cost-sharing to the states.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Historically, states have paid 50% of administrative costs for SNAP, but the benefits themselves have been 100% federally funded. The new bill, Gundlach said, would increase Alabama’s share of administrative expenses to 75%, costing the state an estimated additional $35 million. 
More concerning, she said, is the proposal to shift part of the benefit cost to the states. Gundlach said Alabama could be “on the hook for about 15% of the actual benefit cost of SNAP,” amounting to at least $254 million annually.
“That would also presumably have to come out of the General Fund, and that’s every year, every single year,” Gundlach said.
The proposed SNAP changes also include an expansion of work requirements for parents with children over the age of 7. This could force parents to “jump through a bunch of hoops in order to keep your SNAP benefits, or they’re going to cut your family SNAP benefits,” she said.
The bill could prohibit the U.S. Department of Agriculture from recalculating the base amount of SNAP benefits in the future, a measure Gundlach said would increase hunger as benefits fail to keep pace with food costs.
“Any way this works, people are going to lose SNAP benefits,” she said, warning that in a worst-case scenario, Alabama could walk away from the SNAP program completely, leaving nearly 1 million people dependent on SNAP, or about 20% of Alabama’s population, without food assistance.
Medicaid
Debbie Smith, campaign director for Arise’s Cover Alabama, said Alabama’s “bare bones” Medicaid program also faces pressures. According to Smith, the bill could cost Alabama “$324 million, I think, over 10 years” for Medicaid, translating to roughly $30 million annually. This could increase Alabama’s Medicaid spending per resident by about 15%.
“Any cut to Medicaid is concerning when you have the bare bones program that we have. We really can’t afford to cut anywhere,” Smith said. “$30 million for a year … that’s still a big impact on our state budget.”
The bill would also eliminate the federal incentive designed to encourage states like Alabama to expand Medicaid, a significant concern for Smith.
“(The bill) sunsets that incentive, Jan. 1, 2026, so there’s no time for anybody to take advantage of it before it sunsets,” Smith said.
Even without state expansion, the bill is expected to cause coverage losses. Smith said Arise projects 53,000 people could lose their Medicaid coverage. Combined with the potential expiration of enhanced subsidies for the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplace, 170,000 Alabamians could lose health insurance, leading to a $592.89 million increase in uncompensated care costs for the state, according to a Center for American Progress analysis.
The House bill also proposes reducing retroactive Medicaid coverage from three months to one month.
State budget
The combined potential costs from SNAP and Medicaid changes could put Alabama’s General Fund in a challenging position, but Sen. Greg Albritton, R-Atmore, chair of the Senate Finance and Taxation General Fund committee, said it’s still early in the process and that it’s hard to plan for a bill that could still change.
“We know things are going to get tough, OK, but we don’t know how tough they’re going to be,” Albritton said.
Albritton said lawmakers had trouble finding an increase of about $220 million for Medicaid this past legislative session and he expects another significant increase next year. “Between the changes of SNAP and other changes, that’s going to put more pressure on us,” he said.
Albritton, who has often voiced concerns about federal program funding being pulled, suggested Alabama is somewhat prepared because it hasn’t expanded Medicaid.
“That’s something — at least one of the few things we don’t have to worry about right now,” he said.
Arise described the bill’s measures as “cruel.” Gundlach described the situation as “making parents choose between adequate care for their children and being able to put food on the table. If there is any definition of cruel, I don’t know what else it could possibly be.”
Albritton pushed back against such characterizations, calling the term “alarmist” and blaming partisan politics. He chose a more cautious approach.
“All I can do at this point is sit and watch and wait,” he said. “There’s a lot that we do not know, and we’re running around trying to fix something that we don’t know what the problem is.”

The kindergartners of South Dakota’s Hamlin County are, in fact, in space. To be specific, they are on planet Earth, near the geographic center of North America, sitting crisscross applesauce inside an 11-foot-high inflatable planetarium set up in their school gym.
The darkness is velvety. Childish whispers skitter around the dome like mice. The kids are returning from a short mission to Jupiter, piloted by Kristine Heinen, a young museum educator with a ponytail who knows how to make her voice BIG AND EXCITED and then inviting and quiet to hold little ones’ attention.  

  During the planetarium’s daylong visit to the small community of Hayti, an educator from the South Dakota Discovery Center wowed 500 elementary school students with a presentation about the planets and stars. (Anya Kamenetz for The Hechinger Report)

“Now we’re over China!” Heinen says. 
“My friend went to China!” a girl calls out.
“The other side is nighttime and this side’s bright,” expounds a boy with a crew cut. “The sun shines here so it can’t shine over there.“ 
The school is in eastern South Dakota, 34 miles northeast of the settlement where Laura Ingalls Wilder grew up and attended a one-room schoolhouse. The sprawling Hamlin Education Center is a modern-day analogue, serving an entire district in one building, with just under 900 students, pre-K through 12. Notable graduates include U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, the former governor of South Dakota.
The center is roughly equidistant from four tiny towns, surrounded by open fields where cornstalks shine in the sun; 95% of students arrive by bus, from up to 20 miles away. Over a third of them qualify for free or reduced-price lunch, said Dustin Blaha, the elementary school’s principal. 
Blaha said that most of these children have never been to the South Dakota Discovery Center, a hands-on science museum three hours west in the state capital. But thanks to a federal agency called the Institute of Museum and Library Services, a part of the museum can come to them.
The IMLS was established in 1996, combining previously separate programs. The small agency became the largest source of federal funding for museums and libraries, last year awarding $266.7 million in program grants, research and policy development across all 50 states. IMLS awarded the South Dakota Discovery Center about $45,000 in 2023 to upgrade this traveling planetarium. 
But students around the state may be waiting a long time for the next upgrade.

President Donald Trump signed an executive order in mid-March calling for the agency to be “eliminated to the maximum extent consistent with applicable law.” Mass firings followed.
On May 1, the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., issued a temporary restraining order to block the agency’s dismantling, followed on May 6 by a second federal judge finding the dismantling of this and two other agencies unconstitutional. On May 20, the American Library Association reported that employees are returning to work and some grants have been restored. 

But the administration is continuing its legal battle to all but shutter the IMLS. The latest post on the agency’s Instagram account is captioned, “The era of using your taxpayer dollars to fund DEI grants is OVER,” holding up for criticism grants that were aimed at addressing systemic racism in museums, equitable library practices, and diverse staff development. The IMLS and the Department of Government Efficiency did not respond to requests for comment. 
A veteran of the agency who asked to remain anonymous because of fear of reprisal said they first saw DOGE staffers meeting with leadership on March 28. “On the 31st, we were put on administrative leave. We had about two hours to turn in your key cards, your ID, get everything off your laptop you’re ever going to need. We were locked out of our computer systems by 3:30 and told to get out of the building.” A skeleton crew was hastily rehired the next day. 
The ex-staffer points out that the Institute of Museum and Library Services spends, or spent, just 7% of its budget on its 70 staff, passing the rest along as grants. “We are not a bloated agency.” They have two kids at home, one with special needs and are married to another federal employee whose job is also at risk; but they are almost as worried about their grantees as themselves.
“After 20 years, I didn’t even get to put an out-of-office response up. Is someone emailing me right now and getting nothing, because all of a sudden their grant just ended? I hate that,” the former IMLS employee said.  
Almost all grants awarded required a one-to-one cost share out of the local institution’s budget, the staffer said. Plus, typically the grantees pay for activities first and then apply to get reimbursed. “We’re leaving these often small rural museums and libraries on the hook.”

Anne Lewis, executive director of the South Dakota Discovery Center, said that organizations like hers would be “wobbly” without federal funding and would have to scale back on ambitious programs like the planetarium upgrade.
“The new system has much better interaction and control,” said Heinen, the museum educator. An earlier version had a static point of view, but upgraded visual effects mean that “now we have spaceship mode,” she said. “We can travel to destinations including planets, and go in a full 360-degree mode around galaxies.”

With a flick of the touchscreen menu, she can also display the constellations of a dozen different cultures including Lakota, a significant benefit especially when she visits tribal schools. 
It’s a lean operation: Heinen drove solo nearly 200 miles from Pierre to Watertown the evening before and spent the night at an Econo Lodge. From there, it was another 20-some miles to Hayti, where she arrived at 7:30 in the morning, set up the dome herself, and ran 30-minute programs all day. 
The whole elementary school, about 500 kids in total, saw the planetarium, with each show customized to the children’s interest and grade level; and she also conducted a parent engagement program in the afternoon. Heinen said she never tires of being a “Santa Claus” for science. ”As soon as they see me, they know something fun is going to happen.” 
During this visit, the fan favorites were Jupiter, Mars and the sun. “It was cool when we went to Mars,” said Nash Christensen, 6. “And the volcano on that one moon, and the big hurricane on Jupiter. I think Jupiter is a dangerous place to live.” 
Grant recipients of the Institute of Museum and Library Services say the support from the federal government has been critical to running their programs. For example, the Boston Children’s Museum, the second-oldest children’s museum in the country, has used federal grant money to improve school readiness. One of the outcomes was a new exhibit in the museum, “Countdown to Kindergarten,” that mimics a kindergarten classroom, complete with a school bus you can sit in out front.
“It’s helpful not only for the kids, but some of our caregivers who came from other countries and may not have gone to a school like this,” said Melissa Higgins, the museum’s vice president of programs and exhibits.

At the Madison Children’s Museum in Wisconsin, federal funds paid for a multistate partnership that provides climate education for young children and their families. In Fort Lauderdale, Florida, a grant covered five “STEMobiles,” which offer hands-on science activities for children ages 3-5 in low-income parts of Broward County. The Philadelphia School District won a two-year planning grant to try to improve its pipeline of school librarians; they were down to only a handful for a district of 200,000 students. 
But the greatest impact may come in rural, often deep-red areas.
Trump’s firings reach into a Rapid City museum and derail an expert’s career

“Rural communities have particularly unique challenges,” said Lewis at the South Dakota Discovery Center. “There’s 800,000 people in the state, and they’re dispersed. We don’t have a concentration of funders and donors who can help support these enrichment activities.” 
She said the teachers she serves are “passionate, committed and, like every other place in the world, underfunded.” If not for institutions like hers, students would probably go without this kind of hands-on science experience, she said. 
Blaha, the elementary school principal, concurred. “The planetarium brings excitement and expertise that we don’t typically have in a community like this,” he said.
For now, the excitement is coming to an end. The class has “landed” on a green lawn, under a deep blue sky. Heinen announces “It’s time to leave.” She’s met with a chorus of, “Noo!” 
“You guys, we were in here for a full 30 minutes.”

“It felt like 10!”

“It felt like a second!” 
Tonight, many of them will be able to look up at the dark sky over the prairie and show their parents Jupiter, Ursa Major and Mars.

So far, the first-term Republican governor has vetoed just one bill and signed 169.
For comparison, Lombardo vetoed 75 bills in 2023, setting a single-session veto record. He signed 535 bills.
Nevada governors usually have five days, excluding Sundays, to veto a bill after it gets to their desk. Legislative rules extend that timeframe to 10 days in the waning days of the session. That means vetoes could be announced into next week.
So what might Lombardo veto this year? Below are the bills the Nevada Current has covered that are now on veto watch. We’ve organized them by how bipartisan their journey through the Legislature was. That said, Lombardo last session did veto bills that passed unanimously, and he signed bills that the Republican caucuses voted against.
Passed on party lines

Assembly Bill 44 (Attorney General Aaron Ford, D) seeks to crack down on “knowingly deceptive” price fixing. All Republicans opposed the bill, as did a few Democrats.
Assembly Bill 201 (Assemblymember Erica Roth, D) would expand efforts to automatically seal eviction records.
Assembly Bill 209 (Assemblymember David Orentlicher, D) would grant sex workers immunity from criminal liability from prostitution-related offenses if they call 911 seeking medical assistance.
Assembly Bill 223 (Assemblymember Venicia Considine, D) would give tenants more power to hold landlords accountable for failing to provide livable conditions.
Assembly Bill 280 (Assemblymember Sandra Jauregui, D) proposes rent stabilization for seniors.
Assembly Bill 283 (Assemblymember Max Carter, D) would restructure the eviction process.
Assembly Bill 411 (Assemblymember Sandra Jauregui, D) would allow prescriptions for drugs used for medical abortions and miscarriage management to list the name of the prescribing health care practice, rather than the name of the specific individual providing the prescription.
Assembly Bill 441 (Assemblymember Daniele Monroe-Moreno, D) would change how Opportunity Scholarships are administered.
Senate Bill 350 (State Sen. James Ohrenschall, D) would extend the time period the state has for carrying out an execution of someone on death row.

Bills with bipartisan support

Assembly Bill 398 (Assembly Speaker Steve Yeager, D) would provide additional pay for public school district teachers in hard-to-fill positions and establish a fund for broader charter school raises. Yeager amended the charter school provision into the bill after Lombardo threatened to veto the K-12 education budget over the issue. AB 398 passed the Legislature with broad bipartisan support, with only Democratic Assemblymember Natha Anderson opposing. After its final vote, Lombardo signed the K-12 budget bill, a strong sign he will likely sign AB398.
Assembly Bill 555 (Assembly Speaker Steve Yeager, D) would prohibit private insurance companies from charging people more than $35 for a 30-day supply of insulin. The bill received broad bipartisan support, with only Senate Republicans John Ellison and Robin Titus opposing.
Assembly Bill 452 would ensure customers receive full refunds with interest for overcharges and extend regulatory timelines for rate case reviews. The bill received bipartisan support, with eight of 15 Assembly Republicans supporting the bill. All eight Senate Republicans voted for the bill after an amendment.
Assembly Bill 96 would mandate that cities and counties with populations exceeding 100,000 people include “heat mitigation” as part of their master plans. The bill passed with some bipartisan support. Three of 23 Republicans supported the bill.
Assembly Bill 457 (Assemblymember Venicia Considine, D) originally sought to close a potential loophole that can be used by corporate landlords to avoid paying the state’s commerce tax. It has now been amended into a study on the issue. Only one Republican, Assemblymember John Steinbeck, supported the bill.
Assembly Bill 217 would prohibit school employees from granting permission to immigration officers to enter a school, or provide student records, including information on a student’s family, without a warrant. Six  of 23 Republicans joined Democrats in support.
Assembly Bill 185 (Assemblymember Natha Anderson, D) would bar most HOAs  from prohibiting licensed home-based childcare operations within their communities. Fourteen of 23 Republicans opposed.
Senate Bill 69 (Storey County) would require companies seeking massive tax abatements to enter into agreements to defray the costs of the government-provided services they would require. Seven of 23 Republicans opposed.
Assembly Bill 215 (Assemblymember Daniele Monroe-Moreno, D) would prohibit high school teenagers from working between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. before a school day. The bill received broad bipartisan support, with just three Senate Republicans voting against it.
Assembly Bill 502 would boost the state’s ability to investigate and enforce prevailing wage violations. The bill received broad bipartisan support,with only two Assembly Republicans opposing.
Assembly Bill 112 (Assemblymember Duy Nguyen, D) would allow workers covered by collective bargaining agreements to use their accrued leave to care for family members. The bill passed the Legislature with some bipartisan support.
Senate Bill 121 (State Sen. Dina Neal, D) changes what homeowners’ associations are allowed to require of new residents. Eight of 23 Republicans supported.

Assembly Bill 121 (Assemblymember Venicia Considine, D) would require all non-optional fees, such as sewer and water, be listed in advertisements for rental properties. It would also require landlords to offer a way for tenants to pay rent without added processing fees. Three Republicans voted for the bill.
Assembly Bill 211 (Assemblymember Venicia Considine, D) would allow a third party to take over the property until repairs are made and living conditions improved. The bill passed with broad bipartisan support, with only Republican state Sen. Robin Titus opposing.
Senate Bill 88 would discharge medical debt from those incarcerated once they leave prison. The bill received broad bipartisan support.

 Bills unanimously supported


Senate Bill 54 would require the state’s Department of Health and Human Services to apply for a federal waiver and amend the state Medicaid plan to cover medical respite care for people experiencing homelessness.
Assembly Bill 321 (Assemblymember Jovan Jackson, D) seeks to establish a pathway for formerly incarcerated people to work as firefighters with the Nevada Division of Forestry.
Assembly Bill 104 would establish the Nevada Voluntary Water Rights Retirement Program, which would allow willing landowners to sell their water rights back to the state through the year 2035.
Assembly Bill 277 (Assemblymember Rich DeLong, R) would make the Net Proceeds of Minerals Bulletin public again.
Assembly Bill 176 (Assemblymember Selena Torres-Fossett, D), known as the Right to Contraception Act, would strengthen protections against a state or local government burdening access to contraceptive measures.

Harriet Tubman, along with Black soldiers, took part in a daring Union raid of Combahee Ferry near Beaufort, South Carolina. 
She became the first American woman to lead a major military operation when she and at least 150 Black soldiers helped to rescue more than 700 Black Americans who had been enslaved on nearby plantations. Many of the men became soldiers for the Union Army. 
The Wisconsin State Journal described her as “She-Moses,” whose raid struck “terror to the heart of the rebeldom … without losing a man or receiving a scratch.” She worked on similar missions with the famed Massachusetts 54th Infantry, portrayed in the award-winning movie, “Glory.” 
In all, she made 19 trips back to the South to ensure that hundreds of others that were enslaved made their way to freedom and was quoted as telling them, “If you hear the dogs, keep going. If you see the torches in the woods, keep going. If there’s shouting after you, keep going. Don’t ever stop. Keep going. If you want a taste of freedom, keep going.” 
She was never caught, despite a $40,000 reward ($1.5 million in today’s dollars) for her capture. The movie, “Harriet,” depicts the Combahee Ferry raid. Statues of Tubman can now be seen across the nation, honoring this heroic woman.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/06104619/Harrriet-Tubman-June2.jpg,,,2025-06-02 09:07:41.389687

(Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)Twinkle Andress Cavanaugh is a political pioneer of sorts.
In her campaigns for the Alabama Power Rubber Stamp Squad — excuse me, the Public Service Commission — Cavanaugh had one message: Being a conservative Republican is the only qualification for office.
She trumpeted her opposition to abortion rights, even snagging Mike Huckabee to back her up on that. Later on, she campaigned for re-election in part on her opposition to “socialism and liberal ‘woke’ ideas.”
What did any of this have to do with the Public Service Commission? Zero. The PSC, at least on paper, regulates utilities. It does not restrict abortion. Or college courses. Cavanaugh could have just as easily campaigned on disappointment in Auburn’s 2012 football season. The PSC has as much power over Gene Chizik as women’s health.
Once she became a regulator — first as a member and then as president — Cavanaugh proved a doormat for the utilities. She supported the rate stabilization and equalization process. That guarantees Alabama Power a profit and shields it from questions about its decisions. Rates went up with hardly a peep from the commission.
Terry Dunn, a fellow Republican on the PSC, wanted Alabama Power to explain how it charged customers. Cavanaugh signed onto a cosmetic change to the process that did little to shake the status quo.
Or lower your power bill. Alabamians pay some of the highest prices for electricity in the South. Both in our homes and our businesses.
There could be non-mercenary reasons for that. But we can’t say for certain. Cavanaugh and her colleagues, ostensibly tasked with protecting the public from high prices, showed no interest in learning why our rates are high, much less confronting power suppliers about them.
The PSC in 2015 trumpeted an Alabama Power rate adjustment that would have saved customers – by the utility’s own calculations – one penny a day over a year. Cavanaugh used that opportunity not to call for further reductions, but to bash the federal government.
That was always the real target of her ire. In turning aside a challenge from Dunn in the GOP primary for PSC president in 2016, she lambasted Obama-era regulations aimed at reducing coal emissions and improving public health.
She also prevailed in a general election contest against Democrat Laura Casey in 2020, whose platform included calls to make the rate process more transparent.
In each election, Cavanaugh showed far more interest in attacking national Democratic figures like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez than in making electricity in Alabama affordable.
The PSC’s low profile helped her. So did straight-ticket voting. It allows a parakeet with an R next to its name to win an Alabama state office.
But Cavanaugh showed that embracing an extreme form of political peacocking meant one didn’t even have to bother with the pretense of using public office to advance the public good.
She loved Trump, jobs and burning coal. She hated abortion, the “woke agenda” and Democrats. When conservative media turned to new targets, so did she. Her political agenda always seemed to be whatever Fox News happened to be discussing in the moment.
And as it turned out, hating the right things could land you a job that had nothing to do with those things. An electricity regulator could ignore the power bills in mailboxes in Linden, Alabaster or Dothan so long as she shook her finger at a young woman seeking reproductive health care.
These politics of conservative hallucination used to stand out. Now it’s common practice.
Sen. Tommy Tuberville, our putative governor-in-waiting, plans to campaign against Joe Biden, who is not on the 2026 ballot. He says he will stand with veterans, which should be news to officers who were up for promotion back in 2023. (Or to 80,000 VA workers who could lose their jobs in August.) He claims that tariffs Trump has imposed will help Alabama farmers, even as China’s retaliatory tariffs threaten a major market for them.
And of course, he attacks DEI and “woke” ideas of inclusiveness and human decency, attacks that are sure to be repeated ad nauseam in the coming year in ads showing Tuberville holding guns, walking into a church, or walking into a church with a gun. GOP primary voters ask for nothing more.
After all, they don’t care that Trump has 34 felony convictions. Or that he bungled the COVID response. Or that his tariffs are threatening the economy. He wears his hatred of their perceived enemies like a maroon stovepipe hat. As long as that’s visible, they will tolerate all his incompetence and corruption.
Cavanaugh is now going to work for Trump, serving as Alabama’s “director of rural development” in the state. Considering the administration’s antipathy toward public investment and infrastructure, I would expect her to do little in the way of developing rural areas.
But she can still talk about how much she dislikes abortion. Because in Alabama politics, performative hatred matters more than accomplishment.

(Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)After Donald Trump tapped him as his running mate, J.D. Vance crisscrossed the country and gave speech after speech in which he, like Trump, demonized immigrants and promised to mount a mass deportation effort if elected.
The Boeing 737 that he used to travel around the nation is now being used to deport immigrants. Records show that it has made at least 16 flights to Central and South American countries to deport immigrants this year.
An Arizona Mirror analysis of publicly available data and records obtained by the University of Washington through Freedom of Information Act requests confirms that the 22-year-old jet is part of the fleet of planes known as “ICE Air” that swiftly shuttles immigrants out of the United States. ICE Air consists of multiple charter airlines and other private aviation companies around the country who are contracted to move immigrant detainees inside and out of the country.
Even before the plane was emblazoned with the Trump campaign logo in July 2024, it had been used at least four times to transport immigrant detainees during an earlier stint on the ICE Air fleet.
Data analyzed by the Mirror and confirmed by University of Washington Center for Human Rights researcher Phil Neff show that the aircraft flew four ICE Air missions in April and May of 2018.
Those four missions consisted of three removal flights to El Salvador and Guatemala, in which deportees were shipped off to those countries. The fourth was a transfer flight, in which detainees were moved from one ICE facility to another.
During those four missions in 2018, the aircraft carried between 456 to 504 passengers, according to ICE passenger data.
And records from 2020 detail 35 flights from known ICE hubs to Central and South American countries.
For example, on March 6, 2020, the aircraft took off from the Alexandria Airport in Louisiana, where ICE has a staging facility operated by private contractor GEO Group. It then landed at the José Joaquín de Olmedo International Airport in Guayaquil, Ecuador, before returning to Alexandria.
Earlier this year, that same airport was where military planes deported migrants.
Data on flights after 2018 is more difficult to confirm. ICE and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security began redacting identifying information of the aircraft used in the deportation process, making it more difficult to see the movements of individual planes, though it is still possible in some cases.
In its response to questions from the Arizona Mirror, which DHS provided after this story was published, an unnamed “senior DHS official” said that the department would not confirm whether the plane had been used for deportation flights.
“ICE uses sub-contractors to help carry out its mission to deport illegal aliens,” the unnamed official said in an email. “These sub-contractors are not exclusive to ICE. For operational security, we will not confirm tail numbers of planes used for removing illegal aliens who are often violent criminals and foreign terrorists.”
Claims that most of the Trump administration’s deportees are violent criminals have been repeatedly proven false.
Civil rights groups have been fighting for records about the program, while the agency regularly slow-walks records releases.
“Our experience in general with FOIAs — not just with the Department of Homeland Security, but especially with the Department of Homeland Security — is you should expect to have to sue to get information and for us that process involves getting approval from the highest level of the university,” Neff told the Mirror. “So, we have had to be very selective in the case in which we have had to do that.”
Just five months after Trump and Vance won the election, the aircraft flew between multiple airports known for ICE Air activity before heading to an airport in Honduras known for deportation flights, then coming to rest at Mesa Gateway Airport.
It is not clear if Trump or Vance were aware of the aircraft’s history prior to it becoming part of their campaign. A spokesperson for the White House directed the Mirror to the Department of Homeland Security and Vance’s office. Vance and DHS did not respond.
From ferrying travelers to deportees
The aircraft, N917XA, has a long and interesting history.
It started its life in the fleet of the now defunct Air Berlin before transferring to Orenair, another ill-fated airline based in Russia, until it was acquired by Swift Air.
Swift Air was a subcontractor for ICE and has previously conducted flights out of Mesa Gateway Airport, one of ICE’s major airport hubs. Flight history shows the plane has made multiple flights to and from Mesa Gateway to other ICE airport hubs, as well as to Central and South American countries.
A previous inspector general report listed the Phoenix-Mesa Gateway airport as the operational headquarters for ICE Air.
Swift Air rebranded as iAero Airways in 2019, but went bankrupt in 2024. Eastern Air Express acquired much of iAero’s assets, including N917XA, in April 2024. Three months later, it was unveiled as Vance’s campaign jet. Eastern Air Express has also taken over the ICE Air contracts that iAero held.
The company also has connections to the Trump world.
From 1989 to 1992, Trump owned an airline company called “Trump Shuttle,” which he purchased after meeting the Eastern Air Express CEO at a party. But the endeavor, like so many of Trump’s businesses, was financially doomed and failed.
ICE Air activities heat up in Arizona
ICE Air operations in Arizona are beginning to ramp up as well, with Avelo Airlines starting to make deportation flights out of Mesa Gateway this month, amid financial woes and market competition.
Contracts to conduct deportation flights are lucrative for the companies involved. The Project on Government Oversight has reported that CSI Aviation, whose corporate director was a “fake elector” in New Mexico for Trump, was awarded a no-bid contract to the tune of $128 million.
Neff said he wasn’t surprised to learn that the aircraft which had been used for deportations had been utilized by the Trump campaign, although he did say there was an “irony to it.”
During their research, Neff said they found that some of the contractors would often boast about how they could turn aircraft around from passenger style to luxury style on short notice, even finding aircraft that had previously been used for deportations later being used to shuttle professional sports teams or musicians around the country.
Immigrant advocates have been critical of the flights and say they raise a number of human rights and civil rights issues. Neff said those concerns are only being exacerbated by the Trump administration’s push to speed up deportations.
“I think it is really impossible to overstate or understand the true scope of human impacts of a deportation program on this scale,” Neff said.
During their initial research, which covered flights between 2010 and 2020, Neff said they found a “significant portion” of the passengers being deported still had ongoing cases that had not worked their way through the courts. The Trump administration has recently been defending its use of the Alien Enemies Act, the 1798 law that was last used during World War II to intern Japanese Americans, to do rapid deportations.
Once on the planes, immigrants are shackled at their feet and hands for the duration of the flight. In testimony in a class action lawsuit against the United States, where passengers were shackled for 23 hours sitting on the tarmac, some soiled themselves as they were denied access to the bathroom.
Abuse on ICE Air flights have been reported going back to 2016, when some passengers were left bloodied after being beaten and placed in body-bag style restraints. In some cases, deaths and miscarriages have been reported on ICE Air flights.
And transparency about the flights is getting worse, Neff noted.
While the first round of data obtained by researchers contained information such as flight destinations, flight costs and the tail numbers of aircraft, the government redacted that information from future releases.
While public flight history data is available to researchers, those researchers are working overtime to help track these flights.
“It is 8 or 10 hours, 7 days a week. It is a significant amount of time,” immigration activist Tom Cartwright, who has been voluntarily tracking ICE flights since Trump’s first term, told the Mirror.
During that time, Cartwright has noticed that tracking the aircraft has gotten considerably more difficult, as federal agencies have sought to stymie watchdogs from monitoring the program by removing their aircraft from flight-tracking services.
But Cartwright and others have still found other ways to keep a watchful eye on the program.
“The transparency has gotten worse over time and worse under the (second) Trump administration,” Cartwright said, adding that taxpayers deserve to know how their money is being spent. “To send some of these flights with relatively few people on them at a million dollars a flight seems pretty ridiculous, to be honest.”
The coming weeks and months are likely to keep Cartwright busy, as deportation flights have been ramping up. In the last couple of weeks, Cartwright said he has noticed flights have “accelerated quite a bit,” and he said is anticipating May to be a record-breaking month for total flights.
Cartwright said his work is important because it sends a message to those on the flights — and those their deportation left behind in America.
“The people on the planes deserve the dignity of someone giving a damn,” he said. “All these people on these planes, they have mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers, aunts, uncles. They deserve the dignity of someone understanding that they are being sent away to somewhere that, in some cases, they haven’t seen in years or somewhere that is dangerous or where they won’t be able to support their family.”

(Quentin Young/Colorado Newsline)Multiple people were injured Sunday in downtown Boulder when a man reportedly lit them on fire, according to local police.
Six victims ranging in age from 67 to 88 years old were transported to hospitals in the region, police said. One was described as being in critical condition, with other victims’ injuries ranging from serious to minor.
The suspect, 45-year-old Mohamed Sabry Saliman, was taken into custody by police and was being treated for minor injuries at a hospital, Mark D. Michalek, special agent in charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Denver field office, said during a Sunday evening press conference.
“Witnesses are reporting that the subject used a makeshift flamethrower and threw an incendiary device into the crowd,” Michalek said.
The attack took place near the Boulder County Courthouse on the Pearl Street Mall, an area in the heart of the city that typically attracts hundreds of people on the weekend. The first calls about the attack came at 1:26 p.m., Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn said earlier Sunday.
“The initial callers indicated that there was a man with a weapon and that people were being set on fire,” he said. “When we arrived, we encountered multiple victims that were injured with injuries consistent with burns and other injuries.”
Participants in the Boulder branch of Run For Their Lives, which organizes events calling for the immediate release of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza, were in the area at the time of the attack.
Michalek said the suspect was “heard to yell ‘Free Palestine’ during the attack.” He called it a “targeted act of violence” and said the FBI was investigating it as an act of terrorism.
Kash Patel, director of the FBI, earlier on Sunday called the incident a “targeted terror attack,” and Colorado Gov. Jared Polis said it was a “heinous act of terror.”
The Anti-Defamation League said on social media it was “monitoring the situation in Colorado.”
Joe Neguse, a Democrat who represents Boulder in the U.S. House, characterized the attack as targeting Jewish people.
“I am horrified by the heinous act of terror that took place in downtown Boulder this afternoon,” he said in a statement. “Tonight, as many prepare to mark the Shavuot holiday, our Jewish community has been subjected to yet another brutal and horrific act of violence. The scourge of antisemitism has metastasized across our country, and we must do more — now — to stop this hatred and violence.”
Phil Weiser, Colorado’s attorney general, indicated the group was targeted.
“From what we know, this attack appears to be a hate crime given the group that was targeted,” Weiser said in a statement. “People may have differing views about world events and the Israeli-Hamas conflict, but violence is never the answer to settling differences. Hate has no place in Colorado.”
This is a developing story and will be updated.

Santiago/Getty Images)Alejandro thought that driving full-time for Uber offered freedom — flexible hours, quick cash, and time to care for his young son. But that promise faded fast.
“There are hours when I make $20,” he told me. “And there are hours when I make $2.” As his pay dropped, he pawned his computer and camera, began rationing his insulin, and started driving seven days a week just to break even.
Alejandro, whose real name is withheld for his privacy, is one of millions of workers powering a billion-dollar labor model built on legal loopholes.
Companies like Uber insist they are “tech platforms,” not employers, and that their workers are “independent contractors,” not employees. This sleight of hand allows them to sidestep minimum wage laws, paid sick leave, and other workplace protections while shifting risks onto workers. It also lets them avoid employer taxes, draining funds from public coffers.
A new Human Rights Watch report looks at seven major platform companies — Amazon Flex, DoorDash, Favor, Instacart, Lyft, Shipt, and Uber — and finds that their labor model violates international human rights standards.
These companies promise flexibility and opportunity, but the reality for many workers is far more precarious. In a survey of 127 platform workers in Texas, we found that after subtracting expenses and benefits, the median hourly pay was just $5.12, including tips — well below the already paltry federal minimum wage.
Seventy-five percent of workers we surveyed said they struggled to pay for housing. Thirty-five percent said they couldn’t cover a $400 emergency expense. Over a third had been in a work-related car accident. Many said they sold possessions, relied on food stamps, or borrowed from family and friends to get by.
Their labor keeps the system running — but the system isn’t built to work for them.
By classifying workers as contractors, platform companies avoid paying core employment obligations while retaining tight control over how the work is done. The platforms often use algorithms and automated systems to assign jobs, set pay rates, monitor performance, and deactivate workers without warning.
One Uber driver in Houston said, “They are like puppet masters. They psychologically manipulate you.”
One Shipt worker in Michigan said her pay plummeted immediately after she received two four-star reviews, down from her usual five. Ratings are hard to challenge, and recovering from a low score can take weeks. Workers feel forced to accept every job and appease every customer, reinforcing a system that rewards compliance over fairness.
These aren’t the conditions of self-employment. They’re the conditions of control.
This labor model also drains public resources. In Texas alone, Human Rights Watch estimates that misclassification of platform workers cost the state over $111 million in unemployment insurance contributions between 2020 and 2022 — a quiet transfer of public wealth into private hands.
In 2024, Uber reported $43.9 billion in revenue and nearly $10 billion in net income, calling the fourth quarter its “strongest ever.” DoorDash pulled in $10.72 billion, up 24 percent from the previous year. Combined, their market valuation exceeds $250 billion.
But workers are pushing back, and policymakers are starting to listen. At this June’s UN-backed International Labour Conference, for example, a binding treaty on platform work is under discussion.
The message is clear: workers are demanding rules that protect their rights.
The U.S. can start by updating employment classification standards and adopting clear criteria to determine whether a platform worker is truly independent. We also need greater transparency. If gig workers were properly classified, public companies would have to disclose pay data, showing just how far below the median these workers earn — and how high executive compensation soars above them.
This isn’t about rejecting technology. It’s about making sure companies don’t hide exploitation behind an app. Alejandro has a right to a wage he can live on, protections he can count on, and a system that doesn’t punish him for getting sick, injured, or speaking up.
He and millions like him built the platform economy. It’s time they shared more than the burden.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-06-02 11:31:00+00:00,CT Mirror,There is no difference between Black feminism and DEI,Dione Dwyer | Opinion Contributor,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/02/there-is-no-difference-between-black-feminism-and-dei/,People think DEI is about race and feminism is about gender. But intersectionality can be found embedded into both.,"“Citizens of this nation, cannot know the positive contributions feminist movement has made to all our lives if we do not highlight these gains.”  — bell hooks

DEI (Diversity Equity Inclusion): A framework approach used to create a more inclusive and fair environment for individuals and groups in various settings, such as workplaces, schools, and communities. 
Black Feminism: Focused on building political and social power for Black women, girls, and gender-expansive people. It centers leadership development, community care and joy.  
People think that feminism is about gender. It is not. Feminism is a realization of what’s fair. Feminism is for everybody – just like DEI includes everyone. Everyone that needs the support of it, such as the elderly who might have retired but still have to work to supplement their pension because it’s not enough. It also supports the young adults diagnosed with any spectrum of autism, ADD or ADHD. 

Dione Dwyer
I am a member of a grassroots organization, a resident-owned and lead collective, in the low-income public housing of my city. The organization was founded and established by residents in the community. Years later, It then furthered its establishment by aligning itself with the Black Feminist organizing movement. Getting training to better familiarize ourselves with how involved the organization would be is what kept it going to the current time. 
We then came to the realization that Black feminism is similar to what we are also working towards when it comes to inclusivity: housing justice, education, environmental Justice, and good government. We are constantly working to drive change in the system that is supposed to help lift us up, but only continuously harms us. 
When I think of Black feminism and what’s going on in the world today, it seems to me that feminism is showing up more in the DEI conundrum… How isn’t anyone making this connection? To me they are both interconnected; in similar ways, they both give reasons to be inclusive of everyone. 
They are both the reason that someone who is special needs can still be in the work environment to earn their own pay; it’s the same reason why women are able to do the same work as men. 
Because of Black feminism and DEI in today’s society, women are now included.
Race is what people think DEI is all about; and gender is what people think Black Feminism is all about. But intersectionality can be found embedded into both; and that  is where today’s DEI can actually make a difference to how everyone gets to be included.
DEI and Black feminism can also work in tandem together. However, if DEI – which is threatened – goes away, it may also essentially take away the work of any organization that includes Black feminist work as well. 
The work I do follows the motto of The Combahee River Collective:  “If Black women were free, it would mean that everyone else would have to be free since our freedom would necessitate the destruction of all the systems of oppression.”  
As a matter of fact, DEI would probably not be needed if that statement was to be followed through. But I suppose that not many, especially the ones in charge, can ever imagine a world such as that.  
I suppose hierarchy is always going to be something that we all have to contend with and fight against. Either way, DEI and feminism are both essential to today’s society in order for it to move forward in a direction that it needs to go, for a better functioning world.
bell hooks tells us, “Feminists are made, not born. One does not become an advocate of feminist politics simply by having the privilege of having been born female. Like all political positions one becomes a believer in feminist politics through choice and action.” 
This also goes for DEI, it doesn’t exist just for the Black race to be incorporated into the existing world. It exists because everyone else that will be excluded, and is not able to be a part of the existing normal world, that may have a little bit of a difference when it comes to physical ability, mental learning, emotional processing, and more, will now certainly be included and live a “normal life.”
Inclusivity is what DEI and Black feminism have always been about, to make sure the one-sided thinking of the past is no longer something to go by. To make sure that as life progresses we are including all of the people that may come with a different way of being, and be able to progress in this world we live in. 
So why is the current administration trying to pull that apart? Why is it that so many corporations are willing to undo the DEI progress that actually has been working towards bringing all of us together? Isn’t this the way we’ve made progress in the first place? To what end? Will undoing all these things help us all progress further in the world in this lifetime? Why are we working so hard to dismantle that progress? What will happen to us all after we do these things? 
True inclusion disrupts how we’ve been going along to get along. That all humans who can be included with all of our uniqueness to bring progress along even more so. The people want some answers.

The last day of early voting is Monday, with Election Day on Tuesday to elect a new county executive and a county council member.","A drop box in a parking lot next to Prince George’s County Board of Elections on May 30. (Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)Prince George’s County’s year of cascading special elections is almost over.
More than 62,000 Prince George’s County voters had dropped off mail-in ballots as of Friday, ahead of Tuesday’s special election to choose a new county executive and a new District 5 council member, a county election official said.
In-person turnout was light — just 307 voters on Wednesday, the first day of early voting and 396 on Thursday — but county Election Administrator Wendy Honesty-Bey attributed that to the week’s rainy weather. “It’s been expected,” she said Friday.
There is one more day of early voting Monday before Election Day on Tuesday. The voting caps a year of upheaval in the county, where the election of a new U.S. senator and the criminal conviction of a sitting council member created openings that had a domino effect, as county officials moved in to new positions.
The parade of elections began with the conviction last year of former At-large Council Member Jamel “Mel” Frankin, who was convicted in a campaign theft scheme, setting up an August primary and a November election. When District 5 Council Member Jolene Ivey won Franklin’s seat and County Executive Angela Alsobrooks won a U.S. Senate seat in November, it set up a March primary and Tuesday’s general election for those seats.
In the executive’s race, voters are choosing between State’s Attorney Aisha Braveboy, the Democrat, and Republican nominee Jonathan White to fill out the remaining two years of Alsobrooks’ term, who stepped down in December to take her Senate seat.
The county’s chief administrative officer, Tara H. Jackson, who has been acting county executive since Alsobrooks stepped down, chose not to seek the seat.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Braveboy, who was endorsed by Gov. Wes Moore (D), easily won a March primary over a field of nine Democrats, including former County Executive Rushern L. Baker III, who had the endorsement of  state treasurer and county resident Dereck Davis (D), and At-Large Council Member Calvin Hawkins, who was endorsed by Alsobrooks.
Ivey was briefly a candidate in the executive’s race but withdrew before the primary — and still managed to finish fourth. By withdrawing, Ivey spared county residents the prospect of another special election for her at-large council seat. Should Braveboy win the executive’s race, the county’s circuit court judges will select a replacement to serve out the remaining two years of her term.
In heavily Democratic Prince George’s County, Braveboy is the favorite to win. In a victory party after her March 4 primary win, Braveboy acknowledged as much when she told the crowd, “I can’t wait to serve as your next county executive.”
Voters in council District 5,which includes Bladensburg, Cheverly and Glenarden, are also choosing between former school board member Shayla Adams-Stafford, a Democrat, and Republican Fred Price Jr. to replace Ivey.
Adams-Stafford, a former school board member, won the Democratic nomination by slightly more than 2,000 votes against four other candidates. A fifth Democratic challenger, former Cheverly Mayor Kayce Munyeneh who lost reelection in last month’s city election, dropped out the County Council race.
As with Braveboy, Adams-Stafford is the likely favorite in the heavily Democratic county.
The council make up could become more progressive with Adams-Stafford on the council, who also received support from Council Chair Edward Burroughs III and Vice Chair Krystal Oriadha. About three weeks after Braveboy won the special primary, Burroughs became the youngest chair in the county’s history at age 32.
Honesty-Bey said counting ballots for Tuesday’s special general election should be completed by June 13.
The winners in both races are scheduled to be sworn in June 19, the federal holiday of Juneteenth, also observed by the state and county, when government offices will be closed.

Here's what to know.,"Republicans in Congress are inching closer to passing a significant piece of legislation that could affect everything from taxes to immigration to Medicaid.
The “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” is the vehicle to enact much of President Donald J. Trump’s second-term agenda. Republicans want to extend the tax breaks in the 2017 tax law that passed during his first term and will expire at the end of the year.
The legislation has implications on taxes for individuals and families at most income levels as well as for businesses and universities. To offset some of those costs, the bill includes steep spending cuts, which would have a direct impact on some safety net programs.
Because they control both chambers of Congress, Republicans can pass a budget bill on their own. But they have been dealing with internal conflicts, and the bill could end up looking considerably different in the final stages.
[RELATED: As U.S. House passes ‘big beautiful bill,’ CT delegation joins opposition]
Democrats, including Connecticut’s congressional delegation, are opposed and have no role in crafting the bill. They argue it will disproportionately benefit wealthier Americans and big corporations, balloon the national debt and cut critical services.
Here’s where the bill currently stands and what it could mean for your finances.
How will it affect my taxes going forward?
Individuals and households in Connecticut could see quick relief on some of their taxes. But some of it will only be temporary and last through the rest of Trump’s term.
It makes many of the tax breaks permanent from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act since they will expire at the end of the year, including lower income tax rates.
One of the most-watched parts of the bill has been whether to raise the cap on deductions for state and local taxes, or SALT. If the cap increases, it will be especially beneficial for higher cost-of-living states like Connecticut.
The bill would raise the $10,000 threshold on SALT deductions to $40,000, which would get phased out for those who make over $500,000. Both caps would increase by 1% through 2033. But it’s likely the Senate will make changes to this provision.
Workers would be able to deduct overtime pay or tips from their federal income tax. And people could deduct up to $10,000 of interest on their auto loans as long as the vehicle was assembled in the U.S. All three tax breaks would last through 2028.
Families would get to claim a slightly higher child tax credit. The rebate would increase to $2,500 through 2028 and then go back down to $2,000 and indexed for inflation. It also requires parents who file taxes jointly to have Social Security numbers.
Seniors who are 65 and older with low to middle incomes will be able to make an additional $4,000 deduction. And the bill would automatically create new savings accounts for newborns born between Jan. 1, 2025, to Jan. 1, 2029. The federal government would give a one-time deposit of $1,000 and invest it in the stock market. Others would be able to contribute up to $5,000 a year through the age of 18.
There would also be changes to student loans and financial assistance.
For Pell Grant recipients who want to get the maximum amount, they need to be full-time students. Under the bill, students would need to increase the number of credits they take each semester from 12 to 15 to reach that status. They need to be half-time students to get at least some assistance. But it would also expand these grants in other cases by making short-term vocational training eligible for Pell.
And the bill would reduce the number of existing income-driven repayment plans to pay back student loans and get rid of federal subsidized loans for undergraduates.
Consumers would no longer see the tax breaks for electric vehicles and energy-efficient home appliances that were part of Democrats’ Inflation Reduction Act.  
Will I lose access to Medicaid or SNAP benefits?
Not necessarily. But cuts are expected if stricter work requirements and other changes are enacted. If the bill passes in its current form, those could go into effect as early as late 2026.
The Congressional Budget Office, which analyzes and scores federal bills, estimates up to 10 million people could lose Medicaid coverage and about 3 million people could lose food assistance in the U.S. over the next decade.
To qualify for Medicaid as an adult under 65, you would need to work or participate in training, education or community service at least 80 hours a month. Exemptions are made for certain groups including those who are pregnant or postpartum, Medicare recipients, veterans, caregivers and people with disabilities.
For those who fall under the requirement, the bill would require you to report that work and the state would conduct frequent checks to ensure eligibility. Those same adults would also need to pay a $35 co-pay for most services.
The bill also seeks to penalize states like Connecticut that provide Medicaid regardless of immigration status. “HUSKY for immigrants” provides state-sponsored health care for children under 15 and people who are postpartum with qualifying incomes. Connecticut uses its own money to provide that coverage, but could stand to see reductions to their federal Medicaid reimbursement for doing so.
Under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program proposal, more older Americans would need to work or train at least 80 hours a month. The bill raises the age limit for able-bodied adults without dependents from 54 to 64.
Dependents are currently considered under the age of 18. But when it comes to SNAP, the bill would significantly lower the age of a dependent to under 7. That means work requirements would also apply to able-bodied adults with children ages 7 or older in order to receive benefits.
States like Connecticut would need to pay a portion of SNAP benefits for the first time in the program’s history. That has raised concerns about potential benefit cuts.
Where does Trump’s bill stand in Congress?
Republicans are using a fast-track process known as budget reconciliation. This allows them to bypass filibusters in the Senate and pass certain kinds of bills without relying on support from Democrats. But the process can still take months to complete.
In late May, Republicans in the House narrowly passed the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” after weeks of negotiations and divides within the party about what to include.
With Congress returning from recess the first week of June, the Senate will now take it up. They will go through their own tedious negotiations, an all-night vote series on amendments and then a final vote on passage.
Because the Senate is likely to make changes, Republicans in both chambers would then need to reconcile the differences and vote on a compromise bill. Republicans are aiming to wrap up the process and send it to Trump for his signature by July 4. But it could take more time if the party remains split on the final version.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AP25126554098870-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-02 08:04:37.701562

The Arc Maryland said thanks to four lawmakers Thursday, recognizing them at the Arc Maryland’s 65th Convention and Awards banquet for their part in clawing back nearly $300 million in proposed cuts to the Developmental Disabilities Administration.
Budget and Taxation Chair Guy Guzzone (D-Howard), Appropriations Chair Ben Barnes (D- Prince George’s and Anne Arundel), Sen. Cory McCray (D-Baltimore City) and Del. Emily Shetty (D-Montgomery) were each given a Legislator of the Year award Thursday at the Arc Maryland’s 65th Convention and Awards banquet.
As chairs of committees that create the state budget, Guzzone and Barnes were influential in restoring millions in funding back to the DDA, which oversees the services for people with developmental disabilities, after Gov. Wes Moore (D) initially proposed $457 million in cuts for the 2026 budget citing unsustainable growth and costs.
Much of the work to restore almost $300 million to the agency occurred in budget subcommittees in the respective chambers, with McCray leading the effort in the Health and Human Services subcommittee and Shetty leading the Health and Social Services subcommittee.
“This was a heck of a year – one that we would not like to be repeated,” Guzzone said in accepting his award.
It was a grueling session for advocates in the developmental disabilities community. Hundreds of people with disabilities, their families and support staff rallied in Annapolis against the hefty cuts, and significant lobbying efforts continued throughout session.
Guzzone recognized the persistent lobbying from the developmental disability community this session as “inspiring” and an example of democracy at work.
“I am just touched by the fact that all of you keep telling your stories, bringing them to the legislature,” he said “And there are others in the legislature who really stepped up.”
“This was a session when we needed all hands on deck,” he said. “The team of people who came together who said, ‘No way, we’re not going to let this happen. We’re going to work with the administration to make this thing — this enormous amount of money — we’re going to figure out a way to deal with it.'”

Kamonjoh officially began his job Wednesday, when he was introduced at the SRPS Board of Trustees meeting.

Speaking of the Maryland State Retirement Agency…


Maryland State Retirement Agency Chief Investment Officer Andrew Palmer has been named to Blueprint Capital Advisors’ 2025 “Power100” list as a leading allocator among institutional investors.
The Power 100 is a nonprofit enterprise designed “to shine a spotlight on alternative investment organizations, professionals and investors that are high performing, impacting the industry and narrowing societal gaps related to wealth, health, education, and other areas important to us all.”
“This recognition speaks to the work of our investment team and the broader mission of the Maryland State Retirement Agency,” Palmer said in a release from the retirement agency. “It’s gratifying to see how our investment strategy not only secures the long-term retirement benefits of our members but also contributes meaningfully to the future of the investment industry.”
It is the second consecutive year Palmer has been named to the Power 100. Under his guidance, the agency said, the investment division has consistently pursued innovative strategies while staying grounded in the fiduciary responsibilities owed to Maryland’s public employees and retirees.
“Andy’s recognition is a reflection of the values we prioritize at SRA: integrity, long-term thinking, and a commitment to the public good,” said SRA Executive Director Martin Noven. “We’re proud that our investment program is not only producing strong results for members, but also serving as a model for principled, inclusive leadership in the broader investment community.”
The list also features other prominent state pension systems, including CalSTRS, the New York State Common Retirement Fund, and the Employees’ Retirement System of Hawaii.

(Courtesy of the New Jersey Governor's Office)Attorneys for the state of New Jersey want an appellate court to deny a request by nonprofit groups and several public school families who want the court to hear their case that New Jersey schools are unconstitutionally segregated along racial and socioeconomic lines.
In a 46-page brief filed last week, the state’s attorneys argue that it is premature for the appellate division to hear the case because a trial judge overseeing the dispute has not issued a final order. The record before the trial judge is too limited, and an appellate court weighing in now would result in “piecemeal review,” the state argues.
“There is no grave damage or injustice necessitating immediate appellate review,” the state said.
The case, filed in 2018 by Latino Action Network and the statewide NAACP, among others, alleges that school district boundaries tied to municipalities exacerbate de facto segregation across schools. They cited a UCLA study that found New Jersey had the seventh most segregated school system, with nearly half of all Black and Latino students in New Jersey attending schools that are more than 90% non-white, schools that are often mere blocks from predominately white districts. The plaintiffs note that the state has a constitutional duty to provide students with a “thorough and efficient” education. 
In October 2023, a state superior court judge ruled that the plaintiffs demonstrated a “marked and persistent racial imbalance” in public schools, but said the lack of data did not prove their sweeping claim that the system is “unconstitutionally segregated because of race or ethnicity.” He declined the plaintiffs’ request for an immediate ruling. The plaintiffs appealed.
In Wednesday’s filing, the state criticizes the plaintiffs for failing to show what desegregation would look like or offering any “practical solution.”
The state’s recent filing came one day after the New Jersey Policy Institute, a nonprofit think tank that supports school choice, filed a 20-page motion in the case arguing in favor of expanding a state program that allows students to attend schools outside of their hometowns. 
Enrollment in the program has been virtually frozen since 2015. Lifting that freeze would be a cost-effective way to increase racial diversity and would not require any significant additional administration, they said, adding that districts could be incentivized to participate.
The program offers a “ready-made solution that can be implemented almost immediately,” according to the institute, which says more than 2,000 students are currently on waitlists. And school choice expansion could help integrate schools more quickly than redistricting, according to the brief. 
“The state has already built the infrastructure. All that’s left is to unfreeze it,” the brief states.

Most countries pay for hospital care as a universal public good.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Ellen Oxfeld: Our health care system needs systemic reform.","To the Editor,In the latest outrageous Vermont health care news, we learn that Vermont hospitals are marking up outpatient drugs to an average of more than 500% of the manufacturer’s price (and in one case nearly 70 times the manufacturer’s price) — the highest markup in the nation.This is one of several reasons for escalating health insurance costs in Vermont. So, it is good news that lawmakers are taking emergency steps and adding an amendment to a drug price bill that would cap outpatient drug prices.READ MORE
But is it effective to keep responding on a one-on-one basis to each health care crisis? Ironically, the lobbyist for the hospitals has admitted that price gouging is wrong. But she argues we have a “very flawed way of paying for health care.”That’s correct. Most countries pay for hospital care as a universal public good. They pool publicly raised funds and finance their hospitals with global operating budgets that take account of local needs and levels of care required in each facility. Such systems have better control over hospital costs and more effective public oversight than we do. Yet this legislative session, a bill (H.267) that would have created a publicly financed hospital system languished in House Health. No testimony was taken. The same is true of bills that would have created universal primary care (H.433 and H.185). Can our relevant House committees take testimony on these bills next session?We can keep trying to put out forest fires, or we can start the work of systemic reform.

Why I withdrew my amendment, and why that matters.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Rep. Troy Headrick: Equity requires more than rhetoric.","This commentary is by Rep. Troy Headrick, I-Burlington.Recently, during floor debate on S.123, I offered an amendment that would have created an eight-year renewal option for Vermont-issued identification cards. It was designed to provide longer-term stability and protection for Vermonters, especially those who are trans and nonbinary.The structure was simple and sound, the amendment was revenue neutral, included safeguards to stabilize DMV revenue over time, and aligned with Vermont’s proud policy of allowing self-attestation of gender identity.I also withdrew the amendment.To some, that may have seemed abrupt or puzzling. But the choice was deliberate. While I remain convinced that the amendment represents strong policy, I knew that insisting on a vote could delay passage of the underlying bill that also includes a critical early renewal provision that trans and nonbinary Vermonters need immediately. Preserving that core protection became the priority.Still, we need to talk about what this moment revealed.Vermont leads in recognizing gender identity, but we do so within a larger federal system. The Trump administration’s recent executive order directs federal agencies to define sex based on immutable biology at conception. This quietly but powerfully undermines existing ID frameworks.A Vermont-issued ID that reflects a person’s affirmed gender could now be questioned or rejected by the Transportation Security Administration, passport agencies or other federal entities. That’s not hypothetical. It’s the creeping return of exclusion via administrative means.My amendment would have given Vermonters a shield with an eight-year window of bureaucratic peace. Time to travel, apply for jobs, enroll in benefits or simply move through the world without being asked to re-prove who they are.And yet, too few in the chamber seemed ready to engage with that reality. The concerns raised weren’t rooted in hostility, but they were rooted in and exposed a blind spot. Some viewed the eight-year renewal as a bonus convenience, not a policy with protective power. Others were uncomfortable with the idea of setting up a reserve fund, despite the clear fiscal logic behind it.What concerns me most isn’t that the amendment was withdrawn, but that too few of my colleagues recognized what it actually offered. For those of us who’ve never had our identity questioned at airport security or challenged by a federal agency, an eight-year ID renewal might sound like a simple convenience. But for trans and nonbinary Vermonters, many of whom aren’t in the room when we draft these policies, it would mean eight years of peace of mind, safety and stability.When we dismiss policy changes as nonessential because they seem nonessential to us, we risk missing real opportunities to protect those who are most at risk. That’s a policy failure. Specifically it’s a failure to act on our stated commitment to keeping equity at the center of our legislative processes.This is not the end of the conversation. The issue will return, as it must. In the meantime, I hope this moment serves as a reminder that equity requires more than good intentions. It requires an ability to see the implications of our policy through the eyes of those who are most affected by it.Because dignity shouldn’t expire every four years.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Rep. Troy Headrick: Equity requires more than rhetoric.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Commentaries_featured-image-25.png,,,2025-06-02 07:11:18.948199

In 2024, fatal overdoses in the state dropped nearly 11% from the previous year, from 3,512 to 3,137, according to preliminary data released by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
“There’s been not a lot of good news in this space, and this is good news,” said Dr. Herbert Duber, regional medical officer at the state Department of Health. “I think that we need to get more time, though, to see how it sticks.”
Last year’s total is still nearly 14% higher than the deaths recorded in 2022.
Washington saw the downward overdose trend reversed in the last few months of 2024, noted Duber. The past month has also seen a significant increase. 
Washington’s decrease last year was far below the national average of more than 25%. Only two states saw upticks in overdose deaths: Nevada and South Dakota. 
Nationally, overdose remains the leading cause of death for Americans ages 18 to 44, health officials say.
Fatal overdoses had been rising quickly in Washington. In 2019, fewer than 1,300 residents died, according to state data. 
Highly potent fentanyl drove that rise, along with increased drug use during the pandemic. In 2019, just over 300 people in Washington died from synthetic opioids like fentanyl. By 2023, that had skyrocketed to more than 2,600, according to the state Department of Health.
Federal health officials cite the Overdose Data to Action program as a way to continue reducing deaths through statistic-guided prevention efforts. The state Department of Health, as well as the King and Snohomish County health departments, have received federal money under Overdose Data to Action.
In Washington, Duber sees increasing access to treatment as a catalyst for the improvement seen last year, especially to the medication buprenorphine meant to treat opioid addiction. Duber, an emergency department physician, will prescribe Suboxone, a medication containing both buprenorphine and naloxone that reduces opioid withdrawal symptoms.
“There’s just been an increasing level of comfort and education and engagement on opioids, trying to figure out a way where the healthcare community can really impact this epidemic,” Duber said.
The state is looking to keep the progress going. The two-year state budget Gov. Bob Ferguson signed last week included money for a new hotline to facilitate access to services and medication like buprenorphine. The earliest that could be launched is in September, a Department of Health spokesperson said.
The goal is to lower barriers as much as possible to give people the chance to get treatment.
But the so-called “big, beautiful bill” the U.S. House passed last month could threaten the progress. The Medicaid program for low-income Americans is the largest payer for opioid use disorder treatment in Washington, according to the state Health Care Authority.
The Republican-backed legislation proposes cutting Medicaid by hundreds of billions of dollars over the next decade, a move that could cost Washington about $2 billion over the next four years and force around 194,000 to lose coverage, local leaders have warned.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/drug-syringe-1.jpeg,,,2025-06-02 07:11:18.948199

(Niki Kelly/Indiana Capital Chronicle)The sprawling sports complex on the edge of southern Lebanon, bordered by open fields and new townhomes, is a welcome and familiar site to Jessica Hill. She regularly brings her 8-year-old son, Larry, to The Farmers Bank Fieldhouse for his basketball league games and practices. The duo also come to watch the Lebanon Leprechauns, a professional basketball team that plays in the Midwest Division of The Basketball League.
The 200,000-square-foot Fieldhouse is one of hundreds across the country and more than a dozen in Indiana promising economic growth, a tourism boost, community engagement and a foothold in the fast-growing world of youth athletics.
“It fuels our community, which is great,” said the mom, who pointed to opportunities for youth sports fans. The venue also hosts birthday parties, golf simulators, batting cages and even personal trainers — though all have an associated cost. 

Arnolt Center for Investigative Journalism staff Max Reich, Marissa Meador, Mia Hilkowitz, Alaska Jones, Zoe Benson and Libby Erlenbaugh co-wrote this special report.

The building is part of a changing Lebanon, which is also set to host a mammoth technology park that’s spurring new housing and associated development — growth that Hill said could sometimes be overwhelming. 
“In the long run, this place will be good for our community,” she concluded. 
The Hills were among roughly 300 hometown fans at the sports complex who watched the Leprechauns narrowly lose a May 23 game that featured a local dance squad, opening game prayer and people shooting hoops on open courts. 
Mike Edwards, an associate professor at North Carolina State University, who researches sport and community development, said that type of investment can benefit communities, but only if the needs of local residents remain the priority.
“I’m a big believer that your first priority for how you’re spending your tax money for recreation, for sport partnership should be a direct benefit to your local residents,” Edwards said. “If it’s not balanced with direct use, accessibility and benefits to that local community, then you’re probably missing out on, really, what the focus of these facilities should be.” 
Sports tourism projects have popped up all over the state — from Columbus and Noblesville to Hammond and Newton County. But the recent push to make Indiana a go-to destination for youth sport competitions started, arguably, in Westfield.
Economic impact and strategic investment 
On the outskirts of Indianapolis, the $49-million Grand Park Sports Complex, has 15 clover-shaped outdoor baseball fields visible from above, sprawling across acres of open land. Inside its main building, which opened in 2016, synthetic turf bears the brunt of hundreds of cleats as youth athletes cycle through tournaments, practices and games across a range of sports. 
Weekends are the busiest times for the complex, as it is usually hosting youth sports tournaments and larger events. Grand Park’s largest events are the Crossroads of America College soccer showcase, the NXT Lacrosse MidAmerica Invitational and the Amateur Baseball Championships. Grand Park also hosts the Indianapolis Colts Training Camp. Occasionally, the complex will host non-sporting related events — including farming and equipment expos, corporate events and even a political rally for President Donald Trump during his inaugural campaign. Youth sports teams train at the soccer fields and baseball diamonds for the rest of the week.
Matt Trnian has served as director of Grand Park Sports Complex since January 2022. He said the complex attracts around 5.5 million visitors each year, from all over the country, but mainly from the Midwest.

Trnian said Grand Park is designed to attract tourists who otherwise never would have visited Westfield and its businesses. 
“So the vision with these events is to have them spend their tourism dollars within the community and to eat at our local restaurants, shop at our local retail stores and spend their tourism dollars within our community,” Trnian said. “So there’s certainly a direct impact to the visitation that Grand Park has to the local businesses throughout Westfield.” 
Revenue for Westfield’s Grand Park reached an all-time high last year, as reported earlier this year by Inside INdiana Business. Recently, an adjoining sports, entertainment and business district started generating enough tax increment financing to cover debt payments roughly a decade after opening.
The city still owes $62 million, according to the story, with payoff scheduled for 2041. But, unlike other public parks, the complex isn’t free for residents to use — similar to how other publicly funded sports complexes operate. 
A cultural shift for youth sports
Access to these facilities and their programs often depends on a family’s ability to travel and keep up with the rising expenses associated with youth sports.
While local leaders see the economic benefits from sports complexes, the multi-million-dollar complexes often shut out children who can’t afford to participate. 
“If you’re going to use public funds to build a facility like Grand Park [sports complex], how do you assure that the local youth in that area can still access it?” said Cassandra Coble, an associate professor at Indiana University who researches youth sports.
For example, open courts at the Lebanon sports complex cost $12 per session, unless you purchase a membership for at least $50 per month. A junior hoops summer camp starts at $250 per child while a volleyball camp is $200.
Beyond infrastructure, these complexes reflect a cultural shift in how some Americans view youth sports — not just as recreation, but as tools for community advertising and development.
Many of these complexes pop up in rural areas where land is more readily available, which can create other participation hurdles for families such as a shortage of volunteers to coach or maintain playing spaces.
“Rural communities face a unique set of challenges when it comes to access to sports and physical activity,” Edwards said. “Transportation is often a major barrier in areas where parents commute into urban centers and kids take the bus home from school, it’s hard for them to access space.”
Limited parks staffing and tight municipal budgets can make it difficult to maintain scattered parks and fields. In response, Edwards said, many towns have moved toward consolidation.

“There’s been a real emphasis on centralizing complexes and parks,” he said. “But in doing so, you sometimes make the park less accessible to the population.”
Coble said she worries about the rise of these complexes, many of which are private, and their long-term effect on youth participation as costs for travel, equipment and private coaching increase
The average U.S. family spent $1,016 on their child’s primary sport in 2024, a 46% increase since 2019, according to a recent survey by the Aspen Institute. This figure doesn’t include expenses related to secondary or even tertiary sports teams. When added up, parents said they spent around $1,500 dollars in 2024.
In total, families in the U.S. currently spend an estimated $40 billion annually on youth sports — double the revenue generated by the NFL, according to the Aspen Institute study. That figure leaves out additional public spending by schools and municipalities, and investments from private facility operators.
Experts, including Coble, say the growing commercialization of youth sports is limiting access to equitable opportunities and, in some cases, is pricing children out of participation altogether.
“There has for a long time been a gap between who has legitimate access to participating in youth sports,” Coble said. “But that gap is growing and growing with the introduction of private training and private facilities.”
An ecosystem for youth sports
Less than 20 miles away from Grand Park, The Farmers Bank Fieldhouse is pitched as one part of the overall “youth sports ecosystem” in central Indiana, according to Lebanon Mayor Matt Gentry.
“It’s actually a multiplier; it’s not a competition-type situation,” Gentry said. “Even before we built our facility, we were getting overflow hotel rooms and stays in Lebanon because of Grand Park and because of the Pacer Athletic Center.
“They’re already kind of feeding and supporting each other,” Gentry continued. “Us having a facility isn’t a negative for (them).”

Gentry said the attraction brings an estimated 60,000 visitors monthly from across the country. Conversations with business owners have made it clear the Fieldhouse has had a positive ripple effect, he added.
“They’ve told me directly they’ve seen increases in business, and our downtown has seen an influx of visitors with different events,” he said.
The city is planning additional economic development around the facility using the Fieldhouse as the main attraction. But, more than a year after its opening, the land in front of the facility is overgrown and features mounds of dirt from the original construction.
“Having the Fieldhouse there is the anchor tenant that makes everything possible,” Gentry said. “We would not be getting an interest in these amenities if we didn’t have the tourism base, and frankly, just the foot traffic, generated by the fieldhouse.”
The $25-million public bond for Lebanon’s complex is set up to be paid for over 25 years by property taxes, innkeeper’s taxes, and food and beverage taxes, though Gentry acknowledged that local income taxes are a last-resort option if all else fails.
“Essentially, all of the development is going to pay for the Fieldhouse, back onto itself,” said Gentry.
Hoosier cities add to the momentum
Across the state, Fort Wayne’s city leaders introduced plans for a $1.5 billion redevelopment project in February. 
The first phase of the proposed North River development includes the North River Fieldhouse, a 160,000 square foot, $60 million facility to advance Fort Wayne’s standing in the sports tourism industry, according to a news release from the city.

It’s expected to host events 27 weekends of the 52-week year, create about 900 new jobs and generate an anticipated $36 million in new economic activity, according to consulting firm Victus Advisors. The city recently approved a contract with Victus to secure a developer for the site.
The city hasn’t yet determined how it will finance such a project, though it is exploring whether it can tap into federal money slated to help with river cleanup, according to WANE, a local television station.
The facility will also be available for public use outside of the tournament season. 
Alec Johnson, Fort Wayne’s deputy director for redevelopment, said that the facility is expected to serve as a catalyst for the success of the rest of the mixed-use district, which will include a boutique hotel, riverwalk, shopping and dining alongside the proposed soccer stadium, natatorium, E-sports venue, athletic fields and basketball courts.
Johnson said the question of public benefit has been central to planning, which includes a “very active” neighborhood association within the district.
“The way that they sort of look at it is, everybody is falling in love with the riverfront development,” Johnson said about the district’s neighborhood association. “So, how do we sort of leverage that and allow that momentum and positivity to jump the river to the northside and spill out into the neighborhood so they see the benefit?”

I wrote a lot about wolves, apparently. (Getty Images)Welcome to The Topline, a weekly roundup of the big numbers driving the Minnesota news cycle, as well as the smaller ones that you might have missed. This week: the bottom line.
Well Reformers, this is it: the final Topline. Call it the Bottom Line? 
As this is my last day here, I thought I’d do something a little more self-indulgent than usual and look back at my time at the Reformer, by the numbers.
Number of days I was employed by the Reformer: 1,050
I started at the Reformer on July 18, 2022, making my tenure just a hair under three years. My first story was about wolf attacks, and how they benefit far-right politicians. I published 309 stories in total, including this one, which works out to about one byline every 3.4 calendar days.
The most widely-read story I worked on was this one from March about then-Sen. Justin Eichorn’s arrest in an underage prostitution sting, although if I recall correctly Michelle Griffith actually did most of the work on it. 
My most-read solo piece was a November 2023 story about how wolves weren’t responsible for that year’s disappointing deer hunt. Judging by the state of my inbox at the time, many of those pageviews were hate-clicks from angry guys looking for any excuse to go shoot a wolf.
Pieces of legislation inspired: 3
Journalism’s not just about the hate-clicks, of course: You’re also trying to change things for the better. To that end, my stories inspired three pieces of legislation in St. Paul this year.
The first was a bill providing grant money to help solve non-fatal shootings in the state. This came about after I wrote last year about data showing more than half of violent crimes in Minnesota go unsolved.
The second would have reformed how so-called “drug free zones” can be policed after I reported on the aggressive and frankly bizarre drug charging practices used by a prosecutor in Polk County (and basically nowhere else).
The third, and the only signed into law this term, was the bill that finally decriminalized bong water in the state. It was inspired by my reporting on Jessica Beske of Fargo, who was staring down the barrel of a 30-year prison term after cops alleged they’d  found a bong used to smoke methamphetamine in her car.
That case, incidentally, also came out of Polk County. Some very strange things happening up there! 
It’s also worth noting that these stories didn’t just arise out of a vacuum. The Reformer had done extensive work on violent crime clearance rates long before I showed up. And Jessica Beske reached out to us only because she had read Deena Winter’s prior reporting on drug paraphernalia reform at the legislature.
Legislator ties to extremist groups exposed: 1
One of the things that drew me to the Reformer in the first place was editor Patrick Coolican’s characterization of it as a newsroom that would tell the stories other news organizations can’t or won’t  tell. I got a first-hand taste of this shortly after I started, with a piece about former Republican Rep. Donald Raleigh of Blaine, whose name had turned up on a leaked membership roster of the Oath Keepers, a far-right extremist group.
Raleigh’s defense was that he never actually agreed with the Oath Keepers’ ideology, and had only signed up for their email list as part of “market research” he was doing for a veteran’s organization he founded. He also told us that other news outlets, like the Star Tribune and Buzzfeed, had looked into his ties to the group and decided they weren’t worth doing a story on. The implication was that we shouldn’t be reporting on it either.
I strongly disagreed, and Patrick backed me up on this. Raleigh’s story was plausible enough, and that’s how we framed our piece. But by the time Raleigh had signed up for their newsletter, the Oath Keepers had a well-established reputation as a fringe group with violent tendencies, and they had been the subject of countless media stories.
As a voter, I’d want to know if one of my elected officials was signing up to receive communications from extremist groups, for “market research” or any other purposes. Especially in the post-January 6 era.
We ran the story, and Raleigh lost his seat two months later (although that was due more to the effects of the state’s recent redistricting than anything else).
Senate ethics inquiries launched: 1
I’m delighted with my reporting on Senate President Bobby Joe Champion’s ethically questionable ties to the Rev. Jerry McAfee for two reasons. The first, and most journalistically obvious reason, is that it shined a light on Minnesota’s extremely lax conflict-of-interest laws, and it got a number of lawmakers to acknowledge that they should maybe try to avoid funneling boatloads of grant money to individuals they have professional relationships with outside of the Legislature.
It also sparked a Senate ethics inquiry into Champion’s actions, which went nowhere given the even balance of power in that body.
But the other reason I love this story is how I stumbled across it in the first place: by wasting time on social media. I was hanging out one morning on Twitter (I will never call it “X”), avoiding whatever story I was supposed to be working on, when I saw some Minneapolis folks making offhand comments about Champion being McAfee’s lawyer. It was a jarring moment, as these people were casually discussing the fact as if it were common knowledge, despite it not having been reported anywhere.
A quick visit to Minnesota’s court records system confirmed what they were saying, and we were off to the races from there.
There are two reporting lessons here, I think. The first is that what passes for common knowledge in some communities will come as a shocking revelation to others. 
The second: Never log off.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-1071732044-1024x699.jpg,,,2025-06-02 07:11:18.948199

It was a day of productive conversations about transportation, curriculum, funding, taxes, extracurriculars, school lunches, and so much more. 
That was until I knocked on what was probably the twentieth door of the day. The man who opened it immediately saw I was holding a pamphlet, and simply asked, “Which party?” I was frozen for a split second, before gathering my wits and explaining. “Actually, this is for a school board race! The candidates are nonpartisan.” I saw a look of disappointment flash across his face. But the conversation that continued from there was just as rich as the ones I’d had before. By the end of our chat, I think we both learned something about the role of schools in our community. 
Sadly, conversations like these are rare in Indiana, because we are one of only seven states that still allows straight ticket voting. Straight ticket voting was once widespread nationwide, but most states have abolished it since the 1960s. While Indiana limited its use in 2016, it persists for most major votes. It’s a practice that rewards partisan ignorance — you don’t even have to look at candidate names. Check a box, R or D, and almost all votes are marked. 
I say almost because some candidates, such as judges and school board members, are left out of a straight ticket vote. As a teacher, I’m grateful. And I’m relieved that this exclusion was maintained in the final version of Senate Enrolled Act 287, which put Indiana in a club of just nine other states requiring school board candidates to declare a political party. 
But I found it telling to hear how the bill’s author, Sen. Gary Byrne, justified adding parties into school board elections: “People don’t know who they’re voting for…Knowing which political party a candidate identifies with will help Hoosiers know what kind of principles that person would apply to their position.”

Of course, this assumes that there are only two ways to govern – Republican or Democrat. In education, as in any other sector, nothing could be further from the truth. The partisan binary in a straight ticket simplifies a much more complicated discourse, enabling people to be uninformed when they vote. 
If everything comes down to party, we may as well allow artificial intelligence to determine election results based on population characteristics and party affiliation. But that’s not how democracy is supposed to work. Democracy requires an open debate that transcends parties. It requires voters to weigh heavily the responsibility of their choice.
Advocates of straight ticket voting claim it’s popular, but if that were true, Indiana wouldn’t have one of the most abysmal voter turnout rates in the nation. In fact, the partisan heuristic is just as likely to turn off voters. Both of our major political parties are deeply unpopular, with solid majorities viewing both unfavorably. About half of Americans don’t even identify with a political party, and those rates continue to decline. The data is clear: straight ticket voting is about tribal self-preservation, not voter education.
That’s how we often find ourselves stuck with problematic, mean, and ethically questionable candidates sliding into positions of power, especially down the ballot. There’s too few options on the table. By emphasizing partisan affiliation over all else, proponents of straight-ticket voting assume that voters are too busy or uninformed to understand real issues. That’s a dismissive way to understand the electorate. 
So as voters, how do we push back? It’s simple: just refrain from voting a straight ticket. We should feel uneasy if we put someone into power without knowing what they are capable of. Get to know the full ballot ahead of time — your coroner, your auditor, your treasurer. Ensure that you walk into the voting room and recognize every name. Google them. Email them. Call them. Ask questions early. When election day comes, you can confidently cast each vote, with no abstentions, knowing exactly how they’ll use the power you’re giving them
It takes time. But when we stop using the straight ticket, maybe Indiana will send it to the dustbin where it belongs.

(Photo: Greg Childress)North Carolina housing advocates are sounding the alarm over proposed cuts to the Workforce Housing Loan Program (WHLP) administered by the N.C. Housing Finance Agency (NCHFA) in combination with federal Low-Income Housing Tax Credits.
The state Senate’s version of the FY 25-27 budget does not include funding for WHLP. The House version allocates $5 million for one year of the two-year biennium. Gov. Josh Stein’s spending plan calls for $30 million in non-recurring funding for the WHLP.  The previous budget included $35 million in non-recurring program funding.

The WHLP was created to help “construct or substantially rehabilitate” multi-family affordable housing units. The money is used in combination with federal low-income housing tax credits to provide gap funding to make affordable housing development financially feasible in difficult-to-serve markets. The WHLP has financed thousands of apartments for seniors, families and members of the state’s workforce across 59 counties since it was created 10 years ago.
The proposed program cuts come as the need for affordable housing grows across the state, members of the N.C. Housing Coalition said last week.
“Without the WHLP, many developments would not be possible, especially in rural areas,” a coalition spokesperson said during its weekly housing call. “As construction and development costs continue to rise, cuts to this program could shutter much needed investments into the construction and preservation of affordable homes across the state.”
The coalition is urging housing advocates and others across the state to contact members of the House Appropriations Committee and urge them to protect and restore the WHLP to $35 million.
“This is an existing program that works, and we already know it works, and it does a really wonderful job of leveraging public funds with private dollars,” said Stephanie Watkins-Cruz, the coalition’s director of housing policy. “If there’s ever a time to not cut housing investments, this is the time.”
Watkins-Cruz noted that the program is structured so that Tier 1 counties are eligible for up to $3 million in funding. Tier 1 counties are the most economically distressed among the state’s three tiers.
Several counties in the 2025 Qualified Allocation Plan are in eastern North Carolina. Several are also on the list of disaster-impacted counties from Hurricane Helene in Western North Carolina. They include Alexander, Graham, McDowell, Mitchell, Rutherford, and Wilkes counties.

(Photo by Andrew Roth/Michigan Advance)MACKINAC ISLAND – After a long Memorial Day weekend, politicians, business professionals, lobbyists and public service workers traveled to Mackinac Island for the Detroit Regional Chamber of Commerce’s annual Mackinac Policy Conference, with political division intersecting at almost all points with policy goals throughout the three day event.
The conference typically features a host of panel discussions centered on economic development, education, housing, and politics at a state, national and international scale, and this year was no different as panelists pointed to concerns with Michigan’s lagging approach to education, outlined the impact  of uncertainty on tariff policies and federal funding and pointed to opportunities to build up the state’s efforts in the manufacturing and technology sector. 
While some lawmakers came together for civil discussions in line with the conference’s motif of civility and bipartisanship, political divides served as a backdrop throughout the conference, as the split Michigan Legislature remained concerned about the state budget and Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan took pot shots at politicians over partisan bickering.
Although members of Michigan’s Congressional Delegation touted their ability to work together on issues affecting Michigan – like getting a new mission for Selfridge Air Force Base or protecting the Great Lakes from invasive species – the relationship among state legislative leaders was a bit more frosty.
During an annual reception ostensibly highlighting civility, Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks, House Speaker Matt Hall, Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt and House Minority Leader Ranjeev Puri spent a tense hour that served as the four leaders’ first meeting as a group debating the merits of each party’s strategy to negotiating legislation.

The back-and-forth between legislative leaders was just one example of what Duggan, who is running for governor as an independent, criticized as a broken system.
Another example: The Democratic Governors Association began running a digital ad attacking Duggan, who was a member of their party until last year, claiming he has a “long, corruption-riddled history,” just one day after Duggan spoke about the Democratic and Republican parties relying on attack ads to win their elections.
Duggan told the Michigan Advance that Democrats “are nothing if not predictable” after the ad campaign was announced.
“They hate Republicans in general, and they hate Donald Trump in particular,” Duggan said. “But today, I’ve gotten them to broaden their platform; now they hate me, too.”
“Once again, after facing the tiniest bit of scrutiny, Mike Duggan resorted to another temper tantrum by immediately lying and comparing himself to Donald Trump,” DGA Spokesperson Sam Newton said in a statement after the Michigan Advance published Duggan’s response to the ad. “Well, he’s right about one thing: both Duggan and Trump are corrupt and wrong for Michigan.”
Although some panels confronted Trump’s blunt-edged approach to diplomacy, federal funding and tariffs head on, U.S. Ambassador to Canada and former Michigan Republican Party Chair Pete Hoekstra offered an optimistic vision for the two countries’ relationship, saying they could become a global powerhouse on energy and manufacturing if they’re able to mend fences that have been stressed since Trump took office in January, proposing to implement punishing tariffs and speculating about making the sovereign nation a 51st state.

Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel criticized the business-as-usual approach she felt attendees were taking in their usual networking and lobbying efforts as the President works to expand his power and reshape the federal government. 
“I look around the Grand Hotel and, you know, the Mackinac policy conference, and there’s this sense that everything is normal and that everything is the same as it’s ever been, and people are negotiating with each other for different sorts of policies they want to see implemented. And yet, I don’t think they understand that anything can be undercut by the federal administration at any time,” Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel told the Michigan Advance on Wednesday. 
Nessel has helped file 17 different cases against the Trump Administration, challenging several policy changes including Trump’s executive order excluding certain newborns from birthright citizenship.

While several candidates for governor and U.S. Senate were present at the conference — with Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, the early favorite for Democrats, making it a stop on her book tour — none got quite as much attention as Duggan, who was shown to be pulling equal amounts of support from Democrats and Republicans in a poll released last Tuesday. 
Duggan delivered a keynote address Wednesday and participated in a conversation with Rocket Mortgage founder and philanthropist Dan Gilbert on Thursday.
Speaking on another panel Thursday afternoon, April Ryan, White House Correspondent for The Grio, underscored Duggan’s arguments about partisan politics, telling Fox 2 Detroit Anchor Roop Raj Duggan’s polling shows “the system is broken.”
“Certain groups felt, that are now in power — now I’m going to say it — They felt like they weren’t heard. And the problem is we have to find a way to get everyone under the umbrella. If you get this person, I’m not going to be heard. If you get that person, I’m not — it’s such a polar opposite, and the system is broken,” Ryan said. “We’ve got to find a way to fix it. That’s why independents are on the rise, and people are listening, because people don’t feel heard. People want to feel seen.”

However, Michigan Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist, who launched a Democratic bid for governor in March, took the helm for several announcements, including more than $107 million to support infrastructure workforce development, $769,000 in grants to support programs aimed at reversing population decline in the state, and a $3.5 billion commitment from the state’s largest energy companies — DTE Energy and Consumers Energy — to purchase technology, equipment and services from Michigan-based businesses in support of the state’s energy manufacturing sector. 
Notably absent from the conference: U.S. Rep. John James (R-Shelby Twp.), who declared his candidacy for governor in April. Polling points to James as the early favorite among Republicans, compared to former Attorney General Mike Cox and Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt, who are also pursuing the Republican nomination.

(Photo by Michael Moline/Florida Phoenix)While the Florida Legislature exhibits nowhere near the level of bile-spitting, brainless dysfunction you get in Washington, they haven’t exactly been a model of a sleek, responsive government machine.
For weeks, there was no budget. No hint of a budget.
Instead of getting done the one thing the Constitution says they have to get done, they’ve been indulging in that sure-fire negotiating tactic: insulting each other.
Then Friday: a trickle of white smoke emanating from the Capitol.
Habemus budget!
A budget framework, anyway.
It’s a bit short on details, other than “permanent sales tax exemptions targeted toward Florida families,” elimination of sales tax on commercial leases, and a boost to the state’s rainy-day fund.
Money for education, health care, environmental restoration, culture, roads — little stuff like that — has yet to be spelled out. Seems House and Senate leaders will be meeting this week to thrash out details and plan, they claim, to hold a vote by June 16.
Things remain contentious, and that’s not counting the wild card in the process: our congenitally angry governor.
He can veto appropriations he doesn’t like or, knowing him, appropriations he thinks his legislative enemies particularly care about.
The state budget is not yet a done deal. If it’s not passed by June 30, we could even have a government shutdown.
Thought experiment: Would you notice?
Bears might: Shuttered FWC offices could slow down final approval for bear hunting, passed by this year after passionate lobbying from the Davy Crockett Caucus.
State workers might: Their paychecks would be suspended.
Holders of state contracts might: They’ll be in limbo.
Anyone wanting to visit a state park might: The gates will be locked.
Hated Canadians
Still, most Floridians probably wouldn’t realize their government isn’t working.
It often doesn’t. Work, that is.
Instead of addressing our numerous problems, from unaffordable housing to unaffordable insurance to inflation to flooding, elected officials prefer to spend much of their time worrying about pronouns, boasting about helping Trump’s storm troopers arrest brown folks, or trying to rename the Gulf of Mexico.










Floridians don’t expect much. And not much is what we’ll get.


Floridians don’t expect much.
And not much is what we’ll get.
The Senate wanted sales tax “holidays” for clothes, tools, hurricane preparedness, and “Second Amendment Summer items,” i.e. cross bows, firearms, ammo.
The House wanted to slash state sales taxes from six percent to 5.25%.
Who knows which, and in what form, these proposals will survive the process.
The governor hates all of it. He’s been stomping around the state throwing tantrums about how lower sales taxes only help tourists and “foreigners,” railing, “I don’t want to give Canadians a tax cut.”
He might not have to worry about tax relief for those sinister Canadians much longer: They’re selling their Florida condos and taking vacations in Mexico and Portugal instead.
DeSantis’ plan? Give every homeowner a $1,000 rebate.
Then work up to abolishing property taxes altogether.
Awesome! Lower taxes! Maybe no taxes! We hate taxes, right?
Problem is, most of us love schools, sidewalks, roads, garbage pick-up, parks, police departments, fire departments, municipal pools, good drinking water, bike paths, animal shelters, electricity, and emergency medical services.
Florida cities and counties depend on taxes to fund these. The House and Senate plan will reduce the state budget by $2.25 billion.
That’s likely to hurt everybody.
‘Streamline’ destruction
No surprise. A number of measures passed this session are not exactly citizen-friendly.
One example: Given our increasingly strong hurricanes and the floods they bring, the state should encourage people to rebuild more resilient structures.
But no: A bill approved this session will block attempts to strengthen construction after storms.
The idea is to “streamline” the process (translation: Help developers who can sue if a local government institutes “burdensome or restrictive” rules) so you can build your house or your business or your school back under the same outdated codes that failed to protect it last time.
The bill also raises the price of flood insurance.
Nice, huh?
Another example: In a fit of good taste, the Senate refused to confirm some of DeSantis’ more appalling University of West Florida board nominees, including yahoos who think the GI Bill was a bad idea or that women don’t belong in higher education.
Good for them. But legislators had a chance to do even more for higher education by putting college president searches back in the sunshine where they belong.
Bills stopping the governor installing his hand-picked faith followers sailed through various committees, but in the end they were withdrawn.
Fear of a gubernatorial melt-down? Line-item vetoes of pet projects?
Presidents will still be chosen in secret subject to the whims of the governor and his tame boards of trustees.
To be fair, the Legislature did decide to forbid oil and gas drilling within 10 miles of the Apalachicola Estuarine Reserve, and passed a bill to shield state parks from the kind of boneheaded nonsense the governor wanted in 2024: You know, “improving” the parks with golf courses, pickleball courts, and luxury hotels.
Why can’t we have nice things?
DeSantis actually realized (for once) he’d screwed up big time last year and signed the bill.
This year, he demonstrated he hadn’t quite learned his lesson.
A secretive outfit calling itself Upland LLC wanted the state to give it 600 acres of preservation lands on the Guana River in St. Johns County in exchange for 3,000 acres of non-contiguous, less environmentally significant property scattered around four counties.
Apparently, that swap sounded good to DeSantis. The state Acquisition and Restoration Council served up a report claiming there was nothing special about the Guana River land, no historic sites, no amazing habitat, nothing like that — never mind the ancient Native American shell middens, wood storks, roseate spoonbills, and old oak hammocks — and rushed the required public comment meeting.
Genuine Floridians (the ones their government ignores) rose up on their hind legs and said hell, no. Loudly.
Upland, its feelings hurt, pulled out of the deal — no thanks to DeSantis and his Department of Environmental Prostitution.
Why, you ask, is this state so self-defeating?
Or, to put it another way, why can’t we have nice things?
Florida has one of the most regressive taxation systems in the country, what the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy calls an “upside down” model. The rich pay a far smaller percentage of their income than the middle classes and the poor.
If the state decides to deprive itself — us — of tax dollars, we will all suffer.
Florida’s social safety net is already tattered.
Twenty percent of children live in poverty. The state ranks 40th in child health and 45th in economic well-being.
Children don’t vote
You’d think lawmakers would figure out helping to feed, educate, and take care of children is worth the money: Healthy, educated people contribute to the economy.
But children don’t vote. Or write big fat campaign checks.
It’s bad enough our so-called representatives can’t do their jobs in a timely manner and must keep coming back for special sessions to decide which taxes to cut and by how much while simultaneously costing the taxpayer around $50,000 every day they hang around in Tallahassee.
The governor, the most mobility impaired of waterfowl, his political career in the dumpster, his wife’s charity under investigation for possible money laundering, still wants to abolish property taxes.
Maybe he thinks that will give him a nice slogan to run for president on if we have an election in 2028.
The Legislature wants to curry favor with their voters by giving them a break on stuff they buy.
Everybody loves a bargain, right?
But it’s not much of a bargain if your quality of life goes to hell.
Cities and counties are staring into the abyss, wondering how they’ll fund everything citizens expect.
School roofs won’t be repaired, parks won’t be maintained, bad water pipes won’t be fixed, new cops won’t be hired, EMS will be cut, potholes will proliferate.
But hey, it’s a small price to pay for a sales tax break on batteries and backpacks, right?",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FLCapitolIMG_0045-1536x1152-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-02 07:11:18.948199

Mike Kehoe, policy analysts, lobbyists, activists and the many special interests who stand to gain from the deal.
They should also hear from the two individuals who stand to benefit most: Royals owner John Sherman and Chiefs owner Clark Hunt. These men should appear before the Missouri House and Senate to explain why taxpayer subsidies of this scale are justified. Anything less short-circuits public accountability.
During a March 2024 debate ahead of the Jackson County vote on funding a new downtown stadium, I was asked if I’d ever met Sherman. I hadn’t, though KCPBS invited Sherman to participate. His office declined every offered date.
On April 2, Jackson County voters rejected the stadium-tax extension by a decisive 58% to 42%. Their position was clear: no blank checks, no vague promises. If legislators now move forward with a $300 million bond package without in-person testimony from the owners, they risk replicating the same lack of transparency voters already rejected.
The current proposal would authorize hundreds of millions in public bonds, yet these franchises are far from lacking resources. Forbes values the Chiefs at $4.85 billion and the Royals at $1.3 billion. When billion-dollar teams request public subsidies, their owners should answer for the proposal, in person.
Key facts remain unknown: where the Royals would build, what share of costs the teams would cover, and how much the Royals would spend on the stadium itself versus adjacent commercial ventures. As in Jackson County, taxpayers are being asked to commit before the teams do. That sequence—public commitment before private investment — betrays the principles of responsible budgeting.
Until these facts are disclosed on the record, the proposal’s benefits remain impossible to assess.
Kehoe has cited the teams’ economic impact to justify the session. his justification is a familiar one — and often misleading. A 2017 report from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis brief warned that many stadium impact studies “fail to include opportunity costs,” noting that spending inside an arena often displaces spending elsewhere in the local economy.
Bipartisan resistance building against Missouri governor’s stadium funding plan

That displaced spending often supports a wider variety of small businesses and contributes more reliably to public revenue through sales, property, and income taxes. By contrast, revenue from stadium-centric development tends to concentrate in the hands of franchise owners.
Kehoe also cited claims from the Royals projecting 8,400 jobs, $400 million in annual labor income, and $1.2 billion in economic output. These numbers were distributed to lawmakers just before the regular session ended. They lack independent review and should be treated accordingly.
These Missouri figures also echo broader trends. Independent research shows stadium subsidies rarely yield significant economic gains. In Nevada, legislators approved $750 million in public funds for the Raiders in 2016. Clark County now estimates total public costs ballooned to $1.35 billion—nearly double the original allocation. In New York, the new Bills stadium is projected to cost taxpayers more than $1.1 billion. Missouri lawmakers should hear why this case will be different.
A 2023 study published by the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management explains why so many of these projections fall short. The authors—John Bradbury, Dennis Coates and Brad Humphreys—found that reports sponsored by teams or developers often use inflated multipliers, unrealistic assumptions, and conflate gross and net impacts.
Missouri senators should examine how the Royals’ numbers were generated—and how they remain so precise without a confirmed stadium site.
There is clear precedent for having owners testify. In 1997, Twins owner Carl Pohlad testified before a joint Minnesota House–Senate panel to press for a cigarette-tax-backed ballpark package. Vikings owner Zygi Wilf followed suit in 2006, fielding committee questions on the state-county deal that became U.S. Bank Stadium. And in 2016, Raiders owner Mark Davis appeared in Carson City to urge Nevada lawmakers to approve a $750 million hotel-tax subsidy for Allegiant Stadium—a commitment that will cost Clark County about $1.1 billion with interest over 30 years. Missouri can—and should—demand the same level of transparency and accountability.
Bradbury and colleagues put it plainly: “Professional sports venues generate limited economic and social benefits, which fall far short of the large public subsidies they typically receive.” These deals often amount to transfers of public wealth to private entities.
Redirecting even a portion of this investment to infrastructure, education, or health would likely yield more durable benefits for Missouri families.
Let’s not forget that merely considering these subsidies is a financial burden. The costs of convening a special session are real. The Jackson County election, demanded by the teams, cost local taxpayers roughly $1 million.
Before approving any subsidy, senators should secure clear, on-the-record answers:

What is the private-capital commitment, in dollars?
Who is responsible for covering overruns?
What is the expected net new revenue, after substitution effects?
What milestones—site control, zoning, environmental review—must precede bond issuance?
Are there claw-back or profit-sharing provisions if forecasts fall short?
What is the long-term plan for demolition or reuse once the stadium reaches end-of-life?

It is not unreasonable to expect Sherman and Hunt to explain their request for public funds in person. If the governor can meet with them behind closed doors, the House and Senate—and the public—deserve that same access, in open session.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/020925Arrowhead2-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-06-02 07:11:18.948199

Exactly how much is uncertain. The review by Jared Walczak, vice president of state projects at the conservative-leaning Tax Foundation, estimates it will be at least $170 million and could be as much as $429 million if state lawmakers pass tax cuts that mirror provisions in the legislation approved in the U.S. House.
Dylan Grundman O’Neill, senior state tax policy analyst at the left-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, said Walczak’s estimate is sound. O’Neill said he is working to estimate how much Missouri’s revenues would be reduced further from the bill’s increase in the limit on the itemized deduction for state and local taxes.
Cuts to food aid endorsed by Congressional GOP could cost Missouri $400 million

The potential reduction in state revenue caused by federal changes, coupled with the new exemption for capital gains income and expanded property tax credit for some retirees and people with disabilities passed by the Missouri legislature earlier this year, could cause the coming fiscal year to be the fourth in a row where revenue growth does not keep up with inflation.
And the prospect that those federal tax changes and state tax cuts will put the squeeze on Missouri’s budget hangs like a shadow over the legislature as it reconvenes this week to consider whether to set aside almost $1.4 billion in state taxes over the next 30 years to finance professional sports stadiums in Kansas City
“We know the state budget years ahead are going to be challenging, and the amount of general revenue that we have is something that I’m taking very seriously as a businessman, and what it’s going to take in future years,” said Missouri Gov. Mike Kehoe.
The state budget for the coming fiscal year, awaiting action by Kehoe, would spend $15.8 billion in general revenue while collections are estimated at $13.6 billion. The budget’s draw on the state’s surplus and uncertainty about future collections is why a spending bill also on the special session agenda has only $50 million more in general revenue, Kehoe said last week.
 Federal impacts

Missouri’s state income tax is linked to the federal tax system. The state tax form starts with the adjusted gross income calculated on the federal return and grants filers the same standard deduction.
The approximately 10% of taxpayers who itemize deductions are allowed to keep most of what they report to the IRS and add some deductions for Social Security and other payroll taxes.
The bill approved by the U.S. House includes a temporary $1,000 increase for the federal standard deduction, $15,000 for single filers this year. That would reduce Missouri revenue by about $124 million, Walczak said.
The new deduction for interest on motor vehicle loans would be added to the federal form in a way that reduces the adjusted gross income amount. That change is estimated to reduce state revenue by $46 million, he said.
“They’re putting that above the line there,” he said. “I don’t understand why. I don’t think anyone knows why they choose to do it this way.”
It would require action by state lawmakers to reverse the effect, Walczak said.
“A state could choose to have a modification where they add back the subtracted amount for auto loans, but they would have to choose to do that,” he said.
For most taxpayers, income derived from tips and overtime would be exempt from the income tax entirely. Like reversing the auto loan deduction, making Missouri law mirror that benefit would have to be done by the legislature, Walczak said.
The two exemptions would reduce Missouri state revenues by about $259 million.
“We put those numbers there because there are states that are saying that they want to follow the federal government and exempt tips and overtime,” he said. “So we wanted to show what it would cost if they did that.” 
The change in the $10,000 cap on the deduction for state and local taxes to $40,000 is one of the hardest pieces of the federal bill to estimate, O’Neill said. 
Federal Medicaid cuts could leave Missouri with huge budget shortfall

Before the cap was put in place by Congress in 2017, more than 30% of taxpayers itemized their deductions. When the standard deduction was doubled — and when mortgage loan rates were low — the rate of itemizers plummeted.
The deduction covers state and local income and property taxes. Missouri’s current tax forms subtract state income tax payments from the amount claimed, for those under the cap, allowing the rest.
Itemizers who claim the maximum calculate the share of the tax payments that come from income tax, and subtraction a pro-rated amount from the $10,000 limit.
For example, the owner of a home in Columbia that the assessor appraises at $1.5 million pays just under $20,000 in property taxes. If income taxes are 90% of the total state and local taxes included on that person’s federal form, the owner would retain a $1,000 deduction for their state return under current law.
With the cap increased to $40,000, the taxpayer would retain a $4,000 deduction. The net effect on state taxes would be a $141 cut for that taxpayer.
“The more the congressional bill raises that cap, the more relevant that provision becomes for states,” O’Neill said. “Missouri is one of the states that has relatively high exposure to that change because of its rolling conformity to the federal tax code.”
The Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy estimates that Missouri taxpayers would see their federal tax bills drop by $9.1 billion, with more than one-fifth of that total going to the 1% of Missouri taxpayers who have an income greater than $689,300.
Filers in that group would receive an average tax cut of $58,490. 
Taxpayers in the lowest 40% of filers would receive one-twentieth of the tax cuts under the bill.
The new costs imposed by the bill include a possible $400 million annually to maintain the food benefits program known as SNAP. Missouri would have to pick up an estimated 25% of the cost of providing the aid because Missouri’s error rate on payments was 10% in 2023, which would mean the highest cost share.
 State financial picture

Missouri will end the current fiscal year with an unobligated general revenue balance of $2.6 billion, the state budget office estimated when Kehoe’s spending proposal was released in January.
Even after spending $1 billion of the accumulated balance, it is historically large and almost $900 million more than was predicted a year earlier. Two factors played into that increase — revenues in fiscal 2024 that were almost $300 million more than anticipated and a gap between budgeted amounts and actual costs, mainly due to understaffing.
Kehoe’s January budget anticipates the surplus would fall to $1.4 billion by the end of the coming fiscal year in June 2026. 
In the coming special session, Kehoe will be under pressure to allow more money to be spent in the appropriations bill. 
“I don’t believe that it’s the government or the state’s job to accumulate a billion dollars to look at in the bank,” said state Sen. Lincoln Hough, the Springfield Republican who chairs the Senate Appropriations Committee. “I agree with a healthy reserve. I’m fine with that. But this billion and a half dollars that we have sitting in the bank while we’ve got hospitals that are closing down and child care facilities that need support… it’s the whole list of projects.”
There should be some allowance for lawmakers to add items to the bill, he said.
“I’m not naive enough to think we’re going to put together a $513 million capital improvements package and drop that,” Hough said.
The budget revenue estimate made in December anticipates a slight decline in revenue in the current year and a slight increase in the coming year. 
That estimate was made before lawmakers passed the tax cut worth about $285 million in the coming year by official estimates but forecast to be much more by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy.
Missouri House Minority Leader Ashley Aune, a Kansas City Democrat, supports the legislation to keep the Chiefs and Royals in the state. She also said there should be more for the appropriations bill.
“We need to be concerned about where we’re spending our dollars, but I also think that we have to be doing it responsibly,” Aune said.
But she is also concerned about the revenue impact of the federal budget bill and the tax cut awaiting action from Kehoe.
“We are in a position right now where we are seeing revenues dwindling,” Aune said. “With everything that has been passed recently, it has the potential to put Missouri in a much more difficult position.”

Community members and staff advocate against losing the midwife-led center they say is a pillar of the region. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Copley Hospital weighs closing its birthing center amid statewide effort to curb health care costs.","A sign in support of the Copley Birthing Center in Morrisville on Wednesday, May 28, 2025. Photo by Kristen Fountain/VTDiggerWhen rumors about closing the Copley Hospital Birthing Center started to circulate last year, Sarah Chouinard, the president of the hospital’s nurses union, and many of her colleagues thought they were just that: rumors.“There have always been cycles of this threat of closure,” she said. “But we’ve been protected because of community public relations and the service we provide for the community.” Then, one of the hospital’s four midwives scaled back her hours to work on an as-needed basis. The hospital initially made no plan to hire a replacement, then posted the job, found a good candidate but never made the hire. The other three midwives grew suspicious. Chouinard also began emailing Copley President Joe Woodin, similarly seeking clarity: Were these just more rumors swirling around the birthing center? Would her nurses need to worry about being reassigned? She said she got no response.“The more that was not said, the more we knew what was happening,” Chouinard said. In March 2025, the Morristown hospital announced it was launching a comprehensive review of the birthing center to explore closing or expanding its operations. Those were the options suggested by a landmark report published by a state-hired consulting firm last year that outlined radical changes needed to make the health care system in Vermont more accessible and affordable. Hospital leadership said it does not plan to make a decision until a consultant hired to do the review submits its recommendations, which are expected in mid-June. The hospital’s associated Women’s Center, which hosts gynecological and obstetric care, is slated to remain open, regardless of the hospital’s decision on the birthing center, according to hospital spokesperson Barbara Walls.Still, the threat of losing such a beloved center has left the community incensed.Supporters of the birthing center quickly created an online petition, which has garnered more than 2,500 signatures. Advocates hosted a Mother’s Day rally in support of the center, peppered their yards with lawn signs, and wrote countless letters to the hospital and public in hopes of underscoring just how great a loss the closure of the Copley Hospital Birthing Center would be for Lamoille County. The public outcry reached such a boiling point that Copley decided to postpone its annual Stowe Art Wine & Food Fundraiser over concerns about a planned protest at the event.READ MORE
The midwife modelAdvocates argue the closure of the birthing center would not only leave the community without a local place for delivery, but it would also jeopardize what patients and providers consider to be a model for midwife-driven care.When a pregnant patient comes to the center, a midwife leads their prenatal visits and development of the birthing plan. The clinic’s two OB-GYNs are part of that broader care team but only become hands-on with a patient’s care if there is a need — like gestational diabetes or hemorrhaging in birth, Kopas said. “It’s a different approach that puts the pregnant person at the center of decision making,” said Mary Lou Kopas, one of Copley’s three full-time nurse midwives. “(The model) looks at pregnancy and birth and breastfeeding as normal physiologic processes and not medical emergencies waiting to happen.”She said the approach also centers “shared decision making,” where the provider takes time to listen to the patient’s specific needs, lifestyle and circumstances in forming a birthing plan. “It’s not a one size fits all,” she said.Patients believe that this approach is what’s made their experiences so positive.“It’s such a special place. It’s the only time that I’ve had an interaction with the medical system where I left that interaction feeling like I was treated with dignity and respect,” said Eva Zaret, a public health specialist who had both her children — a 3-year-old and a 9-month-old — at Copley.Zaret said she had a history of managing an eating disorder and had intense anxiety about gaining weight during pregnancy.When Zaret began explaining her worries, the midwife walked her through the possible alternatives, and “then the midwife just put down everything,” Zaret said. “And she just looked at me, and said, ‘What do you need?’” Zaret told her she didn’t want to be weighed at her appointments, to which the midwife simply said “OK.” That was it. The birthing center also scores highly on one important marker of high-quality birthing care: Copley often cites that it has one of the lowest rates of C-section births in the state. At Copley 1 in about every 10 births is a C-section delivery, Kopas said, while nationally, that rate is closer to 1 in every 3. Part of that low rate, however, may be due to the fact that Copley is only able to accept low-risk pregnancies. Midwifery care has been associated with fewer preterm births, reduced labor interventions, and lower maternal and infant death and illness, as various control trials and observational studies have shown. “I think that Copley should be held up as a model — beyond just ‘you should have (this) many midwives on for this many hours.’ People should go shadow and see ‘how do I talk to a patient? What does it really mean to be trauma informed? Or, what does it really mean to be patient centered?’” Zaret said.Paying for pregnancy When the consulting firm Oliver Wyman issued its report in September 2024, outlining ways to improve Vermont’s health care system, it recommended developing more regional “centers of excellence” for specialized care. For Copley, the report suggested scaling up to become a regional center of excellence for orthopedics. The report did not identify Copley as one of the four hospitals where major restructuring would be needed to stay afloat. The report, and thus Copley’s review, is part of a bigger push to scale back ballooning healthcare costs in the state.“Our health system is experiencing an intense cost crisis, and also an access crisis,” said Brendan Krause, the director of health care reform at the state’s Agency of Human Services. “We’re seeing the cost crisis not just in hospitals, but also with our state regulated insurance market — which doesn’t just mean more, higher premiums for individuals and businesses. It also means it is more expensive to create jobs; property taxes go up.” “I would say this (review) is very much aligned with what a state has asked them to do. And, I would trust the hospital and the board to review the data and listen to their community and make the decision, according to the best information they have,” Krause added. Delivery nurses and midwives expressed frustration that there was little communication with their department about how to make the center more profitable. In late May, the board met with some of the midwives and providers to collect their input on how to close or expand, something providers had long been asking for. They and other stakeholder groups have been given an hour of time to share these ideas, observations and questions with the consultant.Copley says the birthing center operates at a loss of $3 million to $5 million annually. Because commercial insurance rate increases are approved annually by the Green Mountain Care Board, a statewide health care regulator, Copley has been limited in what it can charge and how quickly it can increase those charges. As a result, currently, the hospital bills private insurers around $7,000 for a low-intervention, vaginal birth, while other large hospitals charge more than twice that number.“Our costs are fixed. We do not have the ability to change those costs,” said Barbara Walls, the hospital’s spokesperson. When the Green Mountain Care Board set commercial insurance price increase rates in September, Copley pushed for an 11.8% increase in costs, Walls said. The board trimmed that request significantly to 3.4%, a rate increase that all hospitals were required to stay at or below. The board allowed Copley a total of 15% increase in commercial rates the previous fiscal year — 8% in September 2023 and an emergency additional 7% in April 2024.Kopas and her colleagues see room for the program to draw in more money without raising costs: “I do think there is capacity to grow this program — could easily do 10% more births without increasing staffing,” Kopas added. One way of doing that, she and others suggested, would be to put a satellite prenatal clinic in Waterbury, where the hospital has recently expanded its orthopedic services. It would allow them to catch a larger array of patients right off Route 89, Kopas said.Still, Walls said that an expansion and upgrade to the birthing facilities may not directly correlate with an increase in patients and revenue. Walls said 42% of the births in Lamoille County occur at the hospital.“That’s 58% (of births) that are not happening at Copley,” she said. Part of that may be due to the fact that Copley can only accept low-risk pregnancies. Anyone who might need a Newborn Intensive Care Unit gets referred elsewhere, usually, to University of Vermont Medical Center in Burlington.The hospital often cites low birth rates, which the Wyman report highlighted, as a reason to close the facility. The report identified a low volume of deliveries as a reason for the hospital either to “grow or shift birthing to other organizations.”The report set a threshold of 240 births a year, as sufficient to offset the costs of running birthing operations. Copley has been well under that number since 2010, with birthing center deliveries landing between 160 to 200 a year. Since 2018, those levels have plateaued around 160 births a year. North Country Hospital in Newport and Northeastern Vermont Regional Hospital in St. Johnsbury, both of which draw from regions that overlap with Copley’s service area, also had birth volumes beneath the Wyman report threshold. Kopas interpreted the data differently, saying birth rates have remained steady and that this year’s due-dates are on track to keep the hospital in the same ballpark. Plus, Lamoille County is growing, she said.Walls questioned whether that growth would make a difference.“Yes, Lamoille County is growing, but is it growing with people who are planning on having additional children?” she said. “And would they be planning on having those children here?”When Kim Horne and her husband were looking to buy a house in Morrisville in early 2020, their real estate agent highlighted the house’s proximity to Copley and its birthing center. “Like a lot of our friends who have also recently moved to the area, we were looking to start a family,” she said. In January 2024, she had her first child at Copley and is planning on giving birth to her second child there next month. Community care Many stress the importance of the fact that Copley is a community hospital as one of its great selling points — both because of the proximity it gives patients and the staff’s connection to the county. “It’s a community, and there’s even a family feel to it,” Chouinard said. “You realize you start taking care of generations of people – of babies’ babies.” Chouinard grew up in North Wolcott, went to Stowe High School and then the University of Vermont. She started her career at Copley before becoming a travel nurse, and in 2011 she returned to Copley and has stayed there ever since. “I was so excited to really take my skills and experience and do something here at home,” she said.To patients, that community investment shows. “I think you could take any OB unit at a hospital, and you could staff it up with a 24/7 midwifery model, and you wouldn’t get what Copley has,” Zaret said. “They have worked very intentionally for a long time to create a culture there that really values their patients.” Moreover, many worry about what the absence of a local place to give birth will mean for patients. “That’s going to be a mess,” Chouinard said. “Ambulances don’t want to deliver babies, ERs don’t want to deliver babies. There are a lot of ‘what-ifs’ (to risks associated with birth) but we’re supposed to be here for the ‘what ifs.’”Others worry that closing the birthing center would decrease prenatal visits — though Walls stressed that its Women’s Center will remain unaffected. Patients will still be able to access their pre and post natal care at Copley. Horne, who is eight months pregnant with her second child, worries about what any additional travel might mean for patients before they give birth. Her first baby was head down, but flipped, before she went into labor. “It was excruciating,” she said. “I couldn’t put any pressure on my pelvis or my lower back whatsoever. I couldn’t walk, I couldn’t sit, and when a contraction would happen, and I was seated in the car, even just for the tiniest commute, I was like lifting myself up in my seat,” she said, adding that having to make a longer drive “would have been dire.”But to her, a community hospital represents more than just drivetimes. It’s about the investment a hospital has in its patients’ care, beyond profits.“I’m not trying to be harsh or anything, but (if you close your birthing center), you can’t really call yourself a community hospital anymore because that’s such a vital pillar of a community,” she said. Walls said that the hospital knows that and is taking this to heart. “We understand that this is very emotional. It’s a deeply human process of birthing and creating new families, and we understand and respect that,” she said. “That being said, the temperature has gone up higher and higher, the more we have been forthcoming and transparent and acting from a place of integrity, the more we have received suspicion.”For now, the hospital and its community members are in a holding pattern until the consultant’s report returns with recommended paths of action. Still, Kopas sees the low monetary value placed on midwifery care and birthing in general as part of a deeper systemic issue. “Why is care that is essential to people with a womb an expendable portion of care?” she asked. “I mean, this is primary care for women and other childbearing people. This is essential care. So why is it expendable? That just angers me. I see it in a bigger picture of misogyny in our culture. Why is this care not reimbursed at the value?” Read the story on VTDigger here:  Copley Hospital weighs closing its birthing center amid statewide effort to curb health care costs.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Copley-Birthing-Center-Morrisville-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-02 07:11:18.948199

U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Ann Arbor) thanked Gov. Gretchen Whitmer for being willing to meet and negotiate with President Donald Trump.
“The governor is trying to do what’s right for Michigan,” Dingell said. “She went in there and got a mission for Selfridge Air Force Base, which we, quite frankly, fought for for four years.”
“And thank you, Donald Trump, for delivering a mission to Macomb County, we need that,” Dingell added.

U.S. Rep. Bill Huizenga (R-Zeeland) joked that “we’re going to cut and snip that one.”
Huizenga similarly praised Whitmer as leading the fight for the Brandon Road Lock and Dam to protect the Great Lakes from invasive species.
He said the Great Lakes are an example of an issue where almost everyone in the Midwest can agree and work together, noting that Dingell is a Democratic co-chair of the Great Lakes Task Force, along with Ohio U.S. Rep. Marcy Kaptur, also a Democrat.
“My joke is with Marcy Kaptur, she and I would struggle to agree that today is Thursday in most instances, but we are lockstep when it comes to Great Lakes funding,” Huizenga said.

Huizenga said he and Dingell have co-signed several letters related to the Great Lakes, including one to the Office of Management and Budget requesting full funding for related projects.
U.S. Rep. Kristen McDonald Rivet (D-Bay City) disagreed with an assertion that the Democratic base is frustrated with elected Democrats working with Republicans.
“Even in this climate, in Congress, there are many bills that we see Democratic and Republican votes on, and I don’t feel ostracized by my party in doing that,” McDonald Rivet said. “I work for the people of the Eighth District, and I actually think working in a bipartisan way is what helped me overperform in almost every single precinct of the district.”

But Huizenga said he does get criticized by other Republicans for working with Democrats.
“I’ve had people say, ‘Hey, you shouldn’t even be talking to those people,’” Huizenga said. “And my reply to them is, well, if we’re not talking, how are we supposed to figure out whether we agree on 5%, 15% or 50%?”
“You might not be able to picture yourself interfacing with these folks, but guess what? That’s my job. I have to,” Huizenga added.

The proposed contract between UF and Ono includes a $1.5 million base salary for serving as president, $500,000 for serving as UF Health chair, more than $400,000 in annual performance bonuses, and another half-a-million in retirement contributions and retention payments.
Despite unanimous approval by UF trustees, Ono’s presidency is being protested by some Republicans, while Gov. Ron DeSantis says he is leaving it up to the board he appointed to make the right decision.
Tuesday, the 17-member Board of Governors will vote on Ono, who received unanimous approval from UF trustees last week. He is the sole finalist for the position.
“I appointed all those folks, so they’ll make the judgement,” DeSantis said of the Board of Governors’ final vote.
Former Gov. Rick Scott, U.S. Rep. Greg Steube, and U.S. Rep. and GOP gubernatorial candidate Byron Donalds have publicly questioned Ono’s candidacy, as has Donald Trump Jr., who took to X to express his feelings on the candidate.
“WTF! Have the decision makers at @UF lost their minds!??? This woke psycho might be a perfect fit for a Communist school in California, but how is he even being considered for this role in Florida?” Trump Jr. posted Wednesday. “Every single member of the Florida Board of Governors should vote against him!!!”
Ono supported diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives in his previous job as president of the University of Michigan, guiding its “DEI 2.0” initiative and touting benefits of such programs but ultimately closed DEI offices earlier this year. Some Republicans question the legitimacy of Ono’s new-found anti-DEI convictions.
“Now people have pointed out a lot of statements that he has made that are not exactly what we’re looking for in a state where woke goes to die and I cringe at some of these statements,” DeSantis said Thursday, during a news conference in Fort Myers about medical negligence.
“But basically, I think the folks that were involved in the search, after having interviewed him, spent time with him, it’s their judgement that he’s really kind of reached the limit on the campus leftism and he would want to leave Michigan where that’s prevalent to Florida where it’s frowned upon,” DeSantis said.
Ono told trustees that he developed his new stance on DEI in the last year and a half after talking with students and other members of the university community. Before, he wasn’t an expert on the topic, which had been universal in higher education, he said.
Florida Republicans and President Donald Trump’s administration have focused heavily on removing diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives from higher education, including banning state expenditures on such initiatives.
“He will lose his job” if he promotes “a fountain of activism or leftist indoctrination,” DeSantis said.

(Pat Sutphin for the Idaho Capital Sun)Idaho health officials say it’ll take years to switch all Idaho Medicaid benefits to being managed by private companies.
Through a sweeping bill meant to cut Medicaid costs, the Idaho Legislature this year directed the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare to change a range of Medicaid policies — including to pursue switching Medicaid benefits to being run by private companies.
That model, called managed care, is used widely across the country. 
Right now, Idaho Medicaid already uses managed care  — somewhat. But it’s more of a patchwork approach, where some services are managed by the state health department, some by managed care organizations, and some by doctors’ offices. 
Shifting Idaho Medicaid to managed care will take time to do well, Idaho Medicaid Deputy Director Juliet Charron told a panel of state lawmakers late last month.
  Idaho Medicaid administrator Juliet Charron testified before the Senate Health and Welfare Committee on House Bill 345 on March 10, 2025, at the Idaho Capitol Building in Boise. (Pat Sutphin for the Idaho Capital Sun)
The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare expects the new comprehensive Idaho Medicaid managed care contract to start in 2029, following years of prep work, she told the Idaho Legislature’s Medicaid Review Panel on May 22.
“We have been evaluating all of the different scenarios and timelines under which we could implement this — looking at it as early as 2027 or 2028 — and have determined” that going much earlier is risky, Charron said. “Because you’re going to start to have pieces overlapping throughout this. And that will be particularly challenging for our provider communities.”
Medicaid is a largely federally funded health care assistance program that covers about 260,000 Idahoans, including low-income earners, people with disabilities, pregnant women, and some older people. Roughly 92,000 Idahoans are enrolled in Medicaid expansion, a voter-approved policy that raised the income eligibility cap.

 Medicaid work requirements could come under new law

Idaho governor signs bill to privatize management, add work requirements to Medicaid program

The new Idaho Medicaid cost cutting bill also called for Idaho to seek federal approval for Medicaid work requirements for able-bodied adults. The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare plans to apply for that by July 2026.
The federal spending and tax cut bill being considered by Congress might ease the process for Idaho to seek Medicaid work requirements. 
Instead of applying for a Medicaid waiver that could temporarily allow for work requirements, Idaho could seek a longer-lasting state plan amendment for Medicaid work requirements — if the federal bill becomes law, Charron said. (The bill would require nationwide Medicaid work requirements years later. After passing the U.S. House, it heads to the Senate, where changes are expected.)
Other states’ experiences and a federal watchdog report suggest costs for Medicaid work requirements are high, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. 
Since almost half of Idahoans on Medicaid are already working, some advocates say work requirements are effectively just expensive administrative barriers to access the program. 
 Idaho Medicaid’s management is split up. A new contract would replace existing ones. 

Overall, only 6% of Idaho Medicaid enrollees are in comprehensive managed care — the roughly 27,000 Idahoans dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid, Idaho Idaho Medicaid Deputy Administrator Sasha O’Connell told the legislative panel.

Idaho’s existing Medicaid managed care contracts mostly carve out private management for certain benefits, like mental health, medical transportation and dental.
That split makes it complicated for the state to oversee, O’Connell said. 
“What this has led to is we have particularly high turnover, I would say, in state agencies. And I think that that happens in Medicaid as well,” she said. 
The various contracts have put Idaho Medicaid’s limited staff in a cycle of “amending these contracts constantly,” she said, instead of putting the contracts up for a new competitive bid, a process called procurement.
“Because procurement is such a huge lift,” O’Connell said.
Idaho is also on track to end doctors’ offices managing Medicaid benefits next year, Charron told lawmakers. The new Idaho Medicaid cost cutting bill called for the end of that model, called value-based care, which is unique to Idaho and has existed for a few years.

The new Idaho Medicaid managed care contract is likely to become the biggest contract given out by the state of Idaho.
Idaho’s contract for the company Magellan to run mental health Medicaid benefits is already the state’s largest contract, initially pegged at $1.4 billion over four years.

Like under Idaho Medicaid’s first managed care mental health organization, Idaho Medicaid providers have reported payment delays from Magellan, the Idaho Capital Sun reported.
Sen. Kevin Cook, R-Idaho Falls, raised that issue to Idaho health officials.
“You’re saying, I’m getting reports back from the (managed care organization), and they’re saying, ‘Everything is great. All of our providers are happy. They’re loving it,’” Cook said. “‘That’s like asking the fox, … ‘How’s the hen house?’”
 Idaho’s new managed care contract slated to go to three companies

Idaho’s existing managed care contracts will be phased out for the broader contract to come.

“Idaho is a very large state. But our health care infrastructure is somewhat limited. And people access health care all over the state. Frequently, we are sending Medicaid participants to different parts of the state, based on the service that they need,” Charron said.
The new contract will task three different managed care organizations to run Idaho Medicaid benefits, for a few reasons, she explained, like: 

Federal requirements for Medicaid enrollees to have choice under managed care;
Creating competition between companies to drive efficiencies; and
Redundancy, in case a plan terminates.

Before Idaho launches the new managed care contract, Idaho has a lot of preparation to do, state health officials say. Like engaging stakeholders, seeking out more information and contracting out for actuarial services, a pharmacy benefits manager (PBM), a new enrollment broker for Medicaid enrollees to pick managed care plans, and Idaho Medicaid’s information system.

Trey Caldwell's hand on Wednesday after learning that he hadn't yet vetoed any of Caldwell's bills during session. (Photo by Janelle Stecklein/Oklahoma Voice)The curtain fell on the “Stitt Show” last week.
Because if there’s one thing that defined Oklahoma’s 2025 annual legislative session, Gov. Kevin Stitt finally played a starring role after six years in a row of lackluster performance. The Republican adroitly exercised his power to relegate even lawmakers from his own party to supporting roles in their own production.
For better or worse, pretty much every major policy passed during the 60th legislative session had his fingerprints all over it.
Income tax cuts. Creation of business courts. Four new appointees to the State Board of Education. Stopping the education department’s effort to collect information on students’ citizenship. Extending the school year by a day. Banning cellphones in schools. Largely ending virtual school days. Flat agency budgets.
Check. Check. And more checks.
These victories represent an amazing turn of events for the governor, who year after year, has seen some of his major policy priorities — like calls to cut taxes — stymied by fellow Republicans. In prior years he employed one of the few tools a governor has in the Legislature: forcing lawmakers to return to the Capitol to reconsider his top agenda items during special sessions. But his efforts were futile, and those useless special sessions wasted taxpayer dollars with little to show.
In fact, Stitt was so pleased with this session’s outcomes, he said last week he doesn’t see a reason to call a special session.
Lawmakers, meanwhile, sat mutely for days as Stitt vetoed their bills or insulted their priorities. 
As of Thursday morning – the second-to-last day of session – the governor had vetoed nearly 70 bills, the majority of which were authored by Republicans. He also let an astounding number of bills — over 300 at last count — passively take effect without his signature. When asked about his decision to not sign bills, Stitt said those are the measures that he doesn’t “think are going to move the needle.” He also said the people think it’s “super weird” that there are over 500 new laws proposed each year.
This is the same governor who vetoed measures that increase women’s access to breast cancer screening or that aim to improve Oklahomans’ access to the public records. 
But later Thursday, lawmakers suddenly emerged from their self-imposed supporting role and spent the final full day of session criticizing the governor’s decisions. 
Against Stitt’s wishes, they took the rare step of firing his commissioner of mental health after the agency’s finances fell into disarray. Allie Friesen’s removal marked one of their final actions and sent a clear sign that the honeymoon is apparently over and it might be a rocky interim.
They also overrode nearly four dozen of Stitt’s vetoes, including the breast cancer and public transparency measures.
But it was too little too late. Stitt astutely took advantage of the legislative power vacuum that existed for most of the session to flex his muscles.
Republican lawmakers seemingly wandered into session with no large-scale priorities of their own, and even the House speaker acknowledged early Friday that Stitt had emerged from session with what he wanted.
Stitt’s clear goals must have been a much needed beacon for a rudderless Republican legislative caucus led by new leadership trying to gain their footing and rein in state Superintendent Ryan Walters.
Walters, by the way, was the session’s biggest loser amid a meteoric fall from grace and the end of his storied bromance with Stitt. The two men found themselves exchanging escalating verbal jabs over the path forward for public schools. 
Stitt fired the three education board members that backed Walters, and after closed door budget negotiations, lawmakers revealed that they’d rejected most of Walters’ budget requests, including spending $3 million on Bibles. Lawmakers also dealt Walters’ citizenship collection rule the coup de grace.
But whether the 2025 “Stitt Show” will go down in infamy or herald a renaissance remains to be seen. One thing is for sure, this session will certainly be the one that defines Stitt’s legacy in years to come.
Only time will tell if he’s remembered as the ultimate champ or biggest chump.

(Photo by Lucas Dufalla, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette)CAVE CITY, Ark. — When a severe tornado tore through Cave City, Arkansas, in March, retiree Debra Lindsey was in her trailer home with her husband.
“I didn’t even know there was a tornado on the ground until the sirens went off, and then in 45 seconds it was here,” Lindsey said. “It was very scary. If it would’ve been 100 to 150 feet closer to here, it would’ve taken the front of our trailer off.”
Even without a direct hit, she estimated that the damage to their home and property was between $30,000 and $40,000. Their storage buildings were destroyed, along with their two vehicles. And the insurance company won’t cover everything.
Across the street, Robert and Kymberlie Watson rode out the tornadoes with their seven children in the nearest storm shelter. When they returned, they found roughly $60,000 worth of damage to their property.
About one month after the tornadoes, the Trump administration denied Arkansas’ request for a major disaster declaration. The declaration would have brought federal funds into the state to help with recovery. Both families thought they’d have to pay out-of-pocket for repairs.
The power to grant a disaster declaration and access to the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s assistance programs lies solely in the hands of the president, and President Donald Trump’s administration is looking to significantly scale back FEMA and pass disaster recovery costs onto states.
Lindsey, a disabled retired nurse, feared that the lack of federal assistance for their home repairs would force her back into the workforce.
Another round of severe weather walloped the Lower Mississippi River Basin in early April, causing extensive flooding and more tornado damage in parts of Arkansas, Tennessee, Kentucky and Mississippi.
Then, some good news: The Trump administration reversed course on May 13 after an appeal and a personal plea from Arkansas Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders. The president granted a major disaster declaration, allowing individuals like Lindsey and the Watsons to apply for aid.
“If we get some help out of it, that’s absolutely amazing. We could really use it,” Kymberlie Watson said. “We’re surprised, a little bit … because the government actually stepped up and helped its citizens.”
Cave City may not be so lucky. Trump has yet to approve recovery assistance to public entities, which may leave local governments — including the town of less than 2,000 residents — with big bills. On May 3, Sanders submitted another disaster declaration application asking for extensive public assistance. Requests for FEMA aid from Mississippi, Missouri and Tennessee also remain outstanding, though the Trump administration did grant Kentucky’s request.
“President Trump and his administration will continue working to further empower state and local governments to build their own resilience before disaster strikes and to execute rapid, smart response when supplemental federal assistance is required to truly protect citizens and aid a return to normalcy,” a White House official wrote the Desk by email.
 Cave City pushes forward

Cave City Mayor Jonas Anderson was at a ribbon-cutting event for the city’s ambulance service when he learned of the initial rejection from the Trump administration. His first thought?
“You have got to be kidding me,” he said.
Anderson estimated that some 50 Cave City homes were damaged in the March tornado, and 25 of those were completely destroyed. He said underinsurance was likely a huge issue in the community, and the costs for the city to remove all the debris might run over $300,000 for a municipality that only has an annual budget of around $1.4 million. Cave City also lost its only grocery store, forcing residents to drive 20 to 30 minutes to nearby towns for necessities.
A disaster declaration opens up potential programs for state and local governments to recoup some money spent on removing debris and repairing infrastructure. It can also unlock assistance programs for individuals, including post-disaster support services and financial aid for people who are uninsured or underinsured. Not all programs are offered for every disaster.
After a disaster, government personnel assess the cost of damage. Sanders’ requests for federal disaster aid for dozens of counties mostly in the Arkansas Delta estimated public damages at over $21 million from both the March and April storms, including more than $3 million in Sharp County, home to part of Cave City.
FEMA uses cost per capita to gauge whether local and state governments can handle recovery themselves, or if they’ll need federal help. Those thresholds currently stand at $4.72 per capita for counties and $1.89 per capita for states. Per capita damages for Sharp County, where Cave City is located, are estimated at $179.
But meeting those thresholds does not guarantee that the president will approve a disaster declaration. A president is not required to justify their decision, and documentation of the reasons for denial is considered privileged — not public record.
Sanders released a statement thanking the Trump administration for finally delivering individual assistance, but did not mention her second, outstanding request for public assistance and additional funds. She also expressed support for Trump’s efforts to reform FEMA.
“Our entire state is grateful for President Trump’s leadership and assistance as we recover from the devastating storms that struck Arkansas earlier this spring,” Sanders said. “I had a productive conversation with the President in which he expressed his support for our state and I offered my full endorsement of his plans to reform FEMA to save money and provide greater direct assistance to disaster victims.”
 FEMA politics

Over the past two years, the Biden administration provided more than $101 million in public disaster recovery funding to Arkansas, according to FEMA data. And before that, the first Trump administration gave Arkansas more than $101 million in federal disaster recovery assistance between 2017 and 2020.
States in the Lower Mississippi River Basin have received more than $31.3 billion in federal public recovery assistance following natural disasters since 1998, according to FEMA data. Hurricane response has consistently required the most federal assistance.
In recent years, there have been more requests for disaster declarations and more of them have been approved than denied. Between 1953 and 1999, Lower Mississippi River Basin states saw two approvals for every one denial. Within the last 25 years, the approval ratio rose to 5-1.
John Gasper, an associate professor of economics at Carnegie Mellon University’s Tepper School of Business, found in a 2015 analysis of county-level FEMA data from 1992 through 2005 that the chance of a denial is lower when the president and governor belong to the same political party. In “non-election years or non-opportune times,” denials typically follow FEMA’s unofficial guidelines, he said in a May interview.
There are two reasons for FEMA aid’s president-centric policy design, Gasper said: The federal government wants the ability to grant aid in “marginal cases that don’t make the threshold but still are clear disasters,” and politicians realize the benefits of giving aid to constituents.
“In an election year, it’s a great opportunity for a campaigning official to come in, do photo-ops, roll up their sleeves, etcetera,” he said. “In non-election years, they have less concern there, so the probability of denial goes up substantially.”
The denial of Arkansas’ initial request for help was “shocking,” said Anderson. Sanders, who worked as press secretary for Trump for part of his first term, credited her access to the president for her appeal’s eventual success.
Changes at FEMA have further muddied the process of requesting and obtaining disaster assistance. Since January, the Trump administration has dismissed hundreds of FEMA employees and scrapped an agency program funding disaster prevention efforts in states and municipalities. The Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program had made $5 billion in grant money available since 2020, awarding over $12 million to Arkansas, Mississippi and Tennessee through 2023.
Federal officials have also discussed making it harder to secure funds after a disaster. In an internal memo obtained by CNN, former acting FEMA Administrator Cameron Hamilton proposed various reforms to curb the agency’s disaster spending, including quadrupling the financial burden states must sustain to qualify for public aid. Hamilton was fired weeks later, and state officials say they have received no word regarding changes to FEMA’s public assistance threshold.
While the higher benchmark proposed by Hamilton has not been adopted publicly, the low number of disaster declarations approved so far this year suggests the White House is following new standards for public aid eligibility, one emergency management expert explained.
“We don’t have to wait for an official guidance on this. We know that the bar has shifted,” said Bryan Koon, who led Florida’s Division of Emergency Management from 2011 to 2017 and is CEO of IEM, a disaster management consulting firm. “What got you a declaration in 2024 and earlier is not going to get you a disaster declaration in 2025.”
Hamilton’s replacement at FEMA, David Richardson, reportedly held a meeting with staff where he said a large part of the response and recovery would be put on states under his leadership, according to Drop Site News.
Bipartisan support for disaster aid reform does exist, but Trump’s FEMA overhaul has sparked concern among state emergency management officials, who say they aren’t prepared to take over disaster funding responsibilities from the agency.
Such a transition would require extensive guidance from the administration and planning from state and local governments, said Lynn Budd, president of the National Emergency Management Association and director of Wyoming’s Office of Homeland Security. Reducing FEMA assistance with little clarity or advance notice risks leaving communities unprepared for disasters moving forward, she added.
Even with clearer messaging from the administration, scaling back FEMA support would require states to make tough choices on how to cover disaster costs and budget for future emergencies, Koon explained. Reallocating funds toward disaster management would mean cuts to other services, and states would have to lean heavily on volunteer organizations to fill financial and staffing gaps.
“States are going to have to adapt,” Koon said. “It’s going to be a lot more of a patchwork of support to make up for what would have come from the federal government.”
Koon emphasized that shifting disaster expenses to states would also mean higher costs for residents. Households will have to purchase broader insurance coverage in the absence of FEMA assistance, he explained, and families will have to pay for damage previously covered by the agency.
In Mississippi, where residents are still recovering from the same storms and tornadoes that struck Arkansas in mid-March, emergency management officials said they will continue looking to FEMA for disaster assistance until they are instructed otherwise. The state is awaiting a decision from the White House on its own disaster declaration request, and officials said they won’t adjust operations or request additional funding from the legislature without more guidance from the administration.
“We have received no indication from FEMA about any proposed changes to formulas that determine federal disaster assistance,” said Scott Simmons, director of external affairs at the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency. “Until the rules of the game change, we’re going to continue playing by the rules.”
Others are looking ahead at how states could respond if FEMA steps back.
States already play active roles in recovery but they “need to become a little bit more proficient and get help in coordinating and answering disasters together,” Colin Wellenkamp, executive director of the Mississippi River Cities and Towns Initiative, a coalition of more than 100 mayors of river basin cities, said in early April following severe flooding along the river.
Flooding on the Mississippi River typically impacts all of its 10 bordering states, he said, so if states do take on more responsibility, they would need to work “in tandem” to coordinate recovery efforts.
“That isn’t necessarily something that happens through the FEMA process,” Wellenkamp said.
A new round of storms and tornadoes swept through the basin in mid-May, leaving major damage in St. Louis. And hurricane season begins June 1. Researchers are predicting above average activity this year.
With the Trump administration’s new approach to FEMA aid, Anderson worries that recovery for small places like Cave City may become even harder.
“There’s just things the Federal government has been or should be doing … they’re just a lot more equipped to handle that than a city or a state,”Anderson said. It’s an imperfect process and he added that “numbers on a spreadsheet don’t always tell the human story.”

Water protection group drops challenge to dome tents’ sewerage permit while state lands controversy still swirls around Casper gravel pit.
The post Last legal challenge to Teton glamping hotel ends appeared first on WyoFile .","A water protection group in Jackson Hole removed the last challenge to a temporary glamping operation on state land near Teton Village on Thursday.
Protect Our Water Jackson Hole filed papers with the Wyoming Environmental Quality Council withdrawing its appeal of a controversial sewage system permit. The group had challenged the Department of Environmental Quality’s permit allowing the canvas-dome hotel, owned by Basecamp Hospitality and known as Tammah, to operate a septic tank and leach field at the headwaters of troubled Fish Creek.
The withdrawal came after the Supreme Court ruled in April that the group could not sue to rescind the permit. “It didn’t make sense to continue down a path that had already been litigated as one in which we didn’t have adequate standing,” said Phil Powers, executive director for the group.
Protect our Water’s action followed another Wyoming Supreme Court decision on April 24 that Teton County could not impose its development regulations on Tammah. Conclusion of the two protests ends the immediate legal conflicts over the hotel that offers 11 posh fabric-covered geodesic domes with online rates topping $800 a night.
“Basecamp is proud to continue its partnership with the State in offering a one-of-a-kind, sustainable resort experience in Wyoming.” Chris Hawks
“All legal challenges and regulatory claims — brought by environmental organizations and raised by Teton County — have now been fully resolved in Basecamp’s favor, including POWJH’s recent voluntary dismissal of its appeal regarding the DEQ permit,” Basecamp attorney Chris Hawks said in an emailed statement. “With these matters behind them, Basecamp is proud to continue its partnership with the State in offering a one-of-a-kind, sustainable resort experience in Wyoming.”
Before Protect our Water withdrew its appeal, the Wyoming Supreme Court rejected Teton County’s challenge to the five-year temporary use permit, citing state laws.
The Wyoming Legislature “did not grant the County Board authority to enforce those [local] regulations when the State Board issues [temporary use permits],” Supreme Court Justice Kari Jo Gray wrote.
The advocacy group Citizens for Responsible Use of State Lands, which sided with Teton County in the legal fight, said in an email to supporters that the court’s decision “is not what we wanted.”
Nevertheless, “it is not all bad news,” the group said.
Prospects for change
There are several reasons for Teton County residents to take heart in the face of the legal loss, the group’s attorney Bill Schwartz said Thursday. First, the Supreme Court recognized that leases on state lands — commitments longer than five-year temporary use permits — subject the leasing party to county regulations.
“They noted expressly,” Schwartz said of the court, “that in connection with leases, the land board is required to make the lessee comply with county regulations.”
That’s important because Tammah should not have been approved as a temporary use, he said. A judge made that point as the case advanced to the Supreme Court, he said. In addition to the judge, legislators and residents statewide are recognizing the land board’s use of what the citizens’ group calls a loophole, Schwartz said.
“I think it’s clear [the land board] authorized this use through temporary use permits instead of leases to avoid the statutory requirements that they would have to comply with county regulations,” Schwartz said.
That awareness could bring changes to the underpinning state laws. Momentum is building, Schwartz said, to close the temporary-use loophole and also to scrutinize long-term leases that may also skirt state responsibilities to the detriment of neighbors.
Exhibit one is a lease for gravel mining on state land at the base of Casper Mountain. There, the land board on June 5 will consider renewing Prism Logistics’ lease which, Schwartz said “is literally in the middle of residential areas.”
Neighborhood worries are central to the Tammah and Casper conflicts, even though the circumstances differ. In Casper, Schwartz said local regulations should apply because the gravel mining is a lease.
The state, on the other hand, lumps gravel mining with the mining of minerals, he said. Mineral mining on state land leases is exempt from local regulations, Schwartz said. But Wyoming courts have said, for 100 years, that gravel is not a mineral, he said.
“This is not a mining operation in a sense that is meant in that exemption,” Schwartz said. “I think the gravel operations on Casper Mountain are not considered mining operations like a gold mine or coal mine because gravel is not a mineral.”
Other problems dog the state land board, Schwartz said, including what he and others perceive as inadequate public notice regarding applications for commercial operations on state lands.
“This is a great opportunity for a reset,” he said. “I think the Casper people are going to let that be known.”
The domes abide
Tammah is located on about 5 acres of a state school trust section that’s the site of seven other temporary uses. Most of the 640-acre section is leased for grazing.
Basecamp attorney Hawks said Tammah will abide. “Since entering into its lease with the State of Wyoming, Basecamp Hospitality has remained committed to environmental stewardship, compliance with all applicable laws and building standards, and delivering a distinctive guest experience at the Tammah Resort.”
Among other things, Teton County residents worry about the Tammah septic system and leach field that’s located adjacent to a wetland and at the headwaters of already polluted Fish Creek, a Class 1 waterway that’s impaired by E.coli. After the State Board of Land Commissioners approved temporary use permits on portions of the 640-acre state school trust section near Teton Village in 2022, Teton County began abatement procedures against Basecamp/Tammah for not complying with local land use regulations.
The county sought to conduct fire and electrical inspections. The state land board sued the county to stop local enforcement, prevailing in April in the supreme court.

With Colorado River negotiations facing a 2026 deadline, the state wants to keep water management in its own hands, but lags its neighbors in planning to cut usage.
The post Wyoming begins exploring voluntary water conservation programs appeared first on WyoFile .","This article originally appeared on Inside Climate News, a nonprofit, non-partisan news organization that covers climate, energy and the environment. Sign up for their newsletter here.
In Cheyenne, one of the northernmost cities receiving Colorado River water, the state engineer and attorney general’s offices met with legislators on the select water committee last month to discuss ongoing Colorado River negotiations. Their message was clear: Wyoming must adapt to a future in which the river has an inadequate supply of water for all of its users.
Brandon Gebhart, Wyoming’s state engineer responsible for managing and regulating the water within the state, and Chris Brown, with the Wyoming attorney general’s water and natural resources division, gave committee members background on the Colorado River negotiations, and outlined why it is in Wyoming’s interest to come up with its own water conservation statutes. 
With many Colorado River basin mountain ranges holding less than 50% of their average spring snowpack, it’s clear that the river and its reservoirs will again be stressed this year by deepening drought.
“We don’t have anything set up right now,” Gebhart said. “But I think it’s very important that if we’re to do that, we need to do it in a way that doesn’t impact our water users, and it’s something that Wyoming can live with.”
Southwest Wyoming relies on water from the Green River, the Colorado River’s largest tributary, to feed agricultural operations, serve its towns and power its industries. But as climate change intensifies the decades-long drought in the West, and river users continue to demand more water than the system can provide, the Colorado River is running dangerously low, threatening the water supplies and livelihoods of 40 million people in seven U.S. states, 30 tribes and Mexico.
In an attempt to address river shortages and forecasted drought, the states and tribes have come up with new plans for how to manage the river ahead of an October 2026 deadline. Both the Upper Basin states — Colorado, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming — and the Lower Basin states — Arizona, California and Nevada — have proposed cutting basin-wide use by as much as 3.9 million acre feet.
But, so far, the basins have been unable to agree on how to share those cuts. 
The Upper Basin states have proposed levying the full 3.9 million acre feet of required cuts on the Lower Basin in proportion to elevation declines at Lake Mead, which serves only Lower Basin water users, while voluntarily cutting their own use. Under the Upper Basin plan, the Lower Basin would incrementally cut its water use once Lake Mead drops to 90% of its storage capacity; when the lake reaches 70% capacity, the cuts plateau at 1.5 million acre feet — enough water to cover 1.5 million acres with a foot of water. The cuts would remain at that level until Lake Mead dips below 20% capacity, at which point Lower Basin states cut water use by an additional 2.4 million acre feet.
The Lower Basin states have offered to cut their own consumption by 1.5 million acre feet, but only once the Lake Mead water level drops to 69% of its capacity. The remaining 2.4 million acre feet of cuts would be triggered once the system hit 23% capacity and be shared equally between the basins.
Gebhert, who is also Wyoming’s representative in Colorado River negotiations, told the committee a voluntary program of cuts is important in part because it underlines the viability of the Upper Basin states’ plan and shows the Lower Basin “the certainty that we can do something to contribute to the solution.”
It is unclear what a voluntary water conservation program in Wyoming would look like — except that it would have to accommodate several interests. Ranchers, in addition to having some of the most senior water rights in the Green River basin, draw the most water, and any voluntary conservation program would likely have to balance their needs alongside demand from the communities of Rock Springs and Green River, which together hold almost 6% of the Equality State’s population, and take into consideration industries like mining for trona, a mineral used in soda ash for glass, paper and detergent manufacturing. Mining companies make up a substantial portion of the region’s tax base.
There may not be consensus within each of those groups as to what shape a voluntary water conservation program ultimately takes.

“I hear everything from, ‘Well, we haven’t used our allocation of Colorado River water yet, why should we do anything?’ — which is a good position to have, but one I’m not sure withstands scrutiny in the overall federal picture [of the river] — to those who say, ‘Well, this may provide some opportunity for me to get some revenue from use of some of my water,’” said Jim Magagna, executive vice president of the Wyoming Stock Growers Association, a ranching trade group.
Magagna hopes that as the state engineer’s office drafts its pilot program, it will account for the impacts of voluntary cutbacks of water use on landscapes and ecosystems that have historically been irrigated at a certain time, in a certain way with certain quantities. The state engineer’s office’s pilot program would likely affect urban and industrial water users in the Green River basin, not just agricultural users.
“I really appreciate the fact that they understand the need to involve everyone,” Magagna said.
Wyoming is, in the estimation of Chris Brown, a senior assistant attorney general, behind its peers in the Upper Basin — particularly New Mexico and Utah — in developing a voluntary water conservation program, he told state legislators.
In 2023, the Utah legislature passed a bill requiring water conservancy districts and water utilities over a certain size to submit conservation plans and update them every five years. They have access to state loans or funding to improve water uses. New Mexico makes water conservation resources available to homeowners, industrial users, landscapers and public utilities, among others.
The meeting concluded with members of the select water committee authorizing the state engineer’s office to come up with draft legislation for a pilot conservation program. Lawmakers plan to review that draft during their next meeting in August, at a yet-to-be-determined location.

The lawsuit named Randall Hepp and Yana Pusich as defendants, the then-warden and then-security director of the prison. 
  The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
According to the lawsuit, Botwinski suffered from a severe drug addiction and from mental illness at all times while serving his prison sentence at WCI. It says he died of a fentanyl overdose.
The lawsuit alleges prison staff known to be smuggling drugs were assigned in proximity to Botwinski. It also alleges a failure to order Botwinski into close observation until drug smuggling could be controlled. 
The DOC’s online offender locator dates Botwinski’s death on January 19, 2023. Botwinski is at least the eighth incarcerated person to die at the prison since 2023. The death of Damien Evans, 23, was at least the seventh death at the Waupun prison since 2023, according to reporting from the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel earlier this year. 
Another man incarcerated at Waupun, Tyshun Lemons, died on Oct. 2, 2023 when he overdosed on a substance containing fentanyl, the Examiner reported. 
The estate of Joshua Botwinski is the plaintiff for the lawsuit, by special administrator Linda Botwinski. The lawsuit alleges Hepp and Pusich were deliberately indifferent to a serious medical need, knowingly created a danger for Botwinski and knowingly failed to protect him from danger. It argues that their alleged deliberate indifference caused Botwinski’s death. 
In January, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported that nearly a dozen prison employees had resigned or been fired since the U.S. Department of Justice’s launch of a probe into a suspected smuggling ring within the prison.  
In September, William Homan, a former facilities repair worker at WCI, pleaded guilty to smuggling contraband in exchange for bribes. A sentencing memorandum by prosecutors said the presence of contraband in WCI contributed to a “lack of institutional control.” 
In late April, Hepp was convicted of a misdemeanor and fined $500 in the death of Donald Maier, who was incarcerated at WCI. 
A sentencing memorandum by a lawyer for Hepp said that in March 2023, “conditions and actions of the inmate population created an environment that posed an immediate threat to the safety of the staff and inmates while also threatening the security of the institution.” 
The memo said Hepp put the prison in modified movement, “at times referred to as a ‘lockdown.’” 
“This led to an investigation of the conditions and a search of the institution,” the memo said. “Information and physical evidence that was developed revealed a level of corrupt behavior taking place that was historical in scope involving trafficking of illegal drugs, cellular telephones, finances, and other contraband.”
The sentencing memo from Homan’s case said the lockdown involved incarcerated people “being confined to their cells twenty-four hours a day except for medical or other emergencies.”
“As part of its efforts to reestablish control, a facilitywide search was conducted, resulting in the recovery of numerous cellular phones, controlled substances, and other contraband,” the memo said. “WCI provided information obtained from its investigation to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), which included information that WCI staff were receiving bribes in exchange for smuggling in contraband.”
The lawsuit alleges that before Jan. 19, 2023 — and therefore before the lockdown and investigation — “via the reports they received from staff, both Pusich and Hepp knew that illegal drug use was rampant at WCI, and they knew that prison staff was smuggling drugs into WCI.”
Lawsuit includes alleged timeline leading to overdose
The lawsuit alleges that on August 15, 2022, WCI officials found out that Botwinski was under the influence of drugs. Botwinski tested positive for opiates and stimulants. 
Incidents of prisoners being under the influence of drugs “is automatically reported to Pusich as security director,” and Pusich would report incidents of prisoners using illegal drugs to Hepp, the lawsuit alleges. 
Before Jan. 19, the day of Botwinski’s death, Pusich and Hepp knew illegal drug use was “rampant” at the prison, the lawsuit alleges. 
“From the reports of drug use and overdoses, they knew that inmates had an almost unfettered access to drugs in prison,” the lawsuit alleges. “Botwinski’s access to drugs in WCI was greater than his access to drugs outside of WCI.”
The lawsuit alleges that Hepp and/or Pusich assigned prison staff known to be smuggling drugs into the prison in proximity to Botwinski. It alleges that they knew placing staff who smuggled drugs into the prison in Botwinski’s proximity would lead to overdose. 
According to the lawsuit, staff observed Botlinski in his cell at about 5:10 p.m. 
“At about 6:45 p.m., Botwinski was discovered in his cell: he had been the victim of a drug (fentanyl) overdose, from which he died,” the lawsuit says. 
The Wisconsin Department of Corrections did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the Examiner.

The University of Wyoming should exemplify its ""world needs more cowboys"" campaign and protect diversity, equity and inclusion programming, write a group of UW social work students.
The post Cowboy ethics aren’t what they once were in Wyoming appeared first on WyoFile .","The University of Wyoming launched its “The world needs more cowboys” campaign in 2018 with a video celebrating the diversity of students who embody the cowboy legacy — tenacious individuals who courageously pursued adventure and freedom through “fearless independence” in the American West.

Opinion

As students, UW asks us to embody “cowboy ethics,” but our institution isn’t “cowboy” anymore. 
If UW applauds cowboys for their “unyielding courage” and “relentless curiosity” — as banners adorning campus lamp posts suggest — then the administration should be standing up to the fear and narrow-mindedness exemplified by the Wyoming Freedom Caucus’ attack on diversity, equity and inclusion. 
After hours of testimony over the last year from professors, students and staff who spoke out against the Freedom Caucus’ push to defund DEI programs, the UW administration demonstrated they were more than willing to over-comply and over-censor essential university offices out of fear of legislative reprimand. This is not cowboy “unwavering integrity,” it’s bowing down to authority at the first point of resistance.   
Even private funding for DEI initiatives is under threat. Senate File 103, “Terminating and defunding diversity, equity and inclusion,” a bill vetoed by Gov. Mark Gordon earlier this year, would have prohibited public institutions from accepting private donations designated for DEI efforts. That means when our community wants to support inclusion with our own funds, there are lawmakers who want to tell us we can’t.  
What will happen once the University of Wyoming loses accreditation for programs that require DEI, putting students’ degrees in jeopardy?
In fact, enrollment at the state’s only four-year public university has already been declining.  
Taking effect on July 1, House Bill 147, “Prohibition of institutional discrimination,” defines DEI programs and activities as inherently discriminatory. The rhetoric of a merit-based society is attractive, but what is not being conveyed is that we can’t have a merit-based society without DEI when there is systemic institutionalized discrimination. What gets lost in this definition is the truth: DEI is cowboy. Not the sanitized version we see on recruitment posters, but the real, historical legacy of the American West. One in four cowboys was Black. The vaquero traditions of Mexican cowboys defined cattle herding and ranch life. Native Americans, Asian immigrants and women all shaped the frontier. Cowboy culture has always been diverse; we’re just finally telling the whole story. 
By rejecting DEI, we aren’t preserving tradition. We’re whitewashing it.
When did “relentless curiosity” mean allowing fear to dissuade us from inviting hard workers, creative thinkers and adventurous pioneers to have a seat at the table? 
Cowboy ethics aren’t meant to be printed on a banner, attached to a light pole and forgotten when things get hard. If we only stand by them when it’s easy, they aren’t ethics, they are decoration. 
Cowboy values are grit, speaking up when it counts, standing up to bullies and looking out for the people around you.
So, we urge the university to find its Wyoming cowboy backbone — reflect, course correct and remember what it truly means to draw a line and hold to it.

Pocan was in Eau Claire, the 3rd Congressional District represented by Derrick Van Orden, a Republican, on Saturday, May 31, at a town hall organized by Opportunity Wisconsin, a coalition of grassroots groups, at the Pablo Center at the Confluence, Eau Claire’s performing arts center.
Van Orden was invited to attend the event but declined.
Pocan is one of several congressional Democrats who have begun holding town hall meetings in Republican districts where Republican representatives have been reluctant to meet their constituents who are upset about  budget cuts that threaten access to Social Security, Medicaid and federal food assistance. 
Pocan focused on what President Dondald Trump (R) has called “the Big Beautiful Bill” that was recently passed by the House of Representatives, and which  Pocan called “the worst bill I’ve ever seen introduced by anyone, by any political party.”
He chided Republican supporters for cutting  Medicaid benefits  for nearly 14 million Americans,  raising the premiums for the Affordable  Care Act (ACA), and cutting food assistance to 11 million mostly low-income children through Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).
The Republican budget reconciliation package  also extends  tax cuts passed in 2017 for America’s top earners, resulting in a nearly $5 trillion national deficit over 10 years.
A May 20 Congressional Budget Office (CBO) analysis of the GOP budget bill projects it would increase the national deficit by $3.8 trillion and decrease Medicaid spending by $698 billion and SNAP spending by $267 billion.
A May 22 CBO projection notes the bill would reduce SNAP participation by “roughly 3.2 million people in an average month over the 2025–2034 period.”
There are different projections on how many people would experience a Medicaid cut, with estimates ranging from 7.5 to 10 million.
Van Orden sent out a release after Pocan’s appearance in Eau Claire:
“What Mr. Pocan is doing is absolutely despicable – continuing to fearmonger our vulnerable populations, including seniors, veterans, hungry children, individuals with disabilities and pregnant women. This bill protects Medicaid and SNAP for those most in need and prevents a 25% tax hike on Wisconsin families. Anyone telling you anything different, including Mr. Pocan, is lying to you.”
Van Orden also disputes  the CBO’s analysis, stating that the CBO has been wrong in the past and tends to be overly critical of Republican-sponsored legislation.
“There are not cuts to Medicaid, Medicare, Social Security, veteran benefits, SNAP and WIC (Women, Infants and Children program) are not being cut,” Van Orden told a local TV station after the House passed the bill.
But Pocan said Van Orden has been corrected even by other Republicans who admit the bill would reduce spending on Medicaid.
“83% of the benefit goes to the top 1% of the people,” Pocan said of the tax cuts, “so they are taking from the pockets of pretty much everyone in this room and putting it into the pockets of Elon Musk and Donald Trumps and others.”
Pocan added that  only 5% of the tax cuts in the bill will go to working people, including those who won’t have to pay taxes on tips,  seniors and to offset interest payments on car loans. And, he noted, those cuts will  sunset, while the much larger tax cuts for top-earners, which account for  83% of the cost of the bill, are permanent.
“The single largest cut to health care in American history is in this bill, 13.7 million people are estimated would lose access to health care because of the cuts to Medicaid,” Pocan said. “But what doesn’t get as much coverage is they also cut some of the premium assistance for the Affordable Care Act. So it’s a $700 billion cut to Medicaid, but also a $300 billion cut to the Affordable Care Act. We don’t even have the estimates of the numbers yet, but millions more will pay increased premiums.”
Pocan said Republicans have said the Medicaid cuts are really about setting work requirements in exchange for benefits and not a straight cut.
“Two-thirds of the people who get Medicaid are working poor,” Pocan said. While they shouldn’t be affected by the new work requirements, the red tape involved in proving their work history will help push people off Medicaid.
 “It’s not about trying to have any accountability,” he said. “It’s to just make it harder for people to get health care.” Pocan pointed to a state work requirement for Medicaid recipients in  Arkansas, where people who lost coverage were actually eligible for care. The work requirements did not boost employment, researchers found and many of those who lost coverage had trouble accessing the online reporting system. 
Pocan also noted that the projected increase in the deficit under the House proposal would trigger a sequestration requirement, resulting in automatic cuts to Medicare of nearly $500 billion.
SNAP cuts would mean a loss of $314 million for Wisconsin.
 Pocan also criticized Trump’s “on again, off again” practice of announcing tariffs, which had created a climate of uncertainty for businesses.
“Not only did Donald Trump not reduce costs like he promised in November, but the tariffs are actually a tax on all of us,” he said.
Pocan criticized Van Orden for not coming to town hall meetings to defend his vote for the Republican budget bill.
Van Orden has said he prefers telephone town halls where the meeting isn’t dominated by people he describes as leftwing critics, and he also has said that his family has received death threats and is vulnerable in an in-person setting.
Pocan acknowledged death threats should be taken seriously, but also stated he and many others in Congress have received death threats, and he criticized Van Orden’s telephone town halls for only allowing his supporters to talk.
Pocan also criticized Van Orden for going back on his promise never to cut Medicaid or reduce SNAP.  Van Orden has claimed  the bill doesn’t reduce Medicaid and that Medicaid and  SNAP payments will continue as usual for recipients if they meet the new work requirements.
A registered nurse who attended the town hall in Eau Claire said many of her clients are on Medicaid and Medicare, with several living in nursing homes, and she asked what would happen to them if the House budget bill became law.
State Sen. Jeff Smith (D-Brunswick) who came to the town hall with Pocan,   said approximately 55% of people in long-term care in Wisconsin are on Medicaid and if Medicaid funding is cut it will also impact the other 45-50% who have private insurance  because facilities will close due to lack of funding.
Pocan also responded to questions about cuts to Social Security Administration staff, saying, “When you cut thousands of people who work for Social Security, you make it harder for people to get access to their money.”
Speaking more generally of federal cuts under Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, he added, “They fired the people who worked on avian flu, bird flu, which was affecting us greatly recently, and they had to rehire them at the Department of Health and Human Services.” 
Pocan said he believed Trump won in November because the cost of living was high and noted that in other countries incumbents  also lost because of a backlash caused by global  inflation.
“So that was the No. 1 thing going for Donald Trump in November, but today it’s the No. 1 thing that’s taking him down the polls, because he said he would address it. He’s done nothing,” said Pocan.
Asked how Democrats could encourage younger people to vote, Pocan said, “The good news is younger people absolutely agree with more progressive public policy and not conservative policy.” But people “want to fight back, you want something to happen,” he added.
He encouraged Democratic leaders to hold more town hall meetings in Republican districts.
 “We should be going into many more Republican districts,” he said.
Pocan also encouraged attendees to meet Van Orden whenever he is in Eau Claire and ask to talk to him directly, and invite the press to be there for the interaction.
He encouraged the crowd of 100-plus to become active.
“You happen to be in this very unique position of having a member that is in a purple district,” Pocan  said of Van Orden, who  won in 2024 by one of the smallest majorities for a Republican in Congress. He “could lose his seat if he doesn’t listen to you.”

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nebraska lawmakers greenlit a long-term commission Friday to review how the state funds its K-12 schools, a step that could lead to future property tax relief after the latest efforts fell short this year.
Legislative Bill 303, from State Sen. Jana Hughes of Seward and introduced at Gov. Jim Pillen’s request, passed 48-0. It would create an 18-member School Financing Review Commission to regularly review and suggest possible improvements to the state’s main state aid formula to divert sales and income tax dollars to public K-12 schools: the Tax Equity and Educational Opportunities Support Act.
“I hope to be a fly on the wall of those meetings anyway,” said Hughes, who plans to reintroduce legislation in 2026 for additional property tax relief. “When you hear ideas, then it might spark something else that gives you better ideas.”

LB 303 received widespread support, including from the Nebraska Farm Bureau, Nebraska Farmers Union, Nebraska State Educational Association, Nebraska Rural Community Schools Association, Nebraska Council of School Administrators, Nebraska Association of School Boards, Greater Nebraska Schools Association, Educational Service Unit Coordinating Council and the OpenSky Policy Institute.
TEEOSA basics
The “TEEOSA” formula, created in 1990 and perpetually adjusted since, in most basic terms, diverts “equalization aid” to public school districts if it calculates that a local district has more “needs” than “resources.”
“Needs” is calculated among 18 buckets, including a district’s poverty concentration, students with limited English proficiency, transportation needs and student growth. 
“Resources” includes six buckets of funds, such as estimates of property taxes that could be raised with a $1 tax levy and net option enrollment funds.
  These are the various components that make up the “needs” and “resources” that amount of “equalization aid” as part of Nebraska’s Tax Equity and Educational Opportunities Support Act (TEEOSA). (Courtesy of the Nebraska Department of Education)
The formula diverts about $1.2 billion between 245 school districts each year. An increasing number of districts do not receive any TEEOSA aid under the formula, which is why Pillen and other senators in 2023 created “foundation aid,” distributing $1,500 to school districts roughly for each student. About 60% of foundation aid is considered a “resource.”
Pillen, in a Friday statement, said the state’s history with TEEOSA has indicated some “glaring flaws.” He thanked Hughes for championing a commission that Pillen said could find the “right solutions” to funding schools and “ultimately be a part of solving our property tax crisis.”
‘A long time coming’
Hughes said the “significant milestone” has been “a long time coming” with multiple senators, including State Sen. Wendy DeBoer of Omaha and former State Sen. Al Davis of Hyannis, who each proposed similar commissions.
DeBoer, now in her seventh year, routinely fought for the commission, including with LB 500 this year, because she believes it is the best way for a “deep dive look” at TEEOSA and property taxes generally. She said it can help understand if the state is on the right path,” or if corrections are needed, “not just today but in the long run.”
  State Sen. Wendy DeBoer of Omaha. Jan. 8, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
DeBoer and Hughes are among a rare crop of senators who understood TEEOSA before coming to the Legislature, Hughes because of school board service in Seward and DeBoer because of preparations during her 2018 campaign and as a self-described “nerd.”
The two senators said the implementation of term limits in 2006 also complicated major changes to TEEOSA.
‘Desperation’ for change
State Sen. Dave Murman of Glenvil, chair of the Legislature’s Education Committee, said the commission shows the need to reform property taxes and how the state funds its public schools.
“I agree with the desperation of farmers and homeowners that nothing else has worked, so it’s worth a try with the commission,” Murman said.
A former senator had questioned whether a commission was needed, arguing that lawmakers didn’t need an outside advisory group and could act right away for any TEEOSA changes.

Murman said the commission could be beneficial, but he’s been hesitant to support one in the past because he feared school officials might push conversations in ways that support their local schools or a set group of schools. He said their representation is needed, but he also wanted more taxpayer representation. Hughes embraced those suggestions.
With those reservations, Murman said senators should take any recommendations with “a grain of salt” as they have the final say in legislation. Murman plans to appoint himself as the Education Committee representative on the commission.
Property tax relief
Hughes, vice chair of the Legislature’s Education Committee, has made it one of her personal legislative missions to reform the state’s model for funding K-12 schools. Over her years in the Legislature, she hopes to lower school property tax levies and push them closer together. Right now, school districts can tax up to $1.05 per $100 of taxable property valuation.
TEEOSA considers a “local effort rate” of $1 per $100 of taxable property valuation for every school district, a mathematical model to determine what a district could theoretically contribute.

LB 303 would have originally lowered both the maximum tax rate and the “local effort rate” by 3 cents, thereby distributing more dollars to schools to ease the burden of local property taxes. That would have cost more than $120 million, proving too big a hill to climb with the state’s budget woes.
Pillen originally included LB 303 in his budget proposal in January, but the Appropriations Committee made key diversions from Pillen’s proposal, and downward economic projections in April derailed hopes to find additional funds without expanding sales taxes.
Instead, the bill moved forward only with the review commission, the members of which will need to be appointed within one month of the governor signing the bill. A first report is due Dec. 1, with subsequent reports each Nov. 1 after.
Commission duties
The commission’s main duties are to:

Evaluate TEEOSA and make recommendations for adjustments or changes “that may be necessary to help prevent the increase of property taxes.”
Regularly review both the “needs” and “resources” sides of the TEEOSA formula.
Analyze how to minimize the negative impact on schools during times when the state might not be able to fully fund the TEEOSA formula.
Examine the impact of funding for education on student achievement and outcomes, including access to early childhood education, student attendance, literacy, graduation rates, college-going rates and postsecondary workforce participation.
Consider the impact of funding on issues and resources impacting students with relatively high needs, including students who live in areas of high concentrations of poverty, students with an individualized education program and students with limited English proficiency.

Path to the governor’s desk
Hughes’ bill languished in the Education Committee until mid-May, largely because of a lack of funds. But it also stayed behind as a backup for property tax reform.
“We had to get a better feeling of what mechanisms might work to fund schools and property tax relief,” Murman said. “We wanted to keep all options open.”

Murman tried to keep LB 303 in committee longer than when the committee met May 9 to advance the bill 7-0, which could have hurt the chances of the bill reaching its finish line. The bill reached the full Legislature on May 15, the 80th legislative day, and passed on the 88th legislative day. Lawmakers will adjourn for the year Monday.
At the committee meeting to advance LB 303, a committee staffer urged Murman to oppose LB 303, or at least not vote to advance it. But Murman voted it out of committee and approved it along the way. He said his concerns weren’t personal.
Hughes challenged Murman for committee chair in January. He won reelection 29-20.
LB 303 sought three state senators as nonvoting members of the commission. However, Murman said the Education Committee chair should be a member, which some committee members pushed back on.
‘A big deal’
Hughes changed her bill so the senators are the chairs of the Education and Revenue Committees, or their designees, and one at-large senator. No more than two senators can be of the same party, and both chairs are Republicans.
If the Revenue Committee chair appoints himself, Hughes would not be able to serve on the commission because she, too, is a Republican.
Hughes said she doesn’t see a big recommendation coming from the commission this year but will continue work ahead of the 2026 session on how to drop school property tax levies and increase property tax relief. She plans to work with at least six other senators, two each from the Appropriations, Education and Revenue Committees, with even political party splits.
“People may or may not have noticed what a big bill it is,” DeBoer said, “but it is a big deal towards the ultimate goal of finding the right way for Nebraska to finance education.”



School Financing Review Commission membership
The School Financing Review Commission shall consist of:

The state commissioner of education (currently Brian Maher), or the commissioner’s designee, who will chair the commission.
The state property tax administrator (currently Sarah Scott), or the administrator’s  designee.
One representative of the governor appointed by the governor.
Three members of the Legislature, including the chairs of the Education Committee (currently State Sen. Dave Murman) and Revenue Committee (currently State Sen. Brad von Gillern) or their designees. Up to two senators can be from the same political party. 
One member who is a representative of postsecondary education with expertise in school finance.
One representative of a Class V school district (Omaha Public Schools).
One representative of a Class IV school district (Lincoln Public Schools).
Four superintendents or school board members representing Class I, II or III school districts (smaller than OPS or LPS). No more than two members can be from the same school district class.
Five members appointed from the state at large, including at least one with experience in business, one with experience in farming and one who is an active certified teacher in a public school.

The commission must meet at least once each calendar quarter. Commissioners would need to be designated by early July.
The Nebraska Department of Education, Nebraska Department of Revenue and the Legislature’s legislative fiscal analyst can provide data and assistance as needed.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout) In an escalation by Trump Administration officials and Republican lawmakers, two U.S. House committees have launched an inquiry into the response by Nashville’s mayor and local officials to federal immigration enforcement activities. 
A letter sent Thursday by the House Judiciary and Homeland Security Committees demands a series of documents from the office of Mayor Freddie O’Connell by June 12.
They include documents related to the mayor’s executive order requiring city emergency personnel to report interactions with federal immigration officials within 24 hours. The committees are also demanding all communications between city officials and other organizations and individuals regarding federal immigration activities during the month of May.
The letter accuses the mayor of actions that “threaten to chill immigration enforcement in the City of Nashville and Davidson County.”
O’Connell, during a regularly scheduled news conference on Friday, said he intends to “appropriately respond.”
‘There will be repercussions’ Homeland Security official targets Nashville mayor over immigration

“I am not particularly concerned,” the mayor said in response to a reporter’s question about the inquiry. 
“We’re going to respond appropriately to all inquiries, and we have been guided by a full understanding of state and federal law and we will continue to be,” he said.
The letter was sent to O’Connell the same day the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) released a list of hundreds of U.S. cities, counties and several states that Trump Administration officials accused of “deliberately and shamefully obstructing the enforcement of federal immigration laws endangering American communities.”
Nashville, along with Shelby County in west Tennessee, was on the list. 
But in a reversal over the weekend, the list was removed from the agency’s website. Reuters reported Sunday that the list was taken down after DHS received pushback from the National Sheriff’s Association, which issued a statement noting that local law enforcement had not been consulted before the sanctuary city list was made public and that it “violated the core principles of trust, cooperation, and partnership with fellow law enforcement.”
On Friday, O’Connell held in his hand a copy of Tennessee law barring sanctuary status, a designation that typically limits cooperation between cities and federal immigration officials, noting that Nashville has not engaged in any of the actions barred by the legislation.
“By definition Nashville is not a sanctuary city,” the mayor said. “We do not, nor have we ever had a policy that violates state law.”
“As we’ve stated several times in recent weeks, Metro (Nashville) does not have any legal authority as it relates to immigration enforcement and we do not impede federal law enforcement actions,” O’Connell said. “In fact we regularly partner with state and federal agencies to take violent criminals off our streets. This is the reality.”
U.S. border czar: Nashville mayor, a critic of immigration sweeps, now faces investigation

O’Connell also noted that both violent and property crimes in Nashville are significantly down from prior years.
The mayor’s remarks came at the end of a week marked by escalating attacks against him by top federal immigration officials as well as Tennessee Republican Rep. Andy Ogles. 
During a Memorial Day press conference, Ogles accused O’Connell, a Democrat, of “aiding and abetting illegal immigration.” 
Subsequently, White House “border czar” Tom Homan warned that immigration agents would “flood the zone” in Nashville seemingly in retaliation for the mayor’s perceived political stance against mass immigration detainments.
And on Thursday a Department of Homeland Security assistant secretary for public affairs accused O’Connell of “harboring” immigrants without legal status and “doxxing” immigration enforcement agents.
O’Connell has drawn the ire of Republicans for two actions: during mass immigration stops in Nashville earlier this month, O’Connell issued a revised executive order requiring the city’s emergency personnel – and some non-emergency employees – to report any interaction with federal immigration officials within 24 hours. 
The city then posted a list of those interactions on its web site. Initially the names or partial names of four federal immigration staffers appeared on that list in error, city officials said. The names have since been removed. 
O’Connell also publicized a fund established by the Community Foundation of Middle Tennessee to assist family members of those detained by immigration authorities. While Trump Administration officials accused O’Connell of using public funds to support immigrants without legal status, the fund operates only with private donations, a foundation spokesperson said.

(Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)Ever since the defeat of the Axis Powers in World War II, America has been admired around the world as a beacon of equality, freedom and opportunity. That admiration helped the United States become the world’s preeminent economic and military power over the last 80 years. While we have faced serious problems, like racial inequality, poverty and questionable wars, our elected representatives have usually been able to work together in an effort to address them. I fear that the era of America’s economic and moral dominance is now faltering and headed into a period of decline.
U.S. House-passed tax bill weakens accountability at for-profit colleges, advocates say

The so-called big, beautiful bill, which the U.S. House of Representatives passed on May 22, is a symptom of the decline. It will greatly benefit the wealthy, while denying medical care, food assistance and other social safety-net programs to those on the lower income scale. The bill would substantially increase income inequality in the country and likely necessitate a $500 billion cut in Medicare spending. It is unfathomable that U.S. Reps. Russ Fulcher and Mike Simpson voted for the bill and that Gov. Brad Little strongly supported its passage. Unless the U.S. Senate stops the bill in its tracks, the states will have to increase their budgetary outlays or let their voters go without vital services.  
The national debt consequences of the bill are also of great concern. It should be remembered that Trump added $8.4 trillion to the national debt during his first term, more than any other U.S. president. His big, beautiful bill would add an additional $3.8 trillion to the debt, which would raise the debt from its current $36.2 trillion to a whopping $40 trillion. That is a very serious problem in itself, but made substantially worse by other destructive actions he has taken that will seriously hinder the nation’s ability to deal with that massive debt.
The U.S. lives wildly beyond its means by borrowing against the future. Instead of requiring wealthy corporations and individuals to pay their fair share of taxes, we simply finance the deficits by issuing government bonds.
 Since the mid-1990s the GOP has forgotten that budget deficits can be prevented by raising adequate revenue. Thus, the national debt has ballooned from $5.6 trillion in 2000 to $36.2 trillion at the end of 2024.  About $8.5 trillion of the debt is held by foreign governments and investors. 
Foreigners have helped finance our debt because the U.S. has been regarded as a steady, reliable trustworthy nation. Our dollar is the coin of the international realm, and our government bonds have always been seen as a safe, reliable investment, particularly in times of international economic turmoil.
Donald Trump has shaken the world order by dumping on our friends and allies, including those closest to us – Canada, Mexico, the European Union, Japan and Korea.
He has disregarded trading relationships that have made America the leader of the free world. Trump’s latest threat to impose 50% tariffs on European nations seems designed to drive away our steadiest, most-reliable trading partners and military allies. His erratic and self-defeating tariff actions have shown America to be an unreliable partner. Our friends and allies have started forging stronger trading relationships among themselves and with China, our chief international adversary. This will reverberate against U.S. economic and security interests well into the future.
The bond market has become increasingly edgy about Trump’s erratic behavior. Investors are concerned about the safety of U.S. bonds, as evidenced by an increasing interest rate on our nation’s bonded indebtedness. The big, beautiful bill promises to trigger a crisis in the bond market. A well-regarded economist has observed: “The U.S. government bond markets are already shaky, long-term interest rates are rising, and it seems that foreign investors are fleeing the United States.” It is inconceivable that such chaos in the economic foundation of our country could have occurred since January.
America has long been regarded as the moral beacon of the world. As President Ronald Reagan put it in his Farewell Address — “The shining city upon a hill.” That perception is no longer the case. A recent survey discloses that America’s worldwide popularity has suffered a collapse since January. China is now regarded more favorably than the United States. Trump is viewed more negatively (58%) than Vladimir Putin (49%) and Xi Jinping (31%). Those dismal numbers foretell a decline in America’s ability to sustain its position as the premier moral, economic and military power in the world.

(Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The twice-dismissed felony criminal case against the former director of History Nebraska might soon reach the state’s highest court.
The Nebraska Supreme Court has been asked to accept an appeal of a March ruling by the Nebraska Court of Appeals that dismissed, on procedural grounds, a felony theft by deception charge against Trevor Jones.

The Nebraska Attorney General’s Office, which is prosecuting the case, asked for the review earlier this month, maintaining that the Appeals Court had erred in dismissing the case and in not hearing the state’s objections. Due to the “high profile” nature of the charge and the “weighty concerns” raised by its dismissal, the Supreme Court should weigh in, wrote Zachary Viglianco, a principal deputy solicitor general in the Attorney General’s Office.
“There is also a need for greater clarity about the proper procedural path to appeal an order granting a motion to discharge. This Court’s intervention is warranted,” Viglianco wrote.
But in a May 23 response, Jones’ attorney wrote that the AG’s office is raising “the same flawed argument” that led to the earlier dismissals — that a motion for discharge due to a speedy trial violation “is civil in nature as it is purportedly a ‘special proceeding.’”
Jones’ charges were dropped in January after Lancaster County District Judge Susan Strong ruled that state prosecutors had failed to bring him to trial soon enough, violating his right to a “speedy trial.”
That led the Attorney General’s Office to appeal to the Court of Appeals, which dismissed the case based on another procedural error.
It was unclear whether the Supreme Court would take up the case on appeal. The court had issued no notice as of Thursday.
Jones had served six years as the $164,800-a-year director of the Nebraska State Historical Society, but resigned suddenly in 2022, shortly before a state audit raised concerns about his handling of $270,000 in donations from a fundraising foundation.

The Attorney General’s Office eventually charged Jones with theft by deception, a felony punishable by up to 20 years in prison. Prosecutors alleged that he wrongly diverted the donations into a private foundation he helped establish, instead of depositing them with the state treasury, as required by law.
The failed prosecution has drawn criticism from at least one state lawmaker, Sen. Danielle Conrad, who has said Attorney General Mike Hilgers seems too focused on “politically charged litigation” to the detriment of a prosecution to protect public funds.
Jones’ reign as director was controversial. He imposed a personnel management system that some workers complained micromanaged their work and rebranded the society as “History Nebraska.” But he also won some praise for seeking to digitize the society’s holdings.
Gov. Jim Pillen, when he took office, restored the agency’s historic name, the “Nebraska State Historical Society,” and has since named a former head of the Nebraska National Guard, Daryl Bohac, as director. The independent nature of the agency was ended, placing the society as a department under the governor’s direction.

Currently, the candidates are selected by delegates at each party’s convention.
“I think the base of the party likes the idea of being able to have input in these statewide positions,” said Runestad, a state senator from White Lake.
State Rep. Bryan Posthumus (R-Rockford) expressed a similar sentiment but added that he sees value in the type of grassroots activists conventions bring out.
Runestad and Posthumus spoke during a discussion on the future of the Michigan Republican Party at the Mackinac Policy Conference on Thursday.

He said the party had about $800,000 of debt when he first took over, but said he has raised $500,000 since taking over.
“We’re vanquishing that debt,” Runestad said. “I think by year’s end, we’re going to get most of that down, and into next year, at the end of this term, we certainly will have no debt.”
Runestad said he has vowed to ensure the party has a “big” fund balance by the end of his term – even if means denying requests for a last-minute spending spree in the run-up to the election.
“We’re going to raise the money, we’re going to spend the money, but whether it’s me or someone else, we’re not going to leave that for the next person,” Runestad said.
He said the party has been undergoing a rebuilding process following several years of dramatic internal politics.
“We are on a growth spurt,” Runestad said. “We have changed everything that was done in the past in terms of the email system, the domain system, the website. We are changing absolutely everything from what it was before into a completely new party.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AMR_1854-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-02 07:11:18.948199

(Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)The latest round of air-quality tests near Tontitown’s landfill is complete, the Arkansas Department of Energy and Environment announced Friday.
Environmental consulting firm CTEH conducted the testing, specifically looking for chemicals found in previous air sampling, including benzene, acrolein, carbon tetrachloride, chloroform, and naphthalene,” a news release from the department said. 
“Within 90 days of receiving all final, validated analytical sampling results, CTEH will prepare a draft final report for the study, with feedback from the Arkansas Department of Health.”
All of the chemicals mentioned by the department are toxic to humans and can cause a variety of health problems.
Benzene is a liquid, flammable chemical used in a number of consumer products and industrial processes. Long-term exposure can lead to a number of health problems, including cancer, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Inhalation of acrolein leads to eye and throat irritation and can lead to more serious respiratory congestion, according to the CDC.
Carbon tetrachloride is a highly toxic chemical once used in refrigerants and still used in some industrial processes with serious health consequences for people exposed to it, according to the EPA.
Naphthalene, a common ingredient in mothballs, can cause anemia, liver damage and neurological issues if ingested or inhaled in large concentrations, according to an EPA fact sheet.
Chronic exposure to chloroform can affect the liver and central nervous system, the EPA says.
The testing, which occurred from May 2-11, was the fourth round of tests conducted in response to persistent complaints from nearby residents of overwhelming, noxious odors they say emanate from the Eco-Vista landfill, which is owned by Waste Management and is the only landfill in the region. 
The concerns of those living nearby the site, some of whom have said they want the landfill shut down, have bumped up against the waste disposal needs of the region, which has exploded in population since the landfill first opened in 1979.
Complaints and concerns about the landfill started about five years ago, and have grown since then. Tontitown is currently suing in state court over Eco-Vista’s landfill permits.
At a Pollution Control and Ecology Commission meeting last year, Tontitown Mayor Angela Russell said the Division of Environmental Quality had abandoned her town, which is in one of the fastest growing areas of the state, to a landfill that has received nearly 200 complaints in the last five years.
The latest round of testing was necessary, regulators have said, because previous tests did not identify the source of the chemicals in the air, even though the concentrations of acrolein and benzene were above EPA screening levels for residential air. The Arkansas Department of Health concluded after the third round of testing last year that further testing would be required to determine if the landfill was contributing the chemicals to the ambient air.
CTEH conducted the testing, at a cost of $539,966, after bidding on the project. 
The division previously said they would not announce when testing would take place in an effort to record “normal activities.” Rep. Robin Lundstrum, R-Elm Springs, previously accused two unnamed DEQ employees of tipping the landfill off to inspections during a pre-session budget hearing last year.
The town is in the process of suing the commission and Eco-Vista over multiple permitting matters.
Complaints have come into the division regularly over the last few years, but it was only last year that Eco-Vista was cited with violations of Arkansas air pollution laws as a result of odors.
The alleged violations were referred for DEQ’s formal enforcement process.

				This article is the first in a series on the environmental costs of America’s last remaining alumina refinery.			



GRAMERCY — For several months, a River Parishes refinery unlawfully discharged industrial toxic waste containing arsenic, cadmium, chromium and other toxic heavy metals into public areas and waterways, state records show.
The company, Atlantic Alumina, also known as Atalco, has so far racked up 23 violation notices from the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality after inspectors first discovered the pollution in August. It involves a slurry of industrial “red mud” byproduct that has eroded through the giant levees surrounding the facility’s waste containment lakes and spilled onto public property. The toxic sludge has killed vegetation and contaminated the land along its path to a local drainage system that flows to the Blind River Swamp of Lake Maurepas, according to a 606-page LDEQ inspection report finalized in March. 
The incident marks the first known case of red mud levee breaches at an American bauxite refinery. When asked for details, LDEQ spokesman Gregory Langley had little information to share about the prolonged discharge other than to say it is currently under investigation with the agency’s enforcement division. The only enforcement action taken as of May 29 is a warning letter LDEQ sent to Atalco.  
A review of thousands of pages of state and federal documents and interviews with scientists and area residents indicate that Atalco polluted public land and state waterways with the most toxic non-radioactive elements on the planet and allowed that pollution to continue for months — never notifying the outside community.   
Atalco’s refinery occupies roughly 3 square miles of land where St. James and St. John the Baptist parishes meet on the Mississippi River’s east bank. The site specializes in refining bauxite, a rust-colored powder of raw metals and minerals, into aluminum oxide or “alumina” in the form of an ultra-fine white powder. Atalco sells the alumina to metal smelters that need it to make finished aluminum. Opened in 1958 as Kaiser Aluminum, the Gramercy facility is the only remaining bauxite refinery in the United States and therefore the nation’s only domestic source of a critical metal feedstock. 
Atalco produced 669,261 metric tons of aluminum oxide last year, state records show. For every ton of aluminum produced from Atalco’s work, bauxite refining generates an estimated 2.5 tons of waste byproduct, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
One of the main problems in refining bauxite is there are not many good options for what to do with all that waste, most of which takes the form of a thick red mud. 
The waste comes from a part of the process in which bauxite is heated in a pressurized vessel with sodium hydroxide, a highly caustic chemical. The alumina compounds are then filtered out and separated, while the toxic byproduct is stored in the facility’s six red mud lakes. The lakes are open-air ponds, each roughly 150-200 acres in size surrounded by large earthen levees, some as high as 50 feet, meant to contain the thick liquid waste. 
Four of the lakes, including a “surge” or overflow basin, were constructed in the early 1970s without any liners that would help prevent the heavy metals and chemicals from seeping into the soil below.

“It is very dangerous,” said Slawomir Lomnicki, an environmental scientist at LSU. “There can be a lot of toxic metals leaching out of it and getting into the groundwater.” 
Groundwater contamination from leaching is a constant risk that exists when Atalco’s systems are operating normally. The public drinking water system in St. James Parish regularly monitors for that kind of contamination, according to Parish President Peter Dufresne. Officials with the St. John Parish water system did not answer multiple phone calls last week. 
A greater risk to the community from bauxite refineries in general is the rare case of a levee breach at a red mud lake, which can cause toxic waste to directly contaminate public waters and soils, scientists said. 
Until this reporting, the last known breach at a bauxite refinery occurred in Hungary in 2010. The failure of a red mud reservoir sent 35 million cubic feet of waste into nearby villages, killing 10 people and injuring 150 others.
In the wake of that incident, industry officials told the American public that a levee breach at Louisiana’s bauxite refinery would be unlikely because the levees are “periodically checked by state and federal regulators,” according to a news report from that time. 
That unlikely event has happened at Atalco. With a caustic level higher than drain cleaner and elevated concentrations of heavy metals, Atalco’s waste slurry eroded through levees in multiple locations at multiple lakes, forming canyons as deep as 10 feet that allowed the toxic waste to escape, records show.
 
A water sample LDEQ had tested from a public ditch outside the plant detected arsenic at a concentration nearly 1,400% higher than the level considered safe by state groundwater and EPA drinking water limits. The sample also contained cadmium at levels above those same limits. 
A soil sample taken from the same ditch contained mercury, beryllium, cadmium and chromium — all at concentrations above the average background levels found in U.S. soils. The cadmium was nearly 400% higher, and the chromium was 900% higher than LDEQ’s standard limits for soil. Chromium is the most toxic non-radioactive element on earth and is about three times more poisonous than arsenic, according to EPA toxicity factors.  
Historic water quality data for the Blind River, recorded from 1979-99, show heavy metal concentrations nowhere near those levels.

When the levees broke
“With this kind of facility, the worst major accident that can happen is a breach of the lake [levees],” said Corinne Gibb, a chemist who works with the environmental watchdog Louisiana Bucket Brigade. The group has monitored incidents at the alumina refinery for years.
It is unknown when the mud lake levees first began to erode, but state and federal records show the pollution lasted for months and continued even after Atalco became aware of the problem. 
The company has not responded to the Illuminator’s multiple requests for an interview.
Federal inspectors with the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) documented several hazards at Atalco’s levees last summer and voiced concerns about the risks they posed to the workers at the plant. 
“There were several mud lakes at the facility that was (sic) not being maintained,” MSHA inspector Brandon Olivier wrote in a citation dated June 25, 2024. 
Trees and shrubs obscured sections of the levees, making thorough inspections impossible, Olivier added.
A few weeks later, on Aug. 14, the MSHA issued Atalco another citation after inspectors discovered caustic waste “seeping through various locations on the east and west side of Mud Lake #4” and flowing downhill “into the roadway and ditches.”
LDEQ later noted the Aug. 14 citation was the first formal written notice Atalco received about the levees having a breach with dangerous toxic waste escaping from its facility.

Other dangers present at the Atalco plant had already drawn regulators’ attention at that time. 
Just days prior, on Aug. 4, the public was reminded just how dangerous the chemicals at Atalco could be when 45-year-old Curtis Diggs, a contract worker from Waste-Pro USA, fell into a pit of sodium hydroxide at the plant because a grate that covered the pit was missing and the entire floor was flooded with several inches of the caustic cloudy liquid. The chemical, the same that is stored in the red mud lakes, left Diggs with severe burns from which he did not recover, according to LDEQ records. He died in a New Orleans hospital on Sept 2.
MSHA investigated the fatality and learned that Atalco personnel had removed the grate on July 30, 2024, to try to pump out the flooded area and failed to put anything in its place or even a warning marker, creating a dangerous pitfall left open for five days and virtually invisible. MSHA charged Atalco with three regulatory violations and charged Waste-Pro USA with two, faulting both companies for “aggravated conduct” that involved an extraordinary pattern of negligence, though it’s unclear if any fines or penalties have been issued as of May 30, according to federal records.    
Atalco uses sodium hydroxide to refine bauxite into alumina. After the refinement process, it stores the used sodium hydroxide in the lakes with the other waste. 
Despite the heightened scrutiny from state and federal regulators at the time, by mid-September Atalco still had not repaired the levee breaches to Red Mud Lake 4 that federal inspectors cited the month before. Nor did the company thoroughly inspect its other lakes to look for similar breaches because, as the records indicate, similar breaches were there — if only the company had looked. 
On Sept. 17, MSHA inspectors found a breach in the levee around another lake, Red Mud Lake 1 East, with a stream of hazardous waste flowing freely across the roadway.
“The caustic was observed seeping through the side of the levee for approximately 50 yards across the roadway and to the ditch,” the citation states. “The mud lake is access[ed] by the plant operators daily and contractors for service, and this condition exposes them to injuries if there is a dam failure due to the seepage.”

Based on further inspections that same day, MSHA cited Atalco for a third levee break — at Red Mud Lake 2. 
On that single day, three of Atalco’s six waste lakes had confirmed breaches with streams of poisonous chemicals flowing freely to areas they weren’t permitted to go, including the Blind River Swamp — a popular recreational fishing spot in the Lake Maurepas backwaters.
LDEQ officials first arrived at the plant Sept. 20 to initiate a routine compliance inspection. Agency records show state officials met with Atalco managers, conducted an interview and toured parts of the facility. However, they were unable to inspect some of the lakes and levees because the plant manager told them the access roads were too wet to travel on. 
LDEQ first documented the levee breaches five days later when they were contacted by the federal inspectors, according to state records. Atalco had still not officially notified LDEQ of the levee breaches — something the company should have done immediately upon learning of them in accordance with Atalco’s permit requirements as well as state and federal laws. 
Local officials have also been kept in the dark. When asked about the events during an impromptu meeting with a reporter Thursday at the State Capitol, St. James Parish President Peter Dufresne said he was unaware of Atalco’s levee breaks that contaminated neighboring land and drainage with toxic waste. Dufresne declined an interview but asked the Illuminator for copies of LDEQ’s inspection reports. 
In October, the records show, state inspectors discovered erosion channels in the levee of a fourth lake, Red Mud Lake 3. They also saw for themselves the levee breaches that federal inspectors documented two months before. The erosion channels were still there, and the caustic waste was still escaping from those lakes.
So much waste had escaped that it also overwhelmed the facility’s secondary containment system, which is a network of interior ditches just outside of the levees used to catch any chemical spills or leaks from the lakes. The backup ditch at one location had overflowed, sending the toxic slurry across the highway just north of the Veterans Memorial Bridge. 
Atalco was also, as a matter of protocol, unlawfully using a stormwater ditch as a backup containment ditch. Three company officials, apparently unaware that they weren’t permitted to use the ditch for toxic waste disposal, told LDEQ inspectors that they routinely used it for containment, according to the inspection files.
In other areas, LDEQ inspectors saw that the waste slurry had accumulated to “nearly the height of the levee” in some of the lakes, the agency’s files note. The waste level in the lakes should never be allowed to rise higher than two feet from the top of the levee.
Ultimately, in site visits over the next three months, LDEQ inspectors viewed and documented levee breaches at four of Atalco’s six lakes, prompting the state agency to cite Atalco multiple times for failing to inspect and failing to repair the levees.

Erosion of the levees was a very real possibility that Atalco had long known about. In its 2010 permit renewal applications with the state, the company had addressed the topic at length, promising to prevent erosion by conducting daily inspections of the levees and keeping written logs of those inspections. The state included those as specific ongoing requirements in the final permit issued to Atalco. At that time, the company was in the process of raising its levees from 30 feet to 50 feet high, according to the permit application.
By the time state and federal officials began prodding the company last August, Atalco had not consistently inspected its lakes and levees in over three years and was missing hundreds of daily inspection records from July 30, 2021, to Dec. 18, 2024, according to LDEQ’s summary of violations.
On Oct. 23, state officials noted the company was constructing a new berm to contain the breach at Red Mud Lake 4, which Atalco had known about since at least Aug. 14. 
The breach at Red Mud Lake 3 continued until Dec. 4, according to the LDEQ file. On that day, Atalco managers accompanied state inspectors into the field when they noticed multiple streams emerging near an access road and traced it back to “one erosion channel with an estimated depth of at least 10 feet.” 










You would definitely get injuries and skin burns from it. The plants and any fish in the area would die from that. You can’t survive that high of a pH.


– Corinne Gibb, chemist, Louisiana Bucket Brigade


The chemistry of Atalco’s toxic waste
During their site visits in October, the state inspectors took pH readings from various pools of standing waste that had escaped from the lakes
The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14, with water having a neutral pH of around 7. Lower values indicate acidity, while higher values indicate alkalinity. Substances at the extreme ends of the scale in either direction can eat through solid materials such as steel and concrete and are very dangerous to most life forms.  
The LDEQ detected high pH at every location, with one puddle logged at a high of 12.49 — the same alkalinity as most caustic drain clog removers and ammonia-based cleaners. The inspectors also photographed dead or dying vegetation, petrochemical sheens, and white and yellow chemical residues in many of the locations where the slurry had traveled. 
“Just the pH by itself is concerning … That is very high,” Gibb, the chemist, said. “You would definitely get injuries and skin burns from it. The plants and any fish in the area would die from that. You can’t survive that high of a pH.” 
State inspectors had testing done on water and soil samples from off-site locations in the public drainage system and on-site locations near the erosion streams. Simultaneously, Atalco personnel collected their own batch of samples and sent them to a separate lab for independent testing. 
LDEQ’s soil samples contained significantly elevated levels of cadmium, chromium and nickel — all toxic carcinogens. Atalco’s samples reaffirmed the LDEQ’s lab results and detected even higher levels at one location. The company’s sample taken from public property outside the facility contained cadmium at roughly 1,000% higher than what the state considers safe for people. Additionally, the levels of chromium and nickel measured 1,700% and 300% above their respective state standards, the lab reports show.

Gibb and Lomnicki, the LSU scientist, said these three heavy metals, along with arsenic, are among the most dangerous non-radioactive substances on the planet. Exposure to excessive levels can cause a range of serious health issues, including cancer and blood poisoning.
Ganga Hettiarachchi, a Kansas State University professor of soil and environmental chemistry, said cadmium could pose the greatest long-term risk because it spreads easily and accumulates in living organisms over time. Enough small doses during a given time period can add up to a fatal dose, she said. 
Cadmium is highly toxic to humans in short- and long-term exposure settings. Small concentrations ingested or inhaled can cause gastrointestinal or respiratory illness, while higher concentrations can cause cancer, cell death, neurological damage and organ system failure, according to the National Institutes of Health.
Increasing the risk from cadmium is that it can be easily spread across far distances and transfer from soil into crops, Hettiarachchi said, posing risks to humans and animals if they eat those crops.
“It could easily end up in our food,” she said. “That has been historically the main pathway for cadmium.”
If cadmium gets into surface water or groundwater, it can become an even bigger problem, especially if that water is used for irrigation, she added. 
“The area of damage can expand further and further over time,” Hettiarachchi said.
Cadmium was present at elevated levels in two of Atalco’s water samples and four of LDEQ’s. The highest concentration was 400% above the level considered safe in a water sample taken from an erosion channel within the perimeter of the facility. It also had high levels of chromium and lead.
All seven water samples that LDEQ had tested contained elevated levels of arsenic. One of them taken from outside the levee of a red mud lake detected arsenic at a level 9,000% higher than state and federal safe limits, and it contained high levels of cadmium, nickel and thallium. Six out of the seven samples Atalco personnel collected contained arsenic at levels beyond what is considered safe. 
LDEQ has yet to address the risks Atalco’s red mud runoff could pose to the community. Langley, the agency’s spokesman, said it has yet to determine what the public impact might be. 
“Obviously those are things we don’t want going into state waterways,” Langley said. 
Part Two: For some nearby residents, the levee breaches at Atalco are just the latest incident in a familiar pattern. The second story in this series reveals why the incident at Atalco was foreseeable based on the history of the plant and the many accidents and environmental exposures to the nearby communities. 
“They’re turning a blind eye to it,” said Gail LeBouef, who’s lived near the plant since 1999.

They don’t recognize checks and balances nor the institutions tasked with imposing them. 
They do not recognize the rule of law. Laws that do not suit simply do not apply. 
So, a country’s governing documents such as a constitution are malleable. Truth is what they say it is, facts be damned.
Critics who challenge this – journalists and the organizations they work for, law firms, universities, disagreeable judges, artists, etc. – are in for punishment and derision. They are cast as unelected elites, liars and betrayers of the country’s ideals, the better to silence or mute their influence.
But perhaps most importantly, autocrats and authoritarians must identify enemies for the rest of us to hate. Anyone who’s not part of their tribe, ideologically, ethnically, racially, by gender or sexual orientation is a target. If they speak another language, all the better.
President Donald Trump has focused for years on targeting  immigrants.
Trump himself is a  descendant of white immigrants and is married to one, but that’s where he makes an exception. 
He has accepted white South Africans as refugees while dismantling protections for people from countries he once described as sh–holes. Which is to say, refugees who aren’t white. 
He claims white South African refugees are the victims of extreme violence. As descendants of apartheid adherents, they are members of a group that has retained its privilege in South Africa. They are certainly  not victims of genocide, as Trump claims. The data shows that they are less likely to be the victims of violence than Black South Africans.
Trump’s executive order to enshrine English as the country’s official language – America for English-speaking Americans only – is another example of whites-only tribalism. 
Long ago, the languages of European immigrants like Trump’s forebears  were thought to  delay assimilation and demonstrate traitorous loyalty to other countries. But these days, the fear is rooted around Spanish of the Latin American variety and the languages of immigrants from Asia and Africa.
Around the globe, people in  other countries think a populace fluent in many languages is an advantage, not a deficiency. 
But Trump’s American is one of proud provincialism.
In any case, immigrants already recognize English as the indispensable language of commerce and success in this country.
Ask any child of immigrants. My parents desired that I master written and spoken English, though the price was less literacy in their native language – Spanish.
My proficiency in English brought my parents the most pride.
Now, for many people, speaking perfect English is a matter of safety. Trump  is deporting immigrants of color under an assumption they are members of criminal gangs. But in many cases there is plenty of evidence that those charges are misplaced, and people are being deported  without due process. 
Trump is carelessly rounding people up and sending them to a hellhole prison in El Salvador and to other countries he would assuredly describe as sh—holes —  even to a dysfunctional non-country such as Libya, in the midst of a civil war, without giving them time to respond to the charges against them. 
He has long labeled immigrants as terrorists, although there is little discernible link between immigrants and terrorism.
Under his broad definition, importing drugs to satisfy Americans’ appetites for illicit substances is a terrorist threat,  not  a public health issue.
Even when the administration is forced to admit error in deporting people who have a legal right to be here, it is not returning them. See, Abrego Garcia, mistakenly deported to a notorious El Salvadoran prison.
Like many citizens of color, I’ve become hardened to Trump’s racist  animus. We’ve been cast as job stealers, criminals and a threat to American culture. This is the same animus that made the  civil rights movement necessary. 
Not so long ago, we thought  the pendulum had swung to a more equitable, inclusive country.
But then more than 77 million Americans voted for Trump for the purpose of making America great again.
A country led by an authoritarian leader who thumbs his nose at the rule of law is not the America I know. And it certainly isn’t great.

More legislatures in Republican-led states are passing paid parental leave for public employees. (Brandon Bell | Getty Images)More Republican-led states are giving paid parental leave to public school teachers and other state employees, signaling a broader acceptance of family-friendly workplace policies once championed primarily by Democrats.
“All of these red states, I think we’re late to the party,” said South Carolina state Rep. Beth Bernstein, a Democrat who sponsored a bill this year to increase state employees’ paid parental leave from six to 12 weeks. It passed the majority-Republican South Carolina House in April with strong bipartisan support.
This year, Alabama, Iowa and Mississippi joined 37 other states in granting paid parental leave to thousands of state workers.
The trend has gathered steam in recent years. Some experts link it to the cascade of state abortion bans that followed the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2022 Dobbs decision, which dismantled the federal right to abortion. Under fire from critics to do more to care for babies once they’re born, at least a dozen conservative-led states with abortion bans have since granted or expanded paid parental leave for their state employees.
But others say the increasing bipartisan support for measures that help working parents is also a reaction to economic realities.
“What we’ve seen, especially in more conservative states, is the public sector has experienced a lot of turnover,” said Kameron Dawson, legal director of the Southern Office of A Better Balance, a legal organization focused on workplace rights. “They’re looking for tools to recruit younger employees.”
Paid parental leave is the time off granted to workers for the birth or adoption of a baby, to care for a child, or to recover from a stillbirth or miscarriage. Without it, employees are left to cobble together their sick leave and vacation leave — or go unpaid — to stay home with a child and heal.










We’re trying to attract and retain state employees and teachers, and we’re in competition with everyone around us, and the private sector as well.


– Alabama Republican state Rep. Ginny Shaver


Alabama Republican state Rep. Ginny Shaver watched her daughter, a public school teacher, struggle to get the leave she needed after the births of her children in recent years.
“With her second, she had complications in her pregnancy and used up her [paid vacation and sick] leave before she even had the baby,” Shaver told Stateline. Her daughter contracted COVID-19, and the baby had to spend time in neonatal intensive care. “It was a very difficult time, and she had to take unpaid leave.”
Last year, Shaver and Democratic state Sen. Vivian Figures worked to win approval of a paid parental leave bill for state employees. It failed.
But they tried again this year. With the support of Republican Gov. Kay Ivey, the state legislature — which has a Republican supermajority — passed it nearly unanimously. The new law gives female state employees, including teachers, eight weeks of paid parental leave in connection with birth, stillbirth or miscarriage, and gives male employees two weeks. Adoptive parents get eight weeks for one parent and two for the other.
Shaver said she thinks the law passed thanks to vocal support from the governor and increased awareness of the issue due to the work she and Figures did in previous sessions.
“And the fact that all of the southeast states around us offered it,” Shaver said. “We’re trying to attract and retain state employees and teachers, and we’re in competition with everyone around us, and the private sector as well.”
Keeping talent
For many Republicans, the workforce development argument for paid leave is a persuasive one. For states such as Alabama and South Carolina that have some of the lowest workforce participation rates in the nation, paid leave can be a tool to keep more people — particularly women — working. And it can be a way to retain educators as many states struggle with teacher shortages in K-12 schools.
“For several years we’ve seen state legislatures acknowledging the importance of child care to businesses and the economy,” said Feroza Freeland, policy director at the Southern Office of A Better Balance. “But in the last few years, we’ve seen a growing recognition that paid leave is another piece of that puzzle.”
States have taken up the issue because the federal government has not. The United States is a global outlier; among 38 peer nations, it’s the only one that doesn’t mandate paid parental leave, according to the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development. The group comprises 38 democracies with market-based economies.
The federal Family and Medical Leave Act, passed in 1993 and extended in 2020, only requires public agencies and companies with at least 50 employees to give up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for parents of newborns or newly adopted children, or caregivers of sick family members.
GOP support
During his first term, President Donald Trump publicly supported some forms of paid family leave and signed a defense bill that gives 12 weeks of paid parental leave to most federal employees.
Paid family leave was a signature issue for his daughter Ivanka Trump, at the time a senior adviser to the president. She even held a paid leave and child care summit at the White House in late 2019.
That set the stage for other Republicans to take up the issue more publicly. And after the Dobbs decision, family-friendly policies have increasingly become conservative talking points in states with restrictive abortion laws.
After the Mississippi House unanimously passed a paid parental leave bill earlier this year, Republican House Speaker Jason White celebrated the bill as a reflection of Mississippi’s status as a “pro-life state.”
In a post on X this week announcing her signing of a new paid parental leave law, Iowa Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds called Iowa “a pro-family state.”
North Carolina was one of the first Southern states to grant paid parental leave to state workers in 2019 when then-Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, signed an executive order. In 2023, several months after the Dobbs decision, the state’s majority-Republican legislature extended paid parental leave to public school employees by tacking it onto a law banning most abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy.
Meanwhile, Indiana Republican Gov. Mike Braun signed an executive order in March to add up to eight additional weeks of paid leave for “childbirth recovery” to the state’s existing four weeks of paid parental leave.
Running the gamut
The new laws won’t apply to most residents, because they only cover state employees. But they could have a downstream effect.
Shaver, the Alabama lawmaker, said she hopes her state’s new law will not only help the state be competitive with the private sector, but also set a precedent for other employers to follow.
“I hope they will see it’s in their benefit to offer what they can,” she said. “It may not be eight or 12 weeks, but even offering a reduced or flexible work schedule can help families.”
Just over a quarter of private-sector workers have access to paid family leave through their employer as of March 2023, according the most recent data from the U.S. Department of Labor.
Among the lowest-wage earners, that share drops to 6%.
State paid leave programs run the gamut in terms of what they offer. While Alabama’s new law offers up to eight weeks of leave for all state employees, including teachers, Mississippi’s offers six and does not require public schools to offer paid parental leave to their employees.
Iowa’s new law grants four weeks of paid leave for the birth or adoption of a child and one week of paid paternity leave. Tennessee’s law, passed in 2023, only offers paid leave to workers in the state’s executive and judicial branches.
But a few states are already expanding their offerings: Last year, Georgia legislators voted to double paid parental leave from three to six weeks.
And some states have gone further than just state employees: 13 states and the District of Columbia have mandated paid family leave for all workers, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center. Most of those states are located in New England or on the West Coast and all are Democratic-led. Ten more offer voluntary paid family leave statewide that’s provided through private insurance.
Sandwich generation
Experts say the shift in attitude toward family-friendly policies can also be attributed to a generational shift.
“A lot of younger lawmakers are more willing to champion the issue of paid leave,” said Freeland, of A Better Balance. “They’re understanding it because they’re seeing it in their own lives, or seeing friends and family members going through this.”
In South Carolina, Bernstein’s bill faced some opposition from members of the state’s ultra-conservative Freedom Caucus and Family Caucus. Some lawmakers questioned the potential costs of the bill, or criticized it as government overreach.
South Carolina Republican state Rep. Josiah Magnuson, a member of the Freedom Caucus, said he believed the bill would be a financial burden on public school districts that could lead to raised taxes.
“You’re saying, let’s tax the people of South Carolina, most of whom don’t get paid parental leave, and give them to state employees who already have six weeks’ paid parental leave,” Magnuson told lawmakers in April before the House voted to pass the bill.
He also said he doesn’t like that the increased paid leave “puts the foot in the door a little more for the government to be involved in the home.”
The opposition frustrated Bernstein, who pointed out that the state’s 2022 law that granted six weeks of paid parental leave passed the legislature almost unanimously. This year’s bill expanding that leave passed the House but hasn’t seen movement in the Senate. It can be picked up again when the legislature returns in January.
Other South Carolina Republicans backed the bill, citing their own families’ experiences following the birth of their children, reported the South Carolina Daily Gazette.
More conservative states are also responding to the needs of “sandwich generation” employees who may be caring for aging parents as well as children, Freeland said.
Earlier this year, Tennessee became the first Southern state to expand its state paid leave policy beyond just parental leave. The state legislature voted almost unanimously to extend its six-week paid leave policy to cover state workers providing end-of-life care to a family member.
“We’re seeing a growing recognition that people need support for these types of family or caregiving needs,” said Freeland, “and that it strengthens the workforce and economy to be able to provide that.”

(Photo: Kansas Reflector) A Trousdale Turner Correction Center inmate serving time at a privately-run prison in Tennessee is suing the warden and staff for allowing gang members to assault him and extort money from his mother.
Filed in May in U.S. District Court in Nashville, the lawsuit claims gang members at the CoreCivic prison in Trousdale County threatened to assault inmate Charles Anderson if his mother and two family friends didn’t send them money, then beat and sexually assaulted him anyway after he complained to prison staff. 
Trousdale Turner already faces a federal civil rights investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice for gang violence and murders.
The lawsuit names prison warden Vince Vantell, assistant warden Keith Huggins, investigator Robert Fohrd and a sergeant at the facility, which is run by the Brentwood-based prison operator under contract with the state of Tennessee.
U.S. Department of Justice opens investigation into CoreCivic Trousdale County prison

The filing says almost as soon as Anderson was transferred to Trousdale Turner in October 2023, he became the repeated victim of violence, with gang members stealing his property and threatening and inflicting violence on him. Gang members ordered him to buy back the stolen items in a well-known prison extortion scheme, according to the filing.
Anderson then instructed his elderly mother to pay gang members’ affiliates outside the prison through mobile methods or a “green dot” card or else he would be severely harmed or killed.
Gang members armed with shanks forced him to call his mother and ordered him to tell her to make payments between $40 and $150.
“These calls were placed from (Trousdale Turner Correctional Center) lines and presumably monitored by staff at TTCC,” the filing says.
When the inmate’s mother couldn’t afford to make the payments, he asked two family friends for “protection” payments to “preserve his life.”
The family friends told Fohrd about the extortion and threats, yet the staff member did “nothing” meaningful to intervene or put Anderson in protective custody, the filing says.
In May 2024, the family friend sent multiple emails to the warden’s office about the “incessant” extortion, and at one point a prison official told the friend they were “committed” to placing him in protective custody.
Yet in June 2024, Anderson was assaulted again, and in October 2024, he was sexually assaulted by at least four gang members with a broom handle. They claimed he owed them $1,000 for “debt.” No staff members intervened, the filing says.
The victim received treatment at Nashville General Hospital in October, but when he returned to the prison, gang members attacked him again and poured “scalding hot water” on his face as he slept.
Despite receiving medical treatment, he wasn’t placed in protective custody and was attacked again and threatened if he didn’t perform sexual favors for the gang members, which he refused to do, according to the filing.
A corrections officer recommended he be put in protective custody, and staff reviewed the request. After repeated complaints and a request to file a Prison Rape Elimination Act complaint, Anderson met with prison officials when Vantell told him it was “okay if he was gay.” Anderson replied that he wasn’t.
“This interaction was an attempt to cover-up the rape as a consensual act and escape liability for the defendants’ acts and omissions,” the filing says.
The defendants denied his requests for protective custody, alleging he “was not honest about why he needed protective custody” and “became argumentative with the board” of prison officials.
In December 2024, Fohrd spoke with the inmate’s mother and told her to pay the gang members “one more time” to buy back his property and he would be put into protective custody. The filing says the phone call was made in the presence of Anderson and gang members.
“Because the defendants failed to stop gang violence and extortion directed towards Mr. Anderson and his family, the violence and extortion continues, without reprieve, even to present,” the filing says.
Since last October, the victim has received multiple disciplinary write-ups for refusing his cell assignment, because he believes “segregation” is the only way to be protected from “constant gang violence,” according to the filing. Yet he remains in the general population.
Vantell resigned as warden in April after being placed on involuntary administrative leave amid the Department of Justice investigation into inmate physical and sexual violence, as well as understaffing at Trousdale Turner.
The plaintiffs are represented by Moseley & Moseley Attorneys in Murfreesboro and Leanne Thorne in Lexington, Tennessee.
A CoreCivic spokesman said the company doesn’t comment on pending litigation but added that “the safety and well-being of every person in our care is a top priority for our leadership and the staff at our Trousdale Turner Correctional Center.”

The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe opposes the pipeline, citing concerns for its water supply and sovereign rights. (Kyle Martin/For the North Dakota Monitor)The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe is asking the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals to review a federal judge’s decision to dismiss its latest lawsuit against the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers over the Dakota Access Pipeline.
Standing Rock filed the lawsuit in October, asking the court to find the pipeline must be shut down because it still lacks an easement authorizing it to pass under the Missouri River’s Lake Oahe reservoir, which is regulated by the Army Corps.
“The Corps of Engineers has not earned the trust of our Tribe,” Standing Rock Chairwoman Janet Alkire said in a statement last week announcing the appeal. “We cannot rely on the Corps to properly evaluate DAPL, so we are continuing our legal efforts to protect our water and our people from this dangerous pipeline.”
Greenpeace seeks reversal of verdict, arguing jury wanted to ‘punish’ someone for pipeline protests

The Army Corps originally granted the easement to the pipeline’s developer in 2017, but Boasberg revoked it in 2020 after finding the agency had issued the permit without completing the full environmental review required by federal law. The matter was brought to him through a lawsuit the tribe filed against the Army Corps in 2016.
Boasberg at the time directed the Corps to withhold making a decision on the easement until it completes a full environmental impact study. He also ordered the pipeline to be shut down, though that demand was later reversed by an appellate court.
Five years later, the Army Corps still has not finished the environmental review. It published a draft in late 2023. 
Standing Rock in its latest suit argues that keeping the pipeline open without an easement is a violation of federal law. The tribe also alleges the Army Corps is at fault for a number of other regulatory violations related to the pipeline.
In court filings, Standing Rock has said it intends to present new evidence related to the pipeline’s safety. The pipeline company has indicated previously it does not consider that information credible.
U.S. District Court Judge James Boasberg tossed the suit in March, finding that the courts cannot intervene in the matter until the Army Corps wraps up its environmental study.
“No matter its frustration with Defendants’ sluggish pace, it is not yet entitled to a second bite at the apple,” he wrote in his March order.
Boasberg previously indicated that while the agency works on the study, it has the option of enforcing its property rights since the pipeline is operating on federal land without authorization.
“The Corps has conspicuously declined to adopt a conclusive position regarding the pipeline’s continued operation, despite repeated prodding from this Court and the Court of Appeals to do so,” he wrote in a 2021 order.
Standing Rock leaders say they hope the D.C. Circuit will overturn Boasberg’s decision to dismiss the case.
In her statement, Alkire said the tribe fears the Army Corps’ study will “whitewash” the pipeline’s risk to the surrounding environment.
The pipeline crosses Lake Oahe just north of the Standing Rock Reservation. The tribe opposes the Dakota Access Pipeline as a threat to its sovereignty, water supply and cultural heritage sites.
Federal judge dismisses Standing Rock’s latest lawsuit over Dakota Access Pipeline

Alkire also underscored the tribe’s dismay over a March jury verdict that found the environmental group Greenpeace at fault for damaging the pipeline developers property and business as part of its protests against Dakota Access Pipeline. The jury ordered Greenpeace to pay the company, Energy Transfer, roughly $667 million.
Standing Rock has criticized the verdict as based on a false narrative that Greenpeace, and not Standing Rock and other tribes, led the protests.
“We saw Energy Transfer’s efforts to re-write history as we know it and lived it in their lawsuit against Greenpeace,” she said.
In April, another federal judge ordered the Army Corps to pay North Dakota $28 million in connection to the anti-pipeline protests, finding the agency’s actions had wrongfully forced the state to pay millions policing the protests and cleaning up the aftermath.
The Dakota Access Pipeline passes through unceded land previously recognized as belonging to the Sioux Nation in 19th century treaties with the U.S. government.

(Aristide Economopoulos for NJ Monitor)West Virginia’s school voucher program, the Hope Scholarship, is clarifying how students can use the money for education expenses after parents asked to purchase ammunition, gaming consoles, live animals, witchcraft herbs and more through the program. 
“We had the request for witchcraft herbs and a cauldron,” said Amy Willard, assistant treasurer for the Hope Scholarship Program, at a May 16 scholarship board meeting. The request was denied.
The Hope Scholarship, which launched four years ago, provides roughly $4,900 per student in tax-payer funds to be used for private schooling tuition, homeschooling, microschools and more. Around 11,000 students used the program during the 2024-25 school year.
Parents who utilize the Hope Scholarship for homeschooling use a portal to purchase a wide range of educational materials, like curriculums, iPads, water tables, bee keeping materials under $200 and more from vendors. Parents are permitted to use the money for horseback riding lessons and dance studio fees. Hope Scholarship funds are not sent to the parents.
Carrie Hodousek, communications director for the State Treasure’s Office, said some items are pre-approved and don’t require a manual review by the board. Other items are reviewed by an individual or multiple individuals either in the Treasurer’s Office and/or the Office’s contracted program manager, she explained.
“These items are brought to the board for approval or disapproval,” she said.
On May 16, the Hope Scholarship Board issued an updated list of unallowable expenses based on parents’ requests. Along with witchcraft herbs, live animals and ammunition, the board said the funds may not be used on these additional items and more: travel sports fees; household furniture, including desks and couches; virtual reality equipment; athletic equipment in excess of $500; medications and supplements; chicken brooders; heat lamps and chicken coops in excess of $400.
 “In none of these instances were these items successfully purchased without authorization from the board,” Hodousek said. 
“If items are placed on the non-qualifying expense list, it means that the Treasurer’s Office did not allow those purchases to go through and then requested guidance from the Hope board as to whether they should be permissible expenses,” she added.
The Hope Scholarship program is expected to grow to 50,000 students by 2026, and the price tag has already raised concerns among the GOP-led Legislature, who largely back the program as part of their school choice push. 
Lawmakers recently approved $97 million for the Hope Scholarship for the upcoming school year — up from this year’s $58 million in funding for the program. It was the largest funding increase requested by Gov. Patrick Morrisey in his first budget proposal.
In 2027, its price tag is expected to skyrocket to around $300 million, when the program will open up to all students in the state. 
“We are leaving other vitally necessary programs underfunded because of an increase in this line item,” Del. Elliott Pritt, R-Fayette, said in April as the House debated bills that funded the program. Pritt, a public school teacher, noted the state’s public employee’s insurance program, which insures teachers, continues to struggle. 
Democratic lawmakers in the House proposed a bill banning the use of Hope Scholarship funds at out-of-state schools, but the measure wasn’t taken up for consideration during the legislative session. More than $122,000 in Hope funds were used at out of state schools last school year.
Public school leaders have said the growing number of students using the program has continued to financial issues as the state is facing a wave of school closures. Under the current school funding formula, counties receive state funding based on the number of students. West Virginia is also experiencing an overall population decline.

State lawmakers are proposing a similar successor funded at $50 million per year. (Emily Previti/Pennsylvania Capital-Star)A home repair program that Pennsylvanians really seem to need, based on the response, could continue if state officials can agree on how to run it.
A bipartisan group of state legislators announced – just before budget talks officially start in Harrisburg – they’ll co-sponsor forthcoming legislation creating the PA Home Preservation Program.

https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/31epHPP-web-audio.mp3
 
Gov. Josh Shapiro’s proposed budget allocates $50 million for the program.
It took mere months to spend four times that amount through the similarly-focused Whole Home Repair Program.
The WHRP diverted $125 million to financing weatherization, plumbing and other essential improvements to thousands of residential units across the state starting last September, according to the state Department of Community and Economic Development.
And more 18,000 applicants, combined, were left on waitlists kept by pass-through agencies, according to the planned bill’s co-sponsorship memo.
Lawmakers used a one-time federal infusion from the American Rescue Plan to create the WHRP. 
Program requirements limited homeowners to those making no more than 80 percent of median area household income. Landlords couldn’t own more than five properties and 15 affordable units across all properties. And it capped project costs at $50,000 per unit.
State officials view the WHRP as a pilot for the proposed PA Home Preservation program that’s intended to be more permanent.
“It is not easy to sort of do all this coordination, build out relationships with contractors, … [and] sub-grantees,” said DCED Secretary Rick Siger during the agency’s budget hearing earlier this year. “But we have a path now…informed by, frankly, just learning a bunch of stuff as we ran Whole Home Repair.”
The new initiative likely would have income limits for homeowner recipients and prioritize senior citizens, according to prime sponsor Rep. Lindsay Powell, D-Pittsburgh.
Other than that, few details have been hashed out, Powell said Friday.
But one would be an effort to keep program guidelines as consistent as possible, she said. She cited constantly changing expectations and reporting requirements as a major challenge during her time on Pittsburgh’s Urban Redevelopment Authority Board.

Siger, Powell and others have pointed to the age of Pennsylvania’s housing stock as another reason to invest in renovation and rehabilitation, with nearly 60 percent of homes statewide dating back to before 1970.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Shamokin3-1024x742.jpeg,,,2025-06-02 06:00:17.622397

(Photos by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Few Rhode Islanders think they are better off financially so far in 2025 compared to last year — and not many think Gov. Dan McKee is doing a good job, according to new polling from the University of New Hampshire (UNH).
The latest Ocean State poll found only 15% of 653 Rhode Island residents surveyed between May 22 and 26 believed they were doing better than in 2024. Another 40% said their finances were the same, while only 45% believed they were doing worse.
UNH’s poll has a 3.8% margin of error. 
The top reason for financial concern was an expectation of higher prices and inflation, which was cited by 87% of those who believe they will be worse off by 2026. Rhode Islanders polled also remained pessimistic about making future investments, with only a quarter of respondents saying now is a good time to play the stock market.
Only 19% said they felt that now is a good time to look for a new job.
UNH’s economic survey comes just a day after releasing a poll showing 19% of respondents approved of McKee’s job performance — a drop of 10 points from a year ago. It’s an even sharper drop from a Morning Consult poll released in mid-April, which gave McKee a 43% approval rating and the fourth-highest disapproval rating among the nation’s 50 governors. 
About 74% of the Rhode Islanders polled by UNH  said the governor should not run for reelection in 2026. That includes 60% of Democrats surveyed.
McKee made his re-election bid official in March and remains the only candidate to officially throw his hat in the ring. But a significant chunk of those polled may be interested in seeing former CVS executive Helena Buonanno Foulkes run again. She lost to McKee by 3 percentage points in a five-way Democratic gubernatorial primary in September 2022.
UNH’s poll found that 32% of respondents want Foulkes to enter the 2026 race.
Foulkes’ campaign manager, Jon Romano, celebrated the survey.
“What this poll reveals is what Helena is hearing in every corner of our state: Rhode Islanders know the current system has failed them, they’re dissatisfied with state leadership and the direction of our state, and they’re demanding the kind of meaningful change that will finally put their needs first,” Romano said in an emailed statement.
McKee campaign spokesperson Mike Trainor declined to comment on UNH’s poll. But the governor has proudly proclaimed the state has improved under his tenure, citing Rhode Island’s 24th overall spot in the latest U.S. News & World Report “Best States” ranking — a 10-spot jump since the governor ascended to the job in 2021.
The ranking specifically had Rhode Island’s economy climbing 12 places from 28 to 16 between 2021 and 2025. Rhode Island is currently ranked #8 in the “Business Environment” subcategory, up one from 2024. In the past year alone, the state jumped 18 places to reach #14 in the “Growth” subcategory.
Another 23% of those polled by UNH are open to former Republican candidate Ashley Kalus running again, while 19% are open to former Democratic Gov. Gina Raimondo returning to the State House.
President Trump’s job approval in Rhode Island fell slightly. The latest poll had 37% approving and 61% disapproving of his job as president with 2% unsure. That’s down from 40% approving and 59% disapproving with 1% unsure a year ago.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Liam Niemeyer)A federal award funding a collaboration between Kentucky’s largest utility, the University of Kentucky and other partners to implement a new system capturing greenhouse gas emissions is among two dozen energy-related awards the Trump administration terminated last week.
The $72 million award terminated by the U.S. Department of Energy funded the testing of a carbon capture system on a natural gas-fired turbine operated by electric utility Louisville Gas and Electric and Kentucky Utilities at its Cane Run Generating Station in Jefferson County. 
Carbon capture refers to technologies that seek to reduce climate-warming carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels by capturing and storing carbon dioxide before it’s released into the atmosphere. The utility described the project last year as an “important step in assessing the future viability” of carbon capture technology for natural gas-fired power plants. LG&E and KU, which serves more than 1 million customers in the state, would have captured a portion of carbon dioxide emissions to be potentially reused by a nearby manufacturer, according to a press release. 
Liz Pratt, a LG&E and KU spokesperson, in a statement said the utility was “disappointed” the award was terminated but remained “focused on driving innovation and important research and development in this space.” 
“​​Together with our project partners, we will review our options for advancing this important research project,” Pratt said. 
Among the other awards terminated Friday by the DOE included a number of other carbon capture and storage projects and a project by multinational alcoholic beverage company Diageo that sought to add batteries to decarbonize production facilities including in Shelbyville, Kentucky. 
U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright in a Friday statement said canceling the approximately $3.7 billion in total awards was “in the best interest” of Americans. 
“While the previous administration failed to conduct a thorough financial review before signing away billions of taxpayer dollars, the Trump administration is doing our due diligence to ensure we are utilizing taxpayer dollars to strengthen our national security, bolster affordable, reliable energy sources and advance projects that generate the highest possible return on investment,” Wright said in a statement. 
Investment into carbon capture systems played a large role in the energy policy of the former Biden administration, which sought to require utilities with coal-fired power plants operating past 2039 to capture 90% of carbon dioxide emissions from the plants or have those plants retire by 2032. That carbon capture requirement also applied to new natural gas-fired power plants. The Trump administration has swiftly reversed course, reportedly planning to eliminate any caps on greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired and natural gas-fired power plants. 
Supporters of carbon capture technologies generally say it’s necessary in transitioning to clean energy and addressing industries that are hard to decarbonize, while skeptics, including environmentalists, question whether the technologies will allow for the further burning of fossil fuels. 
Byron Gary, an attorney with the environmental legal organization Kentucky Resources Council, told the Lantern the award termination fits into the Trump administration’s “broader strategy” of “trying to undermine climate regulation.” 
E&E News reported Friday that the Trump administration is expected to argue the U.S. power sector, a major contributor of greenhouse gas emissions, doesn’t contribute “significantly” to climate change. 
Gary said while his organization would rather see investment into zero-emission renewable energy paired with utility-scale batteries, the award terminations appear to ensure carbon capture technology isn’t a “viable option” for the future.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_1095-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-02 06:00:17.622397

More legislatures in Republican-led states are passing paid parental leave for public employees. (Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images)More Republican-led states are giving paid parental leave to public school teachers and other state employees, signaling a broader acceptance of family-friendly workplace policies once championed primarily by Democrats.
“All of these red states, I think we’re late to the party,” said South Carolina state Rep. Beth Bernstein, a Democrat who sponsored a bill this year to increase state employees’ paid parental leave from six to 12 weeks. It passed the majority-Republican South Carolina House in April with strong bipartisan support.
This year, Alabama, Iowa and Mississippi joined 37 other states in granting paid parental leave to thousands of state workers.
The trend has gathered steam in recent years. Some experts link it to the cascade of state abortion bans that followed the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2022 Dobbs decision, which dismantled the federal right to abortion. Under fire from critics to do more to care for babies once they’re born, at least a dozen conservative-led states with abortion bans have since granted or expanded paid parental leave for their state employees.
But others say the increasing bipartisan support for measures that help working parents is also a reaction to economic realities.
“What we’ve seen, especially in more conservative states, is the public sector has experienced a lot of turnover,” said Kameron Dawson, legal director of the Southern Office of A Better Balance, a legal organization focused on workplace rights. “They’re looking for tools to recruit younger employees.”
Paid parental leave is the time off granted to workers for the birth or adoption of a baby, to care for a child, or to recover from a stillbirth or miscarriage. Without it, employees are left to cobble together their sick leave and vacation leave — or go unpaid — to stay home with a child and heal.










We’re trying to attract and retain state employees and teachers, and we’re in competition with everyone around us, and the private sector as well.


– Alabama Republican state Rep. Ginny Shaver




Alabama Republican state Rep. Ginny Shaver watched her daughter, a public school teacher, struggle to get the leave she needed after the births of her children in recent years.

“With her second, she had complications in her pregnancy and used up her [paid vacation and sick] leave before she even had the baby,” Shaver told Stateline. Her daughter contracted COVID-19, and the baby had to spend time in neonatal intensive care. “It was a very difficult time, and she had to take unpaid leave.”
Last year, Shaver and Democratic state Sen. Vivian Figures worked to win approval of a paid parental leave bill for state employees. It failed.
But they tried again this year. With the support of Republican Gov. Kay Ivey, the state legislature — which has a Republican supermajority — passed it nearly unanimously. The new law gives female state employees, including teachers, eight weeks of paid parental leave in connection with birth, stillbirth or miscarriage, and gives male employees two weeks. Adoptive parents get eight weeks for one parent and two for the other.
Shaver said she thinks the law passed thanks to vocal support from the governor and increased awareness of the issue due to the work she and Figures did in previous sessions.
“And the fact that all of the southeast states around us offered it,” Shaver said. “We’re trying to attract and retain state employees and teachers, and we’re in competition with everyone around us, and the private sector as well.”
 Keeping talent

For many Republicans, the workforce development argument for paid leave is a persuasive one. For states such as Alabama and South Carolina that have some of the lowest workforce participation rates in the nation, paid leave can be a tool to keep more people — particularly women — working. And it can be a way to retain educators as many states struggle with teacher shortages in K-12 schools.
“For several years we’ve seen state legislatures acknowledging the importance of child care to businesses and the economy,” said Feroza Freeland, policy director at the Southern Office of A Better Balance. “But in the last few years, we’ve seen a growing recognition that paid leave is another piece of that puzzle.”

States have taken up the issue because the federal government has not. The United States is a global outlier; among 38 peer nations, it’s the only one that doesn’t mandate paid parental leave, according to the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development. The group comprises 38 democracies with market-based economies.
The federal Family and Medical Leave Act, passed in 1993 and extended in 2020, only requires public agencies and companies with at least 50 employees to give up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for parents of newborns or newly adopted children, or caregivers of sick family members.
 GOP support

During his first term, President Donald Trump publicly supported some forms of paid family leave and signed a defense bill that gives 12 weeks of paid parental leave to most federal employees.
Paid family leave was a signature issue for his daughter Ivanka Trump, at the time a senior adviser to the president. She even held a paid leave and child care summit at the White House in late 2019.
That set the stage for other Republicans to take up the issue more publicly. And after the Dobbs decision, family-friendly policies have increasingly become conservative talking points in states with restrictive abortion laws.
After the Mississippi House unanimously passed a paid parental leave bill earlier this year, Republican House Speaker Jason White celebrated the bill as a reflection of Mississippi’s status as a “pro-life state.”
In a post on X this week announcing her signing of a new paid parental leave law, Iowa Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds called Iowa “a pro-family state.”
North Carolina was one of the first Southern states to grant paid parental leave to state workers in 2019 when then-Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, signed an executive order. In 2023, several months after the Dobbs decision, the state’s majority-Republican legislature extended paid parental leave to public school employees by tacking it onto a law banning most abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy.
Meanwhile, Indiana Republican Gov. Mike Braun signed an executive order in March to add up to eight additional weeks of paid leave for “childbirth recovery” to the state’s existing four weeks of paid parental leave.
 Running the gamut

The new laws won’t apply to most residents, because they only cover state employees. But they could have a downstream effect.
Shaver, the Alabama lawmaker, said she hopes her state’s new law will not only help the state be competitive with the private sector, but also set a precedent for other employers to follow.
“I hope they will see it’s in their benefit to offer what they can,” she said. “It may not be eight or 12 weeks, but even offering a reduced or flexible work schedule can help families.”
Just over a quarter of private-sector workers have access to paid family leave through their employer as of March 2023, according the most recent data from the U.S. Department of Labor.
Among the lowest-wage earners, that share drops to 6%.

State paid leave programs run the gamut in terms of what they offer. While Alabama’s new law offers up to eight weeks of leave for all state employees, including teachers, Mississippi’s offers six and does not require public schools to offer paid parental leave to their employees.
Iowa’s new law grants four weeks of paid leave for the birth or adoption of a child and one week of paid paternity leave. Tennessee’s law, passed in 2023, only offers paid leave to workers in the state’s executive and judicial branches.
But a few states are already expanding their offerings: Last year, Georgia legislators voted to double paid parental leave from three to six weeks.
And some states have gone further than just state employees: 13 states and the District of Columbia have mandated paid family leave for all workers, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center. Most of those states are located in New England or on the West Coast and all are Democratic-led. Ten more offer voluntary paid family leave statewide that’s provided through private insurance.
 Sandwich generation

Experts say the shift in attitude toward family-friendly policies can also be attributed to a generational shift.
“A lot of younger lawmakers are more willing to champion the issue of paid leave,” said Freeland, of A Better Balance. “They’re understanding it because they’re seeing it in their own lives, or seeing friends and family members going through this.”
In South Carolina, Bernstein’s bill faced some opposition from members of the state’s ultra-conservative Freedom Caucus and Family Caucus. Some lawmakers questioned the potential costs of the bill, or criticized it as government overreach.
South Carolina Republican state Rep. Josiah Magnuson, a member of the Freedom Caucus, said he believed the bill would be a financial burden on public school districts that could lead to raised taxes.
“You’re saying, let’s tax the people of South Carolina, most of whom don’t get paid parental leave, and give them to state employees who already have six weeks’ paid parental leave,” Magnuson told lawmakers in April before the House voted to pass the bill.
He also said he doesn’t like that the increased paid leave “puts the foot in the door a little more for the government to be involved in the home.”
The opposition frustrated Bernstein, who pointed out that the state’s 2022 law that granted six weeks of paid parental leave passed the legislature almost unanimously. This year’s bill expanding that leave passed the House but hasn’t seen movement in the Senate. It can be picked up again when the legislature returns in January.
Other South Carolina Republicans backed the bill, citing their own families’ experiences following the birth of their children, reported the South Carolina Daily Gazette.
More conservative states are also responding to the needs of “sandwich generation” employees who may be caring for aging parents as well as children, Freeland said.
Earlier this year, Tennessee became the first Southern state to expand its state paid leave policy beyond just parental leave. The state legislature voted almost unanimously to extend its six-week paid leave policy to cover state workers providing end-of-life care to a family member.
“We’re seeing a growing recognition that people need support for these types of family or caregiving needs,” said Freeland, “and that it strengthens the workforce and economy to be able to provide that.”

(Photo courtesy of Aqeela Sherrills)Community-based violence intervention programs nationwide have long worked alongside law enforcement officers to deescalate conflict, prevent retaliatory shootings and, in some cases, arrive at crime scenes before police do.
In many communities, these initiatives have been credited with saving lives and reducing violence.
But the Trump administration last month abruptly terminated at least 373 public safety grants from the U.S. Department of Justice’s Office of Justice Programs, pulling roughly $500 million in remaining funds across a range of programs, according to a new report by the Council on Criminal Justice, a nonprofit think tank. The cuts come just as summer is approaching — a season when violence consistently peaks.
The grants were initially valued at $820 million, but many were multiyear awards at different stages of rollout, which means some of the money has already been spent.
At least 554 organizations across 48 states are affected by the cuts, many of them small, community-based nonprofits that rely on this money. The rescinded grants supported everything from violence prevention and policing to victim advocacy, reentry services, research, and mental health and substance use treatment. Some of the grants also were cut from state and local government agencies.
Another new report from the Council on Criminal Justice dug deeper into local effects: It found that the Trump administration’s cuts also eliminated 473 mini-grants — known as “subawards” — passed from primary recipients to smaller groups that often face challenges accessing federal dollars directly, such as rural government agencies and grassroots nonprofits.
About $5 million of those subawards was intended for state, local and tribal law enforcement agencies working to reduce violence in rural areas, according to the report.
Experts warn the timing couldn’t be worse. The summer months — historically linked to higher rates of violent crimes — are approaching, and the safety net in many cities is fraying. A growing body of research has found a correlation between spikes in temperature and violent crime, with studies suggesting that heat waves and sudden weather swings can inflame tensions and increase aggression.
“These programs are having to cut staff and cut services, and that will be felt in communities in states all over the country at exactly the time when they’re most needed,” said Amy Solomon, a senior fellow at the Council on Criminal Justice and the lead author of the report.
Solomon also previously served as assistant U.S. attorney general in the Biden administration, where she led the Office of Justice Programs — the Justice Department’s largest grantmaking agency.
Many of the primary grants that were terminated contained no references to race, gender or diversity-related language, according to the report — despite claims from federal officials that such criteria were driving the cuts. Primary grant recipients received their funding from the feds directly.
‘Wasteful grants’
U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi defended the cuts in a late April post on X, stating that the department has cut “millions of dollars in wasteful grants.” She also signaled that additional cuts may be on the way. In her post, she specifically cited grants that supported LGBTQ+ liaison services in police departments and programs providing gender-affirming care and housing for incarcerated transgender people.
The Department of Justice’s cuts come amid a broader push by the Trump administration and the newly created Department of Government Efficiency to pull funding from a range of federal programs — a move they say is aimed at reducing spending and saving taxpayer dollars.
For some groups, the sudden withdrawal of funds has meant scaling back crime victim services or pulling out of some neighborhoods altogether.
Community violence prevention groups aim to stop shootings and other forms of violence before they happen by working directly with those most at risk. Staff — often with experience in the justice system — mediate conflicts, respond to crises, and connect people to support such as counseling or job training. In some cities, they’re dispatched to high-risk areas to deescalate tensions, often before police arrive.
And research shows that community-level violence prevention programs can contribute to drops in crime.
After a historic surge in homicides in 2020, violent crime in the United States dropped in 2024 to pre-pandemic levels — or even lower — in many cities. Preliminary 2025 data suggests that the downward trend is continuing in major cities, including Baltimore, Houston, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C.
But the progress hasn’t reached every community. Some neighborhoods are still grappling with high rates of gun violence and car theft.
Organizations that faced the toughest financial cuts had been funded through the U.S. Department of Justice’s Community Based Violence Intervention and Prevention Initiative — the federal government’s primary mechanism for supporting this work.
Since the program’s launch in 2022, the federal Office of Justice Programs has invested about $300 million in community violence intervention efforts and related research. But nearly half of that funding has now been wiped out, according to the Council on Criminal Justice report.
“It’s really unprecedented to see these kinds of grants cut midstream,” Solomon told Stateline. “This was an effort that had bipartisan support [in Congress] and in the field all across the country.”
Impact on communities nationwide
In late April, Aqeela Sherrills received a letter from the federal Justice Department terminating a $3.5 million grant that supported the Community-Based Public Safety Collective. Sherrills is the co-founder and executive director of the national organization, which focuses on community-led approaches to preventing violence, including mediating conflicts, building relationships in high-risk neighborhoods and connecting people to resources such as housing, mental health care and job training.
The letter said the organization’s efforts no longer aligned with the federal Justice Department’s priorities, which include supporting “certain law enforcement operations, combatting violent crime, protecting American children, and supporting American victims of trafficking and sexual assault.”
Until the end of April, the collective had an agreement with the Justice Department to provide training and technical assistance to 95 local groups — including community groups, police departments, city and county governments, and state agencies — that had each been awarded $2 million over three years to run community violence intervention programs.










We're bracing for what could potentially be a high-violence summer.


– Aqeela Sherrills, co-founder and CEO of the Community-Based Public Safety Collective


But after the department cut $3.5 million, the Community-Based Public Safety Collective was forced to lay off 20 staff members.
“Without the significant funding … it destabilizes the organizations. People’s ability to be able to provide for themselves and their family is at risk,” Sherrills said in an interview. “We’re bracing for what could potentially be a high-violence summer.”
The deepest funding cuts hit states led by both Republican and Democratic governors, including California, Florida, Illinois, Kentucky, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Virginia and Washington.
About $145 million in violence intervention funding was rescinded overall, along with an additional $8.6 million for related research and evaluation efforts, according to the Council on Criminal Justice report.
Some of the canceled grants funded studies and research on forensics, policing, corrections issues and behavioral health. Now, those projects may be left unfinished.
Some of the largest losses hit intermediary organizations, such as the Community-Based Public Safety Collective, that support smaller programs by providing microgrants, training and technical assistance.
For organizations such as the Newark Community Street Team in New Jersey, the loss of federal funding has left some areas of the city without coverage.
The funding had allowed staff to monitor neighborhoods and engage directly with community members to prevent violence. That included weekly community walks, where team members connected with victims of crime and people who may have witnessed violence, linking them to resources such as counseling or legal aid. The team also operates a hotline where residents can report crimes or alert staff to tensions that might escalate — allowing the team to step in before violence occurred.
Some of the lost funding also supported school-based initiatives, where mediators helped students resolve conflicts before they escalated into fights or other forms of violence.
Of the 15 Newark positions affected by the cuts, four employees were reassigned to other departments; the others were let go. Some of the team’s staff members are formerly incarcerated, a vital trait that helps them connect with residents and build trust in communities that are often wary of traditional law enforcement.
“We just have to continue working and serving our community the best we can,” said Rey Chavis, the executive director of the street team.
That work appears to be contributing to a decrease in the community’s crime rates.
City crime data from Jan. 1 to April 30, 2025, shows a significant drop in violent crime in Newark compared with the same period in 2024. The total number of violent crimes reported to police fell by 49%, driven largely by a 68% decrease in robberies, according to Stateline’s analysis of the data. Homicides dropped by 53%, while aggravated assaults declined by 43%. Rapes dropped slightly by 3%.

(Photo courtesy of James Johnson)As more states reckon with the history of Black land loss, the Virginia General Assembly has been taking a rare, state-sanctioned approach: formally examining how the creation or expansion of public university campuses has displaced Black communities.
A 19-member legislative commission met last month, its first convening since a mandatory hiatus during the 2025 legislative session was lifted. Enacted last year, the commission received an additional $200,000 in the state budget signed by Gov. Glenn Youngkin in May, a major bump from the $28,760 it was initially allocated. As it prepares to enter its second year, the group is poised to deliver Virginia’s only known comprehensive statewide examination to date of how public universities displaced Black communities — and what forms of redress may be appropriate. 
In Newport News, a separate task force has also been working since last year to address the displacement of a once-thriving Black neighborhood that was usurped to make way for Christopher Newport University. The neighborhood, enclosed by Shoe Lane and three other streets, was home to several generations of families who were forced to move when an all-white city council voted to seize a large portion of the area through eminent domain in the 1960s, paving the way for the school’s construction. The university’s expansion over time led to the acquisition of remaining homes. Today, only five remain. 
The local response to probe this history, running parallel to the state-level work, is led by the city and university and has laid bare ongoing tensions among some impacted residents of the neighborhood and their descendants. The community members have raised integrity questions about the task force’s work, and frustrations remain high for some who say they are still waiting for the impact of their displacement to be fully acknowledged and addressed. 
“We’ve done this before, time and time again,” said Angela Mickel, one of several attendees of a March documentary screening and discussion on Black community displacement, who expressed frustration towards public officials over long-term inaction on the issue. Like others in attendance, Mickel said she felt formal recognition of the community’s complete loss was long overdue.
“We have many stories that we need to tell, and Newport News needs to reconcile with its own history.”

 Mapping ‘a pathway toward healing and repair’

While Virginia’s state commission and the Newport News task force have indicated that engagement with impacted residents will be critical to their work, both are still navigating how best to do so.
At the state level, the legislative commission has created a subcommittee focused on African American displacement in Virginia. When they reconvened in May, members adopted a formal work plan outlining how the commission will gather input from those directly affected by university expansion. That could include in-person public hearings, virtual comment periods, or an online platform for submitting written testimony.
“This particular work is pivotal to the work of the committee,” said Del. Karen Keys-Gamarra, D-Fairfax, who suggested that outside experts — not legislators themselves — take the lead on organizing and facilitating community engagement. “I would not assume that the legislators would be responsible for that … that would speak to the level of integrity of the work that comes out of that committee.”
All four subcommittees — tasked with conducting research, liaising with universities, documenting community displacement, and exploring forms of relief — have meetings scheduled through the summer and fall, with the goal of presenting recommendations for the full commission to consider ahead of the 2026 legislative session.
Commission Chair Del. Delores McQuinn, D-Richmond, expressed optimism about the direction of the work, particularly with the additional funding recently approved by the General Assembly.
“We are moving in the direction of and the process of acknowledging history, and listening to those who have been impacted, and seeking a pathway toward healing and repair,” she said.

A date for a public forum is still being determined in Newport News, where the city-university task force formed in April 2024 has faced criticism over limited transparency and slow outreach — largely due to lack of public access to its meetings and sporadic updates on its progress.
The task force has said outreach to families is ongoing, though members have also acknowledged that coordinating those meetings has taken longer than expected.
In a February city council work session, as members raised questions about the task force’s outreach efforts, the group’s co-chair, Vice Mayor Curtis Bethany, said the group wanted to prepare before beginning “full-blown” outreach, calling the issue “extremely sensitive” and noting task force members didn’t want to approach the community with a “half-baked pie.”
Public remarks from at least one task force member have indicated that the impending public meeting would involve gathering community feedback. 
“We want to get the input from the citizens, from the families that lived on Shoe Lane, and from other families that grew up in Newport News,” said task force member Councilman Cleon Long at the March event.

 Virginia mirrors a nationwide pattern of Black displacement 

As Newport News formally examines the impact of university expansion on Black families, stories of similar displacement are reemerging from other parts of the state.
Adrienne Jackson-Franklin said her father, Otis, was young when her grandparents were among those forced to relocate when Longwood University in Farmville expanded into a bordering Black community in the mid-20th century. Former residents and locals in the area recall that the university cleared community blocks in phases to build dorms and academic buildings, displacing many families by threatening or using eminent domain.
“You lose friends, you lose connections, you now have to rebuild, and it’s almost like starting over,” Jackson said. She told the Virginia Mercury that she’d be willing to speak with the commission and believes it’s important that the state group address generational “deep-seated trauma” that may exist among families impacted by the displacement.

Lamberts Point, a once-thriving middle-class Black community in Hampton Roads, was partially razed in the 1960s and ’70s to make way for a branch campus of the college of William & Mary — now the main campus of Old Dominion University (ODU) in Norfolk. Thomas Harris, a longtime resident who moved to the area in the 1970s, said he has worked with remaining neighbors to address the continuing impacts of the expansion.
“I think they should have a whole lot to say about it,” Harris said of displaced families. “It tore up their homes. It tore up their families—they had to leave and go somewhere else to start all over again.” 
Longwood and Old Dominion have both said they have worked to improve relationships with communities impacted by their expansion.
Longwood pledged to end its use of eminent domain for campus expansion in 2004, according to a spokesperson. ODU offers financial support for Lamberts Point residents admitted to the university, including scholarships either specifically for neighborhood residents or those that prioritize them.
Across the country, efforts to reckon with university-led displacement of communities of color vary. Davarian Baldwin, a historian and urban studies scholar, said Virginia’s statewide investigation stands out nationally as few other states have sanctioned similar examining bodies.
“In my research I haven’t heard of another one,” Baldwin said. “There could be commissions in almost every state in the union (but) a reparations commission around urban renewal is singular.” Baldwin co-founded the Renewal Project, a national network launched in 2022 to support local responses to campus-related displacement, including efforts in states like Kentucky and Colorado.

In both states, impacted residents are directly involved to some degree in reconciliation efforts. Descendants of the displaced Jonesville community in south Kentucky sit on a reconciliation workgroup led by Western Kentucky University in Bowling Green, which was established in 2022 to identify ways to address the lasting impacts of the neighborhood’s destruction in the 1960s.
In Denver, descendants of a Latino community displaced from the former Auraria neighborhood in the 1970s hold the majority of seats on a nine-member council formed last year comprising representatives from several universities involved in the original displacement, including the University of Colorado Denver. The council oversees the future use of homes and a church that were saved from demolition, now part of a historic park.
 What’s next

The months ahead may bring key developments in both the state and local investigation.
In addition to the impending public forum, members of the Newport News task force have publicly said a website could launch this spring or summer to make their research findings publicly accessible.
At the May meeting, the commission was still working to acquire responses to a survey it distributed this winter to most of the state’s 45 public institutions of higher education listed by the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia (SCHEV). The survey included several questions about campus expansion, including queries on schools’ knowledge of displacement in Black communities. The Virginia Mercury polled the 15 four-year public institutions and 23 community colleges on that list. A majority said they had responded or planned to respond to the commission’s survey, including Christopher Newport, Longwood and Old Dominion University.  
McQuinn said she expects the additional funding received from the amended budget will allow the commission to bring in more resources which could support the subcommittees work including hiring consultants or, if needed, project managers.
“One of the reasons that we were not able to make as much progress as I think we needed to make was because there was limited funds,” McQuinn said.
“The additional dollars are going to be essential in us feeling that the outcome (is) something that is worthy of the community.”



Davarian Baldwin, a historian and urban studies scholar, outlined figurative and tangible acts of repair universities, the state and localities could enact as they address the long-term impact of Black community displacement statewide. 

Repair for property-impacted residents could take structural forms such as: direct payments to affected families; scholarships for descendants of those displaced; community development initiatives like affordable housing and community centers; and Community Benefit Agreements ensuring job training and procuring contracts from small businesses.
Given that universities are often property tax-exempt, an alternative approach could involve redirecting Payments in Lieu of Taxes (PILT) directly to affected communities rather than the city.
Commemorative efforts could include integrating the community’s history into university curricula; placing historical markers; renaming buildings; and other forms of public recognition that acknowledge the past while fostering ongoing community engagement.

Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods / Virginia MercuryAmid federal and state funding cuts, freezes and delayed payments, the outlook is grim for free clinics in Virginia that have had to trim or halt some services, but there is hope, Health Brigade executive director Karen Legato said Thursday evening. 
“Care is resistance,” she reiterated during a speech outside of the clinic’s Thompson Street location in Richmond. 
Having first opened in 1970 as the Fan Free Clinic, what is now known as Health Brigade was the first free clinic established in Virginia. It is one of about 70 free clinics currently in the state that provide care to uninsured or underinsured people.
The Thursday gathering brought workers, volunteers, supporters and patients of several Richmond-area free clinics together for a town hall to express concerns and frustrations and to brainstorm ways to keep doors open and patients served. 
Before her calls to action, Legato shared that Health Brigade alone has lost $1.8 million in state and federal funding over the past year. Programs that have taken a hit include ones that offer HIV/AIDS treatment and testing for diseases like Hepatitis C and Tuberculosis, as well as a clean syringe program that also provides naloxone kits — the medication that reverses opioid overdoses. 
“We are witnessing the largest cut in the health care safety net that’s ever been made,” Legato said.
What happens to Medicaid in Virginia if massive federal bill to slash billions becomes law?

In March, President Donald Trump’s administration announced it was planning to pull back $11.4 billion in COVID-19-related funds for state and local public health departments. Virginia’s Department of Health had to prematurely end three such grants, resulting in a loss of $219 million and about 500 employees, according to a Freedom of Information Act request filed by The Mercury. 
Among the crowd was Del. Rodney Willett, D-Henrico, and a staff member representing Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Chesterfield. Hashmi serves as the chair of the Senate’s Education and Health committee while Willett had carried a budget amendment hoping to boost funding for Virgnia’s free clinics that did not survive legislators’ negotiations. 
Both lawmakers have noted that they’re monitoring how federal actions are affecting Virginia. Willett said last week the state legislature could reconvene for a special session later this year — particularly if Congress and Trump achieve the steep cuts in federal Medicaid funding GOP lawmakers are pursuing as part of a “big, beautiful bill” designed to shave trillions from the country’s budget. The measure has already passed the U.S. House of Representatives and will be debated in the U.S. Senate this summer. 


Federal fallout

	
As federal funding and systems dwindle, states are left to decide how and
whether to make up the difference.
Read the latest > 


At Thursday’s town hall, some speakers recalled that Gov. Glenn Youngkin held back $900 million of Virginia’s budget surplus pending federal government actions, and posited that some of that funding could bolster Virginia’s free clinics or help support any federal Medicaid losses. Meanwhile about $1 billion is earmarked in the state budget for tax relief to Virginians — resulting in $200 for individuals or $400 for joint filers. While that cash could be beneficial to families in the short term, Legato said that money could be better spent investing in public health. 
“While we’re gutting this safety net, we’re worried about getting some chump change back to people in Virginia. I think it’s disgusting,” Legato said. 
Youngkin carves out $900 million as Virginia prepares for Trump-era uncertainty

Her organization reached out to the Youngkin administration in recent weeks, she said, to nudge the state government about $300,000 in reimbursement payments it owes the clinic. She added that Health Brigade almost couldn’t make payroll earlier in May. 
“Some of the struggle we have had in the past year … is when you’re having grants from the state … the safety net has to finance the state services until you get paid from the state.” 
A Youngkin spokesman didn’t respond to request for comment by press time.
As Health Brigade handles several public health services, it  fronts the cost for testing and treatment and then seeks repayment from the state. 
“When we run out of cash because we’re waiting for the state to pay, we have to go to a line of credit to float us until those payments come in,” she said  “What that means for us is that our line of credit bottoms out. So we’re at $500,000 on our line of credit right now. We can’t get any more.”
Other speakers included representatives from neighboring clinics, like CrossOver, which has lost $935,000, and Daily Planet, which is facing $1.3 million in cuts from federal grants and state-administered payments. 
In recent days, Daily Planet learned that federal funding for its “Every Woman’s Life” cancer screening program has been frozen, Dr. Patricia Cook, a chief medical officer, said. The program is meant to help uninsured and underinsured people catch breast or reproductive organ cancers early on. 
Detecting and treating illnesses early is something that Dr. Jeffry Reihl, an emergency medicine doctor, said is paramount to avoiding costly ER overflows and poorer health outcomes. 
“I feel that this is going to flood our emergency departments with more and more patients who are sicker because they haven’t gotten care as an outpatient they should have gotten,” he said. “It’s just going to make an overburdened system even more overburdened.”
McClellan, Virginia Democrats warn of dire impact to state if proposed Medicaid cuts materialize

His argument echoes that of U.S. Rep. Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond, who has recently cautioned her congressional colleagues against cutting Medicaid. Without preventative care within reach, people will likely flood emergency rooms when they need care, McClellan said at a press conference last month. As hospitals are federally-required to provide care, uninsured patients who cannot pay can become a shared financial burden on taxpayers.
 “These cuts are impacting multiple nonprofit health clinics, public health departments, hospitals and medical providers across the state,” Legato said Thursday as she connected the dots between how state and federal funding helps local health care providers serve the public. “We are now on the verge of the feds taking a chainsaw to Medicaid, which will exacerbate the crisis of access to primary care for low-income residents and vulnerable community members.”
To counter the current losses, Health Brigade plans to put the building it owns up for sale. It will lease space to operate from the future owner while it secures a new location down the line, she said. 
The organization also plans to host future town halls with other local health partners to discuss intersectional health issues like housing and homelessness, and to make calls to action for fundraising. 
“Now is the time for courage, creativity and turning caring into action,” Legato said.

The Sheriff’s Office asserts that deputies are simply patrolling more vigorously where serious crimes, historically, have occurred in the county.
“We are not stopping vehicles nor doing searches on the basis of ethnicity,” Tom Julia, spokesman for the Loudoun County Sheriff’s Office, said flatly, rejecting allegations of racial profiling. “We completely disagree that it’s targeting of any group.”
Julia made convincing arguments.
It’s understandable that concerns have arisen, however, because of longtime Sheriff Mike Chapman’s well-known, boisterous attacks against illegal immigration and its impacts nationwide. The elected Republican has frequently testified before congressional committees on the subject, often invited because of his leadership role in the National Sheriffs’ Association.
That means you can’t consider his law-enforcement initiatives in Loudoun in a vacuum.
“Over the past four years, the United States has seen an unmitigated flow of undocumented and criminal aliens enter this country with many localities throughout the United States encouraging their sanctuary despite minimal, if not a total lack of proper vetting,” he testified in December.
That was just a month after Donald Trump, who has demagogued the issue repeatedly – often in racial or xenophobic terms – was elected a second time to the presidency.
A new report from the Center for Migration Studies found that there were 12.2 million undocumented immigrants in the U.S. in 2023, using the most recent U.S. Census Bureau data available. 
About a year ago, Chapman noted hyperbolically on his LinkedIn  account: “We are all border states now, and the failure of this (Biden) Administration to slow the influx of undocumented immigrants has put all of us at risk.” He’d just testified at a U.S. House of Representatives subcommittee hearing.
This is the backdrop in which the traffic stops in Loudoun are playing out. With 443,000 people, it’s one of Virginia’s largest localities. The stops have gained attention following the release of department statistics to the Board of Supervisors there. Loudoun Now recently reported on the issue.
From Jan. 1-March 31, deputies stopped white motorists 3,343 times and Latino motorists 1,194 times. White residents comprise 51% of the population, and Latinos about 14%, according to census figures.
The numbers of stops by deputies were up noticeably for both races from the same period in 2024 – especially for whites. (Of course, not all motorists stopped by deputies were county residents.)
More striking, though, is the number of searches for these subgroups: Deputies searched whites 31 times in the first three months of 2025, compared to 90 for Latinos. The numbers for the same period last year were 13 and 15, respectively.
Activists and residents have decried the disproportionate number of searches affecting Latinos and questioned whether they’re being singled out – possibly for undue suspicion of being undocumented immigrants.
“Even though white and Hispanic residents are getting ticketed at traffic stops at about the same rate, Hispanic residents are eight times more likely to have their vehicle searched than white residents. This is clear racial profiling,” Sarah Pace said at a recent Board of Supervisors meeting. 
“When 14% of the population accounts for 55% of all traffic stop searches, this isn’t about crime prevention. It’s blatant targeting of an already vulnerable and hard-working community,” Heather Gottlieb, a New Virginia Majority member, said in a recent news release. The organization focuses on working-class communities of color across the state.
I interviewed Sofia Saiyed, campaign director for the group’s Loudoun and western Fairfax chapter. She told me organization members say there’s a significantly heavier presence of deputies in the community, moreso than before.
“We’re also in an environment in which the presidential administration is making anti-immigrant statements and deportation stunts,” Saiyed said. “The concern that we have is that Sheriff Chapman has been very public and vocal about his alignment with Trump’s anti-immigration agenda.”
As several nonprofit officials pointed out, Gov. Glenn Youngkin also signed an executive order in February deputizing the Virginia State Police to help identify and arrest criminal undocumented immigrants “who pose a risk to public safety.”
That brings me back to Julia, the Sheriff’s Office spokesman.
He said deputies are stopping people for cause and there’s a nexus between proactive traffic enforcement, arrests and reducing the number of crimes. Julia noted the Sterling area in eastern Loudoun County has had the highest percentage of crimes for decades. Major crimes also occur there. The Sheriff’s Office, he said, is using data-driven analytics to fight the offenses.
As the department noted in a recent news release, the Eastern Loudoun Station area has “a significantly higher Latino population than in other parts of the county.”
If you patrol heavily in areas where many crimes have been reported, you’re bound to make more traffic stops and arrests.
The situation is complex. Is it profiling? Or simply smart police work? A combination?
Questions of whether the stepped-up enforcement program is targeting Latinos unfairly – alienating residents in the process – are bound to continue. Given his posture on immigration, the sheriff should’ve expected the heightened scrutiny and should now listen to his community’s concerns.

(Courtesy of lovewellfarms.com)As co-founder of Rhode Island’s only USDA organic hemp farm, and the largest outdoor cannabis farm in the state, I’ve spent the last eight years helping build the hemp industry from the ground up. At Lovewell Farms, we’ve operated under one of the strictest regulatory frameworks in the country, subject to licensing, batch testing, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) limits, secure packaging requirements, and product traceability. Yet two recently proposed bills, H6056 and H6270, would cut licensed hemp farms like ours out of the very market we helped establish.
These bills, introduced by Democratic Reps. Jacquelyn Baginski of Cranston and Scott Slater of Providence, aim to regulate the sale of hemp-derived beverages containing delta-9 THC, the compound most commonly associated with cannabis intoxication. Slater’s bill would specifically eliminate the sale of such beverages and drink mix powders in Rhode Island, unless these products are specifically included in the state’s cannabis laws. The bills misrepresent both the science behind these products and the legal infrastructure already in place.
During a recent House hearing, Rep. Baginski stated, “I was surprised to learn that hemp-based THC products are also available in the marketplace and largely sold unregulated… at any establishment with a retail sales permit. That could be a convenience store, a hair salon, a gas station, anywhere.” Respectfully, this is inaccurate. In Rhode Island, consumable hemp products must be produced by licensed handlers and tested by certified labs. They are subject to strict limits on THC content, comprehensive labeling standards, and age restrictions. If some products are being sold outside these rules, that’s a failure of enforcement, not evidence of an unregulated system.
Rep. Slater’s testimony in support of his bill, which would effectively ban all hemp-derived THC beverages unless sold through a dispensary, also included misleading claims. He asserted that “the hemp-derived THC products are now being sold outside the regulated cannabis system with minimal oversight, including limited testing, weak labeling, no seed-to-sale tracking, as well as avoidance of cannabis taxes.” This characterization erases the work of licensed hemp producers who follow every requirement the state imposes, many of whom, like us, already distribute specific products through dispensaries and operate with full compliance under existing cannabis laws.










Two recently proposed bills, H6056 and H6270, would cut licensed hemp farms like ours out of the very market we helped establish.


Slater went on to say that allowing hemp beverages undermines Rhode Island’s cannabis cultivators, whom he described as his constituents. “I really find it unfair that as soon as this market has started that we’re trying to undermine them… and allowing folks that found kind of a loophole with this synthetically altered hemp in drinks… without going through the same framework that everyone else has.” But our farm has always followed the framework. There is no loophole for us, just increasing restrictions on products we’ve made legally, safely, and transparently for years.
Both bills ignore a crucial scientific fact: Not all hemp products are intoxicating. Our full-spectrum gummies and vape cartridges, for example, often contain a CBD-to-THC ratio of 25:1 or higher. Peer-reviewed research shows that products with a 15:1 ratio or greater are effectively non-intoxicating, as the CBD counteracts the effects of THC. These products are designed for stress, sleep, and inflammation support, not intoxication. Lumping them together with high-potency THC beverages from out of state is scientifically inaccurate and economically harmful.
What’s also troubling is that these bills would hand control of hemp beverage sales to either liquor stores or cannabis dispensaries, while excluding the very farms that have driven the state’s hemp market since 2018. Rep. Baginski says she wants to “create a new safe marketplace for hemp THC beverages,” but the safest and most transparent path is the one we already have: Products that meet intoxicating thresholds should be sold in dispensaries, and products that do not should be available through licensed CBD consumable retailers. That distinction already exists under current state law.
Rhode Island can and should regulate cannabinoids based on potency, ratios, and public health risk. But it must do so with accuracy and fairness. Hemp farmers have invested many years and many dollars into building compliant, small-scale businesses rooted in sustainable agriculture and community health. We are not the problem, we are part of the solution.
My hope is that lawmakers will revisit these proposals and work with, not around, the people who have spent years getting it right. Hemp regulation should be based on science and equity, not stigma or disinformation.

It’s a universal rule of local government that nobody likes their property tax bill or the way their property is assessed. By any measure, the assessors have a tough and thankless job.
That said, it’s also true that there are unjust assessments and sometimes they’re the byproduct of historical bias and discrimination that affect large numbers of property owners. And right now, that appears to be the case in some North Carolina communities.
As NC Newsline reported last week, advocates in Orange County recently provided compelling evidence that residents of some historically Black neighborhoods are experiencing this injustice.
The advocates say newer larger homes in those neighborhoods – typically owned by white investors — are undervalued while older homes owned by longtime Black residents are systematically overvalued.
And that results in genuinely unjust tax bills.
The bottom line: To their credit, Orange County officials say they will review the data. Let’s hope they do so quickly and carefully and that the work inspires other counties across the state to follow suit.

Stock photo from Getty Images.The executive director of the Ohio Association of Foodbanks is trying to get the word out: If the budget passed by the U.S. House of Representatives becomes reality, it could trash the state budget and make many, many Ohioans go hungry.
The matter goes next to the U.S. Senate. But the members of the Ohio delegation aren’t talking.
The House-passed Republican reconciliation budget — President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” — would hand out $4.6 trillion in tax cuts over 10 years. In an analysis, Trump’s alma mater, the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, estimated that 70% of the benefit would go to the “top 10% of the income distribution.” 
Meanwhile, the “Department of Government Efficiency” — led by the world’s richest man — has been looking to cut services for average Americans. One place the Republican House budget seeks to achieve some of those cuts is to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.
Also known as food stamps, the program provides debit cards for food. To qualify, Ohio recipients generally have to have net income at or below federal poverty guidelines —  $32,150 a year for a family of four.
Benefits awarded under the program are pretty modest, $6.28 per person, per day on average last year. And, as a reflection of the high level of poverty in the state, one in nine Ohioans — or 1.4 million — received them last year. 
Whether Ohio’s poorest will get those food benefits in future years is an open question in light of the One Big Beautiful Bill.
“The House-passed Republican reconciliation plan would cut nearly $300 billion from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) through 2034, based on Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates — by far the largest cut to SNAP in history,” the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities wrote last week. “As a result of these cuts and other policies in the legislation — which are being used to pay partly for trillions in tax cuts skewed to the wealthy — millions of people would lose some or all of the food assistance they need to afford groceries, when many low-income households are struggling to afford the high cost of food and other basic needs.” 
The bill would force states to take up the slack by forcing them to pay based on error rates. In other words, they’d have to pay at least 5% more and then go up a sliding scale based on how often they were found to pay recipients too little or too much in benefits. It also would greatly increase error rates by eliminating the current tolerance for small errors — those up to $57. 
This all might sound technical, but the consequences for Ohio would be huge.
If it had an error rate of 6% or less (which it doesn’t, even under the current, more-tolerant system), the state would have to pay $158 million more a year into the program, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities. At the top end, with an error rate of 25% or more, Ohio would have to pay $790 million more a year.
Under the Republican bill, error rates would surely go sharply up. But even under Ohio’s most recent rate, the state would take a massive hit. At 15% errors, the state would have to come up with $473 million a year.
“That’s almost $500 million in new state revenue that they would have to come up with just to maintain current levels of benefits,” said Joree Novotny, executive director of the Ohio Association of Foodbanks. “That’s roughly equivalent to the entire state investment in the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services” which administers SNAP in addition to many other programs.
Novotny is worried that Ohio’s food banks would be stretched even worse under such cuts than they were after expanded SNAP benefits during the covid pandemic expired.
“We know that we can’t ever make up for the value that SNAP benefits provide to low-income working families, seniors and people with disabilities,” she said. “We’re not designed to be a first-line grocery store. SNAP invests directly in local economies. Benefits are spent at local grocers. The removal of this investment in that supply chain… I’m not only concerned about access to affordable food for people with lower resources, but also sustainability and resilience in the food-supply sector as a whole.”
Novotny said two bad-but-likely results would be bigger food deserts and less access to healthy nutrition. Those outcomes would be particularly devastating to low-income families who have seen food prices grow 27% between mid-2020 and the beginning of this year.
Asked whether Gov. Mike DeWine opposed the SNAP cuts in the Republican bill, his press secretary, Dan Tierney, was noncommittal.
“As we have seen, these proposals can change dramatically as the process proceeds,” Tierney said in an email. “We have generally reserved comments until after final proposals have been adopted.”
The offices of Sens. Jon Husted and Bernie Moreno were asked if they would support the cuts when the House bill came before them. Neither replied.
For her part, Novotny said she has an even deeper concern than overwhelmed food banks and growing food deserts. 
Asked what would happen if states can’t or won’t find the money the House budget is demanding for SNAP, she said, “We can’t get a good answer to that.”
“Fundamentally, will SNAP remain an entitlement? Will states have to administer the program at all?” she asked. “Fundamentally, it’s hard to understand how it would be required of a state to participate in the program if there’s such a significant cost burden.”
The question, at bottom, is whether the already huge number of poor Ohioans will swell and whether they’ll be pushed even deeper into poverty and food insecurity.
“I’m most concerned about what it would mean for the structure of the federal nutrition safety net,” Novotny said. “SNAP is and always has been an entitlement program. If you’re a worker who, through no fault of your own, loses your job and while you’re seeking work you need help affording groceries so that you can stay in your house… SNAP is there. Or if you’re a person who receives a really serious cancer diagnosis and you have to use some (Family and Medical Leave Act benefits) to come and get treatment, SNAP is there. If you’re a low-wage working family, or if you’re a senior on a fixed income, SNAP is there and the benefit has always been fully federally funded.”

Most of the clients Keene serves at the Susanna Wesley Family Learning Center in southeast Missouri are working but still rely on federal food assistance to keep up with ever-increasing costs.
The center provides a domestic violence shelter, parenting education and summer camps to struggling families stretched thin by living expenses. Keene, the center’s CEO, worries about how her clients can absorb significant cuts to food stamps, officially called the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.
“I don’t see communities just being able to absorb that need,” she said. “I don’t know what the impact is going to be yet, but I cannot imagine that it’s going to be good.”
Billions in cuts to federal food assistance are looming as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, a major tax and spending package that would slash federal spending on domestic programs to extend tax cuts passed during President Donald Trump’s first term. U.S. House Republicans passed the package in a 215-214 vote, and it’s now before the Senate.
Federal cuts squeeze already-struggling food banks, school lunch programs

Cuts to SNAP would affect residents of every state in all types of communities, but advocates fear the fallout could especially hit rural people, who are more dependent on food stamps, the largest anti-hunger program in the nation.
The legislation that passed the House would cut food assistance by an estimated $300 billion, according to the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. One key provision of the bill would expand work requirements to include people between 55 and 64 years old and those with children aged 7 or older. It would also tighten rules for counties with high unemployment rates.
Together, the changes would remove more than 3 million Americans from the program in an average month, reducing spending by more than $92 billion over 10 years, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.
The legislation will likely face changes in Senate negotiations. The measure was endorsed in a letter signed by 20 of the nation’s 27 Republican governors.
A greater share of rural residents currently rely on SNAP than those in metropolitan areas, according to the Food Research & Action Center, a nonprofit focusing on hunger and health among the impoverished. Rural hunger is already on the rise and grocery stores face an uphill battle to keep going in the most isolated parts of the country.










The SNAP cuts are definitely going to make an impact because we already have hungry kids.


– — Marsha Keene, CEO of the Susanna Wesley Family Learning Center in Missouri


In her corner of Missouri, Keene said, limited job opportunities leave many workers struggling to cover housing and grocery bills. Nearly a quarter of residents live below the poverty line in Mississippi County — almost double the state and national averages.
She recalled her own recent trip to the grocery store, where high prices caused her to forgo items on her list such as orange juice and meat. “And I have a pretty good job,” she said.
“The SNAP cuts are definitely going to make an impact because we already have hungry kids.”
‘I’d probably close the doors’
The National Grocers Association has opposed the potential cuts, saying SNAP provides not only critical food, but also meaningful boosts to local employment and economies. The organization, which represents retail and wholesale grocers, said cuts will particularly hurt independent and rural stores.
“Cutting SNAP would harm the most vulnerable Americans and threaten the viability of community grocery stores that are depended upon by their local economies and neighborhoods,” the association said in a May statement.
Facing competitive pressures from online retailers and big-box stores with lower prices, rural grocery stores are already struggling to remain viable.

But deep cuts to SNAP would have an uneven impact on rural stores.
For Kay Voss, the cuts would be catastrophic at her Stratton Country Market in southwest Nebraska. She estimates 40% of sales are paid for with SNAP.
“I’d probably close the doors,” she said.
That’s a possibility with or without federal changes: Struggling to turn a profit in the town of about 340 people, Voss said the market likely won’t last much longer.
“There’s nothing to be made on the grocery side,” she said.
Several grocery store operators interviewed by Stateline were more optimistic. Some said they believed locals were using their federal benefits at chains in nearby cities for cheaper prices or anonymity.
‘The lifeblood of the community’: States invest to save rural grocery stores

Tasha Malay, one of the owners of Malay’s Market in western Kansas, said SNAP made up less than 2% of the store’s sales last year.
While she believes cuts to the federal program are “a terrible idea” broadly, she said it won’t make a huge difference for her store.
“I think the people that qualify are utilizing it, but I think that they’re spending the dollars elsewhere,” she said.
Profit margins are famously slight in the grocery industry, especially for rural stores facing an onslaught of competition from dollar stores whose bulk purchasing allows them to offer much lower prices.
“When they’re operating on such thin margins anyways, that could have a huge impact on whether or not the store can remain open,” said Carlie Jonas, a policy associate at the nonprofit Center for Rural Affairs.
The center has worked with lawmakers to preserve rural grocery stores, which provide locals with social connections in addition to fresh meat and produce. Proposed legislation to fund $2 million in rural grocery assistance did not win approval from the Nebraska legislature because of the state’s challenging budget cycle, Jonas said.
That figure, though, pales in comparison to new costs Nebraska could face if the proposed SNAP changes are enacted.
One component of the federal legislation would shift billions of costs from the federal government to states to administer SNAP.
A Nebraska-based think tank estimates the state would have to spend at least $39 million a year to make up for the lost federal funds.
“Every single state is going to have to make some really difficult decisions,” Jonas said.
Federal cuts affect regional food access; more uncertainty to come

In Wisconsin, state officials estimate the changes would cost the state $314 million per year.
“This is over a quarter billion dollars each year that Wisconsin couldn’t use for our health care, our roads, our schools, or our economy,” Wisconsin Medicaid Director Bill Hanna said in a May statement.
U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, downplayed the impacts of the changes.
“We are not cutting SNAP,” he said May 25 on CBS News’ political show “Face the Nation.” “We’re working in the elements of fraud, waste and abuse. SNAP for example, listen to the statistics, in 2024, over $11 billion in SNAP payments were erroneous.”
A PolitiFact breakdown published May 29 disputed Johnson’s remarks, concluding that three independent analyses show millions of people could lose SNAP benefits.
‘It’s time to sound the alarm’
Food insecurity is already on the rise in rural America.
Even in heartland areas where farming is central to the local economy, many have trouble accessing fresh and affordable food.
“We’re seeing food insecurity across the entire state rise, but really disproportionately in our more rural areas,” said Tim Williams, government affairs and advocacy officer at Food Bank for the Heartland, an Omaha, Neb.-based nonprofit serving 93 counties across Nebraska and Iowa.

Williams said cuts to the SNAP program will drive up demand on food banks, especially in rural areas that have long struggled with access and transportation to secure fresh foods. In sparsely populated areas such as western Nebraska, it’s difficult to get to grocery stores — if they exist at all.
“There are counties in the state where there are more cows than people, and so things are very spread out,” he said. “They can be very difficult to get to. Sometimes there’s only one pantry or one grocery store in a county.”
The federal food program works in tandem with food banks to keep people from going hungry, Williams said. And cuts to federal aid will unquestionably affect nonprofits.
“It will put a disproportionate burden on the charitable food system that they can’t sustain because they’re already seeing too many people,” he said.
Susie Boelter, executive director of the North Country Food Bank, said it’s time to expand food assistance — not cut it. She told the North Dakota Monitor her nonprofit has experienced “staggering increases” in need over the past three years.
For every meal the food bank provides across its 21-county service area in North Dakota, SNAP provides nine, she said.
“Any additional cuts will put a ton of pressure on our emergency food system,” Boelter said. “Food banks are good at getting food into the hands of people who need it, but it’s time to sound the alarm.”

(Quentin Young/Colorado Newsline)Multiple people were injured Sunday in downtown Boulder when a man reportedly lit them on fire, according to local police.
Eight victims ranging in age from 52 to 88 years old were transported to hospitals in the region, police said. One was described as being in critical condition, with other victims’ injuries ranging from serious to minor.
The suspect, 45-year-old Mohamed Sabry Saliman, was taken into custody by police and was treated for minor injuries at a hospital, Mark D. Michalek, special agent in charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Denver field office, said during a Sunday evening press conference.
“Witnesses are reporting that the subject used a makeshift flamethrower and threw an incendiary device into the crowd,” Michalek said.
The attack took place near the Boulder County Courthouse on the Pearl Street Mall, an area in the heart of the city that typically attracts hundreds of people on the weekend. The first calls about the attack came at 1:26 p.m., Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn said earlier Sunday.
“The initial callers indicated that there was a man with a weapon and that people were being set on fire,” he said. “When we arrived, we encountered multiple victims that were injured with injuries consistent with burns and other injuries.”
Participants in the Boulder branch of Run For Their Lives, which organizes events calling for the immediate release of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza, were the apparent target of the attack.
Michalek said the suspect was “heard to yell ‘Free Palestine’ during the attack.” He called it a “targeted act of violence” and said the FBI was investigating it as an act of terrorism.
Kash Patel, director of the FBI, earlier on Sunday called the incident a “targeted terror attack,” and Colorado Gov. Jared Polis said it was a “heinous act of terror.”
The Anti-Defamation League said on social media it was “monitoring the situation in Colorado.”
Joe Neguse, a Democrat who represents Boulder in the U.S. House, characterized the attack as targeting Jewish people.
“I am horrified by the heinous act of terror that took place in downtown Boulder this afternoon,” he said in a statement. “Tonight, as many prepare to mark the Shavuot holiday, our Jewish community has been subjected to yet another brutal and horrific act of violence. The scourge of antisemitism has metastasized across our country, and we must do more — now — to stop this hatred and violence.”
Phil Weiser, Colorado’s attorney general, also indicated the group was targeted.
“From what we know, this attack appears to be a hate crime given the group that was targeted,” Weiser said in a statement. “People may have differing views about world events and the Israeli-Hamas conflict, but violence is never the answer to settling differences. Hate has no place in Colorado.”

Still, her proposal pares the agency down. (Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)New Hampshire’s Office of the Child Advocate has been on the chopping block this session as state lawmakers look to trim the budget during a difficult fiscal year. However, some senators, slightly more bullish on the state’s economic outlook, have proposed a way to keep the office, albeit in a slimmed-down form.
When the New Hampshire House of Representatives passed its version of the budget, it eliminated the Office of the Child Advocate. Established in 2018, the office serves as a watchdog for New Hampshire’s youth, overseeing the state’s child welfare, juvenile justice, and youth care systems, and advocating for the best interests of children in the state. Eliminating it would save the state — which has been experiencing lagging business tax revenues — around $2.2 million over two years. However, state senators — who projected a slightly less dire financial outlook and appear more interested in keeping the child advocate — have since come up with a proposal to restore it.
“I’m trying to find a middle ground that the House will accept,” Sen. Sharon Carson, who is spearheading the proposal, said. “Keeping it but compressing it down for now and still allowing them the funds that they need to do the job I think is important.”
Carson, a Londonderry Republican and the Senate president, said she plans to propose an amendment to the budget that would restore the Office of the Child Advocate but lay off four of its employees. The amendment also gives the office the option to request more money from the Fiscal Committee in the future should the state’s finances improve over the course of the next two-year budget term.
The committee is expected to finalize the budget plan on Tuesday. After that, the entire Senate will vote to create the Senate’s final version of the budget. From there, the Senate and House will hash out the differences between their budgets before Gov. Kelly Ayotte gets the opportunity to review and either approve or veto it.
Carson believes there’s enough Republican support for her proposal on the child advocate. She hopes it’s “a path that the House can accept.” Carson serves on the Children’s Oversight Committee and has been pleased with the office’s work.
“After working with the office for a number of years, I know how valuable it is,” Carson said. “And I know the value of the work they do, so we had to try to figure out a way to save it.”
Cassandra Sanchez, who heads the Office of the Child Advocate, said she has “really mixed feelings” about the proposal.
“It’s a really difficult time to look at reducing the office in the way in which that amendment would,” Sanchez said. “But, of course, seeing an amendment come forth that continues funding to our office and does not eliminate the office altogether is a big win for us.”
Sanchez said the four positions to be eliminated are an office coordinator (which is currently vacant), a public relations and training officer, the associate child advocate (her second-in-command), and a case aide. As the budget cut threats have loomed, she’s conceded to lawmakers that if they have to cut positions, losing the public relations and training officer won’t impact their caseload management and she asked that it be removed first. 
She’s most fearful of the case aide being laid off because that position reviews all restraints and seclusions of children, and the state has been seeing rising numbers of these tactics being used, she said. 
In April, the state saw approximately 450 instances of children being restrained or secluded by a state worker, according to her office’s most recent numbers. Sanchez’s office is the only agency that reviews such instances to ensure they’re necessary and in the best interest of the child. She said the office would “be able to function quite well” with the other three positions removed “but (the case aide) is the one critical position being cut that is truly going to have an impact on the children of New Hampshire.”
The amendment also includes a provision that prohibits the office from partisan advocacy. Sanchez has been vocal in support of trans youth in the state. In April 2024, she participated in a press conference speaking out against bills targeting LGBTQ children, which ruffled feathers among Republicans. State Sen. Victoria Sullivan told New Hampshire Public Radio the advocacy is “distracting from the actual good work that’s happening with the children, with the systems.” Other lawmakers have echoed the sentiment.
Sanchez said she’s “not extremely clear on what that means,” but “could assume” it’s a reference to that press conference and other LGBTQ advocacy. She wants more clarification from lawmakers, or even an interpretation from the attorney general. Regardless, she has not backed down on the issue.
“I have had conversations where I’m willing to talk about the way in which we engage with the Legislature around those issues,” she continued. “But it would not change our viewpoint, which again, backed by psychological research, is that supporting a child and their gender identity, however they choose to explore that gender identity, supporting them in that exploration is healthy for their development. And so that is where I stand and where the office stands on those issues. And we will continue to advocate for protections of those vulnerable children and sharing factual information about the statistics and the outcomes for children when there is harmful legislation that attacks their ability to freely express themselves.”
She said leading a team where employees are aware that their jobs are on the chopping block, through no control of their own, has been “extremely difficult.”
“It’s nothing I ever thought or had planned for having to manage,” Sanchez said. “And now that it’s here, I’m really taking it day-by-day. … But it is hard because the work we do already is so heavy and so difficult, and then to add that burden of the unknown on top of it, for their own lives, their own jobs, it’s a lot for folks to deal with.”
Still, she said, the team is “not gonna let pessimism sink in.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/SenCarsonMay29-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-02 05:02:38.391316

More legislatures in Republican-led states are passing paid parental leave for public employees. (Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images)More Republican-led states are giving paid parental leave to public school teachers and other state employees, signaling a broader acceptance of family-friendly workplace policies once championed primarily by Democrats.
“All of these red states, I think we’re late to the party,” said South Carolina state Rep. Beth Bernstein, a Democrat who sponsored a bill this year to increase state employees’ paid parental leave from six to 12 weeks. It passed the majority-Republican South Carolina House in April with strong bipartisan support.
This year, Alabama, Iowa and Mississippi joined 37 other states in granting paid parental leave to thousands of state workers.
The trend has gathered steam in recent years. Some experts link it to the cascade of state abortion bans that followed the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2022 Dobbs decision, which dismantled the federal right to abortion. Under fire from critics to do more to care for babies once they’re born, at least a dozen conservative-led states with abortion bans have since granted or expanded paid parental leave for their state employees.
But others say the increasing bipartisan support for measures that help working parents is also a reaction to economic realities.
“What we’ve seen, especially in more conservative states, is the public sector has experienced a lot of turnover,” said Kameron Dawson, legal director of the Southern Office of A Better Balance, a legal organization focused on workplace rights. “They’re looking for tools to recruit younger employees.”
Paid parental leave is the time off granted to workers for the birth or adoption of a baby, to care for a child, or to recover from a stillbirth or miscarriage. Without it, employees are left to cobble together their sick leave and vacation leave — or go unpaid — to stay home with a child and heal.










We’re trying to attract and retain state employees and teachers, and we’re in competition with everyone around us, and the private sector as well.


– Alabama Republican state Rep. Ginny Shaver


Alabama Republican state Rep. Ginny Shaver watched her daughter, a public school teacher, struggle to get the leave she needed after the births of her children in recent years.
“With her second, she had complications in her pregnancy and used up her [paid vacation and sick] leave before she even had the baby,” Shaver told Stateline. Her daughter contracted COVID-19, and the baby had to spend time in neonatal intensive care. “It was a very difficult time, and she had to take unpaid leave.”
Last year, Shaver and Democratic state Sen. Vivian Figures worked to win approval of a paid parental leave bill for state employees. It failed.
But they tried again this year. With the support of Republican Gov. Kay Ivey, the state legislature — which has a Republican supermajority — passed it nearly unanimously. The new law gives female state employees, including teachers, eight weeks of paid parental leave in connection with birth, stillbirth or miscarriage, and gives male employees two weeks. Adoptive parents get eight weeks for one parent and two for the other.
Shaver said she thinks the law passed thanks to vocal support from the governor and increased awareness of the issue due to the work she and Figures did in previous sessions.
“And the fact that all of the southeast states around us offered it,” Shaver said. “We’re trying to attract and retain state employees and teachers, and we’re in competition with everyone around us, and the private sector as well.”
Keeping talent
For many Republicans, the workforce development argument for paid leave is a persuasive one. For states such as Alabama and South Carolina that have some of the lowest workforce participation rates in the nation, paid leave can be a tool to keep more people — particularly women — working. And it can be a way to retain educators as many states struggle with teacher shortages in K-12 schools.
“For several years we’ve seen state legislatures acknowledging the importance of child care to businesses and the economy,” said Feroza Freeland, policy director at the Southern Office of A Better Balance. “But in the last few years, we’ve seen a growing recognition that paid leave is another piece of that puzzle.”
New rules protect pregnant workers, but red states sue over abortion provisions

States have taken up the issue because the federal government has not. The United States is a global outlier; among 38 peer nations, it’s the only one that doesn’t mandate paid parental leave, according to the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development. The group comprises 38 democracies with market-based economies.
The federal Family and Medical Leave Act, passed in 1993 and extended in 2020, only requires public agencies and companies with at least 50 employees to give up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for parents of newborns or newly adopted children, or caregivers of sick family members.
GOP support
During his first term, President Donald Trump publicly supported some forms of paid family leave and signed a defense bill that gives 12 weeks of paid parental leave to most federal employees.
Paid family leave was a signature issue for his daughter Ivanka Trump, at the time a senior adviser to the president. She even held a paid leave and child care summit at the White House in late 2019.
That set the stage for other Republicans to take up the issue more publicly. And after the Dobbs decision, family-friendly policies have increasingly become conservative talking points in states with restrictive abortion laws.
After the Mississippi House unanimously passed a paid parental leave bill earlier this year, Republican House Speaker Jason White celebrated the bill as a reflection of Mississippi’s status as a “pro-life state.”
In a post on X this week announcing her signing of a new paid parental leave law, Iowa Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds called Iowa “a pro-family state.”
North Carolina was one of the first Southern states to grant paid parental leave to state workers in 2019 when then-Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, signed an executive order. In 2023, several months after the Dobbs decision, the state’s majority-Republican legislature extended paid parental leave to public school employees by tacking it onto a law banning most abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy.
Meanwhile, Indiana Republican Gov. Mike Braun signed an executive order in March to add up to eight additional weeks of paid leave for “childbirth recovery” to the state’s existing four weeks of paid parental leave.
Running the gamut
The new laws won’t apply to most residents, because they only cover state employees. But they could have a downstream effect.
Shaver, the Alabama lawmaker, said she hopes her state’s new law will not only help the state be competitive with the private sector, but also set a precedent for other employers to follow.
“I hope they will see it’s in their benefit to offer what they can,” she said. “It may not be eight or 12 weeks, but even offering a reduced or flexible work schedule can help families.”
Just over a quarter of private-sector workers have access to paid family leave through their employer as of March 2023, according the most recent data from the U.S. Department of Labor.
Among the lowest-wage earners, that share drops to 6%.
Abortion-ban states pour millions into pregnancy centers with little medical care

State paid leave programs run the gamut in terms of what they offer. While Alabama’s new law offers up to eight weeks of leave for all state employees, including teachers, Mississippi’s offers six and does not require public schools to offer paid parental leave to their employees.
Iowa’s new law grants four weeks of paid leave for the birth or adoption of a child and one week of paid paternity leave. Tennessee’s law, passed in 2023, only offers paid leave to workers in the state’s executive and judicial branches.
But a few states are already expanding their offerings: Last year, Georgia legislators voted to double paid parental leave from three to six weeks.
And some states have gone further than just state employees: 13 states and the District of Columbia have mandated paid family leave for all workers, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center. Most of those states are located in New England or on the West Coast and all are Democratic-led. Ten more offer voluntary paid family leave statewide that’s provided through private insurance.
Sandwich generation
Experts say the shift in attitude toward family-friendly policies can also be attributed to a generational shift.
“A lot of younger lawmakers are more willing to champion the issue of paid leave,” said Freeland, of A Better Balance. “They’re understanding it because they’re seeing it in their own lives, or seeing friends and family members going through this.”
In South Carolina, Bernstein’s bill faced some opposition from members of the state’s ultra-conservative Freedom Caucus and Family Caucus. Some lawmakers questioned the potential costs of the bill, or criticized it as government overreach.
South Carolina Republican state Rep. Josiah Magnuson, a member of the Freedom Caucus, said he believed the bill would be a financial burden on public school districts that could lead to raised taxes.
“You’re saying, let’s tax the people of South Carolina, most of whom don’t get paid parental leave, and give them to state employees who already have six weeks’ paid parental leave,” Magnuson told lawmakers in April before the House voted to pass the bill.
He also said he doesn’t like that the increased paid leave “puts the foot in the door a little more for the government to be involved in the home.”
The opposition frustrated Bernstein, who pointed out that the state’s 2022 law that granted six weeks of paid parental leave passed the legislature almost unanimously. This year’s bill expanding that leave passed the House but hasn’t seen movement in the Senate. It can be picked up again when the legislature returns in January.
Other South Carolina Republicans backed the bill, citing their own families’ experiences following the birth of their children, reported the South Carolina Daily Gazette.
More conservative states are also responding to the needs of “sandwich generation” employees who may be caring for aging parents as well as children, Freeland said.
Earlier this year, Tennessee became the first Southern state to expand its state paid leave policy beyond just parental leave. The state legislature voted almost unanimously to extend its six-week paid leave policy to cover state workers providing end-of-life care to a family member.
“We’re seeing a growing recognition that people need support for these types of family or caregiving needs,” said Freeland, “and that it strengthens the workforce and economy to be able to provide that.”

In the evenings, tourists make their way across the avenue from the French Quarter, drinks in hand, ready to take in some jazz at the clubs on Frenchman Street.
These visitors — or the current residents, for that matter — have little reason to give any thought to what once happened here in centuries past. The streetscape then could have included a cortege of enslaved Black people being forced-marched in chains from far away or from ships at the nearby docks or unloaded from wagons, all to be delivered to what amounted to urban prison camps.
Before the Civil War, the blocks on and surrounding Esplanade Avenue were home to dozens of slave pens, stockyard-like enclosures of dirt lots surrounded by high brick walls to deter escape and shield public view. Inside were men, women, and children warehoused until they could be sold, either directly from the pens or on the auction blocks somewhere in the prosperous city of New Orleans.
The pens were “foul places, attractive to flies and lice and vermin, hazy with acrid smoke from cheap pork cooked over open flames, and reeking of sweat and urine and feces and garbage,” historian Joshua D. Rothman said in his book “The Ledger and the Chain: How Domestic Slave Traders Shaped America.”
It was the stench and health concerns — not the inhumanity of the slave trade itself — that had prompted Quarter residents to push for the pens to be moved away from their fine homes into the neighborhoods along Esplanade.
The prisoners, many torn from family and friends and forced to walk or endure ship passage for hundreds of miles from the Upper South to serve new masters, were crowded inside by overseers concerned only with keeping them healthy and fit enough to bring top dollar on the market.
Passersby “might hear the cries of small children” or “the muted anguish of adults who are there, who are suffering what we call today PTSD or some sort of traumatic injury, who are trying to wrap their heads around what’s happening,” Calvin Schermerhorn, history professor at Arizona State University said in an interview.
  Slave traders often dressed up enslaved people and provided other cosmetic care when bringing them to auction. This magazine illustration titled, “Slaves For Sale: A Scene In New Orleans,” shows a group of Black men, women and children standing alongside a building beneath a sign reading “T. Hart Slaves.” The engraving is from the early 1860s. (Credit: From the Historic New Orleans Collection; gift of Mr. George Denègre)
An alert visitor can find a historical marker on the neutral ground near Esplanade Avenue and Chartres Street, marking the city’s connection to the brutal slave trade. Another marker across the intersection toward the river marks the location of the infamous slave pens where Solomon Northup, known for  “Twelve Years a Slave,” was sold into slavery.
“There’s a sin, a fearful sin, resting on this nation, that will not go unpunished forever,” Northup said in his 1853 memoir of his life as a free man sold into slavery. “There will be reckoning yet … It may be sooner or it may be later, but it’s a coming as sure as the Lord is just.”
That accounting has yet to fully come to a city more associated with letting the good times roll than dealing with past sins.
Outside of historians, academics and the generational memories of Black New Orleanians, relatively few people understand the enormity of New Orleans’ involvement in the slave trade, which helped build generational wealth for white residents and made the city the most financially powerful and influential in the South.
Gregg Kimball, Senior Consulting Historian for the Shockoe Institute in Richmond, Va., maintains that the slave trade was part of the 19th century U.S. economic boom “that really made the United States a world power. It basically created American capitalism. That’s a big deal. Right?’”
For New Orleans, sugar and slaves were the driving forces for an economy that also thrived from the global cotton trade and its position at the mouth of the Mississippi River.
“It’s those three intertwined. It’s New Orleans’s status as not only a port city, but as a place where banking is based and where trading happens in sugar and cotton and slaves,” New Orleans historian Erin Greenwald said.
Slavery is in the very bones of New Orleans, where the essential protective levees, streets and core buildings were constructed by enslaved workers. Captive Black laborers helped grow and harvest the lucrative sugar and cotton crops, loaded the yield onto the ships for export and even served as collateral for plantation owners’ bank loans to expand their land holdings and buy more enslaved workers.
From the early 1800s until Union Troops occupied the city about a year after the beginning of the Civil War, New Orleans was known as the “slave market of the South.” An estimated 135,000 people were bought and sold in the city and its immediate environs at more than 50 documented places.
These are the same places where residents and tourists today celebrate Mardi Gras, sleep in luxury hotels, drink in dive bars, and eat at fine restaurants. In 2025, there is little public acknowledgement of the atrocities of slavery beyond a few mostly low-key historical markers and some local tours designed to go beyond the usual sightseeing fare.
The history of how slavery made New Orleans the city it is today rarely intrudes on the daily awareness of most people.
Greenwald said she values what she gets from reading academic histories.
“It’s great. But that’s not what’s going to penetrate the consciousness,” she said. “It’s just not. It’s expensive, it’s jargony. … Historians are speaking generally to each other. You have to have a lot of prior knowledge to access a lot of the narrative in academic history.”
  New Orleans history tour guide David Higgins traces his ancestry to a great-great-great-grandmother who he said was a slave in the French Quarter and mistress to a Dutch slave trader. When he gives an African American history tour, Higgins said, “most people are interested in hearing about progressive things that happened after slavery,” like New Orleans native Homer Plessy and his unsuccessful fight against Louisiana’s racial segregation laws in the late 1800s.

There is also the city’s reluctance to confront its painful past, focusing instead on tourism-friendly narratives and laissez les bons temps rouler marketing.
“There’s a powerful impulse to keep slavery in the rearview mirror, to present a story about the United States that is one of progress and improvement,” Rothman, chair of the history department at the University of Alabama, said in an interview. “People like to think slavery was terrible, but we fixed it. In fact, we’ve forgotten about it.”
To those who know, the city’s slave history is everywhere: former slave quarters operating as apartments and short-term rentals, historic structures built with slave labor and a culture of music and art that wouldn’t exist without the influence and contributions of enslaved residents. But it isn’t easy to track down the markers, read the academic research and all the other things that provide a thorough understanding of what happened.
In an upcoming series of articles, Verite News hopes to make the city’s connection to slavery better known and understood by residents who are not familiar with stories and connections held dear by descendants of the enslaved and to the millions who come to visit “the city that care forgot.”
The historical marker for the St. Louis Hotel, the most famous slave auction site in New Orleans, is placed at the back of the luxurious Omni Royal Orleans hotel, next to a loading dock. Hundreds, if not thousands, of people walk past it each day without pausing to read about what took place there.
The marker itself seems to downplay the connection to the slave market and its inhumanity. “The luxurious St. Louis Hotel included a bank, ballroom, shopping arcade, and trading exchange,” the marker boasts. “Six days a week, under the hotel’s domed rotunda, auctioneers sold land and goods,” before what almost seems like an aside of  “as well as thousands of enslaved people.”
Slavery-related markers on The Moonwalk by the Mississippi River, The Merieult House on Royal Street, The Cabildo in Jackson Square, slave pen locations at Esplanade and Chartres, the New Orleans Slave Depot at Common and Baronne streets, and Congo Square are also easy to overlook.

And even for those who do stop and read, the official city guidance and literature provides little context for what it means and what the reader should think or do about it. While other cities around the world have benefited from building museums, permanent exhibits, and other educational structures on painful events, including the Holocaust, race massacres, and the atrocities and injustices of the Jim Crow era, New Orleans has mostly remained on the sidelines.
The removal of Confederate monuments from prominent positions in the city sparked a great outcry in 2017 from those who said they saw it as “erasing history,” but the recognition of enslaved people’s contributions to building and molding New Orleans has not received similar support.
“There had been this resistance, I think, in New Orleans generally to recognizing darker sides of history that complicate the fun-time celebration, exotic nature tourism of the city,” said Greenwald, who put together “Purchased Lives,” an extensive exhibit on slavery that was on display at The Historic New Orleans Collection in 2015. “New Orleans is not alone in that, but they might be one of the worst examples of covering up things that aren’t part of their tourism narrative, and that has changed.”
Many of the slave markers were placed by a city commission appointed to mark the New Orleans Tricentennial in 2018. Freddi Evans, a New Orleans author and educator who was on the commission, said in an interview that the markers have had a positive effect.
“Well, I don’t know if it has an impact on the people who are coming here as tourists, but it has an impact on the people who are here, the citizens,” she said, including the descendants of enslaved people who have taken it upon themselves to keep their history from being erased. The New Orleans Tricentennial Commission does offer a slave marker tour app that provides “an immersive and dramatic self-guided tour of sites that played an important role in the domestic slave trade of New Orleans.”
  Each year, over the July 4 weekend, the New Orleans MAAFA Commemoration provides a community remembrance event “to reckon with the horrors of the Transatlantic and Domestic Slave Trades, and a release from the chains of its legacy.” The event includes a visit to the Tomb of the Unknown Slave – pictured here, next to St. Augustine Catholic Church on Governor Nicholls Street – and other locations.

Each year, over the July 4th weekend, the New Orleans MAAFA Commemoration takes place. Sponsored by the Ashé Cultural Arts Center, participants wearing white begin at Congo Square with stops at the Esplanade site, the Tomb of the Unknown Slave (next to St.Augustine Catholic Church on Governor Nicholls Street), and other locations. Maafa is a Kiswahili word that means “great disaster” or “great tragedy.”
“Hundreds of people come,” Evans said. It’s one way the city can memorialize those who suffered under slavery.
Harvard historian Walter Johnson has written that the whole city should be considered a memorial to slavery.
“The levee is a slave-built levee. The entire economic development of the city was premised upon slavery. All the buildings were built by enslaved people or free people of color,” Johnson told The Chronicle of Higher Education in 2017.
“You could memorialize the city of New Orleans with a million markers of which enslaved people lived there, which enslaved people worked there, which enslaved people built this.”

(Getty Images)As Ohio food assistance recipients await decisions on the federal and state level about whether they will see large cuts to their benefits, some state legislators are trying to iron out other details related to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).
Congressional budget reconciliation is ongoing in the U.S. Senate, after what anti-hunger advocates say would be a nearly 30% reduction in SNAP benefits was approved by the U.S. House in their draft of budget documents, encouraged by the Trump administration as part of efforts to slash federal spending.
Advocates say the cuts will be devastating for low-income families across the country, with rural communities disproportionately impacted, according to the national Food Research & Action Center. The Ohio Association of Foodbanks said the loss of SNAP funding would restrict services “vital for everyday Ohioans in every Congressional district.”
The potential cuts come as legislators work on the state’s SNAP program, with bills ranging from supplements to the benefits for older Ohioans to a push to prevent the defrauding of Ohioans who need the funds.
Most recently, supporters of House Bill 163 – which would make the electronic benefit cards (EBTs) that hold SNAP benefits chip-enabled, like most mainstream credit and debit cards – spoke on the impacts chip technology would offer to households. The modernization of the EBT cards would help stem fraud through “skimming,” a method of stealing information from the swipe of a card and capture of PIN numbers at checkouts.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXThe Ohio Poverty Law Center said fraud occurs for many individuals “in the first few days after benefits were loaded, leaving them without benefits until the next month.”
Joree Novotny, executive director of the Ohio Association of Foodbanks said there was a congressional “pathway” for state agencies to reimburse victims of benefit theft, which took nearly $17 million in SNAP benefits from more than 34,000 Ohio households between June 2023 and Dec. 2024. But the pathway ended in December of last year, when Congress decided against extending authorization for replacement of those benefits, Novotny told the Ohio House Agriculture Committee during a recent hearing on H.B. 163.
Since then, it’s unclear how much has been stolen from Ohioans and other SNAP beneficiaries, because Novotny said “theft reports are no longer being collected.” Still, she said emergency food distribution representatives say the “issue remains pervasive.”
One of the sponsors of H.B. 163, state Rep. Tristan Rader, D-Lakewood, is working with fellow Democratic Rep. Desiree Tims to create a state program to replace stolen SNAP benefits in a bill that would appropriate $17 million from the state’s General Revenue Fund for the task.
State budgets and sweet drinks
State-level budget discussions have included maintaining work requirements for SNAP participants, along with other regulations related to waivers for SNAP participants.
The state budget approved by the House also included a requirement that the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services seek a waiver from the U.S. Department of Agriculture to exclude “sugar-sweetened beverages” from items that can be purchased using SNAP benefits.
While the provision of the budget doesn’t specify types of sugar-sweetened beverages, a bill introduced recently by Republican co-sponsors singles out soft drinks as an item they want to see removed from the SNAP-eligible list of products, along with candy, chips, ice cream and “prepared desserts such as cakes, pies, cookies or similar products.”
If the bill passes, those products would join alcoholic beverages, tobacco, hot foods or “hot food products prepared for immediate consumption” as SNAP-exempted items.
Last week, the sponsors of the bill said exempting “junk food” from SNAP eligibility is one way of ensuring to taxpayers that their money is being spent for the betterment of Ohioans.
“What this bill’s all about is helping focus folks who are using taxpayer money – which we’re glad to provide for folks that are having a rough time, don’t have resources at home, whatever the case may be – but just helping them realize there are better choices here than the stuff that adds calories … and no nutritional benefits,” Sen. Tim Schaffer, R-Lancaster, told the Senate Health Committee.
Bill co-sponsor, Sen. Terry Johnson, R-McDermott, pointed to a change “demographically in our country” toward obesity and health problems, “and it’s primarily the nutritional things that we consume.”
“We’re doing America a great disservice by ignoring the fact that what people actually need is clean air, clean water, clean food, good exercise and a little bit of sunshine,” Johnson said.
Committee member Sen. Beth Liston, D-Dublin, wondered whether discouraging sweets and soda consumption should start with a different population for which taxpayers subsidize food assistance, like the military or public universities.
“If you’re looking at how to make the best impacts, I think looking at only poor individuals that are struggling to get by may not be, certainly not the largest population,” Liston said to the bill sponsors. “There are many other tax-funded foods that we purchase, and if you’re going to be looking at it holistically, just the SNAP program is a pretty small population.”

Similar legislation is working through the Ohio House, too. But dramatically expanding the scope and availability of gaming has drawn a wide array of critics.
Between charging operators at least $50 million in licensing fees and imposing a tax rate of at least 36% on gambling receipts, the Senate proposal would generate a substantial sum of money. Legislative researchers peg the annual tax collections at almost $175 million. The bill’s sponsor and the gambling industry suggest the eventual figure could be double or triple that much.
But some critics, already in the gaming industry, worry about sharing the market with new entrants. Others, oppose the idea for religious or mental health reasons. Last week they made their case to state lawmakers.

What the bill does and who wants it
State Sen. Nathan Manning, R-North Ridgeville, describes his bill as a way to “modernize” gambling in the state and bring Ohio in line with several of its neighbors. At hearing earlier this month he argued that online gambling is already happening, but it’s unregulated.
“Just like sports betting,” he explained, “there was a lot of illegal sports betting happening. When we legalized it, most of that went to the legal form, and we have additional protections in place there, and we also then get additional revenue to the state, so it is a win-win.”
The proposal would take a tiered approach to gambling taxes. Online sports betting would hold steady at its current rate of 20%, but sports betting at brick-and-mortar casinos would drop to 10%. Online casino-style games would be taxed at a higher rate — 36% for operators with a physical presence in Ohio and 40% for those who don’t.
Ohio lawmakers introduce separate bills to regulate online gambling

 
In addition to expanding online gaming opportunities, the bill expands the role of the Ohio Casino Control Commission. Oversight duties handled by the state racing commission, attorney general and lottery commission would fall under the casino control commission’s purview.
Not surprisingly, the bill’s supporters include casino operators. Trevor Hayes from Caesars Entertainment said they’ve been providing online gaming in New Jersey since 2014, and it’s been “additive” to their physical operations.
“We’ve found that our brick-and-mortar customers that have then tried online gaming now visit our properties 55% more,” he said.
Still, others raised complaints about how expensive a proposition it would be to establish online gaming. Ryan Soultz from Boyd Gaming offered a blunt assessment.
“I’ll just point out that fee structure that’s in the bill today would be the highest in the country,” he said.
The $50 million price tag would far outstrip the highest existing fee which is the $10 million charged in Pennsylvania.
Gambling’s critics
The Center for Christian Virtue held a press conference ahead of the latest hearing to announce more than 100 pastors around the state have signed onto an open letter opposing the legislation. Pastor and state Rep. Gary Click, R-Vickery, described the bill in predatory terms.
“We know that gambling appeals to those who have the lowest education, the lowest income, and the greatest debt,” Click said. “As we increase gambling especially online gambling we are hurting, we are harming, the most vulnerable people in the state of Ohio.”

As iGaming is being debated, the gambling industry is preparing to unleash hell on Ohioans.

In the committee hearing, CCV’s David Mahan pushed back on claims that the bill wouldn’t lead to more problem gaming.
“Does anyone actually believe that increased access, convenience and anonymity will not lead to increased addiction?” he asked.
He pointed to a presentation developed by an AI-gaming company called DegenX that bragged they “weaponize data to make games addictive” and build games to achieve “higher customer lifetime value.”
“Addicts,” Mahan said simply.
Brianne Doura-Schawohl from the Campaign for Fairer Gambling pointed to studies suggesting online gambling is particularly addictive.
“When we take one of the most addictive products and put it on the most addictive devices, researchers have found that this is a product that is ten times more addictive than that of other gambling products.”
She added that the lion’s share of the industry’s revenue comes from a tiny sliver of bettors — many of whom are problem gamblers or at risk of becoming one. All the benefits promised by casino operators, she argued, are outweighed by the social costs Ohioans will ultimately bear.
“Research is very clear, if you expand gambling you will increase the number of problems. And please remember this is not an individual problem, it’s a family problem, it’s a community problem, it’s a state problem.”
Tony Coder who heads up the Ohio Suicide Prevention Foundation said 2023 was the first year since COVID where the number of suicides in Ohio declined.
“One percent — that’s 20 folks, though — one percent,” he said. “I want to see those numbers continue to go down, and this legislation, just by everything that we’ve seen, it’s not going to help that.”

Rachel Henderson of Rumford (middle) discusses her data privacy proposal with Judiciary Committee analyst Janet Stocco (left). (Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star)Members of the Judiciary Committee late Friday advanced one of three proposals to better protect data privacy in Maine with the hope that the effort to rein in the reach of Big Tech would not founder as it did last year.
Before voting against her own bill, Rep. Rachel Henderson (R-Rumford) told the Judiciary Committee Friday afternoon that she thinks the best chance the Legislature has to get a comprehensive data privacy law passed this year is for there to be just one plan for the Maine Senate and House of Representatives to consider. 
“To me, it’s not about having a bill in my name,” Henderson said. “It’s about the policy. Transparently, it took me a while to get there. I’ve got an ego too.”
However, that decision does not mean lawmakers agree on what the right policy is. That will still be worked out in the chambers. 
For the sake of procedure, the committee opted to advance just one of the bills, but the competing components of the plans will still have the opportunity to be considered as majority and minority reports. 
As Henderson put it, “I would hate to see happen this year what happened last year.” 
Legislature rejects paths to a comprehensive data privacy law in Maine

Last session, after a dozen public meetings, countless hours of behind-the-scenes work and sizable lobbying influence from Big Tech, the Legislature rejected two competing data privacy bills on the last day, during which floor speeches demonstrated confusion over the various differences in the bills.
The fundamental differences between last year’s legislation — namely how companies approach the collection of user data — could not be reconciled. The plans being considered this year, which lean heavily on last year’s proposals, still have those key differences, so whether a resolution can be reached this year will remain to be seen. 
The main disagreement is how to approach a standard called data minimization, which broadly means limiting the collection of personal information to only what is necessary to fulfill the consumer service. 
The legislation the majority of the committee advanced, LD 1822 sponsored by Rep. Amy Kuhn (D-Falmouth), uses this approach. It specifically would limit the collection of personal data to only what is reasonably necessary and proportionate to provide a specific product or service requested by the consumer.
The key reason business interests at the public hearing opposed this bill was because they were concerned it would prevent them from doing targeted advertising. While Kuhn built her bill off of one of the versions last year that was favored by privacy advocates and opposed by businesses, she altered it to ensure small businesses that have to stretch their advertising dollars can access ad exchanges, which are marketplaces where companies can buy and sell advertising. 
On Friday, Maine Assistant Attorney General Brendan O’Neil said, “I don’t see a restriction on targeted advertising in the bill.”
Henderson’s bill, LD 1088, which the majority of committee rejected, would use a notice and consent model, allowing companies to collect data as long as consumers agree to it in privacy notices. Earlier in May, the committee rejected a similar bill, LD 1224, to narrow down the number of competing proposals. 
These two bills are similar to the version last session that was favored by businesses, who argued for Maine to adopt a law that is consistent with those adopted by other states.
​​There is currently a patchwork of state laws and parts of federal legislation governing the current landscape, as there remains no one federal law regulating internet privacy, despite several proposals. But more than a dozen states have modeled their laws off one first passed in Connecticut, which is the basis for LD 1088 and LD 1224. 
However, Connecticut’s attorney general has since recommended that its state Legislature amend the law to strengthen data minimization provisions rather than rely on its current “exploitable” notice-and-consent model.
Reading from the Connecticut report released in April, O’Neil said, “They start out by saying that, in many cases, serious privacy and data security concerns could have been offset, if not fully alleviated, if companies had properly minimized the data they collected and maintained. That’s really what LD 1822’s data minimization standard aims to do.” 
Maryland passed a law last year that is similar to Kuhn’s proposal, marking a departure from the years-long trend of states following what privacy advocates see as Connecticut’s watered down model.
Maine’s full Legislature will now decide between these two versions of a data privacy law.
The committee voted 7-1 against LD 1088, with Rep. Adam Lee opposed, but his minority report was to strike and replace the bill with Kuhn’s bill. Six members were absent for the vote.
The committee also voted 7-1 in favor of LD 1822, with Henderson opposed. Her minority report is to strike and replace the bill for her bill language. Six members were again absent for the vote.
Essentially, these minority reports afford lawmakers avenues to take up the versions as they see fit but, the committee hopes, without the confusion of competing bills like last year. 
With the possibility of changes coming to Connecticut’s law and waiting to see how Maryland’s law works in practice, lawmakers also prepared to have a vehicle to use should Maine pass a law and then want to amend it based on lessons learned from other states. 
A concept draft, LD 595 sponsored by Judiciary Committee co-chair Anne Carney (D-Cumberland), will be carried over into next year, which currently reads that it could “further update certain consumer privacy laws in response to recent developments in federal and state consumer privacy laws.”

That’s my only response to lawsuits filed throughout May that highlight the downright sloppy lawmaking that has become a hallmark of our state’s rushed, secretive legislative session. Bills are introduced and rubber-stamped in committee, testimony from experts is ignored, and the House and Senate send them through with nary a speed bump.
Afterward, the taxpayers of Kansas have to foot the bill for any carelessness.
Let’s take a quick look at the lawsuits and their subjects. Up first, Kansas Reflector editor in chief Sherman Smith, who reported the following May 28.

Two transgender teenagers and their parents are challenging a new Kansas law that bans gender-affirming care for minors.
The American Civil Liberties Union of Kansas and the national ACLU filed a lawsuit Wednesday in Douglas County District Court on behalf of a 16-year-old trans boy and a 13-year-old trans girl. The lawsuit argues the new law violates state constitutional rights for equal protection, personal autonomy and parenting.
Senate Bill 63 prohibits health care providers from using surgery, hormones or puberty blockers to treat anyone younger than 18 who identifies with a gender that is different from the sex they were assigned at birth. Health care providers who break the law may be subject to civil penalties and stripped of their license.

Next, Reflector reporter Anna Kaminski wrote about another lawsuit on May 19.

A Kansas reproductive rights advocacy group, backed by a Washington, D.C., law firm, sued state officials over a new law banning financial contributions from “foreign nationals” to support or oppose constitutional amendments.
The group, Kansans for Constitutional Freedom, argued in a complaint filed in federal court Friday that House Bill 2106, which passed the Legislature in April and is set to go into effect July 1, is broad, vague and unconstitutional. The group said the bill inhibits its ability to advocate for or against future constitutional amendments. Kansans for Constitutional Freedom and its donors have received contributions from foreign nationals, the lawsuit said.
The complaint drew a connection between HB 2106 and opposition to the 2022 ballot measure that sought to limit reproductive rights. Voters rejected the proposed constitutional amendment by a 59-41 margin.

But wait, there’s still more! Here’s senior reporter Morgan Chilson on May 6.

Three advocacy organizations filed a lawsuit Monday in Douglas County District Court challenging the Kansas Legislature’s attempt to “arbitrarily” reject advance ballots of voters if the mail system fails to deliver them by Election Day.
Kansas Appleseed, Loud Light and Disability Rights Center of Kansas are asking the court to find Senate Bill 4 unconstitutional. Defendants are Kansas Secretary of State Scott Schwab and Douglas County Clerk Jamie Shew.
SB 4, which the Legislature passed this year, disqualifies any mail-in ballots not received by 7 p.m. on Election Day. Previously, mail-in ballots were counted if they were postmarked by Election Day and arrived within three days later.

You can read the law here. You can read the lawsuit here.
We covered all of these proposals at various stages, from twinkles in legislators’ eyes to enshrinement in the statute books. Leaders sent the anti-trans bill to Gov. Laura Kelly as their first act of business in the 2025 session. She allowed the foreign nationals ban to become law without her signature and a warning that it “went too far.” The advance-voting bill was called “pure partisan politics” by former Rep. Ann Mah.
Sure, the deluge of wastewater emanating from the Statehouse in 2025 may have overwhelmed at times. But none of this should have come as a surprise.
If people or groups believe the government has infringed on their rights — to medical care, to advocacy, to voting — no one can be surprised if they bring legal action. When senators and representatives cast votes on such issues, they decide whether the state should place a barrier in front of the people they represent. No amount of victim blaming or sanctimonious claptrap obscures the truth.
Defending the laws falls to Attorney General Kris Kobach and his office. Who pays their salaries? You and me and all the people of Kansas. We’re all on the hook for legislative foolishness.
The state may win some or all of these suits. So may those who filed them. Regardless, their mere presence suggests that our elected officials tread far too easily into the swamps of ideological overreaction. Rather than representing all, they have bowed and scraped in service to a hateful few.
We will see the consequences play out before judges in the months ahead.

They’ll account for an estimated 9% of U.S. energy usage by that time. For our state, this could mean higher energy costs and an electric grid pushed past its limit.
But, for Ohio’s rural communities, this isn’t just a challenge. It’s also an opportunity.
As data centers pull a massive amount of energy from the grid, Ohio is pioneering an innovative solution: building “microgrids” at data center sites. Microgrids are small, self-sufficient energy systems that can run independently from the main electrical grid. They generate and store energy onsite using sources including natural gas and renewables. This approach prevents data centers from overwhelming the broader grid during periods of high demand, making the whole grid more resilient.
Ohio is uniquely positioned to scale up microgrid technology. Our state sits atop abundant natural gas reserves, including the Utica and Marcellus shale formations, providing a stable, low-cost fuel source. Ohio’s growing renewable energy sector offers further flexibility for powering microgrids in a sustainable way. Combining these resources can create a reliable energy supply tailored to the unique demands of data centers. Developing these microgrids also offers an economic opportunity, including good-paying jobs in construction, engineering, energy management, and data infrastructure.

But there’s another critical — and unexpected — benefit to integrating microgrids with data centers: growing healthy, fresh food year-round.
Data centers produce substantial heat and carbon dioxide — byproducts typically viewed as waste. Yet, these resources can be repurposed effectively through controlled-environment agriculture, turning them into powerful growth accelerators for local crops. The idea is simple: excess heat from data center operations can warm greenhouses, while carbon dioxide emissions can boost plant growth, creating ideal conditions for high-quality produce.
Imagine Ohio-grown strawberries, lettuce, and tomatoes harvested freshly in January and February, when there’s still deep snow on the ground, powered sustainably by waste heat from AI-driven computing facilities. This approach drastically reduces transportation emissions, minimizes food spoilage, and lessens dependence on distant agricultural markets.
As a sixth-generation Ohio farmer who has also spent years in energy and technology, I see exciting synergies emerging in how we grow our food and power our economy. New innovations now allow us to transform what was previously considered waste and pollution into productive resources. For Ohio farmers, creatively utilizing waste isn’t a novel concept. We’ve always turned animal waste into nutrient-rich fertilizer and crop residues into sustainable soil amendments.
Our state needs a plan to proactively seize opportunities with the growth of data infrastructure and AI — including the use of local energy, the maximization of local job creation, and other less obvious prospects like the expansion of year-round produce options. This should be a team effort: local and state governments, business leaders, foundations, the tech sector, farmers, and others all have a role to play.
If we fail to strategically plan the growth of data centers in Ohio, we risk higher energy costs and compromised grid reliability without generating meaningful job creation or community benefits. Likewise, if we fail to invest in local, sustainable, healthy food, we risk worsening a crisis of poor nutrition and chronic disease.
Ohio should show the world how to address both challenges at the same time.

Beth Bernstein, a Democrat who sponsored a bill t[...]","A woman holds her newborn baby in her Los Angeles home. More legislatures in Republican-led states are passing paid parental leave for public employees. (Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images)More Republican-led states are giving paid parental leave to public school teachers and other state employees, signaling a broader acceptance of family-friendly workplace policies once championed primarily by Democrats.
“All of these red states, I think we’re late to the party,” said South Carolina state Rep. Beth Bernstein, a Democrat who sponsored a bill this year to increase state employees’ paid parental leave from six to 12 weeks. It passed the majority-Republican South Carolina House in April with strong bipartisan support.
This year, Alabama, Iowa and Mississippi joined 37 other states in granting paid parental leave to thousands of state workers.
The trend has gathered steam in recent years. Some experts link it to the cascade of state abortion bans that followed the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2022 Dobbs decision, which dismantled the federal right to abortion. Under fire from critics to do more to care for babies once they’re born, at least a dozen conservative-led states with abortion bans have since granted or expanded paid parental leave for their state employees.
But others say the increasing bipartisan support for measures that help working parents is also a reaction to economic realities.
“What we’ve seen, especially in more conservative states, is the public sector has experienced a lot of turnover,” said Kameron Dawson, legal director of the Southern Office of A Better Balance, a legal organization focused on workplace rights. “They’re looking for tools to recruit younger employees.”
Paid parental leave is the time off granted to workers for the birth or adoption of a baby, to care for a child, or to recover from a stillbirth or miscarriage. Without it, employees are left to cobble together their sick leave and vacation leave — or go unpaid — to stay home with a child and heal.










We’re trying to attract and retain state employees and teachers, and we’re in competition with everyone around us, and the private sector as well.


– Alabama Republican state Rep. Ginny Shaver


Alabama Republican state Rep. Ginny Shaver watched her daughter, a public school teacher, struggle to get the leave she needed after the births of her children in recent years.
“With her second, she had complications in her pregnancy and used up her [paid vacation and sick] leave before she even had the baby,” Shaver told Stateline. Her daughter contracted COVID-19, and the baby had to spend time in neonatal intensive care. “It was a very difficult time, and she had to take unpaid leave.”
Last year, Shaver and Democratic state Sen. Vivian Figures worked to win approval of a paid parental leave bill for state employees. It failed.
But they tried again this year. With the support of Republican Gov. Kay Ivey, the state legislature — which has a Republican supermajority — passed it nearly unanimously. The new law gives female state employees, including teachers, eight weeks of paid parental leave in connection with birth, stillbirth or miscarriage, and gives male employees two weeks. Adoptive parents get eight weeks for one parent and two for the other.
Shaver said she thinks the law passed thanks to vocal support from the governor and increased awareness of the issue due to the work she and Figures did in previous sessions.
“And the fact that all of the southeast states around us offered it,” Shaver said. “We’re trying to attract and retain state employees and teachers, and we’re in competition with everyone around us, and the private sector as well.”
 Keeping talent

For many Republicans, the workforce development argument for paid leave is a persuasive one. For states such as Alabama and South Carolina that have some of the lowest workforce participation rates in the nation, paid leave can be a tool to keep more people — particularly women — working. And it can be a way to retain educators as many states struggle with teacher shortages in K-12 schools.
“For several years we’ve seen state legislatures acknowledging the importance of child care to businesses and the economy,” said Feroza Freeland, policy director at the Southern Office of A Better Balance. “But in the last few years, we’ve seen a growing recognition that paid leave is another piece of that puzzle.”
New rules protect pregnant workers, but red states sue over abortion provisions

States have taken up the issue because the federal government has not. The United States is a global outlier; among 38 peer nations, it’s the only one that doesn’t mandate paid parental leave, according to the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development. The group comprises 38 democracies with market-based economies.
The federal Family and Medical Leave Act, passed in 1993 and extended in 2020, only requires public agencies and companies with at least 50 employees to give up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for parents of newborns or newly adopted children, or caregivers of sick family members.
 GOP support

During his first term, President Donald Trump publicly supported some forms of paid family leave and signed a defense bill that gives 12 weeks of paid parental leave to most federal employees.
Paid family leave was a signature issue for his daughter Ivanka Trump, at the time a senior adviser to the president. She even held a paid leave and child care summit at the White House in late 2019.
That set the stage for other Republicans to take up the issue more publicly. And after the Dobbs decision, family-friendly policies have increasingly become conservative talking points in states with restrictive abortion laws.
After the Mississippi House unanimously passed a paid parental leave bill earlier this year, Republican House Speaker Jason White celebrated the bill as a reflection of Mississippi’s status as a “pro-life state.”
In a post on X this week announcing her signing of a new paid parental leave law, Iowa Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds called Iowa “a pro-family state.”
North Carolina was one of the first Southern states to grant paid parental leave to state workers in 2019 when then-Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, signed an executive order. In 2023, several months after the Dobbs decision, the state’s majority-Republican legislature extended paid parental leave to public school employees by tacking it onto a law banning most abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy.
Meanwhile, Indiana Republican Gov. Mike Braun signed an executive order in March to add up to eight additional weeks of paid leave for “childbirth recovery” to the state’s existing four weeks of paid parental leave.
 Running the gamut

The new laws won’t apply to most residents, because they only cover state employees. But they could have a downstream effect.
Shaver, the Alabama lawmaker, said she hopes her state’s new law will not only help the state be competitive with the private sector, but also set a precedent for other employers to follow.
“I hope they will see it’s in their benefit to offer what they can,” she said. “It may not be eight or 12 weeks, but even offering a reduced or flexible work schedule can help families.”
Just over a quarter of private-sector workers have access to paid family leave through their employer as of March 2023, according the most recent data from the U.S. Department of Labor.
Among the lowest-wage earners, that share drops to 6%.
Abortion-ban states pour millions into pregnancy centers with little medical care

State paid leave programs run the gamut in terms of what they offer. While Alabama’s new law offers up to eight weeks of leave for all state employees, including teachers, Mississippi’s offers six and does not require public schools to offer paid parental leave to their employees.
Iowa’s new law grants four weeks of paid leave for the birth or adoption of a child and one week of paid paternity leave. Tennessee’s law, passed in 2023, only offers paid leave to workers in the state’s executive and judicial branches.
But a few states are already expanding their offerings: Last year, Georgia legislators voted to double paid parental leave from three to six weeks.
And some states have gone further than just state employees: 13 states and the District of Columbia have mandated paid family leave for all workers, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center. Most of those states are located in New England or on the West Coast and all are Democratic-led. Ten more offer voluntary paid family leave statewide that’s provided through private insurance.
 Sandwich generation

Experts say the shift in attitude toward family-friendly policies can also be attributed to a generational shift.
“A lot of younger lawmakers are more willing to champion the issue of paid leave,” said Freeland, of A Better Balance. “They’re understanding it because they’re seeing it in their own lives, or seeing friends and family members going through this.”
In South Carolina, Bernstein’s bill faced some opposition from members of the state’s ultra-conservative Freedom Caucus and Family Caucus. Some lawmakers questioned the potential costs of the bill, or criticized it as government overreach.
South Carolina Republican state Rep. Josiah Magnuson, a member of the Freedom Caucus, said he believed the bill would be a financial burden on public school districts that could lead to raised taxes.
“You’re saying, let’s tax the people of South Carolina, most of whom don’t get paid parental leave, and give them to state employees who already have six weeks’ paid parental leave,” Magnuson told lawmakers in April before the House voted to pass the bill.
He also said he doesn’t like that the increased paid leave “puts the foot in the door a little more for the government to be involved in the home.”
The opposition frustrated Bernstein, who pointed out that the state’s 2022 law that granted six weeks of paid parental leave passed the legislature almost unanimously. This year’s bill expanding that leave passed the House but hasn’t seen movement in the Senate. It can be picked up again when the legislature returns in January.
Other South Carolina Republicans backed the bill, citing their own families’ experiences following the birth of their children, reported the South Carolina Daily Gazette.
More conservative states are also responding to the needs of “sandwich generation” employees who may be caring for aging parents as well as children, Freeland said.
Earlier this year, Tennessee became the first Southern state to expand its state paid leave policy beyond just parental leave. The state legislature voted almost unanimously to extend its six-week paid leave policy to cover state workers providing end-of-life care to a family member.
“We’re seeing a growing recognition that people need support for these types of family or caregiving needs,” said Freeland, “and that it strengthens the workforce and economy to be able to provide that.”

Feb. 5, 2025. (Courtesy of Nebraska Governor's Office)Welcome to another “What If?” press conference, questions for Nebraska’s congressional delegation in Washington. Since our last session, the White House has tried to shutter the U.S. Department of Education, our tariff “policy” resembles a yo-yo, the inaptly-named “big, beautiful bill” has uglied up the nation’s balance sheet, and curious Americans have taken to looking up both “emoluments” and “original sin.”
Let’s start with the aforementioned BBB. The House kept vampire hours to pass it by a single vote, after which the yays, apparently in a fit of sleep-deprived hubris, congratulated themselves before the bill went to the Senate. We have a couple questions: 

Your own accounting firm, the Congressional Budget Office, determined the BBB gives 60% of its tax breaks to the top fifth of the income bracket, yet cuts food assistance and health care to millions of poorer Americans. How does this benefit the country and what problem does it solve?


The five of you belong to a political party that has historically railed against deficits. The CBO projects the BBB will add $3.8 trillion to the nation’s deficit over the next decade. Please explain what the economic advantage is here, given the dismal history of such cuts: See Reagan 1981, G.W. Bush 2001 and 2003 and Trump 2017 for details.

We’ll move on. During a recent congressional hearing the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security couldn’t come up with the meaning of habeas corpus when she was asked to define it. This comes on the heels of recent interviews in which high-ranking administration officials, including the president, couldn’t guarantee that federal detainees would be given due process. Hmm?

Assuming you still support habeas corpus and due process, when and how should Congress intervene when the administration ignores these most basic of principles in a country in which the rule of law is paramount?

This next question is actually a matter of math. According to the Partnership for Public Service, using numbers from the federal Office of Personnel Management, “in absolute numbers, the federal workforce is slightly smaller than it was 50 years ago, even as the U.S. population has increased by nearly two-thirds during that time period.” 

Even though the courts have tied up or reversed much of the Department of Government Efficiency’s work, how do you square those numbers with DOGE’s scorched-earth policy, especially since the American public has been provided scant evidence of findings of waste, fraud, and abuse, the triplex premise on which DOGE hangs its hat?

Time to talk tariffs. To date, even a casual observer would conclude that the president’s on again, off again tariff proclamations have roiled markets and created uncertainty with little resulting economic benefit. As you know, Article I, Section 1 of the U.S. Constitution gives only Congress the power to levy tariffs. 

Even though previously enacted laws allow Congress to let the president set tariffs in certain situations, could you explain and defend the “qualifying” situation in which we find ourselves and detail how Congress sitting on the sidelines at this juncture in the levying of tariffs benefits Americans?

The president has pulled $2.5 billion from Harvard University, threatened its tax-exempt status, tried to block enrollment of foreign students and pretty much wants a say in whom it should hire and what it should teach. All this to curb what he says is Harvard’s anti-semitism, a charge which, while acknowledged in part by the school, remains without specifics. (Nevermind that the president hosted a cryptocurrency dinner during which a number of coins carried virulently anti-semitic names.) Some have argued that Harvard is simply the poster child for the administration’s “war on higher education,” in the guise of eliminating DEI, CRT, essentially any voice contrary to its liking. 

First, should the government be telling colleges and universities what to teach, who should teach it and who is allowed to learn?


Please respond to the following quote as it relates to social studies and history curricula. “History is not there for you to like or dislike. It is there for you to learn from. And if it offends you, even better, because you are less likely to repeat it. History is not yours to change or destroy. It belongs to all of us.”


Could you explain what problem is solved by closing the Department of Education, which, as you know, sets no curriculum? 


Finally, does it ever occur to you that some in Washington have no idea what they are doing or worse, know what they are doing, know it’s bad for America and do it anyway? Asking for some friends.

I’ve been with the Recorder since we launched in 2019, serving you as the deputy editor. And before that, I covered state politics and policy for a chain of newspapers around the state (shoutout to CNHI). All told, I have been covering the state Capitol here for a decade now, doing my part to help tell the story of Georgia’s evolution into the swingy, purpley state it has become and all that comes with it  – and what that means for you. 
The Recorder staff includes veterans, like our new deputy editor, Ross Williams, who focuses on education and economic inequality. Senior reporter Stanley Dunlap covers energy and environmental issues, including what the Trump administration’s policies mean for Georgians and the resources they rely on. And reporter Maya Homan has joined us to cover state politics with an emphasis on voting rights and immigration. And I’m still chasing down stories about health care and the state’s safety net systems. 
We’ll all pitch in on the campaign trail. Two Public Service Commission seats are on the ballot this year, and the 2026 midterms are already ramping up, as Georgians prepare to pick a new governor and as U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff works to defend his seat in a state President Donald Trump won last year.

Frank Chopp, a citizen activist who became the state of Washington’s longest-serving House speaker, spent a half-century relentlessly agitating for social change.
It seemed fitting then that Chopp, who died in March, would deliver a final call for action to hundreds attending his memorial service in Bellevue on Sunday.
“We have made so much progress, but let us also remember how lucky we are,” he says in a taped excerpt of a speech on the opening day of a legislative session. “None of us go without a paycheck, none of us go hungry, none of us go homeless, none of us lack health care, none of us lack the opportunity to get an education.”
“The people we represent just want what we have,” he said. “So we have a lot to do. Let’s get to work.”
Applause and cheers erupted through the crowd of lawmakers past and present, community leaders, current and former governors, and family friends gathered in the Meydenbauer Center to celebrate Chopp, whose death March 22 at the age of 71 stunned them, coming less than three months after his political retirement.
For two hours, they told stories and paid tribute to the mustachioed maestro of politics, a streetwise and strategic solon who sought no higher office than the Seattle legislative seat he occupied for three decades. A Democrat, he managed to be both high-profile and behind the scenes, fomenting change without leaving visible fingerprints. 
“With Speaker Chopp, we witnessed a rare fusion: the heart of an organizer, the strategy of a legislator and the savvy of a political mastermind,” said Teresa Mosqueda, a King County Council member. “Frank blended these elements into a force that reshaped our social contract.”

Former Gov. Jay Inslee said Chopp’s blend of personal passion and strategic ability was the “rocket fuel” that drove significant housing, health care and social justice policies across the finish line.
Though only one person with one vote, his role in pushing the state to strengthen the social safety net, build affordable housing and improve public schools is unmatched, they said.
“Frank Chopp was the greatest legislator in the last century. Period,” proclaimed Lt. Gov. Denny Heck, a close friend and fellow Democrat.
‘Relentless’
Chopp had two North Stars. 
There was his family: Nancy Long, his wife of 41 years, and Ellie and Narayan, their children. Chopp would tear up when he’d mention them on the House floor, for they were his touchstone.
He was “an equal partner at home,” doing the laundry and shopping and “showing up for the small stuff,” Long recounted. Amid the steady seriousness of the job, she said he was funny and “sometimes downright goofy.” 
His other North Star was adapting government to serve the state’s most vulnerable.
“His daily focus from the time he was in college to the very day he died was improving the lives of others,” Long said. “Frank started with no connections, no positional power, no money, no real standing. What he had were these very adaptive personal traits, a very solid understanding of history, a curious and amazingly agile mind and a total disregard for the status quo.”
Chopp was first elected to represent Seattle’s 43rd Legislative District in 1994, an election that proved catastrophic for many other Democrats. His party lost more than two dozen seats, going from a near supermajority in the House to a 62-36 minority.

He ascended to leader of the House Democratic Caucus and, in 1999, became co-speaker with Republican Clyde Ballard of East Wenatchee when there were equal numbers of Democrats and Republicans in the House.
Democrats won a special election in Snohomish County in 2001 to gain control of the chamber and installed Chopp as speaker in 2002, a job he kept until stepping aside in 2019. He won two more elections before retiring last year.
Chopp understood persistence and patience could achieve lasting progress while impatience could trigger a political recoil. 
“He believed it only mattered to be right if you were getting results,” Long said. 
As speaker, Chopp’s sometimes cautious approach, or pragmatism, depending on one’s perspective, incited the pique of the caucus’ more caffeinated progressives.
“He was not an incrementalist,” declared Mosqueda, who emceed the portion of the memorial devoted to building on Chopp’s legislative and political legacy. “He knew that bold, progressive victories require smart, strategic steps. He was relentless in his drive to dismantle inequity, and his strategies were thus layered and often multi-year.”
Inslee said Chopp recognized the potential that a temporary victory could derail policies and cause Democrats to lose seats.
“He made sure that we didn’t get too far out ahead of the people,” he said.
Chopp was the grandson of Croatian immigrants. His father began working in the Roslyn coal mines at age 12 and later became a union electrician at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard. His mother served as a school cafeteria employee. She left school at 14 to work but earned her high school diploma from Green River Community College at age 65, according to his obituary.
He grew up in Bremerton and graduated from the University of Washington. He served several years as executive director of the Fremont Public Association, now known as Solid Ground, which offers resources such as food banks, housing and employment programs.

In his 30 years as a lawmaker, he focused heavily on housing and homelessness, working to increase the amount of affordable housing across the state, improve access to homeownership and house people with intellectual and developmental disabilities.
He helped start the Seattle Tenants Union and the Cascade Shelter Project, living in a geodesic dome in a rented parking stall to bring attention to the need for affordable housing in the area.
He helped lead efforts to set up the state’s Housing Trust Fund and its Apple Health and Homes program, which uses Medicaid dollars to fund housing. Creation of the state’s covenant homeownership program was one of the crowning achievements of his tenure. 
Chopp also pushed policies to expand behavioral health care facilities, child care access and student financial aid for more Washingtonians. 
Yona Makowski, a longtime budget analyst with the House Democratic Caucus, said Chopp was “willing to break tradition and adapt government procedures” to achieve broader objectives. 
“I’ll lose my composure if I talk about what Frank meant to me,” she said, instead offering what her family members thought of him. “They knew him from me talking about him at the dinner table.”
“My son thought he was a great strategist in getting meaningful things done to help disadvantaged people. My daughter compared him to the Wizard of Oz behind the curtain, but if the wizard was actually the hero,” Makowski said. “And lastly, my late husband perhaps said it best, Frank was a very good man.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/20160111_122228ab-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-02 03:01:06.043030

(Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)A package of legislation that would have included tax cuts and an overhaul of state budget laws has stalled in the Louisiana Senate and is unlikely to regain momentum before lawmakers end their 2025 legislative session next week.
The package includes a proposed constitutional amendment that would have let lawmakers take $3 billion from an emergency savings account and use some of it to pay for income and sales tax cuts, among other things.
That proposal, sponsored by Rep. Julie Emerson, R-Carencro, received overwhelming bipartisan support from House lawmakers last month but has been sidelined until next year, according to Sen. Franklin Foil, R-Baton Rouge.
Foil, who chairs the Senate Committee on Revenue and Fiscal Affairs, said in an interview Sunday he and other senior lawmakers met with Emerson and Gov. Jeff Landry last week to discuss several fiscal bills being proposed this session.
“[After] our last meeting that we had with the governor, I don’t believe that we’ll be bringing that amendment through this session,” Foil said, adding that Emerson’s package of fiscal bills had him worried that it was all “too much, too fast.”  
Senate leaders are reluctant to green light more of a fiscal policy overhaul before they even see the results of the one they completed in a special session last fall. In November, lawmakers lowered and flattened both individual and corporate income taxes and increased the sales tax.  
Emerson, who chairs the House Ways & Means Committee, and other House Republicans have been on an aggressive path to lower the state income tax until they can eliminate it entirely. In a previous interview, Emerson said her goal is to “get to zero,” referring to a 0% tax rate. 
Emerson’s constitutional amendment would have allowed lawmakers to shift about $2 billion from the state Revenue Stabilization Fund into a separate savings account. The remaining $1 billion would be used to pay down debt, freeing up some money currently being spent on interest payments. 
But the current version of the amendment also formed the backbone of a plan that included using that extra cash to fund two separate tax cuts and make a pay stipend for teachers part of their permanent salary. Lawmakers have found a new way to pay for teacher stipends for another year and are continuing to work on it through a proposed amendment, but the tax cuts have stalled.
House Bill 667 would have cut Louisiana’s new 3% flat income tax to 2.75% and authorized a higher deduction for taxpayers age 65 and older. The bill was contingent on the amendment’s approval, and senators were concerned with an analysis from the Legislative Fiscal Office that estimated the measure could deprive the state of more than a billion dollars in revenue over a five-year period beginning in 2027. The Fiscal Office also stressed the difficulty in coming up with any estimate due to the lack of data reflecting the tax changes that took place in November.
“We didn’t even hear the income tax bill because that’s primarily what it did,” Foil said. “It was going to reduce income taxes even more than what we did during the special session in the fall. Many of us up here would like to see income taxes reduced, but we need to do it in a responsible way, and…we didn’t want to accelerate deficits for us either until we see how the finances level out.”
Another cut was in House Bill 578, which would have lowered the state sales tax from 5% to 4.75%. The rest of the bill restores some minor sales tax exemptions removed from state law during the special tax session last fall. The Senate Revenue & Fiscal Affairs Committee advanced an amended version of the bill Sunday that no longer contains the sales tax rate cut. It is now pending a vote on the Senate floor. 
Outside of the committee room Sunday, Emerson, who is typically responsive to reporters, offered only short answers as to how she felt about the setback to her legislation.
“I mean, it is what it is. They took it out,” she said.
The legislative session ends June 12.

It is moral. The Democratic governor of our state should address and combat extreme concentration of wealth, not embody and enable it.","Sixty-six days into Donald Trump’s second term, Gov. Ned Lamont convened a press conference at the University of Connecticut Health Center to announce the rescission of roughly $155 million in federal public health funding to Connecticut. The cuts would gut infectious disease surveillance, newborn genetic screening, and childhood immunization programs. 
“We have been modeling out potential outcomes and monitoring funding for critical programs,” said Lamont, Senate President Martin Looney, and Speaker Matt Ritter in a joint statement the following day, committing: “we will review these on a case-by-case basis  to understand the impact and protect our most essential   programs.”

Justin Etheridge
The additional $880 billion in federal cuts to Medicare, Medicaid, food assistance, special education, and more currently under debate in Washington is already projected to cost Connecticut at least $1 billion. And so it begins. Across the country, Democratic oﬃcials at every level will organize —publicly and politically— to fend oﬀ crippling federal cuts to essential public services.
Unfortunately, the state of Connecticut could not be in a worse position to endure the coming troubles of a second Trump administration. Not because of a lack of resources —but because of a lack of will. A lack of moral character. For six years, the state has been governed by a brand of fiscal caution that has been marketed successfully as “responsible” leadership. But it couldn’t be further from the  truth.
When he was sworn in in 2019, Governor Lamont faced a projected $1.5 billion deficit—a hole he and state lawmakers closed with a variety of creative solutions. One was diverting $170 million in vehicle sales tax revenue from the Special Transportation Fund (STF) to the General Fund. Notably, full dedication of this revenue stream to the STF was later achieved by FY2023 —a promise kept. Kudos to Lamont and company: actually, a deft budget move.
There were more risky maneuvers as well—saving $183 million in one year and $189 million in another by restructuring the state’s pension obligations to teachers and public employees. The changes extended the state’s pension debt schedule from 2032 to 2050, while wisely lowering the assumed return on investment from 8% to 6.9% (though 6% would have been more realistic). But two more decades of sustained economic growth to make ballooning payments is a risky bet—especially now, in an era of federal upheaval, inflation shocks, tariﬀ-driven price hikes (and the profit-padding they conceal), sticky interest rates, and ballooning federal debt,  all in service of extreme wealth concentration. When future lawmakers complain about “leaders of both parties” who “passed the buck” or “kicked the can down the road,” they’ll be talking about Governor Lamont, that budget, and those  votes.
There were additional savings—$460 million over two years—from sacrifices made by our state workers—furlough days, delayed bonuses, three years of wage freezes, and higher employee contributions to healthcare and pensions. These weren’t theoretical cuts. They meant smaller paychecks, delayed promotions, steeper out-of-pocket costs, and more worry in the lives of   the people who plow and repair our roads, process benefit applications, ensure our public safety.
And while workers gave more, the administration drew it’s only red line: no new taxes on the wealthy. There were gestures of progressivity—$6.3 million in revenue from a modest tax increase on real estate transactions for homeowners moving out of state and selling their houses for more than $2.5 million. A pretty penny of $50 million was taken in from trimming a 93% tax credit giveaway to owners of “pass through entities”—law firms, real estate   groups, private equity funds—down to 87.5%, which still remains a pretty generous giveaway to help wealthy business owners avoid state and local tax (SALT) deduction caps while the rest of us pay extra taxes for the same reason.
But by and away, the bulk of new revenue in Lamont’s first budget came from a broad-based scheme of regressive taxes and fees. A total of $218.4 million was raised through sales tax increases on services like parking, laundry, dry cleaning, interior design, online sales, and digital downloads (which, as a member of a digitally native generation—I hate paying). And perhaps most egregiously of all, the budget taxed prepared grocery items—literally taking food out of people’s shopping carts. Could you imagine proposing an increase to grocery prices today?
In the years that followed, Connecticut’s budget outlook didn’t just stabilize—it soared. The state became flush with cash not because of Lamont’s tax policy, but because of a rare confluence of economic conditions: soaring stock market gains among the wealthy, record corporate profits, inflated consumer spending driven by stimulus, a pandemic housing boom, and $2.8 billion in one-time federal COVID relief. In short, the windfall came from the very top of the economy—and from circumstances unlikely to  repeat.
Connecticut went from a $1.5 billion deficit in 2019 to record-shattering surpluses: $569 million  in 2020, $1.7 billion in 2021, $4.3 billion in 2022, and $1.9 billion in 2023. By 2024, the Rainy Day Fund hit its statutory cap of 18% of the General Fund, totaling $4.1 billion. The excess was used to pay down pension debt—more than $8.5 billion in supplemental payments between 2020 and 2024.
But while the balance sheets were glowing, Connecticut’s public services were quietly hollowing out. After more than a decade of flat funding, state-contracted nonprofits— responsible for mental health care, housing support, substance use treatment, re-entry programs, and services for people with disabilities—now operate with 30% less buying power than they had in 2007. Nearly 2,000 people sit on waitlists at the Department of Social Services, unable to access basic care. At Connecticut’s community colleges, over 400 permanent positions will be cut. Entire staﬀs eliminated from oﬃces like Career  Services.
Cafeteria workers laid oﬀ, shutting down food operations. Oﬃce administrators, tutors, ESL instructors, and librarians sent home, slashing library hours and student support across multiple campuses. Funny, from a governor who once featured his public school students in his campaign ads.
At a May Day Rally on May 1, on the New Haven Green, I witnessed a licensed practical nurse who worked at a state-aﬃliated nursing home take the stage. He was a Black man of large stature, caring for people’s parents, grandparents —and caring for us, seniors. He said that the facility had only been supplied with medium gloves. He held out his hand, opened his palm to the crowd, and declared: “These hands don’t fit medium gloves.” He went on to describe coworkers buying hand soap from the dollar store with their own paychecks because the state did not provide any. Then he described having to tape two diapers together to fit a patient because they didn’t have diapers in the right size. I  cried.
SEIU 1199NE—the union representing nearly 5,700 nursing home workers across 51 facilities in Connecticut—is demanding a long-overdue investment in the caregiving workforce. The union is seeking to raise starting wages to $25 per hour, with increases over time to $30— wages that would oﬀer basic stability to caregivers like the one I saw speak on the  Green. These are not the workers we want stressed, sleep-deprived, and struggling in a constant state of scarcity. To meet the union’s demands, the state would need to invest an additional $275 million per year in Medicaid funding, roughly half of which would be reimbursed by the federal government.
Connecticut’s community nonprofits are requesting a $264 million increase for FY26. This funding would support a 6% cost-of-living adjustment for providers, a Medicaid rate increase, and the annualization of one-time coronavirus funding. Staﬃng shortages are impacting service delivery, with more than 80% of health and human services nonprofits struggling to recruit and retain staﬀ due to uncompetitive wages. Two-thirds report having waiting lists stretching from weeks to months, and almost half have been forced to cut programs, reduce capacity, or turn away clients. More than 60% say they are operating at a deficit or with dangerously thin margins.
Senate President Martin Looney has introduced measures such as a “mansion tax,” which would impose a 1-mill tax on homes assessed over $1.5 million and a 2-mill tax on those  over $2 million, potentially generating up to $660 million annually. Alongside Majority Leader Bob Duﬀ, he also proposed raising the top two income tax brackets, which could generate another $420 million annually. 
This year, the Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee advanced a 1.75% capital gains surcharge on Connecticut’s wealthiest residents—projected to raise $284 million annually. Despite repeated introduction, none of these proposals have ever been included in the final budget package negotiated with Governor Lamont. This year is the  year.
This is not about what lies in the state’s coﬀers. It’s about what lies in the heart of our   governor —and the intentions of those around him who enable and celebrate his leadership. In a state so often described as being in permanent fiscal crisis, one would think the need for new revenue would be self-evident. And yet, time and again, revenue solutions are avoided —not because they don’t exist, but because they’re considered politically toxic.
A budget is a moral document. Show me your budget—and I’ll show you your values. Where are the morally courageous leaders who will say: I will generate revenue for this state from the right places —not by cutting funds for soap and sanitary products in nursing homes, but by asking for a few more cents on the dollar from those buying mansions, docking yachts, or taking helicopter rides from their back yards? 
Connecticut’s crisis is no longer fiscal. It is moral. The Democratic governor of our state should address and combat extreme concentration of wealth, not embody and enable it, as he stewards our public services.

Imagine our towns beginning to mirror San Francisco’s streets, where rampant homelessness has crushed public safety, chased businesses, and gutted community pride. 
This grim future awaits Connecticut, including Greenwich, if House Bill 7033 becomes law. This legislation, if passed in Hartford, will erode both communal compassion and civic order. There will be nothing legally Greenwich or any town can do to stop this law from being implemented.
A brief background: In 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court’s City of Grants Pass v. Johnson decision backed a principle that towns can enforce ordinances to keep public spaces safe. The 6-3 ruling confirmed that fining or jailing people camping on public property does not violate the Eighth Amendment (“cruel and unusual punishment”), even with scarce shelter. This empowers municipalities to protect parks, sidewalks, and greens for residents, free from legal roadblocks.
H.B. 7033, being crafted in Connecticut’s Housing Committee would gut this power. Titled “An Act Prohibiting A Municipality From Imposing Any Penalty On Homeless Persons For Performing Life-Sustaining Activities On Public Land,” it bans penalizing sleeping or stashing belongings on public property. Democrats, never content to leave a proven bad policy alone, have doubled down on failure with this bill, testing liberals’ vaunted tolerance for homeless encampments except perhaps in their own back yards. If passed, it would squash Grants Pass vs. Johnson aligned ordinances,    forcing towns to endure encampments indefinitely. Connecticut could soon resemble San Francisco, where over 8,000 homeless, open drug use, and public health disasters swamp public spaces.
San Francisco’s collapse is a frightful warning. Its soft policies on homelessness fuelled crime surges and business exodus, desecrating a vibrant and beautiful city. Connecticut, with 3,410 unhoused in 2024, isn’t immune from this result. New Haven’s Democratic Mayor Justin Elicker slams the bill, saying it cripples towns’ ability to blend compassion and order. He’s the lone prominent Democrat voice thus far speaking out against this bill. 
Greenwich Democrat Reps. Stephen Meskers and Hector Arzeno have been characteristically silent regarding the bill. Their silence suggests either consent or insufficient worry to stand up against this bill in defense of Greenwich before it gains frightening legislative traction. Perhaps they even agree with it but are too timid to say so to their constituents? Greenwich’s first term Republican Rep. Tina Courpas, the ranking member on the Housing Committee, voted “No” for the bill to proceed.
Republicans propose a more common-sense approach: let towns forge solutions while funding fixes like shelters and job training. A strong economy and lower taxes would foster opportunity and do much to prevent widespread homelessness. H.B. 7033 provides zero dollars for housing, dumping encampment and safety costs on municipalities and towns. With Connecticut’s budget strained, Greenwich taxpayers will get stuck with all the costs.
Connecticut’s strength is its safe, thriving towns. H.B. 7033 risks turning parks into squatter camps, diminishing property values, safety, and civic pride. Grants Pass v. Johnson equips municipalities to act decisively; H.B. 7033 rips those tools  away.
Lawmakers must kill this bill, champion local control, discipline, and solutions lifting the unhoused while safeguarding towns. Keep Connecticut’s streets clean and secure—not a mirror of San Francisco’s failed policies.

Electricity rates have risen by over 30% over the last decade, and heating bill hikes are headed in the same direction. 
Just last fall, Yankee Gas requested bill hikes of 43%, an increase of more than $45 per month.
Local leaders, state officials, and residents alike have sounded the alarm on rising energy costs. The state legislature has responded, introducing a handful of bills this session aimed at tackling the problem with a broad range of remedies. So far, the majority have focused on only one half of the equation – electricity bills.
We also desperately need to bring down costs for those who heat with natural gas. One idea in the spotlight uses an old and misunderstood playbook: expand Connecticut’s access to natural gas supply.
This concept has elicited a range of reactions, but let’s consider it in earnest for a moment. Natural gas heats over a third of Connecticut homes. Couldn’t additional gas bring relief on winter bills?
Let’s start by looking at the gas supply.
In recent years, we’ve seen several gas price spikes from extreme weather events like Winter Storm Uri, geopolitical events, and other supply constraints. Gas prices are also historically volatile, making it difficult for households to plan for utility costs. Now, the Energy Information Administration is projecting that the cost of gas this upcoming fall will be almost double the cost from 2024.
Expanding reliance on gas supply only locks Connecticut into an unpredictable and expensive energy future. There’s no way out of this problem – New England doesn’t have any gas reserves or production – Connecticut relies on interstate pipelines to import fuel from other regions. It turns out we can’t simply open the spigot.
Beyond the gas itself, we need pipelines to transport it safely.
This means repairing and likely replacing aging gas infrastructure and expanding gas pipeline networks. That’s an expensive undertaking, and a slow one, especially given that Connecticut ranks No. 4 in the country for miles of old pipe needing attention.
According to 2023 filings, the Connecticut Natural Gas Corporation (CNG) and the Southern Connecticut Gas Company (SCG) cost-per-mile to replace gas mains were $1.4 million to $2.9 million and $1.5 million to $1.9 million, respectively.
Replacement costs are soaring across the country, especially in urban areas. New York gas utilities paid over $3 million per mile and Massachusetts utilities paid up to $6M for pipe replacements in some residential Boston neighborhoods.
Because these costs are up everywhere, and because the headwinds facing the industry are larger than simply construction cost inflation, gas utility planning and cost-containment is formally being reviewed in various states.
New York, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Maine, New Jersey, Maryland, Minnesota, Colorado, California, Washington, Oregon and Illinois are all asking for insights into these costs increases, and assessing how to meaningfully combat them, rather than pre-supposing that the solution is to spend billions of additional ratepayer dollars in the same way that we always have.
A necessary first step to getting a solution for Connecticut is to open a proceeding at the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority (PURA) to examine the long-term costs of the gas system, its interdependencies with the electric system, potential lower-cost solutions to bring down bills, and what other states are doing to combat this same problem. An uncontested docket at PURA comes at no cost to ratepayers.
This proceeding will gather critical information on today’s gas infrastructure and supply costs and bring transparency into the assumptions the utilities are making about the future. With this information in hand, legislators and utility regulators will be able to make better decisions to combat this growing heating affordability crisis.
To plan for an affordable energy future, we need to look forward, not backward. Legislators should issue a practical directive to PURA to open a gas system study as a first step to ensure that Connecticut homes get the most cost-effective and reliable energy solutions.

This is not short-term care, and these are not short-term patients. We’re one of only two hospitals in the country providing this level of long-term, specialty care to both children and adults. And we do it as a nonprofit:  more than 85% of our patients rely on Medicaid coverage.

Crista Durand
That makes state budget decisions —particularly around Medicaid reimbursement rates —critical to our ability to continue providing this care.
After years of flat funding, we are hopeful that a modest Medicaid rate increase for chronic disease hospitals will be preserved in the final state budget. It’s an important step, and we are deeply grateful to the legislators and state officials who understand what’s at stake and have prioritized investments in the Hospital for Special Care and the patients we serve. We remain steadfast in our mission to provide highly specialized care to individuals and families who need it most.
But make no mistake: this must be the beginning, not the end, of our shared effort to protect access to complex care in Connecticut.
The population we serve is growing. Children with autism spectrum disorder are being diagnosed earlier and in greater numbers. Our comprehensive autism center, which includes inpatient and outpatient services, is one of the most advanced in the nation and provides the only in-patient services in the state. At the same time, more adults are surviving catastrophic illness or injury, requiring weeks, months, or even years of post-acute care. Our long-standing programs in spinal cord injury, acquired brain injury, heart failure, and ventilator weaning are expanding too.


This level of care requires staff, space, technology, and time. In healthcare, all these things are expensive.
Our services are designed to be intensive and resource-rich because that’s what these patients require to recover and thrive. We run ventilator units, invest in adaptive technology, and provide therapies that rebuild lives. This kind of care isn’t billable the way a routine hospital visit might be —but for our patients, it’s life-changing and often life-saving.
If reimbursement doesn’t keep pace, the long-term cost isn’t just financial. It shows up in emergency rooms overwhelmed by patients who can’t be transferred to the appropriate level of care. It shows up in working parents forced to leave jobs to care for medically fragile children at home. It shows up in missed rehabilitation windows, lost function, and preventable complications. Connecticut cannot afford to let that happen. We need to create a healthier state, where we can live and thrive together.
To some, Medicaid rate adjustments may look like lines on a budget spreadsheet. But to us —and to the families we serve— they determine what kind of care is possible, and where that care happens. Without sufficient support, specialized hospitals like ours will be forced to make difficult decisions: scaling back services, reducing capacity, or in some cases, closing programs altogether. And when that happens, patients don’t just lose access; they lose precious time that cannot be recovered.
The hardworking staff at Hospital for Special Care will keep doing what we’ve always done: taking on the hardest cases, treating the whole person, and redefining what recovery can mean. We’re proud to serve as a cornerstone of Connecticut’s healthcare system, but we can’t do it alone.
If we want this system to remain strong and equitable —for everyone— then support for specialized care must be a priority. We’ve upheld our commitment to the patients of Connecticut. We hope the state will continue to stand with us, so we can stand with them.

Six victims ranging in age from 67 to 88 years old were transported to hospitals in the region, police said. One was described as being in critical condition, with other victims’ injuries ranging from serious to minor.
The suspect, 45-year-old Mohamed Sabry Saliman, was taken into custody by police and was being treated for minor injuries at a hospital, Mark D. Michalek, special agent in charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Denver field office, said during a Sunday evening press conference.
“Witnesses are reporting that the subject used a makeshift flamethrower and threw an incendiary device into the crowd,” Michalek said.
The attack took place near the Boulder County Courthouse on the Pearl Street Mall, an area in the heart of the city that typically attracts hundreds of people on the weekend. The first calls about the attack came at 1:26 p.m., Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn said earlier Sunday.
“The initial callers indicated that there was a man with a weapon and that people were being set on fire,” he said. “When we arrived, we encountered multiple victims that were injured with injuries consistent with burns and other injuries.”
Participants in the Boulder branch of Run For Their Lives, which organizes events calling for the immediate release of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza, were in the area at the time of the attack.
Michalek said the suspect was “heard to yell ‘Free Palestine’ during the attack.” He called it a “targeted act of violence” and said the FBI was investigating it as an act of terrorism.
Kash Patel, director of the FBI, earlier on Sunday called the incident a “targeted terror attack,” and Colorado Gov. Jared Polis said it was a “heinous act of terror.”
The Anti-Defamation League said on social media it was “monitoring the situation in Colorado.”
Joe Neguse, a Democrat who represents Boulder in the U.S. House, characterized the attack as targeting Jewish people.
“I am horrified by the heinous act of terror that took place in downtown Boulder this afternoon,” he said in a statement. “Tonight, as many prepare to mark the Shavuot holiday, our Jewish community has been subjected to yet another brutal and horrific act of violence. The scourge of antisemitism has metastasized across our country, and we must do more — now — to stop this hatred and violence.”
Phil Weiser, Colorado’s attorney general, indicated the group was targeted.
“From what we know, this attack appears to be a hate crime given the group that was targeted,” Weiser said in a statement. “People may have differing views about world events and the Israeli-Hamas conflict, but violence is never the answer to settling differences. Hate has no place in Colorado.”

Jeff Landry.,"Senate President Cameron Henry, R-Metairie, helped lead an effort to reduce funding in the state budget for a new private education voucher program that Gov. Jeff Landry has pushed. (Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)The Republican-led Louisiana Senate Finance Committee has removed public money meant to expand the use of private education vouchers in spite of the initiative being a priority for fellow Republican Gov. Jeff Landry. 

The committee agreed Sunday to cut $50 million from LA GATOR, Landry’s initiative launching in the 2025-26 school year. The reduction will leave $44 million for the program, enough to continue covering private school tuition for 6,000 students who already receive state-funded vouchers. 
Landry and the Louisiana House wanted to put an additional $50 million into LA GATOR so the state could give out 5,300 new vouchers next school year, for approximately 11,300 overall. 
The cut was one of the biggest shakeups in the Senate leadership’s initial version of the $43 billion state budget unveiled Sunday. The Senate and House must come together to reach a compromise on the spending plan by June 12. 
Senate President Cameron Henry, R-Metairie, has been resolute in his opposition to giving out more vouchers in the coming year. For weeks, he has expressed concern that LA GATOR’s cost could grow faster than the state can afford it, and that the state’s existing voucher program hasn’t resulted in better education outcomes for students enrolled in it.
Still, Landry and conservative groups who back LA GATOR have been putting pressure on senators to keep the $50 million in the program. They are running advertisements and recently held a rally next to the Capitol pushing for additional vouchers for the program.
Some senators were also reluctant to explain why the money had been removed Sunday. 
Senate Finance Committee Chairman Glen Womack, R-Harrisonburg, and Sen. Rick Edmonds, who sponsored the bill to set up LA GATOR last year, allowed the state budget bill with the cut to move forward, but they declined to comment after the committee meeting. 
Louisiana Education Superintendent Cade Brumley, one of LA GATOR’s biggest proponents, also refused to comment on the budget change after the committee hearing. Brumley said he had not had a chance to review the adjustment to the program yet. 
Yet based on the assumption that the number of vouchers offered would grow, Brumley had opened applications for the program across the state earlier this spring. Nearly 40,000 families have applied for the limited slots. 
At least some of the $50 million taken from LA GATOR is going to be used to restore $30 million to a targeted tutoring program for public elementary school students. Brumley attributed some of Louisiana’s success on national math and reading tests to the tutoring program and said he was grateful it had been added back into the budget. 
Landry, Senate hope for hundreds of millions in federal Medicaid funding 
The Republican Senate leadership’s version of the budget also adds hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funding to the state Medicaid budget. The money would be used to pay physicians and hospitals a higher reimbursement rate for treating Medicaid patients. 

Landry asked the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services earlier this year to allow Louisiana’s medical providers to receive a rate for treating Medicaid patients closer to what private insurers provide. 

The federal government has not agreed pay the new rate yet. But if it does, it will increase Louisiana’s federal Medicaid funding by $500 million in the state budget cycle that starts June 1. Hundreds of millions of federal  dollars could also be given to Louisiana to retroactively cover payments in the current budget year that ends June 30. 
Louisiana’s request for more Medicaid funding comes at a time when President Donald Trump and U.S. House Republicans, including House Speaker Mike Johnson and House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, are pushing for ways to reduce the nation’s overall spending on Medicaid. But the reimbursement rates are not expected to be affected by changes Congress is considering. 
UNO transfer to LSU System comes with debt relief

The Senate has added $20 million in its budget proposal for the University of Louisiana System to pay off debt associated with the University of New Orleans, which is likely to move over to the LSU System this summer. 
The Senate has also included nearly $2 million for the UL System to continue a youth recreation partnership at UNO for another year and $450,000 for LSU to conduct an “academic and finance” audit of UNO in the next fiscal cycle. 

Sheriffs will get paid more to hold state inmates
The Senate added $11.6 million to the budget in order to give local sheriffs $3 more per day per inmate to house state adult inmates in their local jails. 

Currently, sheriffs are paid $26.39 per day per inmate to house state prisoners.
Louisiana keeps approximately 15,800 inmates in local parish jails instead of state prisons. This includes almost 2,000 state prisoners who are in transitional work programs, where they hold jobs at private businesses in the community while living at the jail. 
Louisiana DOGE gets money, staff to find efficiencies 

The Senate has added $1.5 million into the budget to support the so-called “Louisiana DOGE” initiative Landry set up to search for government efficiencies.

(Photos via Florida Senate and Florida House of Representatives)Florida legislators are finally heading back to Tallahassee to wrap up their work for the year.
Senate President Ben Albritton and House Speaker Daniel Perez announced late Friday that closed-door negotiations had yielded a breakthrough on the state budget as legislative leaders agreed to a “framework” they will use to draw up a final budget bill.
The plan as outlined in memos to House and Senate members is for legislators to begin formal budget conference meetings on Tuesday with the goal of voting out a new budget for 2025-26 by June 16. Florida’s fiscal year starts on July 1.
The main job each year of the Florida Legislature is to pass an annual budget which authorizes billions in spending on education, healthcare, the environment, transportation, public safety, and more. The lingering standoff on the budget had led to the possibility of a state government shutdown 
While many details remain unclear, the deal announced on Friday would yield a substantial tax cut break for businesses versus a much smaller set of tax cuts for Florida families. The agreement does not include any consideration of a cut in the sales tax rate that had been championed by Perez and House Republicans.
Legislators left town in early May after failing to pass a budget during their 60-day session. On its final day, the House and Senate agreed to extend until June 6. At the time, Albritton and Perez announced an agreement to cut taxes by $2.8 billion, including a cut in the state’s sales tax.
But that deal fell apart after Gov. Ron DeSantis warned he’d veto it, lest it undercut his push to reduce property taxes. Albritton backed away from the earlier deal. That decision prompted sharp criticism from Perez, who said that Albritton had broken his word.
The new agreement calls for $2.25 billion in “revenue reductions” that include the elimination of the sales tax charged on commercial leases and business rent that is estimated to cost $900 million. 
The two sides also agreed to $350 million in “permanent sales tax exemptions targeted toward Florida families.” The memo did not explain exactly what exemptions, although the Senate previously had suggested eliminating some taxes charged on shoes and clothes.
The rest of the revenue reductions, however, would include $200 million for paying down existing state debt and $750 million that would eventually be placed in the Budget Stabilization Fund. The size of that “rainy day fund”  is now capped, so legislative leaders would ask voters in 2026 to approve raising that limit. In the meanwhile, they want to set aside money in reserves that will eventually go to the fund.

(Nadav Soroker/Searchlight New Mexico)
COUNSELOR, N.M. – On a Tuesday in March, Billton Werito drove his son Amari toward his house in Counselor, New Mexico, navigating the bumpy dirt road that winds through a maze of natural gas pipelines, wellheads and water tanks. Amari should have been in school, but a bout of nausea and a dull headache kept him from class.

“To me the surprise was certainly the magnitude of the effects” of air pollution on students, said Mike Gilraine, a professor of economics at Simon Fraser University. “It’s hard to find a similar factor that would have such an impact on schools nationwide.”

“It happens a lot,” Amari explained from the backseat, glancing up from his Nintendo Switch. The symptoms usually show up when the sixth-grader smells an odor of “rotten egg with propane” that rises from nearby natural gas wells and wafts over Lybrook Elementary School, where he and some 70 other Navajo students attend class. His little brother often misses school for the same reason.
“They just keep getting sick,” Amari’s father, Billton, said. “I have to take them out of class because of the headaches. Especially the younger one, he’s been throwing up and won’t eat.” The symptoms are putting the kids at risk of falling further behind in school.

Lybrook sits in the heart of New Mexico’s San Juan Basin, a major oil and gas deposit that, along with the Permian Basin in the state’s southeast, is supplying natural gas that meets much of the nation’s electricity demand.
The gas pulled from tens of thousands of wells in New Mexico has reaped huge benefits for the entire country. Natural gas has become a go-to fuel for power plants from coast to coast, sometimes replacing dirtier coal-fired plants and, by extension, improving air quality. Locally, oil and gas companies employ thousands of workers, often in areas with few other opportunities, all while boosting the state’s budget with billions in royalty payments.
But those benefits may come at a cost for thousands of students in New Mexico whose schools sit near oil and gas pipelines, wellheads and flare stacks. An Associated Press analysis of state and federal data found 694 oil and gas wells with new or active permits within a mile of a school in the state. This means that around 29,500 students in 74 schools and pre-schools potentially face exposure to noxious emissions, as extraction from the ground can release unhealthy fumes.
A measurable effect on students
At Lybrook, where Amari just finished sixth grade, fewer than 6 percent of students are proficient at math, and only a fifth meet state standards for science and reading proficiency.
Other factors could help explain students’ poor achievement. Poverty rates are higher in some areas with high levels of gas development, and students at rural schools overall tend to face challenges that can adversely affect academic performance. AP’s analysis found that two-thirds of the schools within a mile of an oil or gas well were low-income, and the population is around 24 percent Native American and 45 percent Hispanic.
But research has found that student learning is directly harmed by air pollution from fossil fuels — even when socioeconomic factors are taken into account.
And it’s not just New Mexico where this is a risk. An AP analysis of data from the Global Oil and Gas Extraction Tracker found over 1,000 public schools across 13 states that are within five miles of a major oil or gas field. Major fields are collections of wells that produce the highest amount of energy in a state.
“This kind of air pollution has a real, measurable effect on students,” said Mike Gilraine, a professor of economics at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver, Canada, who studies connections between air quality and student performance.
In 2024, Gilraine cowrote a study showing that student test scores were closely associated with air contamination. Each measured increase in PM2.5, a type of pollution created from the burning of fossil fuels, was associated with a significant decline in student test scores, Gilraine found. Conversely, researchers have documented that reductions in air pollution have led to higher test scores and fewer absences.
“To me the surprise was certainly the magnitude of the effects” of air pollution on students, Gilraine said. “It’s hard to find a similar factor that would have such an impact on schools nationwide.”
America’s shift to natural gas has resulted in substantial increases in student achievement nationwide, Gilraine’s research shows, as it has displaced dirtier coal and led to cleaner air on the whole. But there has been little data on air quality across New Mexico, even as it has become one of the most productive states in the nation for natural gas. State regulators have installed only 20 permanent air monitors, most in areas without oil or gas production.

Independent researchers have extensively studied the air quality near schools in at least two locations in the state, however. One is Lybrook, which sits within a mile of 17 active oil and gas wells.
In 2024, scientists affiliated with Princeton and Northern Arizona universities conducted an air-monitoring study at the school, finding that levels of pollutants — including benzene, a cancer-causing byproduct of natural gas production that is particularly harmful to children — were spiking during school hours, to nearly double the levels known to cause chronic or acute health effects.
That research followed a 2021 health impact assessment that was done with support from several local nonprofits and foundations, which analyzed the effects of the area’s oil and gas development on residents.
The findings were startling: More than 90 percent of people surveyed suffered from sinus problems. Nosebleeds, shortness of breath and nausea were widespread. The report attributed the symptoms to the high levels of pollutants that researchers found — including, near Lybrook, hydrogen sulfide, a compound that gives off the sulfur smell that Amari Werito associated with his headaches.
Those studies helped confirm what many community members already knew, said Daniel Tso, a community leader who served on the committee that oversaw the 2021 health impact assessment.
“The children and the grandchildren need a safe homeland,” Tso said during an interview in March, standing outside a cluster of gas wells within a mile of Lybrook Elementary.

“You smell that?” he said, nodding towards a nearby wellhead, which smelled like propane. “That’s what the kids at the school are breathing in. I’ve had people visiting this area from New York. They spend five minutes here and say, ‘Hey, I got a headache.’ And the kids are what, six hours a day at the school breathing this?”
Lybrook school officials did not respond to requests for comment.
Despite risks, oil and gas can pump money into schools
Researchers have identified similar air quality problems in New Mexico’s southeast.
In 2023, a team of scientists from a coalition of universities conducted a detailed, yearlong study of the air in Loving, a small town in the Permian Basin. Local air quality, researchers found, was worse than in downtown Los Angeles, and the tested air contained the fifth-highest level of measured ozone contamination in the U.S.
The source of the ozone — a pollutant that’s especially hazardous to children — was the area’s network of gas wells and related infrastructure. Some of that infrastructure sits within a half-mile of a campus that houses Loving’s elementary, middle and high schools.
A small group of residents has spoken out about the area’s air quality, saying it has caused respiratory problems and other health issues. But for most locals, any concerns about pollution are outweighed by the industry’s economic benefits.
Representatives of the oil and gas industry have claimed the air quality studies themselves are not trustworthy.
“There needs to be a robust study to actually answer these questions,” said Andrea Felix, vice president of regulatory affairs for the New Mexico Oil and Gas Association (NMOGA). Felix said other sources of emissions, such as cars and trucks, are likely a larger source of air quality problems near wells.

“Companies follow the best available science” for well placement and emissions controls, Felix said, and also contribute huge amounts of money to the state’s education budget through streams like royalties and direct expenditures. In the most recent fiscal year, oil and gas revenue supported $1.7 billion in K-12 spending in New Mexico, according to a NMOGA report.
Officials with Loving Municipal Schools are also skeptical of the alarm over the wells. Loving Superintendent Lee White said the school district used funds from the oil and gas industry to pay for a new wing at the elementary school, a science lab for students, turf on the sports field and training and professional development for teachers. He said the industry’s contributions to state coffers can’t be ignored.
“Are we willing to give that up because people say our air is not clean?” he said during an interview. “It’s just as clean as anywhere else.”
As White spoke, a drill rig worked a couple of miles east of Loving’s elementary school while parents poured into the gymnasium to watch kindergartners collect their diplomas. White touted the district’s success, saying the elementary school scores above state averages for reading, math and science proficiency, while Loving’s high school students far outpace the state average for college and career readiness.
But environmental groups, attorneys and residents continue to push for limits on drilling near schools.
Those efforts saw a boost in 2023, when New Mexico State Land Commissioner Stephanie Garcia Richard issued an executive order prohibiting new oil and gas leases on state-owned land within a mile of schools.
Industry representatives decried the move, saying it added potentially insurmountable costs and barriers to drilling operators. However, AP’s analysis found that relatively few wells would be impacted even if the rule applied to all of New Mexico; only around 1 percent of oil and gas wells in the state are within a mile of a school.
In the years since, residents of areas where exploration is heavy have lobbied for legislation prohibiting gas operations within a mile of schools, regardless of land status. That bill died in committee during the most recent session of the New Mexico legislature.
Advocates have also sued the state over an alleged lack of pollution controls. That suit is currently pending in state court.

(Photo by Erik Gunn/Wisconsin Examiner)Nurses at Meriter hospital in Madison returned to work Sunday with a new contract at the end of a five-day strike, the first in the hospital’s history.
The agreement, reached Saturday and ratified by union members late Saturday night, for the first time gives nurses direct input on staffing concerns at the hospital, said Pat Raes, president of Service Employees International Union (SEIU) Wisconsin and also a nurse at the hospital. Raes spoke at a short return-to-work rally Sunday morning outside the hospital.
While it falls short of establishing guaranteed ratios of patients to nurses, Raes said the new two-year contract  establishes a precedent by including  language about staffing concerns.
Wages will go up by 10% over two years, Raes said. She said the wage gain offered “meaningful raises” including 8% across the board and the other 2% for “step increases recognizing our experience and attracting new talent.” 
Raes said the contract also contains  “enforceable language” addressing the safety of health care staff and patients, including a commitment to install a metal detector by the end of the summer.
Staffing concerns and a push for the hospital to guarantee specific ratios of patients to nurses on duty were among the issues that the union stressed in contract negotiations and during the five-day walkout.
In public statements during the contract talks and strike, UnityPoint Health-Meriter officials said they shared the union’s concerns for safe staffing levels but opposed dictating ratios, claiming it would hinder  flexibility to respond to changing conditions.
Raes said the agreement builds on an existing system of committees in which nurses are in charge. “We really felt that was the format for having the staffing discussions and noting where those issues were,” she said Sunday.
The contract also commits the hospital to an annual discussion with the union on staffing concerns and issues, Raes said.

“This was a long and difficult negotiation,” Raes said. “We acknowledge Meriter’s management for ultimately coming to the table and reaching an agreement that prioritizes the needs of our patients and our dedicated professionals. Today, we turn the page.”
The final negotiating sessions were conducted with the aid of a mediator from the Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission (WERC).
“We did not want to walk,” said bargaining committee member Carol Lemke, “but we felt it was the only thing we could do” to get staffing-related language in the contract.
In a statement distributed by UnityPoint Health-Meriter Saturday night after the agreement was announced, Sherry Casali, the hospital’s chief nursing officer, said, “We are grateful for the dedication and hard work of everyone involved in the negotiations. This tentative agreement represents meaningful progress toward a contract that recognizes the important contributions of our nurses.”
Raes said the union is now turning its attention to state legislation lawmakers have reported they are drafting that would establish a state mandate for the ratios of health care workers to patients in health care institutions. 
After five days of large throngs of picketing nurses, the crowd outside the hospital Sunday morning was smaller. The scene was cheerful and celebratory, accompanied by a sense of relief.
Madison Mayor Satya Rhodes-Conway turned out for the 6:30 a.m. return-to-work rally.
“I want to thank you for your courage because I know this wasn’t easy,” she told the nurses.
While she said she was grateful “mostly to the nurses,” Rhodes-Conway also said she was “grateful to management for coming to the table and finally understanding that we are stronger when we collaborate.”
The contract was ratified Saturday night by “a supermajority” of nurses, Raes said. Although the union didn’t release the official vote count, Raes said, “We had more people vote for this contract than we have ever had vote in the past.”
The union pushed to ensure the votes were cast and counted before midnight because the pay increases take effect with the start of the next pay period, Sunday morning.
The timing was also important for another reason. Meriter management told the union and employees that nurses on strike would be removed from the list of active employees effective Sunday, which would end their health insurance coverage.
The union wanted to complete the ratification process Saturday night “so there would not be any issues — there would not be any threat,” Raes said.
“We have nurses that are being treated for long-term health issues that cannot afford to lose their insurance who were out striking, and we have had other ones that felt they had to cross the picket line to not risk their health insurance,” Raes said.
She said she doesn’t expect divisions among members because of those choices, however. “Everybody, all the nurses, will continue to work together and have each other’s back on the floors,” Raes said, “because that is how we have to work.”
  Striking nurses left the message “We would rather be working!” in chalk on the sidewalk in front of Meriter hospital in Madison. The graffiti was still visible Sunday morning as the nurses returned to work. (Photo by Erik Gunn/Wisconsin Examiner)

Consumer advocates are raising alarms about the Trump administration's failure to publicize a major E. coli outbreak. (Photo by Getty Images)Colton George felt sick. The 9-year-old Indiana boy told his parents his stomach hurt. He kept running to the bathroom and felt too ill to finish a basketball game.
Days later, he lay in a hospital bed, fighting for his life. He had eaten tainted salad, according to a lawsuit against the lettuce grower filed by his parents on April 17 in federal court for the Southern District of Indiana.
The E. coli bacteria that ravaged Colton’s kidneys was a genetic match to the strain that killed one person and sickened nearly 90 people in 15 states last fall. Federal health agencies investigated the cases and linked them to a farm that grew romaine lettuce.
But most people have never heard about this outbreak, which a Feb. 11 internal FDA memo linked to a single lettuce processor and ranch as the source of the contamination. In what many experts said was a break with common practice, officials never issued public communications after the investigation or identified the grower who produced the lettuce.
From failing to publicize a major outbreak to scaling back safety alert specialists and rules, the Trump administration’s anti-regulatory and cost-cutting push risks unraveling a critical system that helps ensure the safety of the U.S. food supply, according to consumer advocates, researchers and former employees at the FDA and U.S. Department of Agriculture.
The investigation into the illnesses began near the end of the Biden administration but work on the lettuce outbreak wasn’t completed until Feb. 11. At that time, the decision was made by the Trump administration not to release the names of the grower and processor because the FDA said no product remained on the market.
The administration also has withdrawn a proposed regulation to reduce the presence of salmonella in raw poultry, according to an April USDA alert. It was projected to save more than $13 million annually by preventing more than 3,000 illnesses, according to the proposal.
Officials from the Department of Health and Human Services have said that food safety is a priority, and FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said in an April 29 interview with the newsletterInside Medicine that the recent job cuts would not affect agency operations.
“The FDA had 9,500 employees in 2007. Last year it was nearly 19,000. Has the 100% increase in employees increased approval times, innovation, AI, food safety, or agency morale?” Makary asked. “No, it hasn’t. In fact, it’s increased regulatory creep.”
The FDA referred questions to HHS, which declined to comment or make Makary available for an interview. In a statement, the agency said “protecting public health and insuring food safety remain top priorities for HHS. FDA inspectors were not impacted [by job cuts] and this critical work will continue.”
Public health advocates warn companies and growers will face less regulatory oversight and fewer consequences for selling tainted food products as a result of recent FDA actions.
The administration is disbanding a Justice Department unit that pursues civil and criminal actions against companies that sell contaminated food and is reassigning its attorneys. Some work will be assumed by other divisions, according to a publicly posted memo from the head of the department’s criminal division and a white paper by the law firm Gibson Dunn.
The Justice Department did not respond to an email requesting comment.
“They need the DOJ to enforce the law,” said Sarah Sorscher, director of regulatory affairs at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a nonprofit consumer advocacy group. “For an executive investing in food safety, the knowledge they could go to jail if they don’t is a really strong motivator.”
Federal regulators also want states to conduct more inspections, according to two former FDA officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retaliation. But some Democratic lawmakers say states lack the resources to take over most food safety inspections.
“Handing that duty to state and local agencies is really troubling,” said Rep. Shontel M. Brown, D-Ohio. “They don’t have the resources, and it creates a potentially unsafe situation that puts families in Ohio and America at risk.”
 The high cost of foodborne illnesses

Foodborne illnesses exact a major economic toll in the United States, according to federal data, and cost thousands of lives each year. The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates the deaths, chronic illness, medical treatment, and lost productivity from food-related illnesses amounted to $75 billion in 2023.
Each year, about 48 million people in the U.S. get sick with foodborne illnesses, 128,000 are hospitalized, and 3,000 die, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
In its first few months, the administration has suspended a program known as the Food Emergency Response Network Proficiency Testing that ensures food-testing labs accurately identify pathogens that can sicken or kill, according to a former FDA official.
In March, the agency said it would delay from January 2026 to July 2028 compliance with a Biden-era rule that aims to speed up the identification and removal of potentially contaminated food from the market.
However, the FDA is taking aim at foreign food manufacturing, saying in a May 6 notice that it would expand unannounced inspections overseas.
“This expanded approach marks a new era in FDA enforcement — stronger, smarter, and unapologetically in support of the public health and safety of Americans,” the notice said.
Some former FDA and USDA officials said that goal isn’t realistic, because U.S. inspectors often need to obtain travel visas that can wind up alerting companies to their arrival.
“It’s really, really difficult to do surprise inspections,” said Brian Ronholm, director of food policy for Consumer Reports and a former USDA deputy undersecretary for food safety. “The visa process can alert the local authority.”
HHS declined to address Ronholm’s concerns.
The FDA hasn’t met the mandated targets for inspecting food facilities in the U.S. since fiscal year 2018, and the agency has consistently fallen short of meeting its annual targets for foreign inspections, according to a January report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office.
Foodborne illness can turn serious. Salmonella bacteria in cucumbers sickened dozens of people in April and May and left at least nine people hospitalized, according to the FDA. A 2008-09 salmonella outbreak in peanut butter killed nine, resulting in criminal charges against company executives. And E. coli in cookie dough sickened more than 70 people in 2009, including a Nevada mother who died of complications from eating the raw dough.
 ‘Life or death for our Sson’

E. coli, commonly found in feces, can be especially dangerous to children like Colton, the boy from Avon, Indiana, who ate contaminated lettuce. The bacteria can damage blood vessels and cause clots that destroy the kidneys, leading to strokes and comas. Consumers sickened by E. coli can pass it along to others, and, in some cases, the bacteria end up killing victims who never consumed the contaminated food.
By the time Colton’s mother brought him to the emergency room that November day, the bacteria were releasing toxins and damaging his blood cells and kidneys, according to his father, Chris George.
Colton was sent to Riley Hospital for Children in Indianapolis. Chris said doctors told him and his wife, Amber George, that their son was in kidney failure and the next 24 to 72 hours would determine whether he would survive, the father recalled.
“They said it was life or death for our son, and I was like, wait, he was just playing basketball,” said Chris, a firefighter. “I told them, ‘You do what you need to do to save my son.’”

Usually, the FDA alerts the public and identifies growers and food manufacturers when there are outbreaks like the one that sickened Colton. The FDA said in its February internal summary that the grower wasn’t named because no product remained on the market.
But Bill Marler, a Seattle lawyer who specializes in food-safety litigation and represents the George family, said the information is still important because it can prevent more cases, pressure growers to improve sanitation, and identify repeat offenders.
It also gives victims an explanation for their illnesses and helps them determine whom they might take legal action against, he said.
“Normally we would see the information on their websites,” Marler said, adding that the agency’s investigatory findings on the outbreak were “all redacted” and he obtained them through a Freedom of Information Act request.
The FDA, USDA, and CDC play central roles in overseeing food safety, including inspections and investigations. The FDA and CDC have been rocked by job cuts that are part of a reduction of 20,000 staff at HHS, their parent agency. The Agriculture Department has also shrunk its workforce.
Staffing cuts mean delays in publicizing deadly outbreaks, said Susan Mayne, an adjunct professor at Yale School of Public Health who retired from the FDA in 2023.
“Consumers are being notified with delays about important food safety notifications,” she said, referring to a recent outbreak in cucumbers. “People can die if there are pathogens like listeria, which can have a 30% fatality rate.”
Makary has said the cuts wouldn’t touch inspectors, reviewers, or scientists at the agency.
But the FDA laid off scientists in April who worked at food safety labs in Chicago and San Francisco, where they performed specialized analysis for food inspectors, former FDA officials said. The FDA later restored some positions.
“No scientists were fired? That was incorrect,” Mayne said.
Siobhan DeLancey, who worked in the agency’s Office of Foods and Veterinary Medicine for more than 20 years before she also was laid off in April, said new requirements for reviewing agency announcements became so arduous that it took weeks to get approval for alerts that should have been going out much sooner.
She said some employees who were laid off include communications specialists and web staff who do consumer outreach aimed at preventing illness. The USDA and FDA have been bringing some workers back or are asking some who accepted deferred resignations to take back their decisions.
“It’s all about destruction and not about efficiency,” DeLancey said. “We’re going to see the effects for years. It will cost lives.”
HHS did not respond to an email seeking a response to DeLancey’s comments.
For 13 days, Colton stayed on dialysis at the hospital, initially unable to eat or drink. His mother wet a sponge to moisten his lips and tongue.
He turned 10 in the hospital. Chris George bought paint markers to make signs on the windows of his son’s room.
“I am not happy with the CDC and FDA,” Chris George said. “Victims have a right to know who made them sick. This is my kid. He’s my life.”
Colton was able to leave the hospital almost three weeks after first eating the contaminated lettuce but still has nightmares about the ordeal and is seeing a therapist.
“The whole ‘Make America Healthy Again,’ the focus on taking food color dyes out of cereal?” said Chris George, who objects to the Trump administration’s decision to redact information about the grower in the February report. “How about we take E. coli out of our lettuce, so it doesn’t kill our kids?”

(Photo courtesy of Aqeela Sherrills)Community-based violence intervention programs nationwide have long worked alongside law enforcement officers to deescalate conflict, prevent retaliatory shootings and, in some cases, arrive at crime scenes before police do.
In many communities, these initiatives have been credited with saving lives and reducing violence.
But the Trump administration last month abruptly terminated at least 373 public safety grants from the U.S. Department of Justice’s Office of Justice Programs, pulling roughly $500 million in remaining funds across a range of programs, according to a new report by the Council on Criminal Justice, a nonprofit think tank. The cuts come just as summer is approaching — a season when violence consistently peaks.
The grants were initially valued at $820 million, but many were multiyear awards at different stages of rollout, which means some of the money has already been spent.
At least 554 organizations across 48 states are affected by the cuts, many of them small, community-based nonprofits that rely on this money. The rescinded grants supported everything from violence prevention and policing to victim advocacy, reentry services, research, and mental health and substance use treatment. Some of the grants also were cut from state and local government agencies.

Another new report from the Council on Criminal Justice dug deeper into local effects: It found that the Trump administration’s cuts also eliminated 473 minigrants — known as “subawards” — passed from primary recipients to smaller groups that often face challenges accessing federal dollars directly, such as rural government agencies and grassroots nonprofits.
About $5 million of those subawards was intended for state, local and tribal law enforcement agencies working to reduce violence in rural areas, according to the report.
Experts warn the timing couldn’t be worse. The summer months — historically linked to higher rates of violent crimes — are approaching, and the safety net in many cities is fraying. A growing body of research has found a correlation between spikes in temperature and violent crime, with studies suggesting that heat waves and sudden weather swings can inflame tensions and increase aggression.
“These programs are having to cut staff and cut services, and that will be felt in communities in states all over the country at exactly the time when they’re most needed,” said Amy Solomon, a senior fellow at the Council on Criminal Justice and the lead author of the report.
Solomon also previously served as assistant U.S. attorney general in the Biden administration, where she led the Office of Justice Programs — the Justice Department’s largest grantmaking agency.
Many of the primary grants that were terminated contained no references to race, gender or diversity-related language, according to the report — despite claims from federal officials that such criteria were driving the cuts. Primary grant recipients received their funding from the feds directly.
 ‘Wasteful grants’

U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi defended the cuts in a late April post on X, stating that the department has cut “millions of dollars in wasteful grants.” She also signaled that additional cuts may be on the way. In her post, she specifically cited grants that supported LGBTQ+ liaison services in police departments and programs providing gender-affirming care and housing for incarcerated transgender people.
The Department of Justice’s cuts come amid a broader push by the Trump administration and the newly created Department of Government Efficiency to pull funding from a range of federal programs — a move they say is aimed at reducing spending and saving taxpayer dollars.
For some groups, the sudden withdrawal of funds has meant scaling back crime victim services or pulling out of some neighborhoods altogether.
Community violence prevention groups aim to stop shootings and other forms of violence before they happen by working directly with those most at risk. Staff — often with experience in the justice system — mediate conflicts, respond to crises, and connect people to support such as counseling or job training. In some cities, they’re dispatched to high-risk areas to deescalate tensions, often before police arrive.
And research shows that community-level violence prevention programs can contribute to drops in crime.

After a historic surge in homicides in 2020, violent crime in the United States dropped in 2024 to pre-pandemic levels — or even lower — in many cities. Preliminary 2025 data suggests that the downward trend is continuing in major cities, including Baltimore, Houston, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C.
But the progress hasn’t reached every community. Some neighborhoods are still grappling with high rates of gun violence and car theft.
Organizations that faced the toughest financial cuts had been funded through the U.S. Department of Justice’s Community Based Violence Intervention and Prevention Initiative — the federal government’s primary mechanism for supporting this work.
Since the program’s launch in 2022, the federal Office of Justice Programs has invested about $300 million in community violence intervention efforts and related research. But nearly half of that funding has now been wiped out, according to the Council on Criminal Justice report.
“It’s really unprecedented to see these kinds of grants cut midstream,” Solomon told Stateline. “This was an effort that had bipartisan support [in Congress] and in the field all across the country.”
 Impact on communities nationwide

In late April, Aqeela Sherrills received a letter from the federal Justice Department terminating a $3.5 million grant that supported the Community-Based Public Safety Collective. Sherrills is the co-founder and executive director of the national organization, which focuses on community-led approaches to preventing violence, including mediating conflicts, building relationships in high-risk neighborhoods and connecting people to resources such as housing, mental health care and job training.
The letter said the organization’s efforts no longer aligned with the federal Justice Department’s priorities, which include supporting “certain law enforcement operations, combatting violent crime, protecting American children, and supporting American victims of trafficking and sexual assault.”
Until the end of April, the collective had an agreement with the Justice Department to provide training and technical assistance to 95 local groups — including community groups, police departments, city and county governments, and state agencies — that had each been awarded $2 million over three years to run community violence intervention programs.










We're bracing for what could potentially be a high-violence summer.


– Aqeela Sherrills, co-founder and CEO of Community-Based Public Safety Collective


But after the department cut $3.5 million, the Community-Based Public Safety Collective was forced to lay off 20 staff members.
“Without the significant funding … it destabilizes the organizations. People’s ability to be able to provide for themselves and their family is at risk,” Sherrills said in an interview. “We’re bracing for what could potentially be a high-violence summer.”
The deepest funding cuts hit states led by both Republican and Democratic governors, including California, Florida, Illinois, Kentucky, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Virginia and Washington.
About $145 million in violence intervention funding was rescinded overall, along with an additional $8.6 million for related research and evaluation efforts, according to the Council on Criminal Justice report.
Some of the canceled grants funded studies and research on forensics, policing, corrections issues and behavioral health. Now, those projects may be left unfinished.
Some of the largest losses hit intermediary organizations, such as the Community-Based Public Safety Collective, that support smaller programs by providing microgrants, training and technical assistance.

For organizations such as the Newark Community Street Team in New Jersey, the loss of federal funding has left some areas of the city without coverage.
The funding had allowed staff to monitor neighborhoods and engage directly with community members to prevent violence. That included weekly community walks, where team members connected with victims of crime and people who may have witnessed violence, linking them to resources such as counseling or legal aid. The team also operates a hotline where residents can report crimes or alert staff to tensions that might escalate — allowing the team to step in before violence occurred.
Some of the lost funding also supported school-based initiatives, where mediators helped students resolve conflicts before they escalated into fights or other forms of violence.
Of the 15 Newark positions affected by the cuts, four employees were reassigned to other departments; the others were let go. Some of the team’s staff members are formerly incarcerated, a vital trait that helps them connect with residents and build trust in communities that are often wary of traditional law enforcement.
“We just have to continue working and serving our community the best we can,” said Rey Chavis, the executive director of the street team.
That work appears to be contributing to a decrease in the community’s crime rates.
City crime data from Jan. 1 to April 30, 2025, shows a significant drop in violent crime in Newark compared with the same period in 2024. The total number of violent crimes reported to police fell by 49%, driven largely by a 68% decrease in robberies, according to Stateline’s analysis of the data. Homicides dropped by 53%, while aggravated assaults declined by 43%. Rapes dropped slightly by 3%.

SPRINGFIELD – With public transit agencies in Chicagoland facing a fiscal cliff and the potential for thousands of layoffs, the state did not pass a bill that would have provided the agencies with potentially over $1 billion in new funding.

A version of the bill passed in the Senate, sponsored by Sen. Ram Villivalam, D-Chicago. But the House adjourned early Sunday morning without concurring as some of its tax hikes became too controversial. Now, the future of Chicagoland transit is in limbo as the bill awaits further action.

The Regional Transportation Authority — which oversees the Chicago Transit Authority, Metra commuter rail and Pace Suburban Bus — projects a $771 million annual operating budget shortfall.

At a hearing in the days leading up to adjournment, Amalgamated Transit Union political director Clem Balanoff told lawmakers that thousands of union bus drivers and train operators would be laid off if action wasn’t taken to fill the budget gap. RTA officials have estimated 40% service cuts are necessary to address the fiscal crisis.

Gov. JB Pritzker on Sunday said there is “significant work” left to address Chicagoland transit funding over the summer and into the fall.

“The fact is that we need to address transit funding as fast as possible,” Pritzker said.

The Senate’s proposal to do so included statewide taxes on deliveries and electric vehicle charging, as well as expanding taxes on rideshares and expanded certain Chicago taxes to the rest of Cook County and surrounding counties.

RTA and its subsidiary transit agencies will create their budgets for the upcoming fiscal year in the coming weeks. According to RTA spokesperson Tina Fassett Smith in a statement, those budgets “by law must only include funding we are confident the system will receive in 2026.”

“We think there’s probably a billion dollars for mass transit in there,” RTA Board Chairman Kirk Dillard said shortly after the Senate passed its transit bill late Saturday night.

Now, Dillard and other transit officials are going to work to minimize or avoid cuts.

“It’s clear that many in both the House and Senate support transit and our intention is to build on that shared support to identify the funding needed to avoid devastating cuts and disruption for everyone in Northeast Illinois,” Smith said in a statement.

The senate’s solution
House Bill 3438, the proposal approved by the Senate, would bail out transit authorities and send some funding outside northern Illinois. The reform package includes multiple tax increases. It’s unclear if any of these increases could come up again in future attempts to reform transit, although the House could pass it at a special legislative session or at a a future regular session.

The most controversial tax increase was a $1.50 fee added to any home delivery order placed online, with exceptions for some small businesses as well as orders containing only groceries and medication. Of the funds raised from this statewide tax, 80% would go to northern Illinois transit systems under a renamed RTA and 20% would be put into a fund for downstate transit agencies.

The bill would have also instituted a tax on real estate transfers in Cook County and the counties surrounding it. That tax is similar to one already in place in Chicago. It would have also required a charge on taxi and rideshare services in that region and a statewide 3 cents-per-kilowatt hour fee for charging electric vehicles.

""All told, we have achieved with the Senate package, a $1.5 billion investment for the northeast Illinois region,” Villivalam said. “And we have received more than double what downstate transit agencies requested for a historic investment.”

Over the two years that lawmakers have worked with the RTA on this transit funding issue, Democratic lawmakers have consistently repeated their mantra: there would be no funding without reform. To that end, they sought to institute sweeping reforms to the RTA.

The bill would rename the RTA to the Northern Illinois Transit Authority. The agency would have ultimate control over fares as well as a restructured board that places more power in the hands of the state.

While the bill will not become law soon, similar governance reforms were proposed by House lawmakers, who indicated there was agreement between the Senate and House on the reforms likely to be included in any deal.

Even still, those reform proposals drew fierce criticism from some suburban lawmakers

""This has become a bailout for Chicago CTA,” Sen. Seth Lewis, R- Bartlett, said. “We’re giving the mayor more control. We’re giving him more than a billion dollars in revenue.”

The board, under the Senate bill passed Saturday, would have five members appointed by the governor, five appointed by the president of the Cook County Board, five from the mayor of Chicago and one each from the collar counties.

In many communities, these initiatives have been credited with saving lives and reducing violence.
But the Trump administration last month abruptly terminated at least 373 public safety grants from the U.S. Department of Justice’s Office of Justice Programs, pulling roughly $500 million in remaining funds across a range of programs, according to a new report by the Council on Criminal Justice, a nonprofit think tank. The cuts come just as summer is approaching — a season when violence consistently peaks.
The grants were initially valued at $820 million, but many were multiyear awards at different stages of rollout, which means some of the money has already been spent.
At least 554 organizations across 48 states are affected by the cuts, many of them small, community-based nonprofits that rely on this money. The rescinded grants supported everything from violence prevention and policing to victim advocacy, reentry services, research, and mental health and substance use treatment. Some of the grants also were cut from state and local government agencies.

Another new report from the Council on Criminal Justice dug deeper into local effects: It found that the Trump administration’s cuts also eliminated 473 minigrants — known as “subawards” — passed from primary recipients to smaller groups that often face challenges accessing federal dollars directly, such as rural government agencies and grassroots nonprofits.
About $5 million of those subawards was intended for state, local and tribal law enforcement agencies working to reduce violence in rural areas, according to the report.
Experts warn the timing couldn’t be worse. The summer months — historically linked to higher rates of violent crimes — are approaching, and the safety net in many cities is fraying. A growing body of research has found a correlation between spikes in temperature and violent crime, with studies suggesting that heat waves and sudden weather swings can inflame tensions and increase aggression.
“These programs are having to cut staff and cut services, and that will be felt in communities in states all over the country at exactly the time when they’re most needed,” said Amy Solomon, a senior fellow at the Council on Criminal Justice and the lead author of the report.
Solomon also previously served as assistant U.S. attorney general in the Biden administration, where she led the Office of Justice Programs — the Justice Department’s largest grantmaking agency.
Many of the primary grants that were terminated contained no references to race, gender or diversity-related language, according to the report — despite claims from federal officials that such criteria were driving the cuts. Primary grant recipients received their funding from the feds directly.
‘Wasteful grants’
U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi defended the cuts in a late April post on X, stating that the department has cut “millions of dollars in wasteful grants.” She also signaled that additional cuts may be on the way. In her post, she specifically cited grants that supported LGBTQ+ liaison services in police departments and programs providing gender-affirming care and housing for incarcerated transgender people.
The Department of Justice’s cuts come amid a broader push by the Trump administration and the newly created Department of Government Efficiency to pull funding from a range of federal programs — a move they say is aimed at reducing spending and saving taxpayer dollars.
For some groups, the sudden withdrawal of funds has meant scaling back crime victim services or pulling out of some neighborhoods altogether.
Community violence prevention groups aim to stop shootings and other forms of violence before they happen by working directly with those most at risk. Staff — often with experience in the justice system — mediate conflicts, respond to crises, and connect people to support such as counseling or job training. In some cities, they’re dispatched to high-risk areas to deescalate tensions, often before police arrive.
And research shows that community-level violence prevention programs can contribute to drops in crime.

After a historic surge in homicides in 2020, violent crime in the United States dropped in 2024 to pre-pandemic levels — or even lower — in many cities. Preliminary 2025 data suggests that the downward trend is continuing in major cities, including Baltimore, Houston, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C.
But the progress hasn’t reached every community. Some neighborhoods are still grappling with high rates of gun violence and car theft.
Organizations that faced the toughest financial cuts had been funded through the U.S. Department of Justice’s Community Based Violence Intervention and Prevention Initiative — the federal government’s primary mechanism for supporting this work.
Since the program’s launch in 2022, the federal Office of Justice Programs has invested about $300 million in community violence intervention efforts and related research. But nearly half of that funding has now been wiped out, according to the Council on Criminal Justice report.
“It’s really unprecedented to see these kinds of grants cut midstream,” Solomon told Stateline. “This was an effort that had bipartisan support [in Congress] and in the field all across the country.”
Impact on communities nationwide
In late April, Aqeela Sherrills received a letter from the federal Justice Department terminating a $3.5 million grant that supported the Community-Based Public Safety Collective. Sherrills is the co-founder and executive director of the national organization, which focuses on community-led approaches to preventing violence, including mediating conflicts, building relationships in high-risk neighborhoods and connecting people to resources such as housing, mental health care and job training.
The letter said the organization’s efforts no longer aligned with the federal Justice Department’s priorities, which include supporting “certain law enforcement operations, combatting violent crime, protecting American children, and supporting American victims of trafficking and sexual assault.”
Until the end of April, the collective had an agreement with the Justice Department to provide training and technical assistance to 95 local groups — including community groups, police departments, city and county governments, and state agencies — that had each been awarded $2 million over three years to run community violence intervention programs.










We're bracing for what could potentially be a high-violence summer.


– Aqeela Sherrills, Community-Based Public Safety Collective co-founder and CEO


But after the department cut $3.5 million, the Community-Based Public Safety Collective was forced to lay off 20 staff members.
“Without the significant funding … it destabilizes the organizations. People’s ability to be able to provide for themselves and their family is at risk,” Sherrills said in an interview. “We’re bracing for what could potentially be a high-violence summer.”
The deepest funding cuts hit states led by both Republican and Democratic governors, including California, Florida, Illinois, Kentucky, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Virginia and Washington.
About $145 million in violence intervention funding was rescinded overall, along with an additional $8.6 million for related research and evaluation efforts, according to the Council on Criminal Justice report.
Some of the canceled grants funded studies and research on forensics, policing, corrections issues and behavioral health. Now, those projects may be left unfinished.
Some of the largest losses hit intermediary organizations, such as the Community-Based Public Safety Collective, that support smaller programs by providing microgrants, training and technical assistance.

For organizations such as the Newark Community Street Team in New Jersey, the loss of federal funding has left some areas of the city without coverage.
The funding had allowed staff to monitor neighborhoods and engage directly with community members to prevent violence. That included weekly community walks, where team members connected with victims of crime and people who may have witnessed violence, linking them to resources such as counseling or legal aid. The team also operates a hotline where residents can report crimes or alert staff to tensions that might escalate — allowing the team to step in before violence occurred.
Some of the lost funding also supported school-based initiatives, where mediators helped students resolve conflicts before they escalated into fights or other forms of violence.
Of the 15 Newark positions affected by the cuts, four employees were reassigned to other departments; the others were let go. Some of the team’s staff members are formerly incarcerated, a vital trait that helps them connect with residents and build trust in communities that are often wary of traditional law enforcement.
“We just have to continue working and serving our community the best we can,” said Rey Chavis, the executive director of the street team.
That work appears to be contributing to a decrease in the community’s crime rates.
City crime data from Jan. 1 to April 30, 2025, shows a significant drop in violent crime in Newark compared with the same period in 2024. The total number of violent crimes reported to police fell by 49%, driven largely by a 68% decrease in robberies, according to Stateline’s analysis of the data. Homicides dropped by 53%, while aggravated assaults declined by 43%. Rapes dropped slightly by 3%.

The ink is hardly dry on Washington’s new budget and already legislative leaders are anticipating more fiscal uncertainty. 
Democrats are focused on threats to health care access if Congress slashes Medicaid funding, while Republicans are warning of renewed legal jeopardy in education funding.
In post-session interviews on TVW’s Inside Olympia, House Majority Leader Joe Fitzgibbon, D-West Seattle, warned that a U.S. House-passed budget legislation — if enacted — could force Washington into a special session to make emergency Medicaid adjustments.
“I’m very concerned about the prospects that Republicans in Congress are going to cut Medicaid at a level that’s going to lead to a whole lot of people losing health care around the country,” Fitzgibbon said. “We’re not able to insulate ourselves from that entirely.”
He said proposed reductions to federal reimbursement rates, particularly for hospitals and nursing homes, would force tough decisions. “We would have to come back in special session and we’d have to kick a lot of people off health care and close a lot of hospitals and nursing homes.”
Senate Republican Leader John Braun, R-Centralia, disputed that framing. “I think there’s a lot of fearmongering out there,” he said, adding that the U.S. House plan is “much more favorable for Washington than what many people thought.”
Braun pointed to proposed eligibility checks, work requirements, and reforms to prevent dual-state enrollment. “These are things that will not only save the federal government money,” he said. “They’ll save the state government money and allow us to deliver services more equitably to the people that really need it.”
 McCleary 2.0 concerns

The two party leaders also offered starkly contrasting assessments of whether the new state budget could reignite a constitutional challenge like the 2012 McCleary decision, which mandated that Washington fully fund basic education.
Fitzgibbon defended the budget’s approach, saying the state continues to increase total and per-student K–12 funding. “I don’t think that we are relying on local levies to make up the difference in what basic education costs,” he said. “Those are enrichment levies to cover additional programs.”
He argued that voters had already approved the levy increases and said the budget includes additional money for levy equalization, more formally known as Local Effort Assistance, or LEA, which provides extra state support to property-poor districts. “That should very much keep the scales balanced between the property-rich districts and the property-poor districts,” he said.
Braun disagreed sharply, warning that the Legislature’s move to increase local levy caps could trigger another legal challenge. “I don’t think there’s any question. I think you’ll have that lawsuit—if you don’t have it already—you’ll have it before the end of the year,” he said.

“You can’t go to a school district across our state and say, ‘Can you show me any definitive way that you’re not using levies for basic education?’ They’ll say, ‘No way, I can’t. We’re using it for basic education.’”
 Studies cite widening gaps

Outside groups are warning of persistent discrepancies among districts. According to a March 2024 report by the Washington State School Directors’ Association, wealthier school districts consistently raise significantly more revenue through local property tax levies, allowing them to offer expanded programs and staff. Lower-income districts often struggle to generate comparable funds, creating disparities in educational access and quality.
Though Washington law imposes a “levy lid” to limit how much local districts can raise, the system still allows for wide funding gaps. The League of Education Voters, in a summer 2024 analysis, concluded that the state’s LEA funding is “inadequate” to fully offset these disparities.
The report found that districts are increasingly using levies to fund what many parents and educators view as core services—including special education, student mental health, and additional classroom staff—undermining the notion that the state is fully funding a “basic education.” The result is what the League called “a patchwork system where access to a constitutionally guaranteed education can depend on a student’s ZIP code.”
Braun echoed that view, saying, “It’s undeniably inequitable. This will result in less money per student in some districts and more in others—and that’s exactly what McCleary said we could not do.”
Fitzgibbon acknowledged the concern but said it can be addressed legislatively. “The increase in levy equalization, which was not included in that bill, but is included in the budget, is something I have every expectation we’ll be able to put into statute.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Fitzgibbon-1-1-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-06-01 12:13:06.524700

The 9-year-old Indiana boy told his parents his stomach hurt. He kept running to the bathroom and felt too ill to finish a basketball game.
Days later, he lay in a hospital bed, fighting for his life. He had eaten tainted salad, according to a lawsuit against the lettuce grower filed by his parents on April 17 in federal court for the Southern District of Indiana.
The E. coli bacteria that ravaged Colton’s kidneys was a genetic match to the strain that killed one person and sickened nearly 90 people in 15 states last fall. Federal health agencies investigated the cases and linked them to a farm that grew romaine lettuce.
But most people have never heard about this outbreak, which a Feb. 11 internal FDA memo linked to a single lettuce processor and ranch as the source of the contamination. In what many experts said was a break with common practice, officials never issued public communications after the investigation or identified the grower who produced the lettuce.
From failing to publicize a major outbreak to scaling back safety alert specialists and rules, the Trump administration’s anti-regulatory and cost-cutting push risks unraveling a critical system that helps ensure the safety of the U.S. food supply, according to consumer advocates, researchers and former employees at the FDA and U.S. Department of Agriculture.
The investigation into the illnesses began near the end of the Biden administration but work on the lettuce outbreak wasn’t completed until Feb. 11. At that time, the decision was made by the Trump administration not to release the names of the grower and processor because the FDA said no product remained on the market.
The administration also has withdrawn a proposed regulation to reduce the presence of salmonella in raw poultry, according to an April USDA alert. It was projected to save more than $13 million annually by preventing more than 3,000 illnesses, according to the proposal.
Officials from the Department of Health and Human Services have said that food safety is a priority, and FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said in an April 29 interview with the newsletterInside Medicine that the recent job cuts would not affect agency operations.
“The FDA had 9,500 employees in 2007. Last year it was nearly 19,000. Has the 100% increase in employees increased approval times, innovation, AI, food safety, or agency morale?” Makary asked. “No, it hasn’t. In fact, it’s increased regulatory creep.”
The FDA referred questions to HHS, which declined to comment or make Makary available for an interview. In a statement, the agency said “protecting public health and insuring food safety remain top priorities for HHS. FDA inspectors were not impacted [by job cuts] and this critical work will continue.”
Public health advocates warn companies and growers will face less regulatory oversight and fewer consequences for selling tainted food products as a result of recent FDA actions.
The administration is disbanding a Justice Department unit that pursues civil and criminal actions against companies that sell contaminated food and is reassigning its attorneys. Some work will be assumed by other divisions, according to a publicly posted memo from the head of the department’s criminal division and a white paper by the law firm Gibson Dunn.
The Justice Department did not respond to an email requesting comment.
“They need the DOJ to enforce the law,” said Sarah Sorscher, director of regulatory affairs at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a nonprofit consumer advocacy group. “For an executive investing in food safety, the knowledge they could go to jail if they don’t is a really strong motivator.”
Federal regulators also want states to conduct more inspections, according to two former FDA officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retaliation. But some Democratic lawmakers say states lack the resources to take over most food safety inspections.
“Handing that duty to state and local agencies is really troubling,” said Rep. Shontel M. Brown, D-Ohio. “They don’t have the resources, and it creates a potentially unsafe situation that puts families in Ohio and America at risk.”
  The High Cost of Foodborne Illnesses 

Foodborne illnesses exact a major economic toll in the United States, according to federal data, and cost thousands of lives each year. The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates the deaths, chronic illness, medical treatment, and lost productivity from food-related illnesses amounted to $75 billion in 2023.
Each year, about 48 million people in the U.S. get sick with foodborne illnesses, 128,000 are hospitalized, and 3,000 die, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
In its first few months, the administration has suspended a program known as the Food Emergency Response Network Proficiency Testing that ensures food-testing labs accurately identify pathogens that can sicken or kill, according to a former FDA official.
In March, the agency said it would delay from January 2026 to July 2028 compliance with a Biden-era rule that aims to speed up the identification and removal of potentially contaminated food from the market.
However, the FDA is taking aim at foreign food manufacturing, saying in a May 6 notice that it would expand unannounced inspections overseas.
“This expanded approach marks a new era in FDA enforcement — stronger, smarter, and unapologetically in support of the public health and safety of Americans,” the notice said.
Some former FDA and USDA officials said that goal isn’t realistic, because U.S. inspectors often need to obtain travel visas that can wind up alerting companies to their arrival.
“It’s really, really difficult to do surprise inspections,” said Brian Ronholm, director of food policy for Consumer Reports and a former USDA deputy undersecretary for food safety. “The visa process can alert the local authority.”
HHS declined to address Ronholm’s concerns.
The FDA hasn’t met the mandated targets for inspecting food facilities in the U.S. since fiscal year 2018, and the agency has consistently fallen short of meeting its annual targets for foreign inspections, according to a January report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office.
Foodborne illness can turn serious. Salmonella bacteria in cucumbers sickened dozens of people in April and May and left at least nine people hospitalized, according to the FDA. A 2008-09 salmonella outbreak in peanut butter killed nine, resulting in criminal charges against company executives. And E. coli in cookie dough sickened more than 70 people in 2009, including a Nevada mother who died of complications from eating the raw dough.
  ‘Life or Death for Our Son’ 

E. coli, commonly found in feces, can be especially dangerous to children like Colton, the boy from Avon, Indiana, who ate contaminated lettuce. The bacteria can damage blood vessels and cause clots that destroy the kidneys, leading to strokes and comas. Consumers sickened by E. coli can pass it along to others, and, in some cases, the bacteria end up killing victims who never consumed the contaminated food.
By the time Colton’s mother brought him to the emergency room that November day, the bacteria were releasing toxins and damaging his blood cells and kidneys, according to his father, Chris George.
Colton was sent to Riley Hospital for Children in Indianapolis. Chris said doctors told him and his wife, Amber George, that their son was in kidney failure and the next 24 to 72 hours would determine whether he would survive, the father recalled.
“They said it was life or death for our son, and I was like, wait, he was just playing basketball,” said Chris, a firefighter. “I told them, ‘You do what you need to do to save my son.’”
Usually, the FDA alerts the public and identifies growers and food manufacturers when there are outbreaks like the one that sickened Colton. The FDA said in its February internal summary that the grower wasn’t named because no product remained on the market.
But Bill Marler, a Seattle lawyer who specializes in food-safety litigation and represents the George family, said the information is still important because it can prevent more cases, pressure growers to improve sanitation, and identify repeat offenders.
It also gives victims an explanation for their illnesses and helps them determine whom they might take legal action against, he said.
“Normally we would see the information on their websites,” Marler said, adding that the agency’s investigatory findings on the outbreak were “all redacted” and he obtained them through a Freedom of Information Act request.
The FDA, USDA, and CDC play central roles in overseeing food safety, including inspections and investigations. The FDA and CDC have been rocked by job cuts that are part of a reduction of 20,000 staff at HHS, their parent agency. The Agriculture Department has also shrunk its workforce.
Staffing cuts mean delays in publicizing deadly outbreaks, said Susan Mayne, an adjunct professor at Yale School of Public Health who retired from the FDA in 2023.
“Consumers are being notified with delays about important food safety notifications,” she said, referring to a recent outbreak in cucumbers. “People can die if there are pathogens like listeria, which can have a 30% fatality rate.”
Makary has said the cuts wouldn’t touch inspectors, reviewers, or scientists at the agency.
But the FDA laid off scientists in April who worked at food safety labs in Chicago and San Francisco, where they performed specialized analysis for food inspectors, former FDA officials said. The FDA later restored some positions.
“No scientists were fired? That was incorrect,” Mayne said.
Siobhan DeLancey, who worked in the agency’s Office of Foods and Veterinary Medicine for more than 20 years before she also was laid off in April, said new requirements for reviewing agency announcements became so arduous that it took weeks to get approval for alerts that should have been going out much sooner.
She said some employees who were laid off include communications specialists and web staff who do consumer outreach aimed at preventing illness. The USDA and FDA have been bringing some workers back or are asking some who accepted deferred resignations to take back their decisions.
“It’s all about destruction and not about efficiency,” DeLancey said. “We’re going to see the effects for years. It will cost lives.”
HHS did not respond to an email seeking a response to DeLancey’s comments.
For 13 days, Colton stayed on dialysis at the hospital, initially unable to eat or drink. His mother wet a sponge to moisten his lips and tongue.
He turned 10 in the hospital. Chris George bought paint markers to make signs on the windows of his son’s room.
“I am not happy with the CDC and FDA,” Chris George said. “Victims have a right to know who made them sick. This is my kid. He’s my life.”
Colton was able to leave the hospital almost three weeks after first eating the contaminated lettuce but still has nightmares about the ordeal and is seeing a therapist.
“The whole ‘Make America Healthy Again,’ the focus on taking food color dyes out of cereal?” said Chris George, who objects to the Trump administration’s decision to redact information about the grower in the February report. “How about we take E. coli out of our lettuce, so it doesn’t kill our kids?”

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota Republicans could be choosing from a crowded field when they make their choice for governor in the 2026 primary. With as many as five candidates in the race, would-be governors will need to find a way to distinguish themselves from the pack. 
The first announced candidate for that race was Speaker of the House Jon Hansen, a Dell Rapids attorney. He declared his candidacy for the Republican nomination in April. 
Hansen was the first candidate for governor to come from the new MAGA wing of the South Dakota Republican Party—referred to as “grassroots patriots” in his announcement speech. His campaign platform contains many of the topics his wing of the party has made a priority: cutting government spending, allowing school choice, protecting private property rights, opposing abortion and tightening election laws.
First candidate for governor focuses on property rights, spending and halting ‘corporate welfare’

Another topic that Hansen touched on was ending “corporate welfare.” That’s the name he has given to the practice of using taxpayer dollars to boost private business. His example of corporate welfare gone bad was Tru Shrimp. The company was given a $6.5 million loan of state and local funds six years ago to build a facility in Madison. While the company did manage to change its name to Iterro, it has yet to break ground. 
“I think it’s just unnecessary government mingling, and it’s risky business, and they’re wasting our taxpayer dollars to do it,” Hansen said in a South Dakota Searchlight story. “It’s the sort of stuff that we want to say ‘no more’ to. Let’s get back to the free market, low tax and low regulation.”
South Dakota got serious about using state dollars to entice and build business in 1987 when Gov. George Mickelson helped to create the Revolving Economic Development and Initiative Fund. Mickelson was able to convince the Legislature to implement a 1% sales tax increase that would sunset once it had raised $40 million for the REDI Fund. Since then the Governor’s Office of Economic Development has made loans and grants worth millions of dollars to new and existing businesses and industries in the state. 
Taking state government loans and grants out of the marketplace would certainly be one way Hansen could approach his new role if he were elected governor. That tactic, however, fails to consider the fact that a financial boost from the state is sometimes what it takes to get the free market interested in investing in South Dakota. 
Putting an end to low-interest government loans would certainly put the state at a disadvantage when it comes to competing with other states for business and industry.
A recent news release from the GOED showed just how invested the state has become in helping businesses grow. The news release noted a $3.4 million grant for the Big Stone Energy Storage Project thermal energy facility, a $2.6 million grant for a Bel Brands expansion and a $250,682 grant to Dakota Line Energy for a lagoon digester. 
The news release said the grants would result in $419 million in capital expenditures and create 180 full-time jobs. In essence, the state is betting $6 million in hopes of getting a $419 million payoff. That kind of “government mingling,” as Hansen called it, seems to offer pretty good odds. It is, however, as he noted, “risky business.”
At its heart, investing in economic development will always be a bit of a gamble. That’s why we expect government officials to place safe bets, though there is always the chance for a bust like Tru Shrimp. That’s the nature of any gamble.
Hansen won’t be the only “patriot” in the Republican primary for governor, with Aberdeen businessman and political influencer Toby Doeden also declaring his candidacy. If “corporate welfare” is going to be an issue in the GOP primary, the people who like to use state loans and grants to boost their local economies have got to do a better job of telling about the benefits of government investment. 
One way to do that would be to keep telling their story after the initial news release has been issued. Beyond the cliched photo of local officials with hardhats and shovels for a groundbreaking, taxpayers deserve regular updates on capital expenditures and job creation. This would add a layer of government transparency to the use of tax dollars. It would also soften the criticism from people like Hansen when an outfit like Tru Shrimp is slow to pay off on its state investment. 
Politicians often like to tout the benefits of the “free market.” By curtailing state grants and low-interest loans, that market will be free to invest in states that are more financially welcoming. 
In 1987, the state’s economy was badly in need of a jump-start, and it got one from Gov. Mickelson and the REDI Fund. Since then, that gamble has paid off more often than it’s gone bust. What Hansen calls “corporate welfare” has been a usually sound investment for South Dakota.

The Republican-controlled House passed two bills last week that would bar transgender girls from competing on girls sports teams. But Democrats, who control the Senate, say they will not consider the legislation.
“Our legislative agenda is long and attacking kids is not on it,” Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks, a Democrat from Grand Rapids, told Chalkbeat in a statement.
Failure to take up the Republican-sponsored bills could draw unwelcome political attention to Michigan at a time when the Trump administration has targeted for investigation states that don’t comply with its view on Title IX, the federal civil rights law that prohibits discrimination based on sex.
Since taking office for the second time, Trump has issued several executive orders targeting the rights of transgender Americans. One in January said the U.S. government would only recognize two genders, male and female, while another issued that month attempted to ban gender-affirming health care for transgender youth. A February executive order called for schools to block trans girls from competing on girls sports teams.
Trump has threatened to withhold federal funding from schools that don’t comply with his executive orders.
Executive orders cannot override existing state and federal statutes, though, and there have been legal challenges to the constitutionality of Trump’s executive orders.
But the Trump administration’s threats to states that don’t comply with the order have stoked fears over how he intends to enforce it. Multiple federal agencies opened investigations into Maine this year after a heated exchange between Trump and the state’s Democratic governor, Janet Mills, in which she promised to follow the state’s law protecting transgender rights.
In one of those federal cases, a judge issued an injunction to stop the government from freezing federal funds to the state. But there are two other open cases that have been assigned to the Department of Justice to enforce.
U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has said other states are at risk of losing federal funding for Title IX violations, specifically singling out California and Minnesota. Officials in those states have said their civil rights laws preclude them from complying with Trump’s executive order. Bondi’s office announced Wednesday that it has opened an investigation into California.
Like some other states, Michigan recently expanded state protections from discrimination on the basis of sexuality and gender identity and expression. The expansion of those protections two years ago has long been a signature issue for Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.
She signed the expansion of the state’s Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act in 2023, saying in a statement that “Michigan is a place that will fight for your freedom to be yourself.”
It is possible what has happened in Maine could happen in Michigan, said Nancy Chi Cantalupo, associate professor of law at Wayne State University.
“But what is happening in Maine is in no way a success for the current administration at this point,” she said, noting that the federal government has never withdrawn funds from a state under Title IX or any other civil rights statutes it enforces.
“It’s not like there’s a light switch the federal government can use to just turn off federal funds at its whim,” she said. “There are a lot of steps it has to go through.”
Brinks did not respond to a question about whether she or others in the Democratic Party have concerns Michigan may be targeted by the Trump administration.
Whitmer’s office did not respond to questions about the bills.
In Michigan, a prohibition against trans girls competing on girls sports teams would affect few athletes statewide. The Michigan High School Athletic Association, the private organization that runs the state’s high school sports competitions, said there were no trans girls competing on spring sports teams this year. None played on winter sports teams, while two played on fall teams.
About 25 states have already passed similar laws restricting trans girls from playing on sports teams aligned with their gender identity.
Advocates for transgender rights say sports bills aren’t really about limiting the teams trans girls and women can play on.
“If this bill were just about sports, it wouldn’t be proposed in coordination with all of these other anti-trans bills [nationwide,]” said Kye Campbell-Fox, a research assistant and laboratory manager at Michigan State University, who studies the impact of legislation targeting the rights of trans kids. “This is a coordinated campaign to push trans people out of public life.”
 Advocates say trans youth don’t feel safe as their rights are attacked

Though the Michigan bills have effectively died, advocates say lawmakers’ focus on the issue — and the language they often use to talk about trans athletes — is still harmful to all trans children.
The Michigan bills, for example, referred to trans girls as “biological males,” ignoring their gender identities. And some lawmakers have said that the presence of trans girls in locker rooms could lead to sexual violence against other girls.
Rep. Mike Harris, a Republican from Waterford, said during a hearing for the bills that he was concerned about the potential for sexual assault if trans girls use girls locker rooms.
“I don’t think it’s appropriate to place biological boys and girls in the same room, to strip down naked next to each other,” he said.
There is no evidence to support the idea that trans girls will assault other girls, though there is evidence that trans populations face increased risks when they use bathrooms according to the sex they were assigned at birth.
Republican lawmakers’ rhetoric has emboldened some students and adults to feel freer to make hateful remarks, and LGBTQ+ youth are being affected by it.
“I’m hearing a lot of fear from youth,” said Jude Krajnyák, a regional coordinator for a research policy project at the Michigan Organization on Adolescent Sexual Health. “Things everyone else gets to take for granted — like playing soccer in middle school — are rights that are being taken away from us.”
Krajnyák said he heard from a trans girl in middle school who gave up on playing soccer because she said “it’s just not worth” the backlash.
Currently, the Michigan High School Athletic Association determines eligibility for trans girls to play on girls teams on a case-by-case basis. The executive director of the association, Mark Uyl, makes the determination based on a number of factors, including what gender is recorded on the students’ school documents and other paperwork. Students are also asked whether they’ve begun hormone therapy and gender-affirming surgeries.
“The MHSAA asks for documentation on therapy and surgery as our policy allows for a waiver to be both approved and denied — and part of that decision is based on where in the transitioning process a student is at the time,” Geoff Kimmerly, director of communications for the association, told Chalkbeat.
The policy went into effect in 2012, according to the association. It aligned with federal law during the Obama administration, as well as federal requirements from the Office for Civil Rights during Trump’s first term and Biden’s presidency.
“The MHSAA follows and will continue to follow all applicable state and federal laws,” said Kimmerly in a statement. “We are monitoring developments in this regard closely.”

This policy change would replicate how the government resolved the Latin American debt crisis of the 1980s -- by negotiating steep discounts from the bank lenders, which allowed countries to repay much lower amounts, restoring their credit ratings. We should borrow from that experience. 
The post Here’s how we can help solve the student loan crisis: sell th[...]","FROM THE ONSET of the pandemic until today, the terms of federal student loan repayment have changed over and over again. It is often forgotten that President Trump was the first to pause payments through the CARES Act, signed in March 2020. But it was President Biden who tried to put a stake in the heart of student debt, forgiving most of it only to see the Supreme Court deny him the right to do so.  In his second term, President Trump has concluded that it’s time to collect on the debt. The administration announced in early May that it is resuming aggressive collections on defaulted federal student loans. The government is threatening to garnish wages, tax refunds, and Social Security benefits from those who fail to pay.  For many borrowers, it will feel like being flogged while already down. Defaults are expected to balloon. This isn’t about individual irresponsibility. It’s about a broken promise — that student debt would pay for itself through higher earnings. For millions, it hasn’t. And it never will. Is there any escape from what is broadly seen as a failed policy? Here’s an idea that would be a win-win for government and student loan holders: Sell the debt before it becomes an even bigger problem.   Student debt operates under a fundamentally different set of rules than most other types of debt—a fact that often goes overlooked. Federal student loans are not traded in financial markets and are not “marked to market” like corporate or sovereign debt. In fact, by law the government can only trade the debt if it involves no loss, a condition which has effectively prohibited any trading. This means the value of student loans remains on the government’s books at face value, even when long-term repayment is unlikely — due to defaults — or delayed through income-driven repayment, deferments, or forgiveness programs. Thus, a first step toward a sale of the debt would be to recognize that the $1.6 trillion in student debt sitting on the federal government’s books is worth much less due to growing defaults. Only by shining the light of the market on it will we learn the real value of the debt.  Sales of debt into the market may involve painful discounts. But this will force transparency. After the sale, students would pay the discounted price, which would represent real debt relief.  In size and method, this policy change would replicate how the government resolved the Latin American debt crisis of the 1980s — by negotiating steep discounts from the bank lenders, which allowed countries to repay much lower amounts, restoring their credit ratings. The combination of the government working with the private sector succeeded in lifting the entire region from depression and despondency. We can borrow from this experience. Before a debt sale the government must set terms with prospective buyers that whatever discount is achieved in sales will favor the student borrower. Thus, if a bank buys a lot of debt at a 50 percent discount it will mean that the debt of the student borrower will be cut in half.  The bank will benefit from the ability of the student to keep up with lower payments. Right now, the credit ratings of students are in the cellar. Cutting the debt load on students would raise these ratings, making them better able to participate in the market for houses, cars, and other big-ticket items.   Meanwhile, debt sales would provide substantial cash to the government that could be used to provide student grants, pay down national debt, or meet any number of priorities. To maintain the status quo would keep the government in the collection business forever given the $1.6 trillion of debt, which will only grow over time.  If this effort were running smoothly, it would be one thing. But the government has wrapped itself into a pretzel trying to meet its fiduciary obligations to taxpayers while easing burdens on students. Meanwhile, the servicing companies it contracted to collect the debt infuriate students with false information, incorrect payment demands, and overall poor communication.  Selling the debt would free politicians from the trap of having to compel payments from those they seek votes from. It would also alleviate distortions, including how the easy availability of loans has allowed colleges to raise tuition levels to stratospheric levels. To end the scourge of student debt, the government must not only sell existing debt but also ease up on lending. Even with declining enrollments the government annually issues $70 billion in new loans and $40 billion in new Pell grants. These figures should be reversed, and new loans should be ready for sale.  At present, student loan rates are high at 6.5 percent for undergraduates and 8 percent for graduate loans, sufficiently attractive for banks to purchase. Any attempt by banks to cherry-pick the loans of students with the highest credit scores should be forestalled by offering discounts on the loans of low-income students. States are showing a much better way of financing higher education by offering cheaper options such as community colleges and vocational training. State grants combined with federal Pell grants often allow students to attend these programs for free. They are directing colleges to limit tuition and other costs to what can be covered by grants.  Unfortunately, the Trump administration is imposing stricter conditions on Pell grants, which could greatly narrow their availability. Lack of access to Pell grants will put pressure on student finances, forcing them to borrow more. The government should do just the opposite — increasing grants while decreasing loans. All of these changes should be voted on by Congress. We learned during the Biden administration that trying to use executive action to implement sweeping change will only lead to court action and political rancor.  President Trump has shrunk the federal government in ways that have cut vital services in many areas. Lessening its role in the student loan business would actually be a good way to reduce government’s footprint. Bob Hildreth is a former International Monetary Fund economist whose professional work involved restructuring Latin American debt and marketing sovereign debt loans. He is the founder of Boston-based Hildreth Institute, Inversant, and other nonprofit organizations with complementary missions to help get low-income students to college.  The post Here’s how we can help solve the student loan crisis: sell the debt    appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/massbay-e1707743859561-edited.jpeg?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-01 09:01:12.626320

The U.S. Supreme Court unanimously overturned Alabama’s ban on the NAACP, allowing the NAACP to operate in the state for the first time in eight years. 
NAACP leader Ruby Hurley set up the office in Birmingham in 1951, only to be forced to flee the state five years later after Alabama authorities aggressively investigated the NAACP and tried to seize membership records. 
After the NAACP refused, an Alabama judge levied a fine against the organization and threatened more penalties it refused to comply. The NAACP sued, only to have the Alabama Supreme Court dismiss the litigation. NAACP lawyers argued that the release of such records could invite reprisals and attacks on their members. 
In 1958, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled unanimously that the right of association and assembly under the First Amendment is protected by the due process clause of the 14th Amendment. If the high court had upheld the state’s attempts to seize membership records, it would have dealt a serious blow to the organization, its members and the movement itself.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/06104623/Ruby-Hurley-June1-FeatImage.jpg,,,2025-06-01 09:01:12.626320

Every day we delay, more kids are being hurt.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont state legislators: Big Tech doesn’t want you to know what’s happening to your kids online. We do..","This commentary is by 17 Vermont state legislators. Their names are listed below the text of the commentary.There’s a battle happening over your child’s safety — and most Vermonters have no idea it’s underway. That’s because it’s being waged behind closed doors: not in press conferences or public hearings, but in whispered conversations, anonymous letters and legal threats from some of the most powerful corporations in the world.As Vermont state legislators and sponsors of the Vermont Kids Code (S.69) — also known as the Age-Appropriate Design Code — we’ve been on the frontlines of this fight. We want to share what we’ve seen, what’s really at stake, and why we need Vermonters to stand up and speak out before it’s too late.S.69 is a common-sense bill designed to protect children online. It prohibits manipulative features like autoplay and endless scroll for minors. It prevents companies from making programming decisions designed to addict and exploit. It defaults to strong privacy settings. And it says that if a company knows that its product is being used by a kid, they have a duty to protect them — not exploit them.But Big Tech doesn’t want that.Your child’s attention is money. Their data is money. Their mental health? Their safety? That’s just collateral damage.So the moment this bill started moving, the industry mobilized. But they didn’t show up themselves — not Meta, not Snap, not TikTok, not Google.Instead, they deployed front groups — organizations with friendly sounding names like NetChoice and TechNet, funded by Big Tech but designed to appear neutral. These groups flooded lawmakers with memos filled with legal jargon and exaggerated fears of censorship.Big Tech refused to testify in public. And their front groups? They didn’t come out of the gate disclosing who they represent. And not once — not once — did they mention the stories of children whose lives have been destroyed by the very systems we’re trying to regulate.They didn’t talk about the 12-year-old Vermont girl who was allegedly raped by a man Snapchat recommended as a friend she might know.They didn’t talk about the students whose bodies were found after months of algorithm-fueled self-harm and depression.They didn’t talk about the parents who wake up every morning knowing their child will never come home again — because a multibillion-dollar company couldn’t be bothered to turn off a notification.Instead, they told us our bill might be “too hard” to comply with.That’s not a legal argument. That’s a business model problem.The truth is, we built this bill to withstand court scrutiny. We studied rulings in other states. We tailored the language. We removed any provision that regulated speech and focused only on product design and data processing. We listened to civil liberties groups, constitutional scholars and children’s advocates. We did the work. Because that’s our job.The opposition? They’re doing theirs too — but their job is to protect profit.These conflicting goals create a difficult fight. If we walked away from every hard fight, no child would wear a seatbelt. No parent would know if a toy was toxic. This is how progress happens. You write the strongest law you can, and then you defend it — because the cost of doing nothing is simply too high.And here’s what keeps us up at night: every day we delay, more kids are being hurt.More are being addicted. More are being preyed upon. More are falling victim to a system designed to exploit them.The 2025 S.69 Age-Appropriate Design Code passed the Vermont Senate on a vote of 25–5 and the Vermont House on a vote of 133–9 with strong tri-partisan support. The Legislature is expected to continue moving the bill forward and eventually send it to Gov. Phil Scott’s desk.If you are a parent, a grandparent, an educator or a young person tired of being treated like a product — you have a role to play.Contact the governor’s office today. Ask him to stand with Vermont families — not with the powerful out-of-state corporations working behind the scenes to stop this bill.Because this is the industry playbook. Meta, Snap, TikTok and Google profit from addicting and exploiting children — and when lawmakers push back, they send in front groups to confuse, delay and weaken the response.Gov. Scott has an opportunity to rise above their tactics and lead.We may not have their billions. But we have the truth. And the truth is, this bill will save lives.Let’s make sure the governor hears from Vermonters — not just Silicon Valley. Let’s show our kids that when it mattered, we stood up for them.Rep.

Throwing a rushed, bad pitch that lands ten rows up in the center field bleachers is a far worse outcome than the penalty for a delay.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Bill Jesdale: Buy some time and get education funding right.","Dear Editor,One of the compelling aspects of many sports is the pressure to perform or do something within some sort of prescribed timeframe.Major League Baseball now has very specific rules about pitchers not taking forever to deliver the next pitch. Batters can no longer retreat to constantly adjust batting gloves, read signs from base coaches and so forth. Batters and pitchers failing to meet the deadlines are penalized.Football and basketball have rules that force teams and players to move quickly. Again, penalties are levied if a team fails to act within the timeframe.The Vermont Legislature is under pressure to do something quickly about funding our public schools. The penalty in their case is to be viewed by some as not doing anything, being inept, incurring the displeasure of the governor and so forth. Unfortunately, the bills before them offer poor solutions and would have the effect of damaging many small communities and their very effective schools.The major theme in these bills is consolidation of school governance. Please remember that this was also the major theme of Act 46, which promised new efficiencies, lower costs and improved student outcomes in exchange for the loss of local control. How did that work out?My recommendation is to take the penalty. Throwing a rushed, bad pitch that lands ten rows up in the center field bleachers is a far worse outcome than the penalty for a delay.Vermont education funding is extremely complicated and finding reasonable solutions is tough work at best. The proposals from the administration assume that consolidation by itself will save money and that student performance will increase. Nonsense!

People just kept recognizing Russell Porter’s genius and offering him jobs.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Then Again: Art, Architecture, Astronomy and the Arctic — A Vermonter’s curious career.","Russell Porter couldn’t get enough of adventures in frigid climes, participating in nine Arctic and sub-Arctic expeditions. Photo via National ArchivesIf Russell Porter ever wrote a resume, recipients could be forgiven if they thought someone was playing a joke on them. At various times, he was an artist, but also an engineer. An architect, but also a cartographer. He was a builder, and a death-defying arctic explorer, while also being a ground-breaking telescope designer.In truth, Porter might never have had to write a resume and make sense of all this nonlinear bouncing between vocations and avocations. Resumes weren’t mandatory in the job market during the first half of the 20th century. More importantly, he didn’t seem to need one, because people just kept recognizing his genius and offering him jobs. Here’s some of what his resume might have covered: Born in Springfield, Vermont, in 1871. Took college preparatory classes at Vermont Academy in Saxtons River, from which he graduated. Skipped freshman year of college, enrolling as a sophomore at Norwich University before transferring to the University of Vermont to study engineering. Left UVM before graduating when his family suffered a financial blow.Moved to Boston, where he took a job appraising buildings for an insurance company. Became so fascinated with the buildings’ designs that he decided he would become an architect. Enrolled at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to study architecture, while still working part time as an appraiser to pay his bills.That’s when his career took its first surprising zag. In the fall of 1892, Porter attended a lecture by arctic explorer Robert Peary about his recent traverse of northern Greenland, which confirmed that it was indeed an island. Porter was transfixed by one thought — he had to join Peary’s team. As he explained, “Out of a clear sky that evening came to me the undefinable lure known as arctic fever.” Porter managed to secure an interview with Peary that winter in Washington. The conversation went well; Peary agreed to consider Porter for his next expedition.But Peary ultimately decided against taking Porter. Only years later did Porter learn that his mother had written the explorer, imploring him not to take her son.Russell Porter as a young man. Photo via Stellafane
The following year, Dr. Frederick Cook, who had been a member of Peary’s Greenland expedition, offered to take passengers to the Arctic for a fee of $500. Porter, who had studied painting under an accomplished MIT classmate and surveying in a college course, persuaded Cook to reduce the fee to $300. In exchange, Porter would serve as the group’s artist and surveyor. Apparently Porter’s mother didn’t object. Porter took leave from his job — he was working as an architectural draftsman by then — and voyaged north with Cook and 50 other paying passengers aboard a steamship. The Miranda attracted mishaps like a magnet. Departing the pier in New York City, the ship’s crew accidentally rammed the dock instead of backing out into the Hudson. En route to Greenland, the Miranda struck an iceberg. The ship stayed afloat, but needed repairs. Underway again, the Miranda struck an uncharted submerged reef, tearing a gash in its hull. The shriek of shredding metal filled the vessel. “I had for the first time been thoroughly frightened,” Porter wrote, referring to it as “tasting copper,” a sensation akin to what “one feels when placing upon the tongue certain electrodes that will generate a slight current.”The Miranda was beyond repair. Porter was one of a dozen men, including four Inuit guides, who boarded a sailboat to search for help. Sailing 150 miles north, crossing the Arctic Circle, the men located an American fishing schooner, the Rigel, which agreed to help. Once everyone had transferred from the Miranda onto the Rigel, the cable securing the Miranda was cast off and the stricken vessel steamed off into a fog bank, never to be seen again. Despite the dangers he’d faced, Porter was eager to return to the Arctic. He found the “fugitive glimpses of the shimmering ice cap” irresistible. Porter spent the next decade splitting time between Boston and expeditions in the frozen north. MIT gave Porter a scholarship to pursue postgraduate studies, even though he had never graduated college. But his mind was equally occupied with thoughts of the next expedition. When visiting Vermont in wintertime, he made a habit of getting off the train in Bellows Falls and walking the dozen miles to his family’s home to acclimate to the cold. In all, he would make another eight treks into the Arctic and sub-Arctic regions.Porter persuaded Peary to take him on an expedition hunting a large meteorite that had smashed into Greenland. Porter joined a small scientific team stationed in Umanak, a Danish settlement north of the Arctic Circle, where he oversaw the group’s food and camping equipment. In his free time, Porter helped the scientists monitor the movement of a nearby glacier. Peary didn’t find the meteorite, but Porter returned to Boston with watercolor portraits he had made of members of the local Inuit community. Porter rejoined Peary the next summer as he tried again to find the meteorite; this time, thanks to the help of Inuit guides, Peary was successful.After trying his luck in the Klondike gold rush in British Columbia, Porter joined the Baldwin-Ziegler Polar Expedition of 1901 as a surveyor and artist. The latter job almost got him killed. While sketching the shoreline one day, Porter became so engrossed in his work that he didn’t notice a large white bear approaching until it was about 100 feet away. The polar bear was already well aware of Porter, who was alone and about three miles from camp. Porter carried a rifle for just such an event. Aiming the gun at the bear, he pulled the trigger. The hammer moved as if in slow motion and came to rest gently on the firing pin. The gun’s oil had congealed in the frigid conditions. Porter dropped the gun, pulled out his knife and began shouting and dancing about. The display only made the bear more curious. Porter tasted copper for the second time in his life. In desperation, he whacked the gun over his knee in hopes of bringing it back to life, then raised the rifle again. This time it worked.Although the Baldwin-Ziegler Polar Expedition never lived up to its name — it never reached the North Pole — Porter returned to Boston impatient for his next chance. He signed on almost immediately with the Fiala-Ziegler Expedition, this time as artist, surveyor and assistant scientist. This expedition would be the most trying he endured.The America steams north of the Arctic Circle in this painting by Russell Porter. Photo via National ArchivesDuring the summer of 1903, Porter traveled to Russia, joining the expedition’s vessel, the America, and the rest of the crew in the far northern White Sea. While Porter and most of the men were camped on the northernmost island of the Franz Josef Archipelago, the America disappeared from its mooring one night during a heavy storm. Two days later, the men aboard the America managed to sail back to the bay, explaining that the ship had been blown out to sea. Things didn’t improve from there. In November, the America became trapped in the ice. The men salvaged goods from the ship and stripped every useful part before the America sank during a January storm. Subjected to cold and living off rationed food, the men split into feuding factions. To distract the men during the long, cold days, Porter fashioned a deck of playing cards from sheets of zinc, using his watercolors to paint the faces. The deck was four inches thick and weighed two pounds. His more serious task was taking celestial bearings to determine the location of their camp. While stranded, expedition leader Anthony Fiala made several attempts to reach the North Pole, selecting Porter as part of the team. But each effort failed. A relief ship finally rescued the men in the summer of 1905, after two years marooned above the Arctic Circle. After nine Arctic and sub-Arctic adventures, Porter decided at the age of 34 that it was time for a less perilous existence. His dream was now to start an art colony in Maine. He started by purchasing a house and 50 acres in Port Clyde from a fisherman. He soon married the fisherman’s daughter, Alice Belle Marshall. A few years later, the couple became parents to their daughter, Caroline.Crewmembers salvaged everything they could from the America after it was trapped in the ice. Photo via National ArchivesIf Port Clyde provided a fruitful place to start a family, his idea of forming an art colony there failed to take root. Porter shifted his attention to farming potatoes, like his neighbors, but only briefly. He moved on to something relevant to his actual training; he designed and built cottages to rent out, creating 14 unique designs for the houses, all done in a rustic English style. The next turning point in Porter’s life arrived in the mail. An old friend from Springfield, James Hartness, knowing that Porter was captivated by the cosmos during his years of Arctic navigation, sent him a copy of Popular Astronomy magazine. Porter’s celestial obsession dovetailed perfectly with the part of his brain that loved the challenges of engineering. Soon he was constructing telescopes, meticulously making his own mirrors, and building a small, domed observatory next to his home.Hartness, who had become wealthy as president of the Jones and Lamson Machine Company, mailed his friend $200 to support his telescope-building endeavors. He even gave Porter his decrepit Stevens Duryea automobile. The thing didn’t run, but no matter: its true value was providing parts for building telescopes. In Porter, Hartness had found a kindred spirit: the two corresponded regularly about telescope designs.Porter was on the move again in 1915, relocating to Boston with Alice and Caroline to teach architecture at MIT, a testament to his lived experience since he himself had never graduated. Soon, however, with World War I raging, Hartness, a leader in the machine tool industry, convinced officials with the National Bureau of Standards that Porter would be invaluable in Washington to solve issues producing enough optical instruments for the war effort.When the war ended, Hartness persuaded Porter to return to Springfield to help him develop an optical device to inspect screws for uniformity. It was less inspiring than spending nights gazing out through the Milky Way, but it paid the bills. Porter’s biographer, Berton C. Willard, wrote that Porter wasn’t “a joiner,” or “socially or civically minded.” But he was far from a hermit, and in fact Porter’s time in Springfield seems to contradict that characterization.In August 1920, Porter assembled a group of 16 men and one woman to teach them how to build telescopes, particularly the painstaking work of grinding and polishing mirrors by hand. Out of this first meeting of friends with a shared passion grew the Springfield Telescope Makers. Club members built a gathering place on a nearby hill owned by Porter, who naturally oversaw construction. He suggested they name it Stellar Fane, from the Latin for “shrine to the stars,” soon shortened to Stellafane. The group has held nearly annual gatherings since 1926, making it the longest-running astronomical convention in the United States. The founding members of the Springfield Telescope Makers club gather in 1920. Russell Porter is fourth from left. Photo via StellafaneGiven Porter’s unique combination of talents, it wasn’t hard to surprise his friends. Stellafane member Ralph Flanders, a manager at Jones and Lamson and a future U.S. senator, recalled an incident during a backcountry trip with Porter in Quebec. One night, while camped in a farmer’s field, Flanders asked Porter where exactly they were. “I’ll tell you,” Porter replied, taking out a saucer and pouring in maple syrup from their food supply, then balancing it on their car’s fender. Sighting the North Star with his sextant and bringing its image together with its reflection on the syrup, which acted as an artificial horizon in place of the sea’s horizon, he was able to calculate their latitude. Then, using the sextant, his wristwatch, and tables from his copy of The Nautical Almanac, along with the maple horizon, he determined their longitude. Scrawling the coordinates on a piece of paper, he said, “That’s where we are.” In 1925, Albert Ingalls, an editor at Scientific American magazine, visited Stellafane and came away impressed. His article about the club elicited enthusiastic letters to the editor from readers as far away as Alaska, Argentina, Australia, India, and Switzerland, demonstrating that amateur telescope building was becoming a global pastime. Porter became a leading figure in the hobby, writing regular pieces for Scientific American and other publications.Among his readers was George Ellery Hale, a prominent American astrophysicist who dreamed of building the world’s largest telescope. Ingalls arranged a dinner with Porter and Hale in New York City in early 1928 at which Porter spoke expertly about how Hale could realize his dream. Grabbing any paper that came to hand, he sketched out his ideas. Later that year, a pair of astronomers arrived in Springfield to speak with Porter. Not realizing who they were, Porter talked about a wide range of topics — the Arctic, art, life in Vermont. They might have skipped the topic of astronomy completely. Only when the men had left did Porter learn that Hale had sent them, and that he’d just been interviewed for a job. Apparently, it had gone well. Some weeks later, Hale telegraphed Porter: “Can you come to Pasadena for several months to assist in designing a 200-inch telescope.” Hale hoped Porter could “come at once to push work rapidly.”That telegram set the course for the final two decades of Porter’s life. Porter proved himself an invaluable addition to the team from California Institute of Technology building the massive telescope. With a mirror measuring 200 inches across, Hale’s telescope would be twice the size of the next largest in existence.Porter was initially assigned to design a specialized telescope to test the suitability of various sites around the Southwest. The team ultimately picked Palomar Mountain, southeast of Pasadena, as the location of the future observatory.Next, Porter designed a series of large Art Deco-style office and laboratory buildings. He also designed the mounting for the telescope, monitored manufacturing of the enormous mirror and devised the massive rotatable dome that would cover the telescope. One of his greatest contributions to the project, however, was creating masterful cutaway drawings that showed how parts that hadn’t yet been fabricated would interact. His drawings were credited with resolving heated debates within the team.“(T)o think that any artist had his pictorial imagination in such working order as to construct these pictures with no other material data than blue prints … is simply beyond belief,” declared famed New Hampshire painter Maxfield Parrish. “These drawings should be in a government museum of standards, in a glass case, along with the platinum pound weight, yard stick, etc. to show the world and what comes after just what a mechanical drawing should be. … The pity is that comparatively few will know about them, for their creation should be world news.”When World War II broke out, Porter’s skills were used to show the inner workings of rockets before a prototype had even been made. And when the U.S. military ran short of prisms for use in antiaircraft and artillery pieces, he rallied telescope enthusiasts to boost the supply. The amateurs manufactured more than 28,000 prisms that met the military’s exacting specifications.The war delayed the completion of the Palomar Observatory, but Porter lived just long enough to see it begin operation in 1948. The Hale Telescope allowed humans to see farther into the universe than ever before. It is still in operation today.Late in life, Porter received an honorary doctor of science degree from Norwich University. In January 1949, Middlebury College’s president and fellows voted to do likewise at the school’s spring graduation, but Porter died before he could receive it.As gratifying as those tributes might have been, Porter, that lover of barren landscapes, might have been more thrilled that two celestial craters — one on the moon, one on Mars — were named in his honor.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Then Again: Art, Architecture, Astronomy and the Arctic — A Vermonter’s curious career.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Arctic-expedition-1024x694.jpeg,,,2025-06-01 07:59:03.190884

This story was originally reported by Barbara Rodriguez and Jessica Kutz of The 19th. Meet Barbara and Jessica and read more of their reporting on gender, politics and policy.
Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced this week that the federal government no longer recommends the COVID-19 vaccination for healthy pregnant people and healthy children, a move that immediately raised questions from medical experts.
“Despite the change in recommendations from HHS, the science has not changed. It is very clear that COVID infection during pregnancy can be catastrophic and lead to major disability, and it can cause devastating consequences for families,” Dr. Steven J. Fleischman, president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said in a statement. “The COVID vaccine is safe during pregnancy, and vaccination can protect our patients and their infants.”
Kennedy did not cite any data along with his decision, though he has long questioned the need for frequent COVID-19 boosters for children.
Removing COVID vaccines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s recommendations for pregnant people or children could impact the availability of the vaccines or if they are covered by insurance. Dr. Sean T. O’Leary, chair of the Committee on Infectious Diseases for the American Academy of Pediatrics, said that removing the recommendation “could strip families of choice.”
“Those who want to vaccinate may no longer be able to, as the implications for insurance coverage and access remain unclear. … What is clear is that pregnant women, infants and young children are at higher risk of hospitalization from COVID, and the safety of the COVID vaccine has been widely demonstrated,” he said.
An HHS spokesperson did not immediately respond to The 19th’s request for comment.
Here’s what we know about Kennedy’s announcement and how it could impact pregnant people and access to the vaccines.
 Why were COVID-19 vaccines recommended to pregnant people and children to begin with? 

Scientific studies have shown that pregnant people are at higher risk of developing more severe cases of the virus than people who aren’t pregnant. As a result, pregnant people are more likely to end up hospitalized. They are also over 10 times more likely to die from COVID-19 compared to the general population. Studies have also shown a link between COVID and an increased risk of stillbirth.
Vaccinating pregnant people has not only been shown to lower these risks, but also offers some protection to newborns. Antibodies from a parent who received the vaccine while pregnant can provide some immunity to infants in the weeks and months after birth, according to Charlotte Moser, co-director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. “[It] is the safest way to protect those babies,” she said in an email.
Studies have shown that COVID-19 may be less severe in healthy children. But Moser said children who become infected with COVID-19 are at risk of being hospitalized, developing long COVID or dying from the virus. COVID-19 vaccines decrease those risks.
 Will my health insurance still cover a COVID-19 vaccine if I’m pregnant? What about for my children? 

“It is not totally clear yet,” said Joshua Sharfstein, a public health professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. He was also a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) official under the Obama administration.
Under the Affordable Care Act, insurance providers are required to cover vaccines recommended by the CDC, but some experts, including Sharfstein, are concerned that this announcement could mean insurance companies are no longer mandated to cover the COVID-19 vaccine for “healthy” pregnant people and children.
It’s still too early to know whether private insurance companies will remove vaccines from their coverage. It may still be more cost effective for companies to pay for the vaccine, versus paying for severe illnesses that might result from being unvaccinated, experts said.
Sharfstein said private insurance is still clearly required to cover a COVID-19 vaccine for a pregnant person or child who has a medical condition that meets the criteria for a higher risk of severe COVID.
But it’s unclear who falls under these categories, said Dr. Kathryn Edwards, a longtime expert in infectious diseases. She noted that the health secretary is contradicting an FDA announcement last week that listed pregnant people as a high risk category that makes them eligible for the vaccine.
“They need to get their message straight,” she said in an email.
 How will this affect access to COVID-19 vaccines? 

That’s also unclear. Richard Hughes, an attorney at the law firm Epstein Becker Green, who previously served as vice president of public policy for a major vaccine manufacturer during the COVID pandemic, said manufacturers could eventually reduce their supply as they determine their bottom lines. That could shake up overall product availability at doctors’ offices and pharmacies.
In addition, if private insurance companies stop covering the vaccine, it could be a barrier for those with low incomes.
“We know that any amount of out-of-pocket [cost] for a vaccine is going to discourage a patient from getting vaccinated,” he said. “The more that increases, the less likely they are to get it.”
This announcement does not immediately impact the Vaccines for Children (VFC) Program, a federally-funded initiative that aims to vaccinate children whose parents or caregivers might not be able to afford them. However, given how the health secretary has sidestepped protocol to remove this recommendation for pregnant people, some experts worry that Kennedy may similarly make decisions for the VFC program.
 Wait, so can Kennedy do this?

Medical experts say Kennedy’s announcement — which came via a one-minute video posted on X — appeared unilateral, since a key vaccine panel that would typically make such recommendations did not appear to vote on the matter. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), which is housed under the CDC, isn’t scheduled to meet again until June.
Kennedy, as HHS secretary, does have legal authority to modify recommendations made by an advisory committee, according to Hughes.
But experts say this decision is highly unusual. This is the first time a health secretary has circumvented the typical review process for vaccination recommendations, and experts stressed that making these kinds of decisions — which they described as not using the science-based procedures that are in place — puts lives at risk.
Several also noted Kennedy’s lack of medical expertise and his long history of vaccine skepticism.
“This signals that health advice for all Americans is now subject to the whim of the secretary of HHS who has no relevant expertise and a long track record of misleading people about vaccines. This should be of concern to everyone,” said Marc Lipsitch, a professor of epidemiology at Harvard’s school of public health, in an email.
 Will this decision face legal challenges? 

“I expect there will be lawsuits and I expect the administration is not in a good position for those lawsuits,” said Dorit Rubenstein Reiss, a professor of law at the University of California College of Law, San Francisco.
Reiss predicted the decision will be challenged in court by patients who could file a lawsuit if they are denied coverage for the vaccine from insurance companies. Cities and states who buy the vaccination could also sue, she said.
Both the lack of evidence presented by the health secretary and what appeared to be procedural irregularities in making this decision could bolster these court challenges, she said. Not only did Kennedy appear to sidestep the committee that makes these decisions, but he appears in the announcement alongside Jay Bhattacharya, director of the National Institutes of Health, and Marty Makary, the commissioner of the FDA. Those men have an anti-COVID vaccine bias, and neither role is typically involved in vaccine recommendations.
“It’s ignoring our usual process that involves expert deliberation and examination of the decision and making what looks like a political decision without a lot of consideration of the effects,” she said.
The fact that Kennedy did not provide evidence for the change is also problematic, Reiss said.
“If you look at the recommendation for pregnant women, it’s a lengthy document by ACIP setting up why they think pregnant women should get the vaccine [which includes] data,” she said. That decision can’t be reversed with a one-minute video on social media, she said. “Under administrative law, an agency is expected to explain its actions.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/preg-1.png,,,2025-06-01 07:59:03.190884
,Mississippi Today,2025-06-01 11:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,‘Sinners’ and the Blues used to tell epic story of the Great Migration,Bobby Harrison,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/06/01/sinners-and-the-blues-used-to-tell-epic-story-of-the-great-migration/,"Column: The epic story of the Great Migration — and the influence of Blues music on the world — is at the heart of the epic movie ""Sinners.""","Note: Special screenings of “Sinners” were held in Clarksdale this week after residents decried the lack of a movie theater. You can read more about those events here.

Blues music has long been linked to the mystical or supernatural.
After all, the seminal Blues tale is of legend Robert Johnson selling his soul to the devil at the crossroads of U.S. Highways 49 and 61 in the Delta to be able to play a guitar like no one else.
In the movie “Sinners,” set in 1932 Clarksdale in the very Delta town where Johnson is rumored to have made that faustian bargain, those mystical connections are taken to a whole new level.
The movie is based on the believable theory that music or especially gifted musicians can conjure up magic through their performances. Surely, that theory is relatable. After all, many people have been moved spiritually by all types of music. But the movie concludes these gifted musicians can conjure up good and, yes, bad spirits from the past and the future.
In “Sinners,” Sammie, played by actor Miles Caton, who recently visited Clarksdale for a special showing of the movie, is such a talented musician that vampires are attracted to his offerings.
Yes, this is a vampire movie. On first blush, the movie may not seem all that realistic. After all, why would twin brothers Smoke and Stack, both played by Michael B. Jordan, escape the Mississippi Delta after World War I, move to Chicago and then return home in the midst of Jim Crow and the hatred and lynchings it entailed? That seems almost more unbelievable than vampires.
But the brothers referred to Chicago as Jim Crow with tall buildings, though there also was the inference that they might have returned home to try to escape from some issues they had with their employer, the Al Capone crime syndicate.
The movie is so rich with symbolism that perhaps the juke joint where Sammie, the brothers and their allies try to find safety represents their Mississippi home. And perhaps the vampires that lurked outside represent those migratory cities: rich with opportunities (as the vampires in the movie offer) but also rife with dangers. But near the end of the movie, the dangers of their Mississippi home are made clear in vivid detail.
At the heart of the multidimensional movie, which could be considered a musical, is the story of that Great Migration — the period, of course, when Africans Americans fled the nastiness of the South, taking with them the rich and unique culture of their home.
Mississippi still has the largest percentage of Black residents — about 38% — of any state. But remember, the state had a majority Black population before the Great Migration. Black Mississippians who left had an enormous influence on the rest of the nation, and Black Mississippians who stayed can be credited with helping lead a reckoning over numerous American civil rights.
That reckoning, coupled with other aspects of the Great Migration, forever changed the South, changed the north and arguably changed all the world.
An important part of that change was the expansion and the impact that the Delta Blues brought to the world. That impact was highlighted in the surprising and inspiring feel-good ending that will remain unwritten here in deference to the people who have not yet seen the movie.
Family members of “Sinners” director Ryan Coogler were part of that Great Migration. But in an interview, Coogler said he did not recognize the full extent of that impact until he started researching and making the movie.
“I found that there’s a legitimate argument to be made that the Delta Blues music is America’s most important contribution to global popular culture,” Coogler told IndieWire. “It might be America’s most important artistic contribution to humanity came out of this place, and that’s when I realized that the film had to be epic.”
And it is epic, just as the Great Migration at the heart of the movie was.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/29124042/AP25094161362490.jpg,,,2025-06-01 07:59:03.190884

Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerChittenden property owner John Gerlach has been found in contempt in the latest development  of an ongoing legal battle with Mountain Top Resort. The May 22 decision came after Gerlach removed a rope barring access to one of the resort’s cross-country trails.The dispute began last summer when Gerlach and his wife, Debra, relocated two of the resort’s trails that ran through their private land.The Gerlachs purchased the property with an easement that allowed Mountain Top Resort to operate ski trails within their property lines, but also permitted the Gerlach family to move trails as long as cross-country skiers had access to similarly safe and groomed trails. The resort’s general manager and activities director said at the time that the two modified trails were too narrow and steep to groom, limiting their cross-country skiing guests’ access and potentially hurting their business.In October, Rutland Superior Court Judge Alexander Burke agreed with the resort in a preliminary injunction, which granted the resort permission to use the original trails and prohibited the Gerlachs from interfering with existing trails or the resort’s maintenance and safety measures.But in February, the resort claimed in a motion to the court the Gerlach family violated the terms of the order by obstructing safety markers and using snowmobile equipment on resort trails. The resort asserted such activities affect employees’ ability to maintain existing trails, although snowmobiles are used on other resort pathways.READ MORE
During a Christmas visit to Chittenden from his primary residence in Florida, John Gerlach took down a rope the resort placed on the Sunset Trail to bar cross-country skiers entry, and used a snowmobile on trails crossing his property where such activities are not allowed by the resort.In the May 22 decision, Burke held John Gerlach in contempt for removing the rope marking the trail closure, but disagreed that use of snowmobile equipment violated the injunction and impaired the resort’s ability to maintain trails. John Gerlach’s son, Jake, also was found to have snowmobiled and repeatedly removed rope from a closed trail during a visit to the Chittenden property in March, but Burke did not find him in contempt, as he was not the subject of the initial injunction.The Gerlachs were ordered to not remove the resort’s trail closure ropes and to instruct their guests to follow suit. The Gerlachs must also pay the resort’s attorney fees related to the motion requesting enforcement of the injunction and sanctions. This is not the only legal conflict the Gerlach family has faced over trails.The Gerlachs claimed the town of Chittenden failed to legally establish a public trail running through their 600-acre property. The previous land owners entered an agreement in 2006 allowing a former road running through the property to be transformed into a publicly accessible hiking trail.In a May 5 ruling, Burke denied the Gerlachs’ request for the court to rule that no past agreements properly set up the trail for public use after a similar route was discontinued in the 1800s. Burke instead granted summary judgement to the town, asserting the previous owners “unequivocally intended to dedicate the disputed trail to public use.”A lawyer for the Gerlach family and lawyers for the town of Chittenden were not immediately available for comment Friday.Khele Sparks, general manager of the Mountain Top Resort, said the resort could not offer comment at this stage of litigation. Read the story on VTDigger here:  Trail tensions escalate: Chittenden landowner held in contempt in legal battle with Mountain Top Resort.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/mountaintop-resort-1-20241114-1024x676.jpg,,,2025-06-01 07:01:10.732875

He says while climate change affects both the quality and quantity of cacao, there might be a silver lining for cacao farmers.“Climate change is a crisis, but it also brings an opportunity for the farmers to negotiate better prices,” he said.Méndez says the consumers in the Global North might need to start paying more and offering more support to the producers in the Global South.“Of course, they don’t want to do it, because they’re going to lose some of that profit,” he said. “But they’re realizing now that if they don’t do it, they might not have enough supply.”Meghan Fitzpatrick at Lake Champlain Chocolates agrees. She says people and corporations that buy cocoa have long enjoyed low prices.“We — people who enjoy chocolate — we haven’t really been paying what chocolate is worth for a really long time,” she said.Fitzpatrick said Lake Champlain Chocolates started a new program this year to award micro-grants to cacao farmers to help address issues caused by climate change.“We’re looking to make some systemic changes at that level, you know, ensuring our future, because climate change is a real issue with cocoa,” she said.As the climate changes, everyone who is part of the cocoa supply chain is adapting. Luckily, Amy Huyffer at Strafford Organic Creamery said, that’s what farmers are good at.“Two most important words in farming are ‘oh’ and ‘well,’” she said. “So we’ll figure it out.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  Sweet survival: Vermont businesses navigate climate cocoa crisis.",https://i0.wp.com/vtcommunitynews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/peter-miller-dairy-farm-vernon-community-news-service-20250422-edited.jpg?resize=4414%2C2942&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-01 07:01:10.732875

Read the story on VTDigger here:  What is: Winning an episode of ‘Jeopardy’?.","Jim Carpenter is the first “Jeopardy” contestant from Charlotte. He was last Friday’s champion. Photo courtesy of Jim CarpenterThis story by Liberty Darr was first published in The Citizen on May 29.Some Charlotters might recognize Jim Carpenter as a regular on the pickleball courts, but now all of America knows him as a champion on the beloved television show “Jeopardy,” after winning last Friday’s nail-biter of an episode.The six-year Charlotte resident — born and raised in Burlington — is now one of 53 Vermonters since 1995 who have competed on the show. But according to Alison Shapiro Cooke, the TV show’s executive director of publicity and communications, Carpenter is the only Charlotter to make an appearance in the show’s history.The show itself has garnered a cult following over the years and many people associate watching the show with their growing-up years. For Carpenter, his experience was similar. He said he grew up watching the show with his dad.“Even after I was grown up and gone and would come back and visit, he and I would watch it together and try to beat each other out,” he said.He had been taking the online 50-question “anytime tests” — an entry point for anyone who wants to compete on “Jeopardy” — for a few years but had never actually anticipated being on the big screen. But one day, out of the blue, he got an email asking him to do a monitored test over zoom.“I mean, there are so many people who take those tests, I never really expected much to come of it,” he said.He continued through a few more Zoom tests, making it to the final mock test round before he was placed in a pool of applicants eligible to be on the show, but still the odds of actually getting called aren’t guaranteed.In February, he got the phone call and luckily his wife was around to suggest he answer the random California number that he thought was spam.“My cell phone rings, and I looked at it and it was a California number that I didn’t recognize,” Carpenter recalled. “And my wife, I said, ‘Oh, who’s calling your cell phone?’ I said, ‘Well, it’s California. It’s probably spam.’ She said, ‘Well, no, wait a minute, that might be ‘‘Jeopardy.’’ So, I answered it, and it was.”He flew to Los Angeles in February for two days of filming with nearly 10 other contestants. When it came time for his turn, Carpenter was up against some stiff competition, the prior three-day champion, Brendan Liaw, a recent college graduate from Vancouver.“He was looking pretty hot and pretty confident going into the game,” Carpenter said. “I got off to a little bit of a slow start.”One of the most challenging parts of the game, he said, was learning the timing of the buzzer. Contestants are only allowed to buzz once the entire question has been asked.“You don’t see this on TV, but there are blue lights on either side of the big game board, and those blue lights flash on when the buzzers are actually enabled to answer the question,” he said. “When it comes on, you start clicking away to see if you can actually beat everybody else to the buzzer.”Carpenter, a retired music professor, doesn’t tout himself as some sort of trivia buff. The knowledge that it takes in a multitude of different topics to compete on the show came from being both well-read and well-versed, he said. Teaching music at different colleges and being immersed in the university realm also helped him to engage in a slew of different subjects and conversations.And, of course, he is an avid New York Times crossword buff.“There’s a lot of funny and obscure little bits and pieces that come out of that sort of thing,” he said. “I’ve always just had kind of a sticky memory where I will remember all kinds of odd little bits of information that somehow get stuck in my head.”Carpenter won $25,601 during his first game and ultimately brought home the gold in Final Jeopardy. The question in the category of “Time” was: “Eponymously named and in use for more than 1,600 years, it was based in part on concepts from the Greek mathematician Sosigenes.”Carpenter, the only contestant to answer correctly and wager enough money to give him a leg up, wrote down “What is the Julian calendar?”“Where I knew that from, I have no idea at this point, but it came into my head,” he said, letting out a laugh.While he didn’t secure a win Monday night in his follow-up appearance, competing for that long as a fan — and securing a win as a contestant — was enough for him. Not many people can add ‘winning Jeopardy’ to their list of accolades, after all.“My whole thought was, whether I win or whether I lose, this is an experience that not very many people get to have,” he said. “I was a little nervous going out and certainly hoping that I would not do something to look really dumb in front of a national audience, but my whole mindset was just to go out and enjoy the experience.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  What is: Winning an episode of ‘Jeopardy’?.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/jim-carpenter-jeopardy-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-01 07:01:10.732875

Morgan Brown has fought to get Vermonters to recognize the humanity of their unhoused neighbors — inspired by his own housing instability. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Montpelier advocate reflects on cancer journey, advocating for unhoused neighbors and how the community has given back to him.","Morgan Brown and his cat Cleo. Photo courtesy of Morgan BrownOn Montpelier’s lively Front Porch Forum, Morgan Brown is one of the most frequent posters, providing local news, commentary and occasional humor. “Can’t sleep at night? Restless?” began one recent post. “Not to worry, call the Insomnia Warmline. Our professionally trained, volunteer, experienced peers, people who are sleepless at night as well, will bore you to sleep.”When Brown went silent for several months this winter, his absence was noted by locals. Upon his return in February, he had some not-so-humorous news to share: He had been diagnosed with an aggressive case of colon cancer and been in and out of the hospital for weeks. The response was immediate and kind. “Morgan Brown, So sorry to hear of your health struggles. I’m thinking of you,” Cindy McCloud wrote on Front Porch Forum. Brown told VTDigger he was incredibly grateful for the Montpelierians who had driven him to the hospital, brought him omelettes and scrambled eggs, and looked after his cat, Miss “Cleo” Cleopatra, while he was gone. “I’ve learned not to say no because that sometimes pisses people off because they want to help,” he said. In mid-May, Brown received a positive update. His oncologist told him he could have a year or more to live if he pursued treatment, rather than his initial prognosis of three months to a year. Photo courtesy of Morgan BrownBrown fully intends to pursue treatment. However, he said he’s still in a lot of pain. “I’m a fighter, and I intend to beat those odds, so I intend to be around for a while,” he said. “Winston Churchill’s favorite saying every day in the morning was, ‘Keep buggering on.’ And that’s basically a model I’ve adopted — keep buggering on.”Brown’s diagnosis has also forced him to retire from his passion of advocating for unhoused Vermonters, especially those living on the streets of Montpelier. Brown has attended protests, served on the city’s Homelessness Task Force, and written commentaries for outlets like VTDigger in support of policies that would provide more compassion and support to unhoused Vermonters. The issue is personal to him. Brown spent 12 years living unhoused, transitioning between a variety of living situations before he found housing 15 years ago. When it comes to housing policy, Brown is adamant and firm. “There shouldn’t be one person living outside,” he said. Brenda Siegel, executive director of End Homelessness Vermont and a friend of Brown’s, called him a well-respected member of the community who gives with “all of his heart.”She said she was saddened to hear of his cancer diagnosis. “I don’t really want to know a world where Morgan Brown is not part of the life that I have or the work that I do because we need him here,” she said. READ MORE
‘Every person is worth the effort’Brown grew up in eastern Massachusetts but said he never felt connected to it. “I don’t say I’m from there. I say I was plopped there as a little kid,” he said. Photo courtesy of Morgan BrownHe first came to Vermont more than 30 years ago. He had chipped in to help a friend get their car up to Montpelier. From the first time he saw the small city, he knew he wanted to live there. “I saw the kids hanging out in front of City Center. I said to myself, ‘Well, if they can do that, this place is for me, you know, I’ll be accepted,’” he said. For a while Brown lived at Another Way, a local community center for unhoused Vermonters and psychiatric survivors. The center did not usually allow people to live there, but he had an “unofficial” arrangement, he said. “Otherwise, I would have been out in the woods with a tarp,” he said. Eventually, with the assistance of an employee at Washington County Mental Health Services, Brown was able to get a motel room, then an apartment. When asked about how his experience informs his opinions on the housing crisis, he deflected. “I try not to just use my own perspective. I watch and I listen to whoever’s outside and whatever. And I actually draw more on that than my own (experience),” he said.Lately, he’s had a hard time keeping up with the local unhoused community because his health mostly keeps him at home. Brown lives in a small efficiency apartment in a multi-unit building with Cleo, a 12-year-old cat with a “voracious appetite.”His recent hospitalization was the longest the two had been apart since he adopted her 11 years ago. “Ever since I got back from the hospital, she hasn’t let me out of her sight,” Brown said. He recalled one of the last in-person protests he was able to attend was the sleep-in on the steps of the Vermont Statehouse in 2021, when activists camped out at the Capitol for weeks to protest the removal of unhoused Vermonters from the motel program.Although he stayed with them for only one night — and “didn’t get any sleep at all,” he said — Siegel recalled Brown coming by to give the protesters water and moral support, then getting a hotel room in town for them when the protest was over so they could go straight to bed. “He did not tell us, because we would have refused,” she said. “It was just like, I can’t quite describe it, but he would show up with whatever he had and give all of it.”Since then, the two have kept in touch through text and email. Siegel has read Brown’s poetry out loud at various protests and events. “He writes beautiful poetry, and especially beautiful poetry about the experience of homelessness and the experience of watching other people go through it after now that he’s housed,” she said. His poetry, political writing and observations about daily life are collected on his blog, Green Mountain Meandering Missives. At times he addresses his thoughts on the housing crisis directly to Gov. Phil Scott.“It boggles the mind how your administration can be so deliberately indifferent and uncaring when it comes to those who are being or already have been evicted from the Vermont Hotel/Motel Program without those persons having anywhere else safe and secure to go inside, day or night,” he wrote in an open letter to Scott last month.The Legislature and Scott have clashed in recent years over whether to extend funding to the state’s motel program, which housed thousands of Vermonters during the Covid-19 pandemic but has slowly been rolled back. To everyday Vermonters, Brown asked them to consider doing for others what they would want done for their loved ones if they were facing a difficult situation. “What would you want for your loved ones? You’d pull out all the stops, right?” he said. He said society tends to classify certain people as “not worth it” — but Brown said he believes “every human life, every person is worth the effort.”“The problem is sometimes people have given up on themselves, so we need to double down on them. We need to show them that they matter. That somebody cares for them, even if they don’t care for themselves,” he said. “And that, sometimes it helps. Without wanting something from them. They’re not obliged, there’s no expectation. I’m not a religious person, per se, but it’s God’s true love.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  Montpelier advocate reflects on cancer journey, advocating for unhoused neighbors and how the community has given back to him.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Morgan-Brown-2-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-01 07:01:10.732875

Left to right, Jeff Carmon, Chairman Francis DeLuca, Stacy ""Four"" Eggers, Siohban Millen, and Robert Rucho. Our democracy, with free and fair elections at the cornerstone, can be warped in favor of those who manipulate the election process to their advantage – who gets to vote, when and where, and which votes are included when they’re finally counted. Call that a cornerstone of autocracy.
For the past 15 years in North Carolina, ever since Republicans captured majorities in the state House and Senate amid President Obama’s first-term struggles, the party has sought to solidify its hold on power in just that fashion.
The tactics have been manifold: gerrymandering that puts Republicans in disproportionate numbers of safe seats. Photo ID rules that cut against groups of voters who might tend to favor Democrats. Stricter rules for absentee voting that result in some ballots being tossed because they weren’t received in time, perhaps because of postal delays.
Republican legislators have been the driving force behind such changes – with elected Republican judges helpfully turning aside cries of foul from Democrats and their allies among voting-rights advocates.
All of that brings us to a chain of events triggered by last fall’s elections, in which Democrat Josh Stein claimed the governor’s mansion and, by a single seat in the House, Republicans lost their veto-proof legislative majority. The results apparently left Republicans in the General Assembly to vow, “You ain’t seen nothing yet!”
The counter-strategy they cooked up has panned out with what amounts to a hostile takeover of an agency that worked to advance the principles of honest, orderly elections in which every eligible citizen is encouraged to participate. That is of course the State Board of Elections – under control of the governor’s party by virtue of a law dating back decades.
The takeover was set in motion when it became clear that, with Stein’s victory, the board otherwise would continue with a Democratic majority. Legislators decreed that instead of by the governor, appointments to the board would be made by the state auditor – a post captured in the November balloting by Republican Dave Boliek.
In essence, the auditor would hold the reins when it came to the state’s election oversight. The changeover would – and did – take effect on May 1, after Stein’s court challenge was sidetracked by Republicans on the state Court of Appeals and then the state Supreme Court.
Court contest’s lessons
As it would happen, much water went under the bridge between the passage in December (over Stein’s veto) of Senate Bill 382 and the power shift in which Boliek appointed new Republican members to run the board, and the board’s nationally heralded executive director, Democratic appointee Karen Brinson Bell, was ousted.
North Carolina’s political headlines throughout the end of 2024 and the first months of 2025 were dominated by the contested Supreme Court election between Democratic incumbent Justice Allison Riggs and her challenger, Republican Judge Jefferson Griffin of the Court of Appeals.
Riggs’ 734-vote victory finally was nailed down on May 5 – no thanks to Griffin’s allies on the two appellate courts who agreed with him that thousands of votes shouldn’t have been counted. It took a Republican-appointed federal judge to explain why disallowing those votes would have violated the constitutional rights of citizens who cast them.
Here’s where the Riggs-Griffin clash and the Board of Elections saga became intertwined. The board, for reasons ultimately validated by Chief U.S. District Judge Richard Myers, resisted the attempt to disallow votes that Griffin claimed shouldn’t have been counted, even though the people who cast them, including military and overseas voters, hadn’t knowingly violated any rules and there was no evidence of fraud.
If the board hadn’t pushed back, insisting for example that overseas voters actually didn’t need to submit copies of photo IDs, chances are that enough votes from likely Democrats would have been tossed aside that Griffin would have won the race.
Myers boiled down his thinking in everyday language: The legality of certain conduct should be assessed according to the laws in effect at the time. “That principle will be familiar to anyone who has played a sport or board game,” he wrote. “You establish the rules before the game. You don’t change them after the game is done.”
That was the election board’s point all along. Yes, it aligned with Democratic arguments. But nobody would accuse Judge Myers of carrying the Democrats’ water.
Auditor’s mission creep
While Griffin’s effort to overtake Riggs worked its way through the judicial pipeline, the law transferring election oversight to the state auditor was being challenged by Stein as an infringement on his executive powers. He argued that the state constitution gives him final responsibility for seeing that the laws are faithfully carried out, and thus he needs to be able to appoint a majority on the elections board who share his commitment to elections operated in the public interest.
Other attempts by the General Assembly to horn in the powers of Stein’s predecessor, Democrat Roy Cooper, were turned aside by the courts as violations of the separation of powers between the legislative and executive branches. In the case of S.B. 382, top lawmakers argued that since state auditors are themselves executive branch officials, the legislature’s constitutional prerogative to assign duties within that branch allows them to take oversight of the elections board away from Stein and give it to Boliek.
In accord with the state’s procedure for refereeing alleged constitutional violations, Stein’s lawsuit was routed to a three-judge panel in Wake County Superior Court.
After a full-dress review, with briefs and oral arguments, the panel on April 23 reached a 2-1 decision that Stein’s complaints were justified. Even though North Carolina parcels out various executive duties to the elected members of the Council of State, including such figures as the state treasurer and the attorney general as well as the state auditor, the panel held that under the state constitution ultimate responsibility for the appointed Board of Elections lies with the governor. The two-person majority included one Democratic judge and one Republican. A Republican judge dissented.
Republican Senate President Pro Tem Phil Berger and House Speaker Destin Hall appealed to the Republican-dominated state Court of Appeals. On April 30 – the day before the election board change was to take effect – a three-person panel of the court’s judges sided with the legislators, meaning that the changeover could go ahead. The unanimous, unsigned ruling contained no explanation and the judges who participated weren’t identified. No prizes for accountability there!
Stein filed a last-ditch appeal with the Supreme Court, where Republicans also rule the roost. With no immediate intervention by the high court, Boliek on May 1 took command of North Carolina’s election machinery. Instead of a 3-2 Democratic majority with a Democratic chairman, with Boliek’s appointees the elections board emerged with a 3-2 Republican majority.
The new chairman is Francis De Luca, a Republican activist who hardly has been a cheerleader for so-called same-day registration during early voting – a convenience encouraging many eligible citizens to cast their ballots. Another new member, former Republican state Sen. Robert Rucho, would belong in the Gerrymanderers Hall of Fame, were there such a dubious institution, for his work to tilt the scales in favor of Republican candidates for the legislature and Congress.
High court’s tilt
When the Supreme Court finally responded to Stein’s appeal, it rejected the governor’s argument that the reassignment of election oversight to the auditor should have been blocked while the appellate courts weighed the constitutional issues.
That leaves the election board’s new governance structure intact while Stein pursues his case. Of course as time elapses, as Boliek proceeds to appoint new members of county election boards and as this fall’s elections approach, unwinding that new structure becomes increasingly impractical.
The high court’s opinion was unsigned, meaning it was supported by the five Republican justices, although Justice Richard Dietz in a concurrence criticized the Court of Appeals’ opaque handling of the matter. Dissents came from the court’s two Democrats – Riggs, freshly sworn back into office after her drawn-out election win, and Anita Earls.
“The voters hired Joshua Stein and David Boliek to do specific jobs, and the General Assembly is restructuring those jobs after the election,” Earls wrote. “The General Assembly may not grab power over enforcement of election laws by shuttling the Board [of Elections] between statewide elected officials until it finds one willing to do its bidding.”
Well, that sort of power grab looks to be just what the legislature’s Republican chiefs had in mind, and acceding to it looks to be just what the appellate courts are inclined to do.
Continue down that path, and they’ll be turning over supervision of the state’s elections to people whose “election integrity” mantra has proven to be code for voter suppression driven by right-wing partisanship. Not only does that degrade our democratic system, but it also puts the best interests of many North Carolinians vulnerable to economic, educational, environmental and health challenges at unacceptable risk.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_4499-1-1024x366.jpg,,,2025-06-01 07:01:10.732875

Moreover, the problem of fake news is increasing as we become ever more polarized and as our government tries to undermine and to silence media that exposes intentions and actions it wants to keep hidden from us. Adding to the problem is the proliferation of social media posts that may or may not be accurate.
Increasingly, I have become a supporter of independent journalism and have dropped my subscriptions to local papers — owned by what some call vulture equity firms, interested only in power and profit. I’ve even dropped my long-time subscriptions to two well-known national newspapers. Instead, I support my local library, where I can access, online, my local newspaper, as well as national news publications such as The New York Times and The Washington Post.

I am not necessarily advocating that you drop your newspaper subscription. Instead, I am hoping you are aware of the many independent news sources available to you. In Colorado, among those I support are Colorado Sun, Mountain Ear and this newspaper, Colorado Newsline (part of the States Newsroom organization).
Conveniently, in Colorado alone there are many more independent news sources than the three I have named. The Media and Democracy Project has compiled a list that can be found at the organization’s website.
Personally, I also support a number of independent national news sources, some of which are identified online at trustworthymedia.org.
Most crucially, I support those organizations that support independent journalism in a variety of ways — organizations such as the Colorado News Collaborative, the Freedom of the Press Foundation, the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, and the Media and Democracy Project.
What do I mean by independent news sources? Independent news sources are those that are free from the influence of governments, corporations or special interest groups, ensuring that what they report is truthful. To determine independence, you could begin by looking at whether the news source is more reliant on facts than on opinions/arguments, by investigating the sources of its funding and whether there are potential conflicts of interest, by evaluating its history and track record (e.g., its record for exposing criminality or abuses of power), and by assessing the extent to which it follows established journalistic standards and ethics.
When I want to ensure that what I am reading is trustworthy, I search for primary sources if available (e.g., a C-Span video or a legal document) and for additional reports on the topic. I search FactCheck.org, Reuters Fact Check, Snopes, and Media Bias/Fact Check, too — all available online.
We are awash in fake news, and it is eating away at our society. We deserve an honest, skeptical, independent press. Too much of corporate-run media is only interested in lining their own pockets at our expense. According to a Sept. 18, 2020, article in TechStartups online:

These media conglomerates are owned by the elite or the ruling class, which extends its reach to encompass not only traditional power structures but also modern behemoths like big tech companies, exerting control over the content we consume — what we read, watch, and listen to …
The term “elite” often slips into our conversations without much thought, yet its roots and significance remain unfamiliar to many. Derived from the French élite, which traces back to the Latin eligere, meaning “to select or to sort out,” elites represent a select group of influential individuals who wield a disproportionate share of wealth, privilege, political power, or expertise within society.

With final passage Saturday of a major early childhood education bill, legislators will return Monday to begin their three-day push to Wednesday night’s adjournment deadline with a limited to-do list topped by adopting a biennial budget and voting on a bipartisan energy deal.
Gov. Ned Lamont, and his wife, Annie, made a surprise visit to the state Capitol as the House debated Senate Bill 1, legislation creating a groundbreaking new fund for early childhood education that was Lamont’s major initiative in a year dominated by his desire to keep state finances under a spending cap.
“I think that’s a really big deal,” Lamont said of SB 1. “That was my No. 1 priority.”
The bill also expands the state’s support for special education, a legislative initiative accepted by an administration wary of new spending, even as the state is sitting on record budget reserves and continues to pay down Connecticut’s considerable unfunded pension liability.
While the governor posed for selfies with Democratic lawmakers, House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, invited him to a brief, private discussion about an unresolved budget issue: a desire by Democratic lawmakers to establish even a modest child tax credit.

It was an unscripted moment.
“I was just walking through. Figured we’re here, say hi to the folks, wish them well. They just said, ‘Come on in. Let’s talk about something,’” Lamont said, as he exited the impromptu negotiation.
His top budget official, Jeffrey Beckham, was hastily summoned to join the chat, which also included the governor’s chief of staff, Matt Brokman. Nothing was resolved during the conversation, and the child tax credit’s prospects faded as the day progressed.
The last days of every annual session are unlike the previous months.
The combination of an unyielding constitutional adjournment deadline of midnight Wednesday and a tradition of unlimited debate means little can pass without bipartisan consent, empowering Republican minorities that hold fewer than one-third of seats in the House and Senate.
That shift means that Senate Bill 4, an effort to reduce Connecticut’s high electric rates, was being rewritten to accommodate a demand by House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, over procedures at the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority.
“There is definitely movement. I think the PURA language that was important, that we’re negotiating, is going our way. We’re having consensus. The legislature has come together in that language. It looks like we will have rate relief,” Candelora said. “It looks like we’ll be able to run it on Monday or Tuesday.”
On Friday, debate on a highway safety bill, HB 7160, was halted while lawyers discussed whether a Republican amendment increasing the penalty for distracted drivers could be adopted under the rules without a referral to the Judiciary Committee. Such a late referral would kill the bill.
“There are always bumps in the road and things that throw us off, right?” House Majority Leader Jason Rojas, D-East Hartford, said Saturday, before the House convened. “I think there’s general agreement on the underlying bill.”
Indeed, the bill was brought back for passage on a 140-5 vote Saturday evening with bipartisan backing — and the briefest of debates. It now goes to the Senate.

There is nuance in how the tradition of unlimited debate and power sharing in the final days is observed. The legislature’s rules allow a motion to end debate and call a vote, a tool rarely employed. If filibusters are overused, Candelora knows that is an invitation for Democrats to call the question. 
What constitutes overuse is not precisely defined.
Candelora opposes Senate Bill 1, which would create an early childhood trust fund that is off budget and outside the spending cap. It passed on a 101-45 vote with no Republican support. But Candelora did not consider trying to stop final passage Saturday with a filibuster.
“We know this is going to be in the budget. So for us to filibuster this and talk it ’til Wednesday is kind of unrealistic, and it’s physically difficult to get members to stay here for six days,” Candelora said.
A multi-day filibuster likely would have provoked a vote to end debate. 
On opening day on Jan. 8, Ritter warned his own party to have their bills ready for votes before the final weeks of the session, when passage grows more difficult. And he cautioned Republicans not to abuse the filibuster. Both warnings were applauded.

The Senate was not in session Saturday after voting for final passage of House Bill 5002, the session’s major housing legislation, at 2:13 a.m. The House came in at noon and worked into the evening, debating SB 1. Both chambers will be in session Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.
Ritter, Rojas and Senate Majority Leader Bob Duff, D-Norwalk, proclaimed themselves satisfied with the annual session, even if scores of bills will die from inaction, as occurs every year.
“We’re in a really good place,” Ritter said.
“We’ve been working really well together so far. So I think that there’s a good opportunity to get a lot more done still,” Duff said.
Duff said the Senate hopes to deliver final passage of a climate bill that is a House priority. The legislation, House Bill 5004, would strengthen the state’s existing carbon-reduction goals and create a new “Clean Economy Council” to develop strategies and policies to help meet those targets.
Rojas said the House intends to vote on Senate Bill 10, a bill that strengthens the state’s rules to ensure insurers comply with mental-health parity coverage requirements. 
Some bills that languish on the final few days might find a path to passage by being folded into a budget bill, but Duff noted that requires agreement of the House, Senate and governor’s office.
He declined to speculate on which favored few might get such treatment.
Seventy-three House bills await final passage in the Senate. Ninety-three Senate bills were on the House calendar Saturday when debate began on SB 1. A small minority are guaranteed votes.
As for the rest?
Ritter smiled Saturday and alluded to the fact it’s the time of year when pretty much anyone can kill a bill simply by talking. If a lawmaker made enemies during the session, they will find out if one of their bills are called.
“Look, Tuesday and Wednesday, we’ll find out how you treated your colleagues, right?” Ritter said. “It’s the ultimate sign of how people feel about you.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2025_0530_SR_Session_128-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-01 05:01:18.109461

It's time for economic justice—now.","By Fay Lenz, President, The Arc CT
May 23rd marked IDD Awareness and Advocacy Day in Connecticut, established in 2023 through the leadership of the IDD Caucus to raise awareness and advocate for individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities. We joined a strong, bipartisan group of legislators at the Capitol to commemorate the day and urge legislative action, because Connecticut’s nonprofit providers are in crisis. Now, just a week later, the situation has come to a head, and we need to act now.
Organizations and the Direct Service Providers that care for and support individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) are being asked to do more with less—year after year. Despite small increases, nonprofit providers operate with 30% less buying power than in 2007 due to chronic underfunding and inflation. This financial instability is not an abstract budget issue—it’s a direct threat to the services thousands of individuals with disabilities and their families depend on every day.

This year, nonprofit providers are requesting a $264 million increase for the current fiscal year and $237 million the following year to restore funding, replace federal COVID-era funds, and raise Medicaid rates. This investment is not just overdue—it is essential.
Meanwhile, the gap between what the state pays its employees and what it provides to community-based nonprofits has grown unacceptably wide. According to one recent report, Connecticut state employee pay reached a record $5.4 billion in 2023. Some employees at the Department of Developmental Services (DDS)—the agency charged with overseeing services for individuals with IDD—earned more than $100,000 in overtime alone.

Consider this example: a single DDS staffer has a base salary of $61,000—already significantly higher than their counterpart at a nonprofit provider. However, when factoring in overtime exceeding $177,000, plus benefits and state retirement (SERS) contributions surpassing $134,000, this employee costs Connecticut taxpayers more than $400,000 per year. And this is just one instance—there are many similar examples. As the Governor works hard to reduce the state’s pension debt, the implications of these inflated salaries on Connecticut’s pension liability are staggering.
DSPs support people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD), enabling them to lead dignified, inclusive lives in our communities. They perform tasks that range from physical care to emotional support. It’s challenging and deeply rewarding work. Yet, despite its necessity, Connecticut DSPs remain profoundly undercompensated, earning on average just $19.65 per hour, significantly below the state’s calculated living wage of $24.13 for a single adult. DSPs are the backbone of the care system, yet we pay them poverty-level wages.
Let’s be clear: this is an economic justice issue. The majority of DSPs are women of color or minorities, many are raising families while earning wages that qualify them for public assistance. These frontline workers are among the most underpaid professionals in the state, despite performing physically and emotionally demanding work that requires deep commitment and compassion.
Connecticut cannot continue to ignore this injustice. If we value the lives of individuals with disabilities—and if we truly respect the people who support them—we must do better and address this funding disparity now.
I urge state leaders to shift priorities and fully fund nonprofit providers, using some of the “second largest surplus in state history” in a way that will have a meaningful impact. Raise wages for direct service professionals to a livable standard. Stop relying on low-wage, disproportionately minority workers to subsidize a system that cannot function without them.

Every person with a disability deserves consistent, compassionate support that will keep them safe. 
Every worker who provides that care deserves respect, a livable wage, and economic dignity. Connecticut must do better—and it must address this injustice now. I urge you, the citizens of Connecticut, to take immediate action. Contact your legislators and the Governor today and advocate for fair, living wages for our DSP workforce and full funding for our non-profit providers.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-06-01 08:59:00+00:00,CT Mirror,A delicate dance: Maneuvering around CT’s budget cap,Keith M. Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/01/ct-budget-spending-cap/,CT's options to adhere strictly to the spending cap are limited by dysfunctions that have plagued the mechanism through its 34-year history.,"As legislators and Gov. Ned Lamont scrambled last week to craft a new budget before Wednesday’s deadline, they groped for the latest in a string of maneuvers around a spending cap already strained to its limit.
A plan that already would underfund guaranteed worker benefits and shifts hundreds of millions off-budget to support child care and municipal aid would also abruptly boost, and then shrink, payments into the teachers’ pension fund — all to circumvent a fiscal guardrail Lamont assured business leaders was “sacrosanct” just four months ago.
But options to adhere strictly to the cap are severely limited by dysfunctions that have plagued this budget mechanism throughout its 34-year history. Without the extra spending those gimmicks permit, officials say, the legislature wouldn’t be poised to adopt a new budget before the 2025 session ends on Wednesday.
Put simply, a handful of big programs usually gobble much of the allowable spending growth and leave scraps for everything else. Over time, that creates big problems.
Lamont and legislators have avoided this since 2021, thanks mainly to $2.8 billion in emergency federal pandemic grants they’ve been able to spend outside of the formal budget. In other words, when the cap won’t allow more spending on any item, it could be bolstered with federal aid without breaking the rules.
But those pandemic funds largely have been exhausted, and dealing with the spending cap has never been more challenging.
Lamont: ‘A lot of people are gnashing their teeth’
“Let’s face it, I think a lot of people are gnashing their teeth under the [fiscal] guardrails,” Lamont said at a press conference Wednesday afternoon, explaining why he and Democratic lawmakers were grappling with yet another cap-centered impasse in budget negotiations. 
At first glance, the limit is relatively simple. Legislators may budget what they did the prior year, plus some growth that reflects average household income or inflation, whichever is greater. 
About one-quarter of the budget — payments on bonded debt and some pension contributions — aren’t subject to cap limits. Prior to 2017, neither was aid to poor cities and towns.
Legislative leaders told the governor last week they wanted to spend roughly $200 million beyond what the cap would allow in the 2026-27 fiscal year, the second of the new biennial budget. 
The solution they convinced Lamont to accept was unconventional but not illegal.
They agreed to make a one-time, $200 million payment — on top of the required $1.7 billion — into the teachers’ pension fund in 2025-26, which will be the last year of a temporary cap exemption for these contributions.

Rules call for the spending cap limit to grow two years from now to accommodate the teachers’ pension line item when it comes back under this system. But Democrats say the cap limit should grow by an extra $200 million in 2026-27, even though the bonus payment won’t be repeated that year.
That then would leave $200 million legislators could spend on something else without exceeding the cap.
Lamont’s budget director, Jeffrey Beckham, has been urging lawmakers throughout the 2025 legislative session to remember the system is about affordability and sustainable budgeting.
“We are responsible to taxpayers; therefore, spending must be sustainable and not grow faster than our residents’ ability to pay,” Beckham said in late April after the Appropriations Committee proposed to exceed the cap next fiscal year by $215 million.
Spending cap has plagued governors, legislatures for decades
But the budget is complex, and a few programs can hijack much of the spending growth allowed each year.
While the capped portion of the budget grew just 7% between 2015 and 2019, required contributions to pensions for state employees and teachers combined increased 36%. And that included a deal with unions to defer portions of contributions owed this decade into the 2030s and 2040s.
The state faces a similar problem now with Medicaid.
Since 2021, the capped portion of the budget has grown 30%, sparked by a 40-year high in inflation in the summer of 2022.
But after Lamont agreed two weeks ago to allow a $284 million cap exception in the current fiscal year — chiefly to cover cost overruns in the Department of Social Services’ Medicaid account — spending growth in that program was up 46% since 2021.
Legislators foresaw these potential problems 34 years ago when they created the cap and included an emergency process to overrule the spending growth formula. The governor first must declare a fiscal emergency in writing, and 60% of both the House and Senate must approve.
But from the late 1990s through 2007, Republican Govs. John G. Rowland and M. Jodi Rell teamed up with Democratic-controlled legislatures to legally exceed the cap seven times.
Future governors and legislators would criticize this as fiscally irresponsible. Any exception became politically taboo after Democratic Gov. Dannel P. Malloy, who succeeded Rell in 2011, inherited a budget deficit topping 18% and approved a tax hike estimated at more than $1.8 billion a year. 
Has CT over-corrected for past fiscal mistakes?
Still, many of Lamont’s fellow Democrats in the legislature say Connecticut has over-corrected for its past mistakes and now is allowing the cap to starve vital services.
Medicaid payments to doctors and others who treat the poor haven’t been adjusted broadly since 2007, leaving many low-income families unable to find treatment.
Nonprofit agencies that serve clients with developmental disabilities miss out on hundreds of millions of dollars annually because state payments haven’t matched inflation for decades. Cities and towns say the same is true of state aid for K-12 schools.
Meanwhile, the spending cap — coupled with other aggressive budget controls enacted by both parties in 2017 — has generated unprecedented annual surpluses averaging $1.8 billion, which equals about 8% of the General Fund.
That’s deceptively large, considering about three-quarters of the budget involves wages, benefits, Medicaid, debt service and other fixed costs.
This year’s projected surplus approaches $2.4 billion, or 10% of the General Fund. Analysts estimate the state will continue to save more than $1 billion annually through at least 2028.
These surpluses, used mainly to shrink Connecticut’s hefty pension debt, have become a source of frustration for many Democratic legislators and other advocates who insist core programs are slipping badly.
“I think members are looking to make a significant investment in our state this year, and we’re tired of hearing the governor say there’s not enough money when we know there is,” said Rep. Jillian Gilchrest, a progressive Democrat from West Hartford.
Co-chairwoman of the Human Services Committee, Gilchrest spearheaded a push to invest $250 million across four years in Medicaid rates. Nonetheless, the budget to be adopted this week is expected to order a much smaller investment. Advocates seeking big funds for nonprofit social service agencies also are bracing for little new money.
House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, called the lack of investments in health care and social services two of his biggest disappointments.
“We do agree with the governor, the state’s in a better position financially” because of the spending cap, he said. “But we probably have gone a little too far.”

Labor groups descended on the Capitol en masse Saturday to protest insufficient spending on core programs and demand immediate reform of spending caps.
“If Gov. Lamont truly wanted transparency, he would declare a fiscal emergency and suspend the roadblocks,” said Norma Martinez HoSang, director of CT For All, a coalition of more than 60 labor, faith and civic organizations.
Connecticut has pledged in legal covenants with bond holders not to alter any of its budget caps dramatically before July 1, 2028, when many expect a landmark reform debate.
Lamont struggled to keep his own budget proposal under the cap
In the meantime, legislative leaders are trying to bend the limits without breaking them.
They’re not the only ones.
To keep the $55.2 billion two-year budget he proposed in February under the cap, the governor employed several workarounds. 
First, he would underfund contractually required health care benefits for retired state workers by about $114 million per year. Comptroller Sean Scanlon says he hopes to mitigate that gap by negotiating savings with insurance providers, but any remaining deficit would be taken from the retiree health care trust — meaning the cost, plus interest, would be covered by future taxpayers.
Lamont also proposed borrowing rather than paying cash for a $60 million grant program that helps towns cover road paving and winter snow plowing. Borrowing occurs outside of the formal budget and spending cap.
Finally, he would shift $300 million from surplus into an off-budget account to fund future increases in early childhood development programs.
Given these maneuvers and the latest cap workaround involving the teachers’ pension, House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, said Lamont and Democratic legislators clearly are bending the rules.
“It’s a gimmick to pay something off budget in the first year, bring it on budget in the second year, to escalate the spending cap,” he said.

Candelora added he suspects the entire budget “is going to be cobbled together with gimmicks that do [an] end-around the spending cap.”
Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield, predicted fiscal chaos when Lamont first agreed to legally exceed the spending cap two weeks ago. “Get your pocketbooks, your wallets ready,” he said. “You’re going to give over more of your money [to] the state of Connecticut.”
Lamont spokesman: ‘The spending cap remains sacrosanct.’
Chris DiPentima, president and CEO of the Connecticut Business and Industry Association, heard Lamont’s declaration that the spending cap is “sacrosanct” back on Jan. 15.
The business leader said from the moment the governor proposed his biennial budget on Feb. 5, complete with some cap gimmicks, he feared legislators would embrace them and offer more.
“That’s got us very alarmed, that we’re just ignoring the spending cap when all is said and done and not making hard decisions” to cut spending, DiPentima said.
But Lamont’s political options are limited.
Democrats threatened last week to suspend the 34-year-old requirement that Connecticut adopt a two-year budget — designed to encourage long-range fiscal planning — unless they could find more options to work around the spending cap in 2026-27.
The alternative, Ritter said, was to adopt a plan covering just 12 months through June 2026.
That would be problematic, to say the least, for Lamont, should he seek reelection next year.
Under that scenario, Lamont would have no approved spending plan in place should he fail to strike a budget deal with legislators next spring. And he would be faced with the chaotic prospect of managing underfunded departments by executive order, even as his reelection campaign entered the home stretch.
But despite some of the compromises the governor made this year to secure another two-year budget, spokesman Chris Collibee said “the spending cap remains ‘sacrosanct,’” and while legislators won’t see all the funding they wanted, there are new investments and fiscal stability.
“Our ‘kitchen table’ approach to budgeting over the past six years is the reason why Gov. Lamont was able to provide some flexibility in spending to cover essential services,” he said. “While other states are reducing services and/or increasing taxes, here in Connecticut have not only gotten our fiscal house in order but are doing the opposite.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2025_0531_SR_Session_194-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-01 05:01:18.109461

(Max McCoy/Kansas Reflector)Bad weather doesn’t keep business hours.
Of the top 10 tornadoes that have wreaked death and destruction in Kansas, most came near or after dark, according to the National Weather Service. The Udall tornado of 1955 struck at 10:15 pm and killed 80, making it the deadliest twister in state history.
That’s why the National Weather Service’s closing of the Goodland forecast office overnight is so alarming. Goodland is among eight locations that had reduced their hours, or were planning to, because of the Trump administration’s cuts to the federal government. Staffing at the NWS has taken a beating under DOGE, according to reporting by the Washington Post. In an open letter, five former NWS directors warned the cuts may “endanger lives.”
The Goodland office serves northwest Kansas and parts of Nebraska and Colorado. About 17 miles from the Colorado border on I-70, severe weather around Goodland ranges from tornado-producing spring storms to winter blizzards that shut down the interstate.
But it’s not just the Goodland County Warning Area, a 21,000-square-mile region with more than 80,000 people, that’s at risk. Understaffing at Goodland and other forecast offices that have curtailed hours, including Wyoming and California, creates an additional burden for meteorologists at fully staffed locations. Somebody has to keep an eye on the weather, because the NWS is the federal agency responsible for issuing advisories, watches, and warnings.
If you live in Tornado Alley, you know how essential those warnings can be. The alley is a broad swatch of the Great Plains, from Texas to South Dakota, where dry cold air from the northwest collides with warm moist air from the south. Kansans are familiar with the feeling along about dusk when conditions are ripe for a twister. The sky turns a peculiar shade of green, a thunderstorm approaches and the air smells like river water.
A public affairs specialist for the NWS at Silver Springs, Maryland, did not respond to a request for comment by deadline. Specifically, the spokesperson was asked if the Goodland office would remain closed overnight, and whether that represented a threat to public safety.
While the NWS did not respond, a spokesman for the union that represents federal weather service workers said there was no immediate crisis. Meteorologists at other regional forecast offices had agreed to keep an eye on the weather while the Goodland office was closed overnight. But, he said, a 20% reduction in forecast office staffing since Trump took his second oath of office poses a long-term threat.
“There is no question that the public safety for the community is at risk,” said Tom Fahy, legislative director of the National Weather Service Employees Organization. “(The workers) have done everything they can to shore up the holes and come up with a work flow schedule that will allow individuals not to be burned out.”
Weather service employees are dedicated, hard-working individuals, he said, who take their mission to protect lives and property seriously.
The Goodland is among the two worst hit of the 122 forecast offices in the nation, Fahy said. Goodland normally has 13 meteorologists, but because of DOGE cuts and a federal hiring freeze imposed in January, is down to just five. It ties with a forecast station in Hanford, California, as the most understaffed.
While we are at the tail end of what is usually thought of as tornado season, May through early June, the NOAA National Severe Storms Laboratory at Norman, Oklahoma, cautions that twisters are unpredictable. They can come at any time of the year, at any time of the day, and meteorologists still aren’t sure what causes them.
“The truth is that we don’t fully understand,” according to the Severe Storms Laboratory website. “The most destructive tornadoes occur from supercells, which are rotating thunderstorms with a well-defined radar circulation called a mesocyclone. (Supercells can also produce damaging hail, severe non-tornadic winds, frequent lightning, and flash floods.)”
While I’ve seen scores of small twisters form, touch down, and spin themselves away within a few minutes, I’ve never spotted a really large tornado. These storms are measured by the Enhanced Fujita Scale, from 0 to 5, based on estimates of observed damage. A common EF0 has wind gusts up to 85 mph and produces little damage. A rare EF5 has wind speeds of more than 200 mph and produces “incredible” damage. The tornado that struck Udall in 1955 was an EF5. So was the Greensburg twister of 2007 and the Joplin, Missouri, tornado of May 2011, a storm that killed 158 people and demolished a third of the town.
I witnessed the aftermaths of the Greensburg and Joplin tornadoes in my capacity as a journalist, and the devastation of each was nightmare-like. In Greensburg, houses were turned to kindling and schools were reduced to piles of bricks. Trees were snapped off at about 10 or 12 feet, as if somebody had driven a giant lawnmower across town.
At Joplin, there was similar destruction, and the neighborhood where my grandfather’s house had stood was unrecognizable. The area looked like it had been shredded by a buzzsaw and then flattened. The human suffering across town was on a massive scale that night, with bodies in the streets and survivors sitting on curbs wearing trash bags as their only defense against the rain. I’ve never taken a roof over my head for granted since.
The Greensburg tornado was a two-mile wide EF5 that blew up from the southwest. The National Weather Service issued a warning for Greensburg at 9:19 p.m. The storm hit Greensburg dead-center at 9:45, destroying approximately 1,000 homes and businesses, or about nine-tenths of the town. The response by the Federal Emergency Management Agency required 15 federal entities, including the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Environmental Protection Agency.
Now, cuts to the weather service by DOGE in the name of governmental “efficiency” threaten to cripple the weather alert warning systems that saved untold lives in Greensburg. There was no such warning system in 1955 for Udall, and that’s one of the reasons that casualties were so high. To decrease the number of staff available for weather forecast offices in the name of efficiency is like reducing the number of life preservers on an ocean liner to save space.
But the explanation that DOGE is out to improve government by making it smaller and more effective is a canard. The real reason the NWS and other federal agencies are being kneecapped is to punish federal workers, dismantle the machinery of government, and achieve a long-cherished dream of neoliberalism, an economic philosophy from 1938. Don’t let the name fool you, because there’s nothing liberal or progressive about it.
Never heard of it?
Allow me a few paragraphs to explain.
“Its anonymity is both a symptom and a cause of its power,” write George Monbiot and Peter Hutchison in their 2024 book on neoliberalism. “It has caused or contributed to most of the crises that now confront us: rising inequality; rampant child poverty; epidemic diseases of despair; off-shoring and the erosion of the tax base; the slow degradation of healthcare, education, and other public services; the crumbling of the infrastructure; democratic backsliding; the 2008 financial crash; the rise of modern-day demagogues, such as Viktor Orban, Narendra Modi, Donald Trump, Boris Johnson, and Jair Bolsonaro; our ecological crises and environmental disasters.”
Neoliberalism, according to Monbiot and Hutchison, is an ideology whose central belief is that competition is humanity’s defining feature, but that our greed and selfishness and the free market will lead to social advances. The term “neoliberal” was coined at a conference in Paris in 1938, but it’s been around since at least 1776, when Adam Smith used the metaphor of the “invisible hand” in his “Wealth of Nations.”
Put another way, think of Gordon Gekko in Oliver Stone’s 1987 movie “Wall Street.” In the movie, Gekko — played by Michael Douglas — says greed is “good.” Gekko’s soliloquy of nearly 40 years ago sounds disturbingly modern.
“America has become a second-rate power,” Gekko says. “Its trade deficit and its fiscal deficit are at nightmare proportions. Now in the days of the free market when our country was a top industrial power, there was accountability to the stockholder. … The point is, ladies and gentleman, is that greed, for lack of a better word, is good.”
Greed, according to Gekko, will save that “malfunctioning corporation” called the USA.
What does this have to do with the National Weather Service?
Everything.
The DOGE cuts aren’t meant merely to make the federal government smaller, but also to make certain sectors of it ripe for privatization. The transfer of public sector assets to private companies is a long-held neoliberal tenet. And the privatization of the National Weather Service is an unambiguously stated goal of Project 2025, the right-wing playbook for the second Trump administration.
Juan Declet-Barreto, a senior social scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists, argued in a March essay that privatizing the weather service would result in the greatest harm to those who are the least able to pay for critical warning information.
“Public services exist to provide parity in access to all people in society without regard to their ability to individually fork out money for such a service,” Declet-Barreto wrote, “so those unable to pay will end up paying twice: once with their tax dollars, and once with their wellbeing or with their lives. Paywalled weather alerts will deprive individuals, households, or towns with lower income of access to life-saving services.”
Fahy, the weather service union legislative director, told me he doubts the weather service will be privatized, because so many commercial firms already get its data for a few dollars a month.
But I’m not so sure, because the “commercialization of weather technologies” is so clearly spelled out in Project 2025. It’s all on page 675, in which the NWS is identified as part of a “colossal operation that has become one of the main drivers of the climate change alarm industry and, as such, is harmful to future U.S. prosperity.”
Know what else is harmful to prosperity? Tornadoes that eat your town.
Here in Kansas, we typically associate weather alerts with tornadoes, flooding, blizzards, and temperature extremes. But every location across the country has its own hazards, from wildfires to volcanic ash to hurricanes.
But weather alerts aren’t the only things under threat by DOGE cuts. Of the 15 federal agencies responding to Greensburg in 2007, many are now targeted for downsizing. This may lead to little warning of severe weather and reduced help after. We’re already seeing the latter, as Trump’s FEMA has denied disaster relief requests from states hit by tornadoes and hurricanes.
Michael Lewis devoted a chapter to the Joplin tornado in his 2018 book, “The Fifth Risk.” The death toll in Joplin was the highest since the government had started issuing tornado warnings, in 1948. But it wasn’t the failure of the National Weather Service that had killed 158 in Joplin, Lewis concluded, because the sirens blared 17 minutes before the storm hit. Instead, it was the inability of citizens to understand their government — and the inability of the government to understand its citizens. Not enough Joplin residents had sought shelter when warned because they had the “false confidence” they would not be hit. Even a congressman misunderstood that weather channels and phone apps come from data provided by the NWS.
For complicated reasons, human beings have a difficult time imagining the things that might actually kill them. Lewis said that’s one of the reasons, after the Joplin tornado, that the weather service began encouraging news outlets to help people imagine what might happen if they didn’t take cover: “Complete destruction of entire neighborhoods … making the area unrecognizable to survivors.”
Comparable warnings are appropriate for the era of Trump and DOGE.
We were told, but we just couldn’t imagine how bad it would be. Surely our weather forecast center, our university, our Medicaid won’t be hit. Now we have some of the damage assessments, and it amounts to an EF5 political disaster.
The crippling of the NWS forecast office at Goodland is a symptom of a hostile takeover of the federal government by a quasi-governmental group, DOGE, that until recently was headed Elon Musk, the president’s biggest donor. DOGE’s actions have made little sense, unless you think cruelty makes sense, or unless you realize they resemble the way in which a corporate raider will strip assets from a company and then sell off the carcass.

No one is trying to collect it.,"“This is the number one form of tax evasion in Connecticut.  Connecticut is losing millions annually and our DMV does not care.”
So says Stonington Tax Assessor Jennifer Lineaweaver, president of the state association for her profession, the Connecticut Association of Assessing Officers.  She’s speaking of Connecticut residents who register their cars in other states to avoid local property taxes.  “Connecticut is also losing money on registrations, emissions, insurance and unpaid parking tickets that cannot be enforced,” she says.


It’s super easy to get Maine plates for your vehicles… without even traveling to the state or having an address there.  You can even register in Montana, a scheme especially popular with expensive motor home owners.
A couple of years ago Vermont admitted there were 3,600 cars registered in that state by Connecticut residents.  In Maine there were 1,400.  In Bridgeport, City Councilman Alfredo Castillo was even caught with five cars registered next door in Shelton, where taxes were lower, trying to save himself $1,300 in property tax.  
“I am absolutely certain that those [out-of-state] numbers are extremely low,” says Assessor Lineaweaver.  So the losses are even worse than you might think.
The problem is there’s almost no enforcement of Connecticut laws.
“Connecticut DMV says that ‘taxation’ is not their issue,” she says.  “A few years ago, we had the law changed so that DMV would have to look up any out-of-state plate that the assessor requests and DMV had the law reversed a year later.  During the one year [the law] was in place, DMV refused to comply with the law and said they would have the law repealed the next year, which they did.”
Not getting much help from the Division of Motor Vehicles, some cities have hired private firms to help. In 2022, Danbury contracted Capital Tax Recovery to scan license plates throughout the city.  Over 8,000 vehicles were under investigation. The firm pocketed 40% of the additional tax revenue collected as their fee, with no upfront cost to the city.  In Waterbury they caught 4,000 cars. In Stamford almost 8,000 cars were caught, bringing that city $1.3 million.
Many towns allow anonymous reporting of scofflaws.  If your neighbor has Montana plates you can also wish them good luck getting a town dump sticker or beach pass requiring proof of local residence.
Connecticut DMV Commissioner Tony Guerrera tells me the problem with out-of-state plates is that drivers often claim legal residence in another state, like Florida.  “If they live there six months and a day, they’re considered legal residents [of Florida],” he told me. 
But Connecticut law mandates that vehicles “garaged” in a municipality —meaning regularly parked overnight, even on the street— must be taxed there, regardless of where they may be officially registered.  Spend your winter in the Sunshine State, but more than 90 days each summer in Connecticut, and you have to pay, even with those Florida plates. The penalty is a $1,000 fine.
In Connecticut, the vehicle property tax is a significant source of revenue for municipalities: $1 billion a year.  But why does a car in New Britain pay four times the tax than the same vehicle in Greenwich?  These inequities just encourage tax avoidance which is, apparently, rampant and unchecked.
“We don’t have the staff [to enforce this],” the DMV Commissioner laments. His agency has its own sworn, gun-carrying police force, but Guerrera says they only work on truck inspections…. even though “registration compliance” is, according to law, one of their duties.
How is our legislature handling this problem?  With a “task force” which met seven times in 2023 considering reforms.  But it never reached a consensus and never approved their final report.  In any case, their draft recommendations were given a thumbs-down by Connecticut Department of Revenue Services Commissioner and former mayor of Danbury Mark Boughton. 
So, what’s a car owner to do?  Well, I hear that Montana is a nice place to visit in the summer.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/florida-plate.jpg,,,2025-06-01 05:01:18.109461

SPRINGFIELD — Nearly every year, Illinois lawmakers pass a package of measures dealing with the state’s Medicaid program, the joint federal and state health care program that covers low-income individuals.

Known as the Medicaid omnibus bill, it sometimes includes bold components, like a 2021 initiative that made millions of dollars available to local communities to help them plan and design their own health care delivery systems. Other packages have focused on smaller changes like guaranteeing coverage for specific conditions and medications or adjusting reimbursement rates for different categories of health care providers.

And moThe Illinois General Assembly passed a scaled-back Medicaid package on the last day of the session Saturday.st years, the packages receive bipartisan support because they are negotiated, largely behind closed doors, by an unofficial, bipartisan Medicaid Working Group.

This year, however, lawmakers passed one of the narrowest packages in recent memory, due mainly to the Trump administration’s vows to make sweeping cuts in federal funding for the program while state lawmakers faced their own set of budget constraints.

“There were many, many, very worthy program expansions, rate increases that we considered during this process that we were unable to include because of the uncertainty in Washington,” Rep. Anna Moeller, D-Elgin, the current chair of the Medicaid Working Group, said on the House floor Saturday.

The Illinois Medicaid program currently costs about $33.7 billion a year, according to the Department of Healthcare and Family Services. Of that, $20.9 billion, or about 62%, comes from the federal government while much of the state’s share comes from taxes levied on hospitals, nursing homes and managed care organizations – money the state uses to draw down federal matching funds.

The program covers nearly 3.5 million people in Illinois, or about a quarter of the state’s population. According to the nonpartisan health policy think tank KFF, the program pays for 40% of all child births in Illinois while covering 69% of all nursing home residents.

This year’s Medicaid omnibus bill, a 231-page amendment inserted into Senate Bill 2437, contains items that could be hugely beneficial to many Medicaid enrollees, but which don’t carry large price tags. In fact, the entire package is estimated to cost just under $1 million.

One of this year’s additions would make it easier for family members of medically fragile children who qualify for in-home nursing care to receive training to become certified family health aides, a designation that would enable them to administer medications, help with feeding and perform many of the same tasks as a certified nursing assistant.

Another provision would require all hospitals with licensed obstetric beds and birthing centers to adopt written policies that permit patients to have an Illinois Medicaid certified doula of their choosing to accompany them and provide support before, during and after labor and delivery.

Although those provisions enjoyed bipartisan support, another provision that extends coverage to certain categories of noncitizens drew Republican opposition Saturday, resulting in a partisan roll  call vote.

The program covers noncitizens who meet the income requirements for Medicaid and have pending applications for asylum in the United States or for special visas as victims of trafficking, torture or other serious crimes. Those individuals can receive coverage for up to 24 months, provided they continue to meet the eligibility requirements.

Moeller said the language was not a new extension of health care benefits to noncitizens, but instead a “technical and administrative fix” to an existing program that had been requested by the Department of Healthcare and Family Services.

But for Republicans, the programs sounded too similar to the more controversial programs, Health Benefits for Immigrant Seniors and Health Benefits for Immigrant Adults, that extend health care to a large category of people who are not U.S. citizens, including some who are in the country illegally.

“For us on this side of the aisle, that is the poison pill,” said Rep. Noreen Hammond, R-Macomb, the deputy House minority leader. “So in spite of the fact that we have article after article in here, that is very worthy of a yes vote, I would urge a no vote.”

At Gov. JB Pritzker’s request, the budget bill lawmakers passed Saturday night cancels the program for immigrant adults, which had covered about 31,000 noncitizens age 42-64. But it provides $110 million over the next year, all in state funds, for the immigrant seniors program, which covers about 8,900 noncitizens age 65 and over.

The Medicaid bill passed the House late Saturday night, 76-39. It then passed the Senate shortly after midnight, 36-19.

It next goes to Pritzker’s desk for his consideration.

The state’s largest electric utility says it needs to significantly increase its energy capacity to accommodate a potential wave of data centers.
Georgia Power plans to turn to some renewable energy to generate that electricity, but for the most part, the utility intends to lean on fossil fuel sources like gas-fired power plants to boost capacity.
Those controversial plans, packed into what’s called an integrated resource plan, received a public airing during three days of public hearings. Several clean energy advocacy groups and state regulator staffers urged members of the Georgia Public Service Commission to reject the plan.
Commissioners are set to vote on the proposal in July.
Data centers fuel growth forecasts
Georgia Power projects that over the next several years the growth of data centers will significantly increase the state’s electricity consumption, and the company is requesting to add about 9,000 megawatts of capacity by 2031. According to the utility’s forecasts, data centers will consume about 80% of the new power generated.
But some have questioned the accuracy of those projections.
PSC staff expert witnesses said this week they are concerned Georgia Power is using incorrect model forecasts. They also say the utility has not provided evidence showing that data centers are likely to materialize at a higher rate than other industries.
Georgia Power attorneys say the company’s forecast continues to grow based on the state’s economic projections for commercial and industrial customers.
PSC staff questioned the models used by the company that led to forecasting as much as 13,000 megawatts of peak load growth through 2044. The staff is recommending Georgia Power decrease its load growth projections for data centers by as much as 25%.
“Our recommendation is to adjust down Georgia Power’s load forecast,” said Robert Trokey, director of the Public Service Commission’s electric unit. “I think it’s important that they continue to file the data that they have been filing in quarterly reports. If we see trends continue over the short term as the projects roll out, then certainly Georgia Power should adjust its forecast methodologies.”
Advocacy groups have argued that overbuilding the infrastructure could shift the cost burden to ratepayers.
Public Service Commissioner Tricia Pridemore pushed back on the criticism, pointing to a recent rule change that requires data centers and other large companies consuming more than 100 megawatts of energy to cover their full electricity costs.
The change included a provision allowing Georgia Power to require companies to put up front-end collateral for energy costs over the lifetime of the contract. State regulators would also review any contract for high-energy users.
Clean energy versus fossil fuels
Georgia Power has come under fire for reversing plans to shutter a pair of coal plants, Bowen and Scherer. The company instead is asking that state regulators sign off on extending the life of the two plants and allow the company to ramp up its fossil fuel energy capacity.
The utility had planned to retire Bowen and Scherer by 2028. Since then, Georgia Power has cited the projected industrial growth boom primarily driven by massive data centers as a reason it is now planning to retire Bowen by 2035 and Scherer Unit 3 by 2038.
Energy experts and clean energy advocates expressed concerns about the company’s potential overestimation of electricity demand and the underestimation of gas-fired unit costs, which could lead to higher rates.
They recommended increasing planning flexibility, updating load forecasts, and exploring earlier deployment of renewables and energy storage. Their analysis compared different scenarios, showing that renewables and energy storage are more economical under various future conditions.
Critics of the plan advised the commission to require Georgia Power to present additional research portfolios and improve forecast accuracy. The company was also urged to further increase its investments in renewable energies like solar.

Energy consultant Maria Roumpani, who testified on behalf of the Georgia Conservation Voters, said that renewable energy and storage are much more economically viable than the expansion of gas-fired power plants.
“The analysis should focus on enabling earlier years of deployment for wind and energy storage, especially medium and low duration, as well as higher limits for solar,” she said.
Public, protestors weigh in
Clean energy and consumer advocates held a rally outside the PSC’s downtown offices while the hearing was underway Tuesday, warning of the potential consequences if the commission rubber-stamps Georgia Power’s long-term energy plans.
The five-member utility regulator is set to vote July 15.
Hundreds of written comments poured into the PSC, many of them dominated by concerns about rising utility bills and health risks tied to fossil fuels.
However, the three days of hearings began with public comments expressing split reactions to Georgia Power and its energy plans.
The long-term energy generation plan is receiving support from the Georgia Chamber of Commerce and local chamber officials such as Timothy Craig, director of business development of Valdosta-Lowndes County Chamber of Commerce.

Craig told commissioners that he felt the company’s energy plan provides the necessary infrastructure to continue providing reliable electricity to businesses.
“One of the first questions small business owners want to ask is: can I count on the systems that support my business?” Craig said this week. “Energy is at the top of that list. Whether it’s a local bakery or high tech firm, reliable energy is essential. Georgia Power’s plan delivers that reliability.”
Retired educator Bette Holland, founder of North Georgia Conservation Coalition, said it’s important that state regulators accept the science that shows that burning coal, oil and natural gas detrimentally increases the earth’s temperature.
“Solar and wind are much cheaper than fossil fuels to create energy,” Holland said. “The only thing that stops us are the energy companies and regulators who bow to the pressure of the fossil fuel companies. Please begin to think about the survival of the people in Georgia, in this country, on this planet, and about the survival of our natural resources in our wildlife.”

SPRINGFIELD – Giving almost no time for public review, Illinois Democrats pushed through a $55.2 billion budget for next fiscal year late Saturday, bolstering coffers with new taxes on sports bets, nicotine products and businesses.

The $55.2 billion spending plan is supported by $55.3 billion of revenue, including just over $1 billion in new taxes and revenue changes.

The four bills making up the budget and capital spending plan, were part of a flurry of thousands of pages of legislation that went from introduction to passage in the final 48 hours of the legislative session.

The budget marked a roughly 3.9% spending increase from the current year, while Republicans criticized it for containing few cuts. It raises about $500 million more in new revenue than what Gov. JB Pritzker proposed in February to make up for declining base revenues.

The minority party also aired frustration with supermajority Democrats for providing next to no time for public review of the massive spending plan and other major bills.

“We’re rushing this process like we always do. ‘Let’s hide this stuff. Let’s hide it so that the public doesn’t see it until it’s too late,’” Rep. John Cabello, R-Machesney Park, said.

Democrats said it was the best budget they could manage in a difficult year. To address potential uncertainties stemming from federal policy changes, they gave the governor authority over a new $100 million “emergency” fund. And they frequently lobbed criticisms at President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress.

“I am very pleased to be able to present a balanced budget crafted to be fiscally and socially responsible, because we see the decisions made in Washington right now are neither,” House Majority Leader Robyn Gabel, D-Evanston said. “Erratic leadership in Washington has affected our economic outlook, our revenue projections, and even threatened federal funding for our most crucial services.”

The GOP also took issue with the tax increases, although the measure did not raise or create new sales, income or service taxes.

Instead, the measures expand state taxes on foreign and out-of-state income for businesses, raise tax rates on tobacco, vapes and sports gambling, and sweep fund balances from several lesser-known and utilized state funds.

The spending measure, Senate Bill 2510, passed the House 75-41 just before 10 p.m. The Senate followed around 11:30 p.m. with a 34-23 vote. The revenue and tax changes, House Bill 2755, and the budget implementation bill, House Bill 1075, both passed with relative ease before the constitution’s midnight deadline and only Democratic votes as well. Gov. JB Pritzker issued a statement saying he would sign it.

Another spate of tax increases included in a transit governance overhaul bill surfaced late but sputtered. The failed measure would have added a $1.50 fee on food and package deliveries and taxed electric vehicle charging statewide among other changes. Talks on that bill could resume later this year.

New taxes on vaping, gaming, deliveries 

The revenue bill creates a tax of 25 cents per wager for a sports betting licensee’s first 20,000 wagers accepted, and 50 cents per wager after that.

Consumers will also see new taxes on tobacco products. The tax rate will rise to 45% from 36%. Vape products and nicotine pouches would also now be included under the tax.

The revenue plan amends state law to tax sales from all businesses that transact in the state, rather than only businesses with a physical presence in Illinois. The plan also eliminates a “safe harbor” exemption for businesses that move money outside the state.

Businesses that move profits to other countries would also be subject to the state’s corporate income tax. The federal government currently taxes half of income moved offshore and Illinois would tax the other half under the revenue plan.

Businesses outside Illinois that sell $100,000 or more to people in the state must also collect Illinois sales taxes even if the business doesn’t have a physical location in Illinois. This would apply to businesses like Amazon.

“I will not support this betrayal of hard-working Illinoisians,” Sen. Don DeWitte, R-St. Charles, said. “And if you care about the people who sent you here, if you truly represent them, you’ll vote no too. Enough is enough. It’s time for this body to stand with taxpayers, not stand up against them.”

Another source of new revenue is a delinquent tax payment incentive program designed to help the state recuperate overdue tax payments. It will generate $228 million, Rep. Will Guzzardi, D-Chicago, said.



[caption id=""attachment_69376"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""1140""] State Rep. Will Guzzardi, D-Chicago[/caption]



The state would also pause the final transfer of motor fuel sales tax revenue to the road fund in order to free up $171 million, according to the governor’s office’s estimate.

A separate bill designed to lower prescription drug prices calls for levying a fee on pharmacy benefit managers based on the number of patients they insure. Money from that fee would go into a fund for the Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity to award up to $25 million a year in grants to independent pharmacies and pharmacies located in rural counties. The remaining money would go to the state's general revenue fund.

The measure also extends the state’s Hotel Operators’ Occupation Tax to short-term rentals like Airbnb and Vrbo.

Immigrant health cuts

A controversial program that provides health insurance to more than 30,000 noncitizens between ages 42 and 64 will be cut in FY26. The program’s elimination saves the state $330 million, but a $110 million program for seniors will remain in place.

Together, the two programs have cost the state at least $1.6 billion, according to an audit released in February, far exceeding budgeted costs for the program.

""We had to make some tough decisions here. That program grew at greater rates, financially, than we thought it would, and we had to make some hard decisions,” Gabel said.

Federally Qualified Health Centers are set to receive $40 million in the budget. The centers provide health services to low-income and uninsured people. Democrats touted that increase to provide care for immigrants who would have qualified for the health care program.

Illinois still risks losing some Medicaid funding under a proposal in Congress that threatens to slash reimbursements for states that provide health insurance to people illegally in the United States. But Gabel noted it’s possible those reductions won’t take place until 2027.

The budget also increases funding for safety-net hospitals with federal Medicaid funding cuts possible. 
Education spending

The state’s evidence-based funding model for K-12 schools calls for $350 million in additional funding each year, with a portion of that going to a property tax relief fund and the rest directly to schools. The proposed budget fully funds the K-12 education portion at $307 million but does not add $43 million in property tax relief funds, according to Democratic leaders.

Funding for the Illinois Community College Board would also decrease by $24 million, mostly because lawmakers reduced spending on a workforce development grant that Democrat leaders said was not being fully utilized.



[caption id=""attachment_69368"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""1140""] State Sen. Elgie Sims, D-Chicago, introduces the budget bill in a committee hearing on Saturday, May 31. (Capitol News Illinois photo by Jerry Nowicki)[/caption]



Funding for state universities  would only increase by 1%. Pritzker proposed a 3% increase for higher education even as most other areas of his budget would’ve increased by 1%. Senate Democrats’ budget leader Sen. Elgie Sims, D-Chicago, said the budget allows for an additional 2% increase in FY26 if the federal government eliminates substantial funding.

Pensions

Despite more than a year of discussions, Illinois lawmakers did not tackle pension reform this spring. Illinois' Tier 2 pension system is likely out of compliance with Social Security’s “safe harbor” law that requires pension benefits to be at least equal to Social Security.

Part of the budget package created a new Tier 2 reserve fund that can be accessed if there are violations of the “safe harbor” law. Lawmakers appropriated $75 million for the fund this year, in line with Pritzker’s proposal.

‘Emergency’ fund, raises, more

Notably not in this year’s budget is an increase to the “rainy day” fund. Pritzker has taken pride in the fund’s increases in recent years, as it’s grown to a balance of $2.3 billion, up from less than $60,000 when Pritzker took office. The FY26 budget would suspend the monthly transfer for one year, freeing up $45 million for general fund use.

The budget package also establishes a new $100 million fund that the governor can tap into “in the event of unanticipated delays in or failures of revenues.” The measure, an apparent nod to the uncertainty of federal funding amid ongoing congressional budget negotiations, will come from money swept from other funds.

“That will allow us to respond to actions by the federal government and challenges that present themselves and costs that have been diverted from the federal government to the state government,” Sims said in a committee hearing.

The attorney general’s office would get $116 million from the general fund. Attorney General Kwame Raoul asked lawmakers to boost funding for his office as he engages in a growing number of lawsuits against the Trump administration. Raoul was hoping to receive $120 million in funding.

Direct service providers are in line for an 80-cent per hour wage increase, but Republicans said calling it a funding increase is “sleight of hand,” because the measure would also reduce work hours for DSPs by the hundreds of thousands. That makes the increase negligible, Sen. Chapin Rose, R-Mahomet, said in committee.

“It’s not a great budget, but it is a good budget and it is the budget we need for this very difficult moment,” Rep. Lindsey LaPointe, D-Chicago, said.

Lawmakers will see their salaries rise as part of the budget, going to a $98,304 base salary from roughly $92,000. That’s an annualized rate of increase that is set by law.

“You raised our pay, you gave yourselves hundreds of millions of dollars of our taxpayers funds to spend on your pet projects,” Rep. Amy Elik, R-Godfrey, said. “So I simply don’t believe you anymore that you ever intended to be fiscally careful.”

No Bears stadium funding

Lawmakers did not appropriate funding for the Chicago Bears to build a new stadium. But NASCAR would be the recipient of a $5 million grant ahead of the sport’s third downtown Chicago race in July, and the PGA Tour would receive a $1 million grant as part of hosting the 2026 President’s Cup in DuPage County. Those were two economic development measures criticized by Republicans during the Senate committee hearing.

The budget also contains $200 million to prepare unused state properties to be repurposed for development, Sims said. Lawmakers removed another $300 million that Pritzker had sought in spending  aimed at offloading surplus property.

Gabel said the state’s employee management department has negotiated more than $100 million in health care cost savings as well.

Any remaining federal pandemic relief funding would also be sent to recipients that have not received payments in previous years before the funding expires in 2026.

But a larger, child tax credit for middle-class families will have to wait at least another year, according to the compromise reached Saturday between Gov. Ned Lamont and leaders of the legislature’s Democratic majority.
“I’m very pleased to have arrived at this compromise that will deliver tangible relief to some of the Connecticut families that are struggling most mightily,” Rep. Maria Horn, D-Salisbury, co-chairwoman of the Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee, said.
Connecticut has about 195,000 households that receive the state’s Earned Income Tax Credit, a program to help the working poor cover basic needs and increase savings. The state credit is worth 41.5% of the federal EITC’s value, meaning it adds an average of $1,061 to a qualifying household’s Connecticut income tax refund, according to nonpartisan analysts.
Couples with three or more children had to earn less than $66,819 last year to qualify for the EITC, according to the IRS. Other limits for couples were: $62,688 for those with two kids and $56,004 for those with one.
Single parents of three or more children had to earn less than $59,899 to qualify. Other limits for singles were: $55,768 for those with two kids and $49,084 for those with one.
Any EITC-eligible filers with children or other dependents would receive an additional $200 based on Saturday’s compromise. That amount would not vary regardless of the number of dependents claimed. Most EITC-eligible households have children, and while legislators didn’t release precise numbers Saturday, analysts estimate the new benefit would cost the state $26 million per year.
The administration’s budget spokesman, Chris Collibee, confirmed Saturday evening that “Governor Lamont supports this agreement that continues the progress to make Connecticut a more affordable place to live and work.”
The child tax credit was the last major issue blocking legislators and Lamont from compromising on a new state budget, which the House and Senate both are expected to adopt before the 2025 session closes Wednesday.

Connecticut is the only state with a broad-based income tax but no provision that recognizes the cost of raising children. Many Democrats favored a $600-per-child credit, with a maximum benefit of $1,800 per household, available to low and middle-income families. The relief package was projected to cost more than $300 million per year.
At first glance Connecticut easily could afford this. The state has closed the past seven fiscal years with an average surplus of $1.8 billion. Analysts project a $2.4 billion cushion for the current budget, which closes June 30, and expect the state to save at least $1 billion annually through 2028.
But state officials are wary of forfeiting revenue. Proposed federal Medicaid cuts are expected to cost Connecticut hundreds of millions of grant dollars annually, possibly as soon as next fiscal year.
Given those concerns, legislative leaders scaled back the proposed child tax credit to $150 per dependent, lowering the annual cost to about $83 million.
But there were other complications.
Democrats wanted a “refundable” child tax credit. Even if a household earns so little it has no income tax liability to reduce via the credit, $150 per child still would have been added to its refund.
Lamont, a fiscally moderate Democrat, generally has opposed using state taxes to redistribute income, saying that should occur at the federal level. He did compromise with Democrats three years ago to make Connecticut’s EITC rate one of the highest among states.
The governor instead favors broadening eligibility and increasing from $300 to $350 an existing income tax break that mitigates the municipal property tax bills for about 870,000 filers — chiefly from the middle class — each year.
“We had a property tax credit [proposal.] They like a child tax credit,” the governor said early Saturday afternoon during a visit to the Capitol. “Maybe we’ll marry them in some way and get a rebate out to people in need.”
Lamont’s proposal, which also will not be included in the next budget, would have cost $85 million per year, roughly the same cost as a $150-per-dependent child tax credit.
But legislators and the governor also used several maneuvers to work around the state’s Constitutional spending cap, including moving hundreds of millions of dollars outside of the formal budget to finance future investments in child care services.
Democratic legislators, who have been pushing for a child tax credit for the past four years, are expected to resume their battle in 2026.
House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, said his caucus members have “intense passion” for the credit.
And Horn said lawmakers are confident the EITC dependent program will bring real benefits to thousands of families and only intensify support going forward for a child tax credit.

(Alixel Cabrera/Utah News Dispatch)When Utah Democrats gathered at Ogden High School for their organizing convention on Saturday, the school hallways loudly echoed the voices of 600 delegates registering and debating whether an established politician or a newcomer had what it takes to transform red districts into blue after the departure of Diane Lewis, who had been in the role for the last four years.
Ultimately, that was decided by thin margins, when 52% of delegates voted Brian King to be the new Utah Democratic Party chair, a choice that reflected the party’s desire to trust widely known names to support its goal of gaining prominence in bright red Utah. 
“This isn’t just some abstract policy debate. What we’re talking about is happening right now,” King said during his pitch. “It’s parents losing their Medicaid coverage. It’s students being told what they can’t study. It’s immigrants being detained without due process and deported. It’s workers picking up the tab while billionaires cash in.”
King, who was a state representative from 2009 to 2024, when he quit to run for governor, highlighted his experience, saying he has been in the party long enough to know the dedication and planning needed to achieve its goals. He has also raised money and has cultivated important relationships across the state.
Utah Democrats to choose between seasoned legislator and young campaigner as new leader

 
He also committed to getting his hands dirty and filling up his calendar to show real progress.
“I’ve been able to stand on the House floor and say to the Republican supermajority, call them out for what they are, extremists who are out of touch with the values of Utah,” King said. “I took on the governor on the fake stage, and I told the truth. I said, ‘He’s not a leader. He’s a lapdog for the legislature.’”
In a statement after his win, King commended the convention’s turnout, saying it was a demonstration of Utah Democrats’ energy, motivation and readiness to fight for their values.
“This is a new era and this is our moment. As chair, I’m ready to lead the charge to hold out-of-touch Republicans accountable, to connect with voters across the state and political spectrum, and to flip seats from the top of the ballot to the bottom,” King said. “Monopolies, in politics and otherwise, aren’t good for anyone and Utahns deserve better.”
The day started early with caucus meetings, as cars filled up the school’s parking lot and neighboring streets. While it’s not an election year, delegates were fiery as party leaders and candidates mentioned some of the flagship policies the Republican Party has implemented in the state’s Legislature and, most recently, since President Donald Trump took office this year — immigration, Medicaid cuts, book bans and controversial culture war issues.
From the prayer to the candidates’ speeches, Democrats expressed profound concerns on the political status of the country under Trump’s direction, with some describing it as “being at war.”

While about 600 delegates showed up in person for the convention, 1,450 voted with the availability of digital ballots — a record number, the party said in a news release.
Tara Benally, who traveled with her mom from the Utah portion of the Navajo Nation in San Juan County for the convention, said she hoped to get more representation in rural areas out of the leadership change.
“Not many people are aware of what’s happening today or what’s going on within the state, because a lot of information stops somewhere along the way and just doesn’t get disseminated,” she said.
Especially, she added, when tribes are so deeply concerned with the status of public lands, the expansion of extractive industries, and the transportation of uranium through their neighborhoods.
“What is being done to help resolve a lot of the emergency issues that have been brought? What has been done to help monitor the air quality? A lot of these things we hear up in the Wasatch Front, but have not come down to our area,” Benally said. “When is that going to happen?”

A couple of hours before the voting started, the candidates made their pitches to delegates, with King arguing that the choices they made on Saturday would define the state and the party for years to come, as many started to pay attention to real impacts of policy coming out of the White House and the Legislature. 
Ben Peck, a young campaigner and former executive director of the Salt Lake County Democratic Party, highlighted his track record running campaigns that led to the election of Democrats including Natalie Pinkney in a tight race for the Salt Lake County Council, Sheila Srivastava, the first woman elected to serve as Salt Lake County treasurer, and Rosalba Dominguez, a freshman Utah House representative.
“Our democracy is facing an existential crisis. We need a party that acts like that. We don’t have time for part-time leaders anymore. We need a leader of our party whose full-time job is being the leader, building our party,” Peck said. 
Other candidates for the role, Archie Williams III and Jonathan Lopez, also made their case, however, but fell well below King and Peck in the in-person support.
The party also voted to approve a platform highlighting values they hope to lift up, including economic security, equality of opportunity, investing in the common good, and American leadership. Additionally, it overwhelmingly passed a resolution condemning efforts to extend presidential tenure beyond two terms, as well as denouncing mass workforce reduction and benefit cuts in the Department of Veterans Affairs.

Jim Clyburn’s World Famous Fish Fry, an annual gathering of South Carolina Democrats, on Friday, May 30, 2025. (Photo by Shaun Chornobroff/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA, S.C. — Minutes before 10 p.m. Friday, after Democratic speakers led the audience in jeers to Republicans’ efforts to slash jobs and health care, and encouraged people to get involved and vote, line dancing broke out.
That mix of politics and fun, mostly the latter, is what makes Rep. Jim Clyburn’s (D-S.C.) annual fish fry in the state’s capital city so popular, attendees said.
“We all came out, and everybody’s enjoying themselves,” said Shantell Zimmerman, 58, of Columbia.
“It brings out the community,” agreed Dionne Brown, 55, of Irmo, who’s been attending the event for six years. “Then we actually get to discuss our views and takeaways.”
Hundreds of people attended the event that started in 1992, the year voters first elected Clyburn to the 6th Congressional District, as a thank you to the voters who couldn’t afford the Democratic Party’s high-dollar fundraisers.
Over time, the “World Famous Annual Fish Fry” — which includes free food and drinks — has become a must-attend event for Democrats seeking local, statewide and national office.
This year was no different, even if Maryland Gov. Wes Moore and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz — Kamala Harris’ 2024 running mate — said they’re not running for the 2028 nomination.
“I know I’m not running,” Moore told reporters Friday. “But the thing I’m also very clear about is that anyone who’s talking about 2028 is not taking 2025 very seriously.”
Moore and Walz, as well as Clyburn and former Democratic National Committee Chairman Jaime Harrison of Columbia, emphasized the importance of focusing on what’s happening now in Washington, D.C.
Proposed cuts to government safety nets like Medicaid and billionaire Elon Musk’s efforts to rapidly slash federal spending were among the topics the governors touched on Friday during speeches at the fish fry, as well as the state Democratic Party’s Blue Palmetto Fundraising Dinner the same night.

“I taught school long enough to know it’s because they’re weak and they’re bullies, and when you stand up to them, they fade away,” said Walz, a former high school geography teacher.
While both declined suggestions that they’re running for president, there’s wide speculation otherwise. Their addresses at the events in South Carolina — which last year got promoted from holding the Democratic Party’s first-in-the-South to first-in-the-nation presidential primary — sounded a lot like campaign speeches.
Walz will also speak Saturday at the state Democratic Party’s annual convention.
Lucy Owens, an Anderson County delegate to the state convention, discounted the governors’ refusals, saying the 2028 presidential campaign has clearly begun.
“They’re all going to come through here. They’re the first ones,” she said of Moore and Walz.
In 2019, the fish fry drew more than 20 potential candidates hoping to appeal to South Carolina Democrats.
The following year, Joe Biden won the South Carolina Democratic primary, a victory that ended up vaulting him to the presidency. South Carolina’s primary was elevated for 2024 as Biden’s thank you to the state.
With Biden gone, the Democratic party in flux, and Harrison no longer leading the national party, South Carolina maintaining its first-in-the-nation status is in question.
Clyburn’s comments Friday suggest he knows it won’t. He doesn’t care if the state is first, just that it’s early, he said.
“The most important hitter on a team is the cleanup hitter. He comes in fourth place,” Clyburn told reporters at his event. “I’m not concerned about whether or not we’re first, second, third. Please, let us be at least four.”
That would take South Carolina back to having the first primary in the South.
In the aftermath of Trump’s landslide victory and the Republican Party gaining control of both chambers of Congress, the Democratic Party is in a reset. Walz and Moore, the first Black governor in Maryland’s history, are among the early faces of it.
Winning South Carolina, which changed the trajectory of Biden’s 2020 presidential run, will be crucial for Democratic hopefuls.

Owens, the Anderson County delegate, pointed to the stage where Walz and Moore spoke, saying every Democrat who wants to be president will eventually appear in that exact spot.
“They got to come through here. Not South Carolina. They got to go right there,” she said.
Both governors received raucous ovations from South Carolina Democrats, drawing cheers, standing ovations and even a few laughs as they took shots at the GOP.
Owens said “they’re both very great candidates,” and she’s “excited” to hear more from them over the coming years.
That was the general consensus from attendees who spoke with the SC Daily Gazette. But they were significantly more familiar with Walz because of his time on the campaign trail last year with Vice President Harris.
“I know less about Wes Moore than I do about Tim Walz, but I think he’s a good speaker,” said Laura Lowery, a 69-year-old from Fountain Inn. “I think he’s done a good job in his state as well.”
Moore has recently come under fire for vetoing a bill that would establish a commission to examine state and federal policies from 1877 to 1965 and come up with recommendations for reparations.
South Carolina Rep. John King, D-Rock Hill, had asked the state party to remove Moore as the keynote speaker at Friday’s Blue Palmetto Dinner because of the veto. Party leaders never responded to questions about that request.
But for at least some attendees, the veto perturbed them too. “I didn’t understand why he would do that,” said Tonya Winbush of Anderson.
But once Winbush, a 50-year-old Army veteran, heard Moore speak about his time in the Army, as well as his pardoning of 175,000 people with convictions for cannabis possession, her opinion changed.
“I think when you don’t know the whole story and you just listen to sound bites, which is what we do a lot, we’ll make brash judgments about people, when we are really fighting the same fight,” she said.

(Courtesy of Nebraska Game and Parks Commission)LINCOLN — One of Nebraska’s oldest trees has died, and officials are blaming drought conditions.
The “Old Wolf Oak,” a burr oak with a 9.8-foot circumference located along a hiking trail at Ponca State Park, was estimated to be more than 380 years old.
The tree was a popular stop for park visitors, given that it was 223 years old when Nebraska became a state in 1867 and was a silent witness to the Lewis & Clark Expedition of 1804-06.
But Nebraska Game and Parks Commission officials say drought conditions in eastern Nebraska have created large areas of dead or declining mature trees, including the stately oak.
The past two years have seen extreme drought across Nebraska, officials said. While native species like the bur oak are drought-tolerant, prolonged drought causes dieback in the canopy and root systems, weakening tree defenses.
This creates an opening for pests and pathogens, officials said, and makes a tree more vulnerable to infection.
Game and Parks staff had been monitoring and, where possible, treating bur oaks for bur oak blight, which can weaken a tree. Officials also identified a new threat to trees, hypoxylon canker, a fungus that invades the vascular systems of drought-stricken trees and dooms a tree.
The old oak will soon be cut down under a response plan developed after consulting with experts, Game and Parks announced. Infected material must be destroyed on-site, officials said, to avoid stressing the surrounding healthy trees.
A sign at the Wolf Oak, erected in 1964, states that it “began its life in 1644.” But more modern dating techniques later added another half century to its age.
Ironically, it was not a state champion tree in its category. A registry kept by the Nebraska Forest Service lists a burr oak with a circumference of 18.7 feet near Peru as the state champion.

Using flawed studies and scientific journal publications, abortion opponents are building a body of research meant to question the safety of the abortion pill mifepristone, a key target for the movement.
The effort comes as federal officials have expressed a willingness to revisit the drug’s approval — and potentially impose new restrictions on a medication used in the vast majority of abortions.

This report was originally published by The 19th. The Illuminator is a founding member of the 19th News Network.

Mainstream medical researchers have criticized the studies, highlighting flaws in their methodology and — in the case of one paper published by the conservative think tank Ethics and Public Policy Center (EPPC) — lack of transparency about the data used to suggest mifepristone is unsafe. The vast body of research shows that the drugs used in medication abortion, mifepristone and misoprostol, are safe and effective in terminating a pregnancy.
“There’s a proliferation of anti-abortion propaganda right now. I think it is a coordinated attack on mifepristone,” said Ushma Upadhyay, an associate professor at the University of California, San Francisco who studies medication abortion.
Released in April, the EPPC paper suggests that mifepristone results in serious adverse events for 1 in 10 patients — substantially higher than the widely accepted figure of .3 percent complication rate most research has attributed to the pill. The paper appears to count what other researchers say are non-threatening events, such as requiring follow-up care to complete the abortion, or visiting an emergency room within 45 days of an abortion — even if the patient did not end up requiring emergency care — as serious adverse effects. That paper also did not go through peer review, a standard process for scientific research in which other scholars review a study’s findings and methodology before it can be published.
Another paper, a commentary piece published this week in the journal BioTech, challenges the commonly cited statistic that mifepristone has a lower complication rate than acetaminophen, or Tylenol, tracing the history of the comparison and arguing that it is mathematically flawed. The paper’s author, Cameron Loutitt, is a biomedical engineer by training and director of life sciences at the Charlotte Lozier Institute, a research arm of the anti-abortion group SBA Pro-Life America.

“My hope is that this paper sparks action in my peers in the research and medical community to more critically evaluate these unfounded claims regarding abortion drug safety,” Loutitt said in a statement.
Days later, a group of researchers from the institute published another study, this one arguing that emergency rooms are likely to identify medication abortions as miscarriages, which they say increases the risk of needing hospital care.
A miscarriage and a medication abortion are medically indistinguishable, and patients will sometimes visit an emergency room to ensure the drugs worked, or if they suspect possible complications. In places where abortion is illegal, patients may also tell health care providers they experienced a miscarriage to minimize their legal risk. Studies like the Lozier Institute paper suggest complications from medication abortions are being undercounted.
That study was rejected by another journal on April 12 before being published this week, noted Upadhyay, who had served as a peer reviewer in that rejection process. A similar paper written by many of the same researchers behind the Lozier Institute’s was retracted a year ago by the journal that published it, along with two others suggesting mifepristone was unsafe.
“They keep trying to publish the same junk science,” Upadhyay said.
James Studnicki, the Charlotte Lozier Institute’s director of data analytics, who led the second of its new anti-abortion papers and the study retracted last year, did not respond to a request for comment. But a spokesperson for the institute said the organization is challenging last year’s retraction through an arbitration process. This March, Studnicki said in a statement that the retraction placed “politics over publication ethics.”
These studies and papers all fall outside the scientific consensus. More than 100 studies over decades of research have found that mifepristone — and the medication abortion regimen as a whole — has a low complication rate and is very safe to use for abortions. Papers like these aren’t new, and their scientific accuracy has long been questioned. But the bevy of new reports and analyses comes at a moment when abortion opponents may have more influence in shaping public policy.

Mifepristone restrictions are a top priority for the anti-abortion movement. About two-thirds of all abortions in the United States are now done using medication. Even in states with abortion bans, pregnant people have increasingly turned to abortion medication, which they receive from health providers in states with laws protecting abortion.
Nationwide, about 1 in 5 abortions are now performed using telehealth; almost half of those are for people in states with bans or restrictions. Mifepristone is currently approved for use through 10 weeks of pregnancy.
Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. testified before a Senate committee that he has directed the Food and Drug Administration to review the approval of mifepristone, citing the EPPC paper specifically. Jim O’Neill, who is nominated for a deputy secretary role, has also said he is in favor of a “safety review” of the drug — a move that could result in new restrictions on how it is prescribed.
Meanwhile, physicians and researchers are highlighting the rigor of the FDA approval process.
“FDA approval of mifepristone must reflect the rigorous clinical evidence that has proven unequivocally that it is safe and effective for use in medication,” 13 reproductive medical organizations, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, said in a statement after Kennedy indicated the drug may undergo a new FDA review. “Mifepristone has been used for decades for abortion and miscarriage management by millions of patients, and complications are exceedingly rare, minor, and most often easily treatable.”
The International Institute for Reproductive Loss, an anti-abortion nonprofit, has explicitly prioritized the publication of research that supports restrictions on medication abortion. Presenting at an anti-abortion conference last September, that organization’s science director, Priscilla Coleman, highlighted strategies that she said could help result in the retraction of studies showing mifepristone’s safety, such as finding “agenda-driven, poorly developed and conducted studies published in peer-reviewed journals” and writing to journal editors. Coleman did not respond to a request for comment.
Though no scientific consensus has changed, anti-abortion lawmakers have rallied around the suggestion that complications are common. In a private Zoom meeting reported on by Politico, abortion opponents cited the EPPC paper as a potential tool to justify further restrictions on mifepristone — even while acknowledging that the report is “not a study in the traditional sense” and “not conclusive proof of anything.”
Sen. Josh Hawley, a Republican from Missouri, cited the EPPC paper in a letter to FDA Commissioner Marty Makary, who had only a day before the report’s publication indicated openness to reviewing mifepristone’s approval if new evidence emerged.
“The time to act is now. It is time to revisit and restore the FDA’s longstanding safety measures governing mifepristone,” Hawley wrote. His office did not reply to a request for further comment.
“They’re producing this terrible ‘science’ because they don’t have any real science that backs them up. And all they’ve gotten from the administration is, ‘Yeah, we’ll study it,’”  said David Cohen, a law professor at Drexel University who has advised state legislatures on crafting abortion-protetctive laws.
Through the courts and Trump administration, abortion opponents have pushed to reverse a 2021 FDA decision allowing mifepristone to be distributed via telehealth. In addition to calling for the in-person requirement to be reinstated, abortion opponents are asking for restrictions such as the dispensation of the drug to require three in-person visits, and for mifepristone to only be approved for use only in the first seven weeks of pregnancy. Many have also argued the drug should be taken off the market entirely.
The Trump administration said on the campaign trail that it would leave abortion policy up to the states. So far, there has been little indication from the federal government that such changes are imminent.
“Pills are kind of just spreading, as we predicted, without almost any restriction and so far the anti-abortion movement hasn’t figured out what to do,” Cohen said.

While Nevada’s elected leaders have expressed a commitment to addressing the climate crisis, a new proposal under consideration raises questions about our state’s priorities. The proposed expansion of Nevada’s film tax credit program, which would direct hundreds of millions of dollars in public subsidies to Hollywood studios, risks sidelining urgent environmental and climate needs. At a time when bold action is needed to protect our communities and natural resources, this approach feels out of step.
It’s abundantly clear that Nevada is in a climate emergency. Wildfires are burning hotter and longer, filling our summers with smokey skies. Land managers warn this summer could bring catastrophic wildfires. The Great Basin is drying, and Lake Mead is sitting at thirty percent full. Communities from Las Vegas to Reno are enduring extreme heat, toxic air, and prolonged drought, and hundreds to thousands of Nevadans are dying each year as a result. We have proposed projects to protect our public lands, prevent extinction, and invest in sustainable transit, but we’re told there’s “no money.”


The proposal would allocate $95 million in annual transferable film tax credits for 15 years beginning in 2028, expanding our already-existing tax giveaways. The proposal will kick into place in 2028, and yet we have no way to know what our fiscal situation will be at that point in time. Just think of the roller coaster ride the 2020’s have been so far, and the looming federal budget that could have sweeping impacts to Nevada’s fiscal viability. Meanwhile, extreme heat is only getting worse, the Colorado River and Lake Mead are only getting drier, and our special places are only becoming more threatened.




Our organization has spent years fighting for clean air protections, better public transportation, rooftop solar access, and the preservation of special landscapes like Red Rock National Conservation Area and Lake Tahoe. We’re constantly met with budgetary constraints, told to be patient, to compromise. And yet the same state that balks at funding protections for pollinators and soil health is ready to roll out a red carpet for corporate film giants.
Supporters of the film credit expansion claim it will bring jobs and economic growth, but as the independent economists at Applied Economics reported, the state would have a negative return on investment. States across the country have learned the hard way that film subsidies rarely pay off. Meanwhile, climate investments create durable jobs, foster resilience, and protect our future. Where are the investments for fighting wildfires, restoring wetlands, or public transportation?
If Nevada has hundreds of millions of dollars to spend, let’s spend it on the people and places that make this state worth living in, and ensure it will be livable in the next several decades, not on fleeting glitz and glamour. Let’s fund the transition to a clean energy economy, build transit-to-trails networks, restore our watersheds, and protect the wild lands that make Nevada extraordinary.
We have shelled out enough for corporations working against our interests. Why do we give tax handouts to the Boring Tunnel instead of funding mass transit? Why do water intensive data centers get huge tax breaks when we can’t get funding for water conservation? Why did we give millions of dollars to build the A’s stadium in the Las Vegas core when we can’t get funding for urban forestry and mitigating urban heat?
This proposed tax credit isn’t just a bad policy. It’s a missed opportunity to lead. Nevada should act in the best interests of those who live here, instead of enacting Hollywood handouts.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1421734795-scaled-e1732293900334-1024x640.jpg,,,2025-05-31 15:03:28.216641

A Kodiak man has been sentenced to jail for illegally transporting Alaska crab out of state. (Photo provided by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries Service)A Kodiak fisher has been sentenced to spend a year in jail for illegally shipping thousands of pounds of tanner crab, much of it infected with a parasitic disease, out of Alaska to Washington state, federal officials said.
The fisherman, Corey Potter, was also sentenced to two years’ supervised release following his jail term, during which he will be barred from commercial fishing anywhere in the world, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said.
The investigation was led by NOAA Fisheries’ Office of Law Enforcement. The sentence was imposed on May 13 by U.S. District Court Judge Timothy Burgess in Anchorage.
The case concerns tanner and Golden king crab harvested in 2024 in Southeast Alaska. Potter owned two vessels, one of them captained by his son, Kyle Potter, and the other by employee Justin Welch.
Rather than unload the crab catch in Alaska, as is required by state law, the three men kept the live crab in the vessels and took the catch to Washington state, passing through Canadian waters along the way. The motivation was to fetch higher prices for their catch, according to prosecutors’ documents.
At the time, according to evidence presented in court documents, the men knew that a large proportion of the catch was infested with Bitter Crab Syndrome, a parasitic disease that usually kills the crabs and renders their meat inedible. Bitter Crab Syndrome is not toxic for people, but infected crab meat can be bitter and eating it is likened to chewing on aspirin.
That evidence included text messages from other Alaska fishers who cautioned Potter and his son against bringing infested crab to market, with one expressing concerns that their actions would hurt the reputation and marketability of all Alaska crab.

	Bitter Crab Syndrome affects numerous species, and it is considered a possible contributor to the crash of Bering Sea snow crab and king crab stocks that led to an unprecedented string of harvest closures between 2021 and 2024. The main reason for the stock crashes, scientists believe, was the warmth in the habitat, which led to crab starvation. In the years leading up to the fishery closures, however, there was an increase in Bitter Crab Syndrome. The disease is linked to warming waters and climate change, according to scientists from the University of Alaska Fairbanks.
Kyle Potter and Welch pleaded guilty last year. In October, Kyle Potter was sentenced to five years’ probation and ordered to pay a $20,000 fine; Welch was sentenced to three years’ probation and ordered to pay a $10,000 fine.
Ultimately, the loads of crab they delivered never made it to any market. They were seized by Washington state law enforcement officers and deemed unfit for sale or consumption. Of the Golden king crab, 42% of the catch was dead upon arrival; of the tanner crab, so much was infested that the entire load was disposed of in a landfill, federal officials said.
Potter pleaded guilty in February to two counts of violating the Lacey Act, the federal law that concerns transport of wildlife and fish across state lines. Prosecutors identified him as the leader of the scheme and therefore requested heavier penalties.
Potter, in a presentencing memorandum, asked for probation rather than jail time, arguing that his long career of fishing in Alaska has now ended and that at the age of 64, he is now financially ruined. “As a result of last year’s terrible crabbing season, which included the instant offense conduct, he has been financially destroyed. One of the boats involved in this offense was foreclosed on, and the other is believed to have been seized by the state. He has been reduced to relying upon family for assistance and has no viable means to support himself,” the May 6 defense memo said.
But prosecutors, who argued for 18 months imprisonment, said actions with the diseased crab fit Potter’s yearslong pattern of sloppy maintenance and unsafe behavior.
In their presentencing report, also filed on May 6, prosecutors listed numerous past problems with the vessels Potter owned. They have been cited for chronically leaking oil, broken down at sea – requiring crew members to be rescued – and sunk in different sites, the report said.
“The defendant’s track record as a vessel operator in Alaska is abysmal. He has shown a total disregard for the safety of his crew, the safety of Alaskan waterways, and the health of the marine environment,” the prosecutors’ presentencing report said.
Yet to be determined is the amount of restitution that Potter will be ordered to pay for the trafficked crab. The government is seeking $187,187 in restitution. A hearing on that subject is set for July 15.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/1280_EvN4ANCaZ2z3.jpg,,,2025-05-31 14:04:12.317876

(Photo by Shaun Chornobroff/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — Minutes before 10 p.m. Friday, after Democratic speakers led the audience in jeers to Republicans’ efforts to slash jobs and health care and encouraged people to get involved and vote, line dancing broke out.
That mix of politics and fun, mostly the latter, is what makes U.S. Rep. Jim Clyburn’s annual fish fry in the state’s capital city so popular, attendees said.

“We all came out, and everybody’s enjoying themselves,” said Shantell Zimmerman, 58, of Columbia.
“It brings out the community,” agreed Dionne Brown, 55, of Irmo, who’s been attending the event for six years. “Then we actually get to discuss our views and takeaways.”
Hundreds of people attended the event that started in 1992, the year voters first elected Clyburn to the 6th Congressional District, as a thank you to the voters who couldn’t afford the Democratic Party’s high-dollar fundraisers.
Over time, the “World Famous Annual Fish Fry” — which includes free food and drinks — has become a must-attend event for Democrats seeking local, statewide and national office.
This year was no different, even if Maryland Gov. Wes Moore and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz — Kamala Harris’ 2024 running mate — said they’re not running for the 2028 nomination.
“I know I’m not running,” Moore told reporters Friday. “But the thing I’m also very clear about is that anyone who’s talking about 2028 is not taking 2025 very seriously.”
Moore and Walz, as well as Clyburn and former Democratic National Committee Chairman Jaime Harrison of Columbia, emphasized the importance of focusing on what’s happening now in Washington, D.C.
Proposed cuts to government safety nets like Medicaid and billionaire Elon Musk’s efforts to rapidly slash federal spending were among the topics the governors touched on Friday during speeches at the fish fry, as well as the Blue Palmetto Fundraising Dinner the same night.
“I taught school long enough to know it’s because they’re weak and they’re bullies, and when you stand up to them, they fade away,” said Walz, a former high school geography teacher.
While both declined that they’re running for president, there’s wide speculation otherwise. Their addresses at the events in South Carolina — which last year got promoted from holding the Democratic Party’s first-in-the-South to first-in-the-nation presidential primary — sounded a lot like campaign speeches.

Walz will also speak Saturday at the state Democratic Party’s annual convention.
Lucy Owens, an Anderson County delegate to the state convention, discounted the governors’ refusals, saying the 2028 presidential campaign has clearly begun.
“They’re all going to come through here. They’re the first ones,” she said.
In 2019, the fish fry drew more than 20 potential candidates hoping to appeal to South Carolina Democrats.
The following year, Joe Biden won the South Carolina Democratic primary, a victory that ended up vaulting him to the presidency. South Carolina’s primary was elevated for 2024 as Biden’s thank you to the state.
With Biden gone, the Democratic party in flux, and Harrison no longer leading the national party, South Carolina maintaining its first-in-the-nation status is in question.
Clyburn’s comments Friday suggest he knows it won’t. He doesn’t care if the state is first, just that it’s early, he said.
“The most important hitter on a team is the cleanup hitter. He comes in fourth place,” Clyburn told reporters at his event.
“I’m not concerned about whether or not we’re first, second, third. Please, let us be at least four,” he said.
That would take South Carolina back to having the first primary in the South.
In the aftermath of Trump’s landslide victory and the Republican Party gaining control of both chambers of Congress, the Democratic Party is in a reset.
Walz and Moore, the first Black governor in Maryland’s history, are among the early faces of it.
Winning South Carolina, which changed the trajectory of Biden’s 2020 presidential run, will be crucial for Democratic hopefuls.
Owens, the Anderson County delegate, pointed to the stage where Walz and Moore spoke, saying every Democrat who wants to be president will eventually appear in that exact spot.
“They got to come through here. Not South Carolina. They got to go right there,” she said.
Both governors received raucous ovations from South Carolina Democrats, drawing cheers, standing ovations and even a few laughs as they took shots at the GOP.
Owens said “they’re both very great candidates,” and she’s “excited” to hear more from them over the coming years.
That was the general consensus from attendees who spoke with the SC Daily Gazette. However, they were significantly more familiar with Walz because of his time on the campaign trail last year with Vice President Harris.
“I know less about Wes Moore than I do about Tim Walz, but I think he’s a good speaker,” said Laura Lowery, a 69-year-old from Fountain Inn. “I think he’s done a good job in his state as well.”
Moore has recently come under fire for vetoing a bill that would establish a commission to examine state and federal policies from 1877 to 1965 and come up with recommendations for reparations.
South Carolina Rep. John King, D-Rock Hill, asked the state party to remove Moore as the keynote speaker of Friday’s Blue Palmetto Dinner. Party leaders never responded to questions about that request.
But for at least some attendees, the veto perturbed them too. “I didn’t understand why he would do that,” said Tony Winbush of Anderson.
But once Winbush, a 50-year-old Army veteran, heard Moore speak about his time in the Army, as well as his pardoning of 175,000 cannabis convictions, her opinion changed.
“I think when you don’t know the whole story and you just listen to sound bites, which is what we do a lot, we’ll make brash judgments about people, when we are really fighting the same fight,” she said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_5517-2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-31 14:04:12.317876

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)A strange turn of events followed the arrest of Ramón Morales Reyes, a 54-year-old Mexican-born man, who was living in Milwaukee as he sought a U-visa — a type of visa available to victims of crimes. 
On Friday, advocates from Voces de la Frontera joined immigration attorneys representing Morales Reyes to dispute accusations made by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) that Morales Reyes — who does not speak or write in English — drafted a neatly handwritten note in English threatening to assassinate President Donald Trump. Voces de la Frontera and Morales Reyes’ attorneys are calling for DHS to correct the record and clear his name.
The affair began on May 21, when Voces de la Frontera received a hotline call reporting a possible sighting of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Milwaukee. Christine Neumann-Ortiz, executive director of Voces de la Frontera, said during the Friday press conference that one of the group’s “trained community verifiers” contacted local residents who confirmed the sighting and also provided video footage of Morales Reyes being detained. 
  The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
“His vehicle was left on the side of the road, and using the license plate we were able to identify the owner and communicate with his family,” said Neumann-Ortiz. “Shortly after, Ramón’s daughter came to our office to seek help. We assisted her in completing a power of attorney and ensuring that her father received the essential medication that was critical to his health. We immediately contacted attorney Kime Adbuli, who has been representing Ramón in his ongoing U-visa case.”
Neumann-Ortiz explained that a “U-visa” is a form of immigration relief for crime victims who have suffered emotional or physical abuse and who have helped law enforcement or government officials in the investigation and prosecution of a crime. “It provides a temporary legal status, and a pathway to permanent residency,” said Neumann-Ortiz. “In the past, the Morales Reyes family had sought resources from Voces.” 
Days after the arrest, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem provided statements for a press release describing Morales Reyes as an “illegal alien who threatened to assassinate President Trump.” Noem added, “this threat comes not even a year after President Trump was shot in Butler, Pennsylvania and less than two weeks after former FBI Director Comey called for the president’s assassination.” 
Noem was referring to Comey sharing a picture on Instagram of sea shells arranged into the numbers “8647”, which “86” interpreted as slang for “get rid of” and “47” being a reference to Trump, the 47th U.S. president, NPR reported. Comey is now being investigated by the Trump administration. “All politicians and members of the media should take notice of these repeated attempts on President Trump’s life and tone down their rhetoric,” Noem said. “I will continue to take all measures necessary to ensure the protection of President Trump.”
The DHS press release included an image of the note, neatly handwritten in turquoise-colored pen and in flawless English. “We are tired of this president messing with us Mexicans,” it began. “We have done more for this country than you white people — you have been deporting my family and I think it is time Donald J. Trump get what he has coming to him. I will self deport myself back to Mexico but not before I use my 30 yard 6 to shoot your precious president in is (sic) head — I will see him at one of his big ralleys (sic).” The reference to “30 yard 6” may be an incorrectly written reference to 30-6 (pronounced as “30 odd 6”), which is a high caliber bullet for rifles.

Morales Reyes’ family says that it is impossible that he wrote the note. Described by his attorneys as a soft spoken,  hardworking and committed family man, Morales Reyes works as a dishwasher. He was described as coming from a rural part of Mexico where it’s common for people to have no more than a third-grade education. Morales Reyes had difficulty filling out paperwork, does not speak English and is not proficient in writing in Spanish. Neumann-Ortiz said that his family called Voces organizers, confirming that Morales Reyes had very little formal education, and could not read or write in Spanish. 
Since his arrest, Morales Reyes’ family has received death threats on social media. “They want his name cleared,” said Neumann-Ortiz. On the day he was arrested, CNN reported, Morales Reyes was questioned by detectives from the Milwaukee Police Department (MPD), who suspected that someone may have been setting him up to get deported. Police were reportedly investigating jailhouse calls from a person who’d allegedly assaulted Morales Reyes during a September 2023 armed robbery. 
CNN reported that ICE agents were given a handwritten note by Morales Reyes with family-related information, and agents realized that the handwriting did not match. The questions surrounding the letter are reminiscent of those stemming from the arrest and deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was accused by the U.S. government of being a member of the El Salvadoran gang MS-13. President Trump held up pictures which had been altered to appear as though “M S 1 3” was tattooed on Abrego Garcia’s knuckles.  
Getting Morales Reyes deported would prevent him from testifying against the person in custody for allegedly attacking him, his attorneys said at the press conference.

Attorney Kime Abduli said there are due process concerns around Morales Reyes’ arrest, as it could interrupt his testimony as a victim in a criminal proceeding and  also impact his U-visa case. The specific visa process which Morales Reyes is undertaking “is really meant to offer protection to people who may be undocumented who are victims of crime in the United States,” Abduli explained. 
“It’s meant to encourage them to report those crimes, when they are victims of those crimes, to the authorities, and to cooperate in the investigation. Where a person may be undocumented and fearful of reporting these sorts of things, Congress basically established the U-visa to make it ‘safe’ for them to come forward with that information. As long as they’re cooperating with law enforcement, the U-visa is intended to offer some protection for that individual.” Obtaining a U-visa can be a very lengthy process spanning seven to eight years at a minimum, Abduli said. 
Attorney Cane Oulahan, who is representing Morales Reyes in his deportation proceedings, said that ensuring due process is his top priority. Oulahan said that a bond hearing is expected in the coming days, where he expects the government to argue “vigorously” for Morales Reyes to be deported. It’s likely that the accusations from Noem’s DHS will also be raised before the judge. 
Another controversial deportation in Milwaukee
The controversy and questions come as ICE attempts to expel another Milwaukee resident. Yessenia Ruano, a teacher’s aide in Milwaukee Public Schools, was ordered recently by ICE to return to her home country of El Salvador in a matter of days. This is despite Ruano having a pending visa application for trafficking victims, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported. 
On Friday, the same day Voces and attorneys held a press conference about the Morales Reyes case, ICE ordered Ruano to get on a deportation flight on June 3. Ruano will leave behind her 9-year-old twin daughters, who are U.S. citizens. Ruano’s attorneys said that it appears that ICE is abandoning policies of waiting for processing of T and U visas, which protect people from deportation. Ruano has lived in the U.S. for 14 years, has no criminal record, has a valid work visa, and is employed at a bilingual public elementary school. She said she is hoping that a final legal filing could pause her deportation.

Ruano’s case spurred a flurry of condemnation from local Milwaukee officials. “Deporting valued members of our community who are raising and educating our kids, assisting law enforcement in their important work, and giving back to our neighborhoods should alarm us all,” Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley wrote on X. “These individuals are victims of a broken immigration system. The Trump administration told the country they were only going after ‘the worst of the worst’. But time and time again, we see them targeting the very people who contribute the most — our neighbors, our coworkers, or friends.” 
Crowley said that he is “deeply alarmed that our country continues to turn its back on our most vulnerable.” He went on to say that “by not standing up and protecting our neighbors, we’re not just failing them — we’re failing our entire community. Due process is under attack, and that should concern all of us in Wisconsin and across the country.”
Congresswoman Gwen Moore also released a statement, calling Ruano a “beloved member of her community,” and declaring that “deporting Yessenia will not make our country safer.” Moore said the deportation order “will only separate Yessenia from her children and her community while exposing her to danger she was forced to flee in El Salvador. Instead of making America a beacon of hope for people like Yessenia, this Administration’s focus is only pushing cruelty that demonizes immigrants.”
Rep. Ryan Clancy (D-Milwaukee) said that the Trump administration’s deportation of Ruano is “wrong and harmful.” Clancy said in a statement that Ruano had volunteered at her local Catholic parish, worked in her neighborhood school, and was taking care of her family.

Recent weeks have seen ICE and the Trump Administration focus more on Milwaukee. Since late March, at least four people have been arrested by immigration agents after attending regularly scheduled hearings at the Milwaukee County Courthouse. Local officials denounced the courthouse arrests, only for Circuit Court Judge Hannah Dugan to also be arrested by federal agents for allegedly obstructing authorities by escorting a man sought by ICE from her courtroom into a public hallway.
“Yessenia is an asset to our community whenever she touches it,” said Clancy. “Our community and her daughters deserve to continue to have Yessenia with us here, and Yessenia deserves to continue to build a thriving life with her family in Milwaukee.” Clancy condemned ICE, saying the agency “continues to act arbitrarily and with cruelty. We must all do what we can to protect our neighbors from it.”

“Blindsided, corrupt,” Arreguin said of the raid. “They’re not doing it for right reasons but, whatever, it is what it is. All we can do is do this right here, what we’re doing. There’s a god up there, he sees it all, he knows what happened yesterday.”
Wearing a white button-up shirt, Arreguin sat quietly on a bollard in front of the Capitol, holding a sign reading, “IMMIGRANTS ARE WELCOME HERE,” while others chanted, encouraged honking from drivers-by, and cheered for speakers.
“We’re not bad people,” Arreguin said, referring to “Mexicans, Hispanics, immigrants.” 
“This nation was built on immigrants. So, I don’t know what the hell happened in the last 10-20 years that we forgot,” Arreguin said. “Some of the greatest inventions that’s come out of this country have come from immigrants. It’s just the passing of the torch, man, you just gotta wait it out.”

According to ICE, “100+ illegal aliens” were arrested during the “targeted enforcement operation Thursday.” The agency said people arrested were from Nicaragua, El Salvador, Guatemala, Mexico, Venezuela, Colombia, and Honduras “to name a few.”
The operation was directed by ICE Homeland Security Investigations Tallahassee and assisted by Florida Highway Patrol, the FBI, Drug Enforcement Administration, U.S. Marshals Service, Florida Department of Law Enforcement, Internal Revenue Service, and Drug Enforcement Administration. 
Gov. Ron DeSantis, who called a special legislative session earlier this year to create laws cracking down on illegal immigration, characterized the raid as a “Major bust in Tallahassee!”
Ivette Martinez, a daughter of immigrants, traveled from Bainbridge, Georgia, to join the protest. 
“It’s inhumane,” said Martinez, whose husband works five minutes away from the construction site. “It could’ve been my husband.”
“My question is, we present a birth certificate, Social Security, a Real ID that we have, and they still be saying it’s fake,” Martinez said, concerned about cases such as one the Phoenix reported on in which a U.S. citizen was detained under the new immigration laws after showing his ID. 
“So what, me as a USA citizen, do I have to prove in order to prove that I am a USA citizen? If they don’t take my word, they don’t take my real ID, Social Security, or birth certificate, what else? Am I just supposed to let them detain me or fight back?”
After entering the construction site near the Florida State University campus, federal and state officials asked workers for identification and separated them into two categories, witnesses told the Phoenix. According to ICE, one worker during Thursday’s raid was charged with four counts of assault on law enforcement officers and another attempted to pull a weapon on officers.
Some were free to go; others were handcuffed and led onto white buses with metal-plated windows to be transported away from the worksite, escorted by the Highway Patrol. Officials, many masked, on the scene declined to provide information about the operation.
Construction workers who’d been allowed to leave told the Phoenix that law enforcement officers had surrounded the site on West Gaines Street in FSU-adjacent College Town before the raid began at about 9 a.m.

Kat Spiegel drove an hour and half from Jennings, Florida, with politics on her mind. 
“I’m here because Trump is dismantling our entire democracy. He’s trampling over the Constitution,” Spiegel told the Phoenix. “ICE is out of control and they’re running around, they’re not identifying themselves, we have no idea who they are, they’re masked, it’s disgusting, he needs to go.”
DeSantis posted to social media Friday that federal officials “are pursuing the subcontractor responsible for hiring the illegal alien workers…”
“These types of enforcement actions aim to eliminate illegal employment, holding employers accountable and protecting employment opportunities for America’s lawful workforce,” said ICE Homeland Security Investigations Tallahassee Assistant Special Agent in Charge Nicholas Ingegno in a news release. 
“HSI Tallahassee, working alongside our state, local, and federal partners, will continue protecting public safety by enforcing the immigration laws of our nation.”

‘Immigrants Make America Great’
Tony Alas, who works in construction, was at the protest with his family, holding a sign covered in stars and hearts that read, “Immigrants Make America Great.”
“They say we come here to steal. We’re not stealing anything. We’re just doing the job that nobody else wants to do,” Alas told the Phoenix.
“They say, ‘Come here, do it the right way.’ The immigration system is broken and they need to fix it,” Alas said. 
“Because sometimes it’s people with no papers and it’s not about money, it’s about your kin. Some of my friends, they had to go back. When you have a wife and kids, you don’t want to go back to your country and wait like, like, what? Three or four years, 10 years to get your papers straight? So you take the risk to stay with no papers.”
Tony Alas’ 19-year-old daughter Wendy, joined him.
“Me and my siblings, this country is all we’ve ever known. This country is where we grew up, we know everything here,” Wendy Alas said.
“It’s so heartbreaking, and I don’t know what I would do in a situation where my family or any of my other families like my aunts, my uncles, were sent back and I wouldn’t be able to see them again,” Wendy Alas said.

As the crowd formed and speakers aired concerns, protesters chanted, “One, two, three, four, immigrants are worth fighting for,” and, “Five, six, seven, eight, no more ICE in our state.”
“Say it once, say it twice, we will not put up with ICE,” they chanted, accompanied by drums and megaphones.
Groups involved in the protest included Tallahassee Immigrant Rights Alliance, Leon County Democratic Environmental Caucus, Young Democratic Socialists of America, Students for a Democratic Society, Voices United Gadsden, Freedom Road Socialist Organization, and Food Not Bombs
Protesters held up signs reading things like, “Abolish ICE,” “Due process for all,” “Let people work,” “No 287(g),” and “Melt ICE.”
“When our communities are under attack, we stand up and fight back. Politicians won’t help us, the people in power don’t want to help us, so we have to show them that we won’t stand for it and the people will rise up,” Joelle Nunez, an organizer with Tallahassee Immigrant Rights Alliance, said through a loudspeaker. 
“If they’re focused on gang members and drug dealers, why are they focusing on arresting people that are simply trying to earn a living for their family?” Nunez told protesters. 
Nunez, an FSU senior in biology, said she would ask politicians to “stop facilitating these immigration raids.”
“Florida, of all the states in the whole United States, has the most 287(g) agreements; we have a Immigration Enforcement Council now and, all in all, we’re not only taking Trump’s immigration policies in hand, but actually like stepping them up on the local level, and I think that’s not right. What we need to be seeing is a sort of, some type of opposition to the immigration policies,” Nunez told the Phoenix.

Justice Eric Rosen, from row left, wrote the dissenting opinion in the case raising questions about Fourth Amendment rights in searches and seizures. (Kansas Reflector screen capture from Supreme Court photograph)TOPEKA — Wichita police officers Donald Bailey and Shawn Isham were watching a suspected drug house in 2020 when Gina Wilson parked a vehicle in the driveway, entered the residence, reappeared a few minutes later and drove away.
The officers followed Wilson before pulling her over on Greenfield Street, allegedly for twice failing to properly use a turn signal. Wilson denied committing the traffic infractions, but informed officers she didn’t have a valid driver’s license.
What happened next as Wilson stood on the curb with police officers was closely examined by the Sedgwick County District Court, Kansas Court of Appeals and Kansas Supreme Court. In the end, Wilson lost her bid to exclude evidence of a drug offense and the state’s highest court exposed a disagreement regarding constitutional rights of individuals subjected to searches and seizures by law enforcement.
On Friday, the Supreme Court’s majority opinion from Justice Caleb Stegall affirmed the officers’ compliance with the Fourth Amendment in terms of constitutionally conducting the traffic stop and deploying Oden, a drug-sniffing dog, to examine the exterior of Wilson’s vehicle. Wilson had refused to consent to a search of her vehicle. However, the canine alerted to presence of illicit drugs. A subsequent examination of the car’s interior by Wichita officers led to discovery of a packet of oxycodone pills.
Stegall concluded that because Wilson had no legal ability to drive the car away at conclusion of the traffic-related portion of the stop, officers didn’t overstep their authority by nominally extending the encounter to allow for the dog sniff. Four minutes elapsed between when the officers completed her traffic citation and the time Oden alerted to presence of drugs.
“Even though she was not under arrest, Wilson argues that because she was not free to leave during these four minutes, she was unconstitutionally seized as an extension of the traffic stop,” Stegall said in the opinion. “As such, she concludes that the search of the car was also unconstitutional and therefore the evidence gained from the unconstitutional search must be excluded.”
Stegall’s majority opinion argued Wilson’s suspended license created an unusual circumstance enabling officers to deploy the K-9 around her legally parked car that no one was attempting to move.
“Oden’s alert provided probable cause, which allowed the officers to perform a warrantless search of the car … and the pills were properly admitted into evidence,” Stegall’s opinion said. “Therefore, officers do not run afoul of the Fourth Amendment’s protections by performing a dog sniff of any vehicle that is legally parked in public.”
The dissent by Justice Eric Rosen, which was joined by Chief Justice Marla Luckert and Justice Melissa Standridge, said the drug evidence should have been suppressed because prolonging a traffic stop to complete the drug sniff without reasonable suspicion violated the Fourth Amendment.
Rosen held the Wichita officers seized Wilson and the vehicle, extended the traffic stop, deployed Oden and discovered an envelope containing 30 oxycodone capsules in the car’s console.
Rosen expressed frustration the majority opinion “pronounces some new legal rules for which it provides no supporting authority.” He challenged the majority’s declaration that a vehicle directed to the side of the road during a traffic stop shouldn’t be characterized as seized by law enforcement.
“The majority likens this car to any car that was voluntarily parked in a public place,” Rosen wrote. “From here, the majority announces that officers can perform a dog sniff on any car legally parked in public.”
In 2022, Wilson was convicted of driving while suspended and illegal possession of opiates.
She unsuccessfully argued in district court for suppression of drug evidence while alleging the officers impermissibly extended scope of the traffic stop to create a window for deployment of the K-9 unit.
The Court of Appeals sided with the district court in 2023 after concluding there was “no evidence that the dog sniff meaningfully extended the duration of the original stop.” The divided Supreme Court affirmed Wilson’s constitutional rights weren’t violated.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Kansas-Supreme-Court-members.png,,,2025-05-31 09:59:47.240990

For years, states have taxed hospitals and other health care providers to draw down federal matching funds and help finance their Medicaid programs. Now, states may lose their ability to raise or implement new taxes. (Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images)The tax and spending bill the U.S. House approved last week targets a strategy states have used to boost the Medicaid dollars they get from the federal government. The measure would cap or freeze the taxes states levy on medical providers, potentially leaving states with major holes in their Medicaid budgets.
As a result, states would face the choice of either replacing the lost federal money with state dollars, scaling back services or providing coverage to fewer people.
Medicaid is a joint state-federal program, primarily for people with low incomes. For the traditional Medicaid population — children and their caregivers, people with disabilities and pregnant women — the federal government matches state Medicaid spending on a sliding scale, ranging from 50% for the wealthiest states to 77% for the poorest ones.
Consider a state that gets half of its Medicaid funding from the federal government. If that state collects $100 million by taxing providers, it can use $50 million of the revenue to draw down $50 million in federal matching funds, which it can use to expand Medicaid coverage to more people. Then it can take the remaining $50 million in revenue and use that money to draw down $50 million in federal dollars to pay providers more for caring for Medicaid patients.
Forty-nine states — all but Alaska — use the strategy. In 2018, the most recent year for which data is available, states relied on provider taxes to fund 17% of their Medicaid spending, up from 7% in 2008, according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office.
As part of their effort to cut federal Medicaid spending by roughly $625 billion over the next decade, House Republicans have proposed capping the state provider taxes and freezing them in place, preventing states from raising them or implementing new ones in response to inflation. Under current law, states can levy taxes of up to 6% on tax providers’ net revenue. The GOP measure also would add work requirements for Medicaid recipients, a step that would save money by reducing the rolls.
A report from the Congressional Budget Office, the bipartisan research arm of Congress, says eliminating the taxes entirely could save the federal government hundreds of billions of dollars over the next decade.
Many conservatives say the taxes are an accounting trick that allows states to draw down money from the federal government without having to front their true share of the Medicaid program. Some have even called the provider taxes a “money laundering” scheme.
“States are gaming the system — creating complex tax schemes that shift their responsibility to invest in Medicaid and rob federal taxpayers,” Dr. Mehmet Oz, the administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, said in a May 12 news release.
Brian Blase, president of the Paragon Health Institute, a conservative policy group that is working with Republicans to formulate Medicaid cuts, described provider taxes as “a way that states and providers can rip off the federal government.”
“States need to have some accountability for the spending in their programs,” Blase said.
But advocates of these taxes, including state Medicaid directors and even the hospitals that pay the taxes, describe them as legal and legitimate financial tools that have helped providers cover essential services and states fund their Medicaid programs for years. The result of eliminating these taxes or freezing them, they say, will be hospital closures and service cuts.
“We don’t like to pay these taxes, but the alternative is resources or access to care aren’t there for that community,” said Jason Pray, vice president of legislative affairs at America’s Essential Hospitals, an association representing about 350 hospitals. “The state would more than likely have to then tax individuals to make up for that, to keep the services at the same level and keep the resources at the same level.”
Blase said the provider taxes allow hospitals to make windfall profits from the additional federal matching funds that flow back to them, representing a type of “corporate welfare.”
But Pray said often hospitals in his association are losing money. By allowing states to boost payments to hospitals and other providers that serve Medicaid patients, he said, the tax enables hospitals to stay open in the long run, not garner a windfall.
Pray also noted that in the past, support for the taxes has been bipartisan.
“Republicans for years have shown they support provider taxes and have understood the value of them,” he said.

Edwin Park, a research professor at the Georgetown University McCourt School of Public Policy, pointed out that some hospitals pay the tax and don’t get much back, because they serve few Medicaid patients. The hospitals that benefit most are the so-called safety net hospitals that do care for many low-income patients, he said.
Park said he is worried that once the strategy is off the table, states will have to cut their Medicaid spending to balance their budgets.
Jay Ludlam, deputy secretary for North Carolina Medicaid, is worried about that, too. In North Carolina, Ludlam said, almost all of the tax revenue the state collects from providers helps pay for Medicaid services.
“The money goes to providers when they provide services. It’s not special. It’s just another way that states tax themselves and put money into the program,” Ludlam told Stateline. “If it means that there’s going to be less money in Medicaid … we’ll have to cut eligibility, cut benefits, cut provider rates, in order to maintain the program.”

(Photo courtesy of Scott and Julia Whitnall)Like many moderate-income workers, public school teachers Julia and Scott Whitnall didn’t think they’d become homeowners in their early 30s. Especially in California.
“We never felt homeownership was in our cards. But we did it!” Julia Whitnall said. “We’re extremely happy.”
The couple moved May 16 to a $509,000 two-bedroom house in Ripon, east of San Francisco in the Central Valley region.
It wasn’t easy. Despite a relatively high combined income of $140,000 from their nearby jobs, they had to compromise on size and take on extra work at summer camps to pull it off. Then they had to exercise patience as the sellers struggled to find a new home.
High interest rates and high prices in a still-competitive housing market continue to make it tough for first-time buyers, even those with good but moderate incomes.
 

On a national level, households making $75,000 to $100,000 — typical of teachers, nurses and skilled trades workers in many states — face a daunting lack of homes they can afford. That’s according to new research by the National Association of Realtors and Realtor.com based on listings in March of this year compared with 2024. However, the numbers showed an encouraging 20% increase in homes for sale, affordable or not.
Despite more houses for sale, those moderate-income buyers — which the report called “middle- and upper-middle-income buyers” — are much more hard-pressed to find an affordable home than they were in 2019, when almost half the homes on the market were affordable to them. This year they can afford only 21.2% of homes on the market — a slight improvement compared with 20.8% in 2024, according to the report.
It also found that a few states are improving in affordability for people in the $75,000-to-$100,000 income range. But many states are not.
The largest affordability gaps are in California, Hawaii, Idaho, Massachusetts and Montana, where such households can afford fewer than 12% of houses on the market. By contrast, they could afford about half the houses for sale in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Ohio and West Virginia.
There’s progress in states that are adding more housing at moderate price points: Arizona, Colorado, Delaware, Florida and Utah, according to the Realtors report.

 
  Balanced markets 

Nationwide, to get home markets back in line with moderate-income families, the United States needs 416,000 more homes for sale at or below $255,000, according to the report.
“In many places, we’re still seeing a huge mismatch between income levels and what’s available to buy for moderate-income families,” said Nadia Evangelou, the National Association of Realtors’ senior economist and director of real estate research.
“We are no longer in crisis mode, but we are still very far from where we need to be. We can’t fix it overnight. It will take years,” Evangelou said.

Heather, who asked not to share her last name for privacy reasons, said she can’t even think of buying a house near her job on Long Island, New York. She makes more than $100,000 as a registered nurse and her family makes $170,000 with her husband’s job in building maintenance. But $4,400 in rent and $2,000 in monthly day care costs for three children have them living paycheck to paycheck.
“We can’t even afford a small car repair, let alone a mortgage in our hometown” of Ronkonkoma in Suffolk County, Heather said. Their jobs exposed her and her husband to risks in the pandemic that her neighbors avoided with remote work, she said. But she now feels like she’s in worse shape financially than she was in 2019 and considers moving away.
“All of our hard work feels like it was for nothing,” Heather said. “It’s disheartening that we can’t afford to live where we grew up, but that’s the reality we are facing.”
Some states can still be a refuge of affordability.
Ashley and Tristan Jonas bought a $252,000 house in northwest Ohio after three years of getting shut out by higher or all-cash offers. Ashley Jonas, 32, trained as a teacher but now works in skilled trades as a project coordinator for a countertop company, and the couple makes about $140,000 with Tristan Jonas’ job as a computer programmer.
“We happened to hit the market at the right time in 2025,” Ashley Jonas said. “We bid on this house just as [President Donald] Trump was announcing tariffs. I think a lot of people were holding their coin purses. We weren’t.”
  Help for teachers 

Teachers, who generally make less than nurses or trades workers, are particularly squeezed. Some states, facing teacher shortages in local schools, are working to raise pay. And increasingly, some schools and hospitals are providing housing to lure more teachers and nurses.
“We lose so many teachers because they can’t find housing here,” said Autumn Rivera, a 20-year teaching veteran and 2022 Colorado Teacher of the Year. Despite her experience and credentials, Rivera said she can’t contemplate buying even a townhouse in the rural resort town of Glenwood Springs, where she teaches.

Prices for those townhouses now start in the $700,000 range, more than twice what they were when she last considered buying in 2019. Rivera feels lucky to have a reasonable rent by sharing a home with its owner, but many teachers in her Roaring Fork Schools need the 117 apartments provided by the district with affordable rent, she said. The district hopes the apartments will allow teachers to save up for a home; it has also built 14 houses for staff with Habitat for Humanity and Holy Cross Energy.
One way to make homebuying more feasible for teachers is to pay them more — a strategy that paid off for New Mexico, one of the few bright spots in a different report on teachers’ inability to afford housing, which was published this month by the National Council on Teacher Quality, a research and advocacy group.
Beginning teachers in Albuquerque saw a 60% increase in pay between 2019 and 2025, which fell just short of a 65% jump in home prices, according to the report. The report credited a state law that raised teacher salaries, including starting pay, by $10,000.
“We’re dealing with the issue of teachers being able to live in the communities where they’re actually working,” said state Rep. Joy Garratt, a Democrat who sponsored a new law, signed in April, that sets higher minimum salaries for teachers effective July 1.
Detroit schools also gave teachers with advanced degrees a pay boost of up to 50% since 2019, about the same increase as home prices, according to the report from the National Council on Teacher Quality. Albuquerque and Detroit are on the report’s list of most affordable places for beginning teachers to live.
But nationally, on average, experienced teachers who started in 2019 are less able to afford a home now than when they began, according to the report.
“Teacher pay has gone up 24% in the last five years, which some might say is solid growth, and yet the increase in house for purchase has gone up 47%,” said Heather Peske, the organization’s president.
“Housing prices are critical to being able to attract and keep great teachers,” Peske said. “People will be leaving the profession trying to find something that pays enough for housing. And bottom line, kids won’t get as good an education.”

Among Republicans, seven supported and eight opposed.The Nevada Assembly on Friday night approved what will likely be the state’s largest ever public subsidy: $1.4 billion in transferable tax credits over 15 years to support a movie studio in Las Vegas.
Assembly Bill 238 passed the Assembly by a razor-thin margin: 22 in support, 20 opposed. The bill now advances to the Senate for consideration in the waning days of the legislative session.
The bill would massively expand Nevada’s film tax credit program to support the build out and operation of a 31-acre film studio currently referred to as the Summerlin Production Studios Project (after the Las Vegas neighborhood where it would be located). Hollywood giants Sony Pictures Entertainment and Warner Bros. Discovery are attached to the project. Howard Hughes Holdings is developing.




How transferable tax credits cost the state money: A $50 million example
Transferable tax credits sell for less than face value — a discount of about 10% isn’t unusual.
Let’s say the state issues Sony $50 million of tax credits. MGM Resorts International buys them from Sony for $45 million. Then, instead of paying the state $50 million in gaming taxes that it owes, MGM gives the state the tax credits it bought from Sony.
MGM gets a $5 million tax break.
Sony gets $45 million.
And the state, which otherwise would have received $50 million in tax revenue from MGM, gets nothing.
— Hugh Jackson




Nevada’s film tax credit program is currently capped at $10 million per year. AB 238 would raise that cap to $120 million per year, for 15 years, beginning in 2028. The majority of those tax credits, $95 million per year, would be reserved for productions at the Summerlin studio; $25 million per year would be for productions not attached to the studio.
Altogether, that’s equivalent to $1.8 billion in public subsidies for the television and film industry. If approved by the Senate and signed into law by Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo, the legislation will be the largest public subsidy approved by the State of Nevada, surpassing the $1.25 billion approved by lawmakers in 2014 for Tesla Motors.
Democratic Assemblymembers Sandra Jauregui and Danielle Monroe Moreno, who sponsored the bill, have pushed back on the characterization of their proposal as a public subsidy for massive corporations, instead framing it as an investment in a new industry that will bring thousands of new jobs and new revenue to the state.
While tax credits aren’t issued to companies until they prove they’ve met the qualifications for them, the state must treat them as “negative revenue” when forecasting expected state revenue. That means they do impact the state budgeting process.
Opponents have argued that the return on investment is low. An independent analysis commissioned by the Governor’s Office of Economic Development, which houses the Nevada Film Office, determined that AB238 would stimulate the state economy but not enough to offset the massive expansion of the film tax credit program.
An analysis commissioned by the backers of AB 238 offered a rosier projection, but even that acknowledged that most of the projected economic activity is indirect or induced.
An amendment adopted by the Assembly will create a special tax zone around the Summerlin film studio that captures some of the local taxes generated and diverts it to the Clark County School District to fund pre-k programs in East Last Vegas. Additional guardrails were also amended into the bill.
Support in the Assembly did not fall across party lines. Among the 27 Democrats in the chamber, 15 voted in support and 12 voted against. Among Republicans, seven supported and eight opposed.
The Summerlin studio bill received less support in the Assembly than the bill two years ago that approved $380 million in public assistance for a proposed baseball stadium for the Oakland A’s on the Las Vegas Strip. That bill passed the Assembly 25-15. (Two lawmakers were excused from that vote.)
Banking bill vote raises eyebrows
The razor-thin film tax credit bill vote was not the only dramatic moment in the Assembly Friday. Earlier in the floor session, Assembly Bill 500 fell short of the required two-thirds approval it needed to pass the chamber. The bill would have allowed for payment banks, a new type of financial institution that focuses solely on payment processing rather than lending.
Assembly Speaker Steve Yeager, who sponsored that bill, believes the bill will create competition in the financial services industry and lower costs for businesses by cutting out financial middlemen.
The Assembly vote was 25-17, a simple majority but three short of the two-thirds it needed because it would raise state revenue. Six Democrats and 11 Republicans opposed the bill. Four Republicans and 11 Democrats supported the bill.
Immediately after the bill failed, a motion was made to reconsider the vote and move the bill to the chief clerk’s desk.
Yeager said afterward he wasn’t surprised by the outcome, adding that he wasn’t sure he had the votes it needed but decided “to put it out there and see.” 
He dismissed the notion that some Democrats may have withdrawn support after learning that the Nevada Firearms Coalition PAC was privately urging Republicans to support the bill, something Yeager and others in his caucus apparently did not know until it was reported by The Nevada Independent days earlier.
Yeager chalked up the vote to lawmakers being hesitant about complex financial banking legislation. He added that he plans on having “a few more conversations” about the bill on Saturday to see if another vote is possible.
Because of procedural rules, AB500 needs to pass the full Assembly on Saturday in order to have a chance at making it to the governor’s desk.

(Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images)More Republican-led states are giving paid parental leave to public school teachers and other state employees, signaling a broader acceptance of family-friendly workplace policies once championed primarily by Democrats.
“All of these red states, I think we’re late to the party,” said South Carolina state Rep. Beth Bernstein, a Democrat who sponsored a bill this year to increase state employees’ paid parental leave from six to 12 weeks. It passed the majority-Republican South Carolina House in April with strong bipartisan support.
This year, Alabama, Iowa and Mississippi joined 37 other states in granting paid parental leave to thousands of state workers.
The trend has gathered steam in recent years. Some experts link it to the cascade of state abortion bans that followed the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2022 Dobbs decision, which dismantled the federal right to abortion. Under fire from critics to do more to care for babies once they’re born, at least a dozen conservative-led states with abortion bans have since granted or expanded paid parental leave for their state employees.
But others say the increasing bipartisan support for measures that help working parents is also a reaction to economic realities.
“What we’ve seen, especially in more conservative states, is the public sector has experienced a lot of turnover,” said Kameron Dawson, legal director of the Southern Office of A Better Balance, a legal organization focused on workplace rights. “They’re looking for tools to recruit younger employees.”
Paid parental leave is the time off granted to workers for the birth or adoption of a baby, to care for a child, or to recover from a stillbirth or miscarriage. Without it, employees are left to cobble together their sick leave and vacation leave — or go unpaid — to stay home with a child and heal.












We’re trying to attract and retain state employees and teachers, and we’re in competition with everyone around us, and the private sector as well.


– Alabama Republican state Rep. Ginny Shaver




Alabama Republican state Rep. Ginny Shaver watched her daughter, a public school teacher, struggle to get the leave she needed after the births of her children in recent years.
“With her second, she had complications in her pregnancy and used up her [paid vacation and sick] leave before she even had the baby,” Shaver told Stateline. Her daughter contracted COVID-19, and the baby had to spend time in neonatal intensive care. “It was a very difficult time, and she had to take unpaid leave.”
Last year, Shaver and Democratic state Sen. Vivian Figures worked to win approval of a paid parental leave bill for state employees. It failed.
But they tried again this year. With the support of Republican Gov. Kay Ivey, the state legislature — which has a Republican supermajority — passed it nearly unanimously. The new law gives female state employees, including teachers, eight weeks of paid parental leave in connection with birth, stillbirth or miscarriage, and gives male employees two weeks. Adoptive parents get eight weeks for one parent and two for the other.
Shaver said she thinks the law passed thanks to vocal support from the governor and increased awareness of the issue due to the work she and Figures did in previous sessions.
“And the fact that all of the southeast states around us offered it,” Shaver said. “We’re trying to attract and retain state employees and teachers, and we’re in competition with everyone around us, and the private sector as well.”
Keeping talent
For many Republicans, the workforce development argument for paid leave is a persuasive one. For states such as Alabama and South Carolina that have some of the lowest workforce participation rates in the nation, paid leave can be a tool to keep more people — particularly women — working. And it can be a way to retain educators as many states struggle with teacher shortages in K-12 schools.
“For several years we’ve seen state legislatures acknowledging the importance of child care to businesses and the economy,” said Feroza Freeland, policy director at the Southern Office of A Better Balance. “But in the last few years, we’ve seen a growing recognition that paid leave is another piece of that puzzle.”
New rules protect pregnant workers, but red states sue over abortion provisions

States have taken up the issue because the federal government has not. The United States is a global outlier; among 38 peer nations, it’s the only one that doesn’t mandate paid parental leave, according to the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development. The group comprises 38 democracies with market-based economies.
The federal Family and Medical Leave Act, passed in 1993 and extended in 2020, only requires public agencies and companies with at least 50 employees to give up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for parents of newborns or newly adopted children, or caregivers of sick family members.
GOP support
During his first term, President Donald Trump publicly supported some forms of paid family leave and signed a defense bill that gives 12 weeks of paid parental leave to most federal employees.
Paid family leave was a signature issue for his daughter Ivanka Trump, at the time a senior adviser to the president. She even held a paid leave and child care summit at the White House in late 2019.
That set the stage for other Republicans to take up the issue more publicly. And after the Dobbs decision, family-friendly policies have increasingly become conservative talking points in states with restrictive abortion laws.
After the Mississippi House unanimously passed a paid parental leave bill earlier this year, Republican House Speaker Jason White celebrated the bill as a reflection of Mississippi’s status as a “pro-life state.”
In a post on X this week announcing her signing of a new paid parental leave law, Iowa Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds called Iowa “a pro-family state.”
North Carolina was one of the first Southern states to grant paid parental leave to state workers in 2019 when then-Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, signed an executive order. In 2023, several months after the Dobbs decision, the state’s majority-Republican legislature extended paid parental leave to public school employees by tacking it onto a law banning most abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy.
Meanwhile, Indiana Republican Gov. Mike Braun signed an executive order in March to add up to eight additional weeks of paid leave for “childbirth recovery” to the state’s existing four weeks of paid parental leave.
Running the gamut
The new laws won’t apply to most residents, because they only cover state employees. But they could have a downstream effect.
Shaver, the Alabama lawmaker, said she hopes her state’s new law will not only help the state be competitive with the private sector, but also set a precedent for other employers to follow.
“I hope they will see it’s in their benefit to offer what they can,” she said. “It may not be eight or 12 weeks, but even offering a reduced or flexible work schedule can help families.”
Just over a quarter of private-sector workers have access to paid family leave through their employer as of March 2023, according the most recent data from the U.S. Department of Labor.
Among the lowest-wage earners, that share drops to 6%.
Abortion-ban states pour millions into pregnancy centers with little medical care

State paid leave programs run the gamut in terms of what they offer. While Alabama’s new law offers up to eight weeks of leave for all state employees, including teachers, Mississippi’s offers six and does not require public schools to offer paid parental leave to their employees.
Iowa’s new law grants four weeks of paid leave for the birth or adoption of a child and one week of paid paternity leave. Tennessee’s law, passed in 2023, only offers paid leave to workers in the state’s executive and judicial branches.
But a few states are already expanding their offerings: Last year, Georgia legislators voted to double paid parental leave from three to six weeks.
And some states have gone further than just state employees: 13 states and the District of Columbia have mandated paid family leave for all workers, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center. Most of those states are located in New England or on the West Coast and all are Democratic-led. Ten more offer voluntary paid family leave statewide that’s provided through private insurance.
Sandwich generation
Experts say the shift in attitude toward family-friendly policies can also be attributed to a generational shift.
“A lot of younger lawmakers are more willing to champion the issue of paid leave,” said Freeland, of A Better Balance. “They’re understanding it because they’re seeing it in their own lives, or seeing friends and family members going through this.”
In South Carolina, Bernstein’s bill faced some opposition from members of the state’s ultra-conservative Freedom Caucus and Family Caucus. Some lawmakers questioned the potential costs of the bill, or criticized it as government overreach.
South Carolina Republican state Rep. Josiah Magnuson, a member of the Freedom Caucus, said he believed the bill would be a financial burden on public school districts that could lead to raised taxes.
“You’re saying, let’s tax the people of South Carolina, most of whom don’t get paid parental leave, and give them to state employees who already have six weeks’ paid parental leave,” Magnuson told lawmakers in April before the House voted to pass the bill.
He also said he doesn’t like that the increased paid leave “puts the foot in the door a little more for the government to be involved in the home.”
The opposition frustrated Bernstein, who pointed out that the state’s 2022 law that granted six weeks of paid parental leave passed the legislature almost unanimously. This year’s bill expanding that leave passed the House but hasn’t seen movement in the Senate. It can be picked up again when the legislature returns in January.
Other South Carolina Republicans backed the bill, citing their own families’ experiences following the birth of their children, reported the South Carolina Daily Gazette.
More conservative states are also responding to the needs of “sandwich generation” employees who may be caring for aging parents as well as children, Freeland said.
Earlier this year, Tennessee became the first Southern state to expand its state paid leave policy beyond just parental leave. The state legislature voted almost unanimously to extend its six-week paid leave policy to cover state workers providing end-of-life care to a family member.
“We’re seeing a growing recognition that people need support for these types of family or caregiving needs,” said Freeland, “and that it strengthens the workforce and economy to be able to provide that.”

(Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota’s largest hunger-relief organization says it faces a $2.5 million budget shortfall next year because of President Donald Trump’s federal funding cuts.
Feeding South Dakota CEO Lori Dykstra addressed lawmakers on a budget committee Friday in Pierre. She said the group has already cut the amount of food it provides and has merged distribution sites. She warned that unless the funding gap is filled, 21 food distribution events in 15 counties will be eliminated, affecting 3,400 families and eliminating more than 1.7 million meals annually.


Federal fallout

	
As federal funding and systems dwindle, states are left to decide how and whether to make up the difference.
Read the latest > 


“We’re not here to say whether or not the federal funding decisions are right or wrong,” Dykstra said. “We’re just letting you know that one of the unintentional consequences is that the food safety net for Feeding South Dakota and for all of your neighbors facing hunger is at risk.”
The cuts come from the rollback of federal aid by the Trump administration, particularly programs begun during the COVID-19 pandemic to help the U.S. Department of Agriculture support food distribution. 
Dykstra said the group must now find $2.5 million to replace lost USDA support in fiscal year 2026, which begins July 1, or make cuts. 
Dykstra also warned that if the current budget reconciliation legislation in Congress is enacted, the state could be on the hook for 5% of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits and a larger share of SNAP administrative costs, adding up to a possible $13 million total state obligation. SNAP participants can use their benefits to purchase food.
“SNAP benefits get people out of food lines,” she said. “So, it’s either they’re in the food bank line or they’re in the grocery store.” 
Dykstra said 113,000 South Dakotans are food insecure, meaning they are uncertain about where their next meal will come from, often forced to skip meals, eat less, or purchase cheaper, less nutritious food.

Buildings were destroyed during the Tulsa Race Massacre when a white mob attacked the Greenwood neighborhood, a prosperous Black community in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in 1921. Eyewitnesses recalled men carrying torches through the streets to set fire to homes and businesses. Credit: Library of Congress
The Tulsa race massacre began after a white mob gathered at a jail where a Black teen had been arrested on false charges of “attacking” a white girl in an elevator. 
In reality, he may have tripped or bumped into her. Although authorities exonerated him, that didn’t stop the mob. 
“As the whites moved north, they set fire to practically every building in the African American community, including a dozen churches, five hotels, 31 restaurants, four drug stores, eight doctor’s offices, more than two dozen grocery stores, and the Black public library,” according to a 2001 report on the massacre. 
That rampage left as many as 300 dead and 10,000 homeless. “They tried to kill all the Black folks they could see,” recalled George Monroe, who was 5 at the time. The Black community known as Greenwood bore the name of the Mississippi Delta town. Greenwood, known as the “Black Wall Street” for its bustling businesses, became a pile of ashes. 
No one was ever prosecuted for these crimes. Viola Fletcher, a 107-year-old who survived, said, “I have lived through the massacre every day. Our country may forget this history, but I cannot. I will not. And other survivors do not. And our descendants do not.”

The Boeing 737 that he used to travel around the nation is now being used to deport immigrants. Records show that it has made at least 16 flights to Central and South American countries to deport immigrants this year.


Federal Fallout
As federal funding and systems dwindle, states are left to decide how and whether to make up the difference. Read the latest.


	An Arizona Mirror analysis of publicly available data and records obtained by the University of Washington through Freedom of Information Act requests confirms that the 22-year-old jet is part of the fleet of planes known as “ICE Air” that swiftly shuttles immigrants out of the United States. ICE Air consists of multiple charter airlines and other private aviation companies around the country that are contracted to move immigrant detainees inside and out of the country.
Even before the plane was emblazoned with the Trump campaign logo in July 2024, it had been used at least four times to transport immigrant detainees during an earlier stint on the ICE Air fleet.
Data analyzed by the Mirror and confirmed by University of Washington Center for Human Rights researcher Phil Neff show that the aircraft flew four ICE Air missions in April and May 2018.
Those four missions consisted of three removal flights to El Salvador and Guatemala, in which deportees were shipped off to those countries. The fourth was a transfer flight, in which detainees were moved from one ICE facility to another.
During those four missions in 2018, the aircraft carried between 456 to 504 passengers, according to ICE passenger data.
And records from 2020 detail 35 flights from known ICE hubs to Central and South American countries.
For example, on March 6, 2020, the aircraft took off from the Alexandria Airport in Louisiana, where ICE has a staging facility operated by private contractor GEO Group. It then landed at the José Joaquín de Olmedo International Airport in Guayaquil, Ecuador, before returning to Alexandria.
Earlier this year, that same airport was where military planes deported migrants.
Data on flights after 2018 are more difficult to confirm. ICE and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security began redacting identifying information of the aircraft used in the deportation process, making it more difficult to see the movements of individual planes, though it is still possible in some cases.
In its response to questions from the Arizona Mirror, an unnamed “senior DHS official” said that the department would not confirm whether the plane had been used for deportation flights.
“ICE uses sub-contractors to help carry out its mission to deport illegal aliens,” the unnamed official said in an email. “These sub-contractors are not exclusive to ICE. For operational security, we will not confirm tail numbers of planes used for removing illegal aliens who are often violent criminals and foreign terrorists.”
Claims that most of the Trump administration’s deportees are violent criminals have been repeatedly proven false.
Civil rights groups have been fighting for records about the program, while the agency regularly slow-walks records releases.
“Our experience in general with FOIAs — not just with the Department of Homeland Security, but especially with the Department of Homeland Security — is you should expect to have to sue to get information and for us that process involves getting approval from the highest level of the university,” Neff told the Mirror. “So, we have had to be very selective in the case in which we have had to do that.”
Just five months after Trump and Vance won the election, the aircraft flew between multiple airports known for ICE Air activity before heading to an airport in Honduras known for deportation flights, then coming to rest at Mesa Gateway Airport.
It is not clear if Trump or Vance were aware of the aircraft’s history before it became part of their campaign. A spokesperson for the White House directed the Mirror to the Department of Homeland Security and Vance’s office. Vance and DHS did not respond.
 From ferrying travelers to deportees

The aircraft, N917XA, has a long and interesting history.
It started its life in the fleet of the now defunct Air Berlin before transferring to Orenair, another ill-fated airline based in Russia, until it was acquired by Swift Air.
Swift Air was a subcontractor for ICE and has previously conducted flights out of Mesa Gateway Airport, one of ICE’s major airport hubs. Flight history shows the plane has made multiple flights to and from Mesa Gateway to other ICE airport hubs, as well as to Central and South American countries.
A previous inspector general report listed the Phoenix-Mesa Gateway airport as the operational headquarters for ICE Air.
Swift Air rebranded as iAero Airways in 2019, but went bankrupt in 2024. Eastern Air Express acquired much of iAero’s assets, including N917XA, in April 2024. Three months later, it was unveiled as Vance’s campaign jet. Eastern Air Express has also taken over the ICE Air contracts that iAero held.
The company also has connections to the Trump world.
From 1989 to 1992, Trump owned an airline company called “Trump Shuttle,” which he purchased after meeting the Eastern Air Express CEO at a party. But the endeavor, like so many of Trump’s businesses, was financially doomed and failed.
 ICE Air activities heat up in Arizona

ICE Air operations in Arizona are beginning to ramp up as well, with Avelo Airlines starting to make deportation flights out of Mesa Gateway this month, amid financial woes and market competition.
Contracts to conduct deportation flights are lucrative for the companies involved. The Project on Government Oversight has reported that CSI Aviation, whose corporate director was a “fake elector” in New Mexico for Trump, was awarded a no-bid contract to the tune of $128 million.
Neff said he wasn’t surprised to learn that the aircraft that had been used for deportations had been used by the Trump campaign, although he did say there was an “irony to it.”
During their research, Neff said they found that some of the contractors would often boast about how they could turn aircraft around from passenger style to luxury style on short notice, even finding aircraft that had previously been used for deportations later being used to shuttle professional sports teams or musicians around the country.
Immigrant advocates have been critical of the flights and say they raise a number of human rights and civil rights issues. Neff said those concerns are only being exacerbated by the Trump administration’s push to speed up deportations.
“I think it is really impossible to overstate or understand the true scope of human impacts of a deportation program on this scale,” Neff said.
During their initial research, which covered flights between 2010 and 2020, Neff said they found a “significant portion” of the passengers being deported still had cases that had not worked their way through the courts. The Trump administration has recently been defending its use of the Alien Enemies Act, the 1798 law last used during World War II to intern Japanese Americans, to do rapid deportations.
Once on the planes, immigrants are shackled at their feet and hands for the duration of the flight. In testimony in a class action against the United States, passengers were shackled for 23 hours sitting on the tarmac and some soiled themselves as they were denied access to the bathroom.
Abuse on ICE Air flights have been reported going back to 2016, when some passengers were left bloodied after being beaten and placed in body-bag style restraints. In some cases, deaths and miscarriages have been reported on ICE Air flights.
And transparency about the flights is getting worse, Neff noted.
While the first round of data obtained by researchers contained information such as flight destinations, flight costs, and the tail numbers of aircraft, the government redacted that information from future releases.
While public flight history data are available to researchers, those researchers are working overtime to help track these flights.
“It is 8 or 10 hours, 7 days a week. It is a significant amount of time,” immigration activist Tom Cartwright, who has been voluntarily tracking ICE flights since Trump’s first term, told the Mirror.
During that time, Cartwright has noticed that tracking the aircraft has gotten considerably more difficult, as federal agencies have sought to stymie watchdogs from monitoring the program by removing their aircraft from flight-tracking services.
But Cartwright and others have still found other ways to keep a watchful eye on the program.
“The transparency has gotten worse over time and worse under the [second] Trump administration,” Cartwright said, adding that taxpayers deserve to know how their money is being spent. “To send some of these flights with relatively few people on them at a million dollars a flight seems pretty ridiculous, to be honest.”
The coming weeks and months are likely to keep Cartwright busy, as deportation flights have been ramping up. In the last couple of weeks, Cartwright said he has noticed flights have “accelerated quite a bit,” and he said is anticipating May to be a record-breaking month for total flights.
Cartwright said his work is important because it sends a message to those on the flights — and those their deportation left behind in America.
“The people on the planes deserve the dignity of someone giving a damn,” he said. “All these people on these planes, they have mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers, aunts, uncles. They deserve the dignity of someone understanding that they are being sent away to somewhere that, in some cases, they haven’t seen in years or somewhere that is dangerous or where they won’t be able to support their family.”

Jermaine Johnson, D-Columbia, pictured on the South Carolina Statehouse grounds on Sept. 18, 2024 (File/Jessica Holdman/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — After five sessions in the state House, Rep. Jermaine Johnson might make a bid for the Governor’s Mansion.
The Columbia Democrat announced Saturday he’s forming a committee to assess support and engage with voters statewide, which is considered a step toward launching an official run.
“From expanding economic opportunity and improving education to advocating for criminal justice reform and protecting working families, I’ve stood side-by-side with South Carolinians through every challenge,” Johnson said in a press release. “Now, I’m exploring what it would mean to take that work to the Governor’s Office to serve all of the people of South Carolina.”
The father of four — who turns 40 on July 4 — did not offer a timeline on his decision. Filing for the June 2026 primaries isn’t until mid-March.
Johnson is the first Democrat to announce interest in seeking the job as the state’s CEO.
He recognizes it would be an uphill battle for any Democrat in South Carolina.
No Democrat has won the office since Jim Hodges in 1998. The last Democrat to win any statewide office was Jim Rex in 2006, when he became state superintendent of education by fewer than 500 votes.
“South Carolina is at a crossroads,” Johnson said. “We need leadership that listens, leads with integrity, and puts people before politics.”
No Republican has officially announced a bid for governor, but six have said they’re considering it: Lt. Gov. Pam Evette, Attorney General Alan Wilson; U.S. House Reps. Nancy Mace and Ralph Norman; and state Sens. Josh Kimbrell and Sean Bennett.
The race is wide open since Gov. Henry McMaster can’t seek another term. He’s already the longest-serving elected governor in state history, since he ascended to the job in January 2017 — when Nikki Haley became President Donald Trump’s first United Nations ambassador — giving him two years in office before his first inauguration.
Regardless of whether Johnson decides to make a gubernatorial run, he said he “wholeheartedly plans” to still run for re-election to the state House seat representing parts of Richland and Kershaw counties.
South Carolina law allows candidates to seek more than one office at the same time. They just can’t hold multiple offices simultaneously. If they win more than one in an election, they have to make a choice.
Johnson first won a seat in the Statehouse in 2020, when he ousted 22-year veteran Rep. Jimmy Bales in the Democratic primary. Two years later, the elections gave Republicans a supermajority in the chamber. The 2024 elections gave the GOP a supermajority in the Senate too.
That doesn’t stop Johnson from making sure his colleagues know where he stands. And even if Republicans have no intention of supporting his argument, they listen.
“For years, I’ve worked to uplift our communities — not just with words, but with action,” Johnson said in the release.
During the chamber’s May 7 debate on the roughly $14.5 billion state budget, he put up 37 amendments to protest a decision by the chambers’ chief budget writers not to fund any local projects, known as earmarks, this year. All failed, but he ensured his colleagues knew more about some of the projects they were dismissing.
Three weeks later, as the House voted on the final budget deal, Rep. Joe White brought up Johnson’s fight while scolding his GOP colleagues. The Newberry County Republican noted he voted for Johnson’s first amendment.
“He put up some good amendments, and what did we do?” said White, a member of the uber-conservative Freedom Caucus. “We ran roughshod over every one of them.”
His comments also show that Johnson’s well-liked across the political spectrum.
“I love Jermaine,” White said.
Johnson, born in Los Angeles, has a compelling life story, which became the subject of a documentary titled “I Got Myself a Yard,” released last fall.
Homeless in his teens, Johnson earned a basketball scholarship to the College of Charleston.
His 1,276 points still rank 21st in program history and led to a spot in a developmental league for NBA prospects before stints playing professionally in Canada, Portugal, Mexico and Brazil.

The Sleeping Bear Dunes have been active systems for millennia, shifting with the weather or fixed by vegetation. But changes can seem sudden, especially when measured against human infrastructure.
That was the case with a popular wooden viewing platform at the Lake Michigan Overlook’s stop #9 along Pierce Stocking Scenic Drive in Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore.
The platform rested on the dune some 450 feet above the lake. When National Park Service staff arrived at the site this spring, they found some of its pilings were no longer touching the ground. Winter storms, wind and rain had eroded the sand underneath.
“The western portion of that overlook was freestanding. It was free-hanging. The sand had moved on,” said Scott Tucker, superintendent of Sleeping Bear Dunes.
Tucker estimated roughly half a million people visited the stop every year. Some would venture out onto the platform.
Now, it’s gone.
Staff dismantled it earlier this month because it wasn’t safe.

Why do the dunes do that? As the glaciers retreated at the end of the Ice Age, they shaped this area’s geography. Wind and water have changed the lakeshore and the dunes along it for millennia. But human-caused climate change is also influencing erosion in the Great Lakes. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, for instance, warming temperatures contribute to lower ice cover and water levels, which in turn can make coastlines vulnerable to erosion and flooding.

 Underneath the park’s Facebook post announcing the news, people reacted with stories and memories of past visits, from engagements to shared moments with loved ones who have passed away.
The platform was installed in 1986, further back from the edge of the dune and firmly anchored in the ground.
But in the nearly four decades since, the dune has retreated. Tucker said in a given year, the dune face moves about 1 to 3 feet east, away from the lake.
These dunes move with the prevailing winds. In this case, the sand is being blown from the overlook and deposited across the Sleeping Bear Plateau, said Tom Ulrich, a former deputy superintendent of the park who retired about a year and a half ago.
“The dunes are inexorable,” Ulrich said. “They will move, and you cannot stop them from moving, and you’re foolish if you think you can.”
It’s been a chaotic time for national parks. The Trump administration froze federal hiring earlier this year before lifting it for the National Park Service in March. Many federal employees have lost their jobs, left, or been caught in a state of limbo since January. And the proposed federal budget, which narrowly passed the House, would mean major cuts to the agency.
Sleeping Bear Dunes has around two-thirds of the staff typically there this time of year, according to the Glen Arbor Sun and WLUC-TV.
Tucker, the superintendent, didn’t elaborate. “It’s a very complex system right now, and I’m really focused on opening up the lakeshore for the summer,” he said.
As for the future of the overlook, he said, in 2028 the park will look at planning and design for that location as part of a five-year recreation fee plan.
The Pierce Stocking Scenic Drive was the last area of the park to open for the season. And while the platform is gone, people can still visit the stop along the drive and take in the vast landscape.

(Micah Drew/Daily Montanan) Last week, by a single vote, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the “One Big, Beautiful Bill Act.” 
This is sweeping reconciliation bill that promises to reshape the American social safety net. At the heart of this legislation are more than $700 billion in cuts to Medicaid, a program that serves as a lifeline for tens of thousands of Montanans with disabilities. 
Medicaid pays for some of the most basic services many people with disabilities need to get by each day, like the basic personal care supports someone with a physical disability may need to get out of bed in the morning, the more intensive skill training and safety supervision someone with an intellectual disability may need to learn to live more independently, and it pays for medication to maintain a person’s mental health and more intensive community supports when they have mental health emergency. For Montanans with disabilities, this bill is not just a policy shift – it’s a direct threat to our lives.
The bill imposes new administrative hurdles, including requiring Medicaid recipients to reverify their eligibility twice a year. For people with disabilities – many of whom already navigate complex bureaucracies – this change increases the risk of losing coverage due to paperwork errors or missed deadlines. Here in Montana, we know this isn’t a mere possibility, it was our reality. In 2023 and 2024, Montana required Medicaid recipients to submit paperwork to verify their continued eligibility.  When Montanans tried to follow the rules to verify their eligibility, they found the state’s phone lines were left unanswered and many people were kicked off for administrative reasons without ever looking at their clinical need.  
Though the bill includes exemptions, these are often poorly implemented. In practice, people are misclassified, denied exemptions, or fall through the cracks due to inaccessible systems. People with legitimate disabilities are stripped of their health care and there is a big administrative burden on the individual and the state eligibility system to sort through wrongful denials and terminations. When Arkansas implemented work requirements in 2018 similar to the work requirements in the new federal reconciliation bill, more than 18,000 people lost coverage, many of them wrongfully, and there was no meaningful impact on employment.
At Disability Rights Montana, we have been here for 50 years serving the disability community and we hear from people every day who rely on Medicaid to live independently, to work, to go to school, and to participate in their communities. These are veterans with PTSD, children with autism, adults with spinal cord injuries, and seniors with dementia. Defunding disability services is a major step backwards in history to a time when people with disabilities were excluded from society and warehoused in poor institutional conditions. This bill sends a clear message to people with disabilities that their lives are not as valuable as tax cuts for the rich. 
Even if you don’t have a disability or don’t use Medicaid, you will feel the cuts. It is well known in health care circles that even Montanans who don’t rely on Medicaid for their insurance coverage will feel the effects of this bill, especially in rural communities. For example, this year the state legislature heard from hospital administrators and healthcare providers who explained the impact Medicaid expansion has had on our state. It has allowed rural hospitals to add or expand specialty services like orthopedic surgery and mental health care. Without this funding, these services may disappear and that will affect all patients, not just those who are covered by Medicaid. Hospitals and other health care providers serve the rich and poor alike. When the money for poor people goes away, so do the therapists, nurses, and doctors that money paid for. If you lose funding to cover portions of health care professionals’ salaries, those positions go away completely because you can’t hire 60% of a doctor in a rural hospital. 
The bill is now before the Senate. Given the slim political margins there, Sens. Daines and Sheehy could cast deciding votes. Budgets are moral documents. Just a couple months ago, the state legislature decided the moral choice was to maintain a robust Medicaid program for Montana. Now Senators Daines and Sheehy must answer the same moral question. What will they do?",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Medicaid_3-1024x780.jpg,,,2025-05-31 07:03:42.948041

Brad Little signed an executive order establishing eight weeks of guaranteed paid leave for eligible employees of Idaho’s executive branch agencies following the birth or adoption of a child. In 2024, Little signed an executive order to provide eight weeks of parental leave to state employees who foster a child.

The trend has gathered steam in recent years. Some experts link it to the cascade of state abortion bans that followed the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2022 Dobbs decision, which dismantled the federal right to abortion. Under fire from critics to do more to care for babies once they’re born, at least a dozen conservative-led states with abortion bans have since granted or expanded paid parental leave for their state employees.
But others say the increasing bipartisan support for measures that help working parents is also a reaction to economic realities.
“What we’ve seen, especially in more conservative states, is the public sector has experienced a lot of turnover,” said Kameron Dawson, legal director of the Southern Office of A Better Balance, a legal organization focused on workplace rights. “They’re looking for tools to recruit younger employees.”
Paid parental leave is the time off granted to workers for the birth or adoption of a baby, to care for a child, or to recover from a stillbirth or miscarriage. Without it, employees are left to cobble together their sick leave and vacation leave — or go unpaid — to stay home with a child and heal.












We’re trying to attract and retain state employees and teachers, and we’re in competition with everyone around us, and the private sector as well.


– Alabama Republican state Rep. Ginny Shaver




Alabama Republican state Rep. Ginny Shaver watched her daughter, a public school teacher, struggle to get the leave she needed after the births of her children in recent years.
“With her second, she had complications in her pregnancy and used up her [paid vacation and sick] leave before she even had the baby,” Shaver told Stateline. Her daughter contracted COVID-19, and the baby had to spend time in neonatal intensive care. “It was a very difficult time, and she had to take unpaid leave.”
Last year, Shaver and Democratic state Sen. Vivian Figures worked to win approval of a paid parental leave bill for state employees. It failed.
But they tried again this year. With the support of Republican Gov. Kay Ivey, the state legislature — which has a Republican supermajority — passed it nearly unanimously. The new law gives female state employees, including teachers, eight weeks of paid parental leave in connection with birth, stillbirth or miscarriage, and gives male employees two weeks. Adoptive parents get eight weeks for one parent and two for the other.
Shaver said she thinks the law passed thanks to vocal support from the governor and increased awareness of the issue due to the work she and Figures did in previous sessions.
“And the fact that all of the southeast states around us offered it,” Shaver said. “We’re trying to attract and retain state employees and teachers, and we’re in competition with everyone around us, and the private sector as well.”
 Keeping talent in the workforce

For many Republicans, the workforce development argument for paid leave is a persuasive one. For states such as Alabama and South Carolina that have some of the lowest workforce participation rates in the nation, paid leave can be a tool to keep more people — particularly women — working. And it can be a way to retain educators as many states struggle with teacher shortages in K-12 schools.
“For several years we’ve seen state legislatures acknowledging the importance of child care to businesses and the economy,” said Feroza Freeland, policy director at the Southern Office of A Better Balance. “But in the last few years, we’ve seen a growing recognition that paid leave is another piece of that puzzle.”
States have taken up the issue because the federal government has not. The United States is a global outlier; among 38 peer nations, it’s the only one that doesn’t mandate paid parental leave, according to the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development. The group comprises 38 democracies with market-based economies.
The federal Family and Medical Leave Act, passed in 1993 and extended in 2020, only requires public agencies and companies with at least 50 employees to give up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for parents of newborns or newly adopted children, or caregivers of sick family members.

 GOP support

During his first term, President Donald Trump publicly supported some forms of paid family leave and signed a defense bill that gives 12 weeks of paid parental leave to most federal employees.
Paid family leave was a signature issue for his daughter Ivanka Trump, at the time a senior adviser to the president. She even held a paid leave and child care summit at the White House in late 2019.
That set the stage for other Republicans to take up the issue more publicly. And after the Dobbs decision, family-friendly policies have increasingly become conservative talking points in states with restrictive abortion laws.
After the Mississippi House unanimously passed a paid parental leave bill earlier this year, Republican House Speaker Jason White celebrated the bill as a reflection of Mississippi’s status as a “pro-life state.”
In a post on X this week announcing her signing of a new paid parental leave law, Iowa Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds called Iowa “a pro-family state.”
North Carolina was one of the first Southern states to grant paid parental leave to state workers in 2019 when then-Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, signed an executive order. In 2023, several months after the Dobbs decision, the state’s majority-Republican legislature extended paid parental leave to public school employees by tacking it onto a law banning most abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy.
Meanwhile, Indiana Republican Gov. Mike Braun signed an executive order in March to add up to eight additional weeks of paid leave for “childbirth recovery” to the state’s existing four weeks of paid parental leave.
 Running the gamut

The new laws won’t apply to most residents, because they only cover state employees. But they could have a downstream effect.
Shaver, the Alabama lawmaker, said she hopes her state’s new law will not only help the state be competitive with the private sector, but also set a precedent for other employers to follow.
“I hope they will see it’s in their benefit to offer what they can,” she said. “It may not be eight or 12 weeks, but even offering a reduced or flexible work schedule can help families.”
Just over a quarter of private-sector workers have access to paid family leave through their employer as of March 2023, according the most recent data from the U.S. Department of Labor.
Among the lowest-wage earners, that share drops to 6%.
State paid leave programs run the gamut in terms of what they offer. While Alabama’s new law offers up to eight weeks of leave for all state employees, including teachers, Mississippi’s offers six and does not require public schools to offer paid parental leave to their employees.
Iowa’s new law grants four weeks of paid leave for the birth or adoption of a child and one week of paid paternity leave. Tennessee’s law, passed in 2023, only offers paid leave to workers in the state’s executive and judicial branches.
But a few states are already expanding their offerings: Last year, Georgia legislators voted to double paid parental leave from three to six weeks.
And some states have gone further than just state employees: 13 states and the District of Columbia have mandated paid family leave for all workers, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center. Most of those states are located in New England or on the West Coast and all are Democratic-led. Ten more offer voluntary paid family leave statewide that’s provided through private insurance.
 Sandwich generation

Experts say the shift in attitude toward family-friendly policies can also be attributed to a generational shift.
“A lot of younger lawmakers are more willing to champion the issue of paid leave,” said Freeland, of A Better Balance. “They’re understanding it because they’re seeing it in their own lives, or seeing friends and family members going through this.”
In South Carolina, Bernstein’s bill faced some opposition from members of the state’s ultra-conservative Freedom Caucus and Family Caucus. Some lawmakers questioned the potential costs of the bill, or criticized it as government overreach.
South Carolina Republican state Rep. Josiah Magnuson, a member of the Freedom Caucus, said he believed the bill would be a financial burden on public school districts that could lead to raised taxes.
“You’re saying, let’s tax the people of South Carolina, most of whom don’t get paid parental leave, and give them to state employees who already have six weeks’ paid parental leave,” Magnuson told lawmakers in April before the House voted to pass the bill.
He also said he doesn’t like that the increased paid leave “puts the foot in the door a little more for the government to be involved in the home.”
The opposition frustrated Bernstein, who pointed out that the state’s 2022 law that granted six weeks of paid parental leave passed the legislature almost unanimously. This year’s bill expanding that leave passed the House but hasn’t seen movement in the Senate. It can be picked up again when the legislature returns in January.
Other South Carolina Republicans backed the bill, citing their own families’ experiences following the birth of their children, reported the South Carolina Daily Gazette.
More conservative states are also responding to the needs of “sandwich generation” employees who may be caring for aging parents as well as children, Freeland said.
Earlier this year, Tennessee became the first Southern state to expand its state paid leave policy beyond just parental leave. The state legislature voted almost unanimously to extend its six-week paid leave policy to cover state workers providing end-of-life care to a family member.
“We’re seeing a growing recognition that people need support for these types of family or caregiving needs,” said Freeland, “and that it strengthens the workforce and economy to be able to provide that.”

The old Kitty Clover building, as locals know it, has undergone a multimillion dollar renovation on its 3.5-acre site south of downtown. And a chunk of the 85,000-square-foot facility has been transformed into a co-working hub for artists.
Instead of 16,000 bags of chips daily, the building built in 1952 and rebranded as “Clover24” — a nod to its history and the main corridor on which it sits — is, at least for now, producing original thread paintings, pottery and other crafty products. 
 Boings, bowls, little people

Among the first 18 creative tenants is Diane Mattern, who kiddingly calls herself a “weird welder” whose work is seen regionally in the form of spiraled steel “boings” and other distinct concrete garden and indoor sculptures.
There’s Letha Goldsmith, an art therapist who uses magazine pages and glue to sculpt colorful bowls and containers and also incorporates figures of little people into various other art pieces.

Studio mate Amy Robertson’s creative bent is fiber art and thread painting, while neighbor comedian Todd Graves describes his multidisciplinary art forms as “unapologetically offbeat.”
They’re open for business in a structure that, for the first time in decades, offers a public-facing side. For example, a three-day open house and free inaugural group exhibition showing work of more than 90 local artists, including Therman Statom and Watie White, wraps up at 7 p.m. Saturday, May 31. 
Featured is Bart Vargas, whose art has been shown worldwide. His pieces will remain on display through July, along with work of other resident artists. 
Bob and Ilaamen Pelshaw, a husband-and-wife team that started and manages the artist co-working project, said they plan to host future events, in addition to opening doors daily for customers.
“We’re building community,” he said. “We want to celebrate the artists that live in the Omaha area.”
Ilaamen, herself an artist and illustrator with a studio at Clover24, said word quickly traveled, and the initial wave of available studios filled. 
“It shows demand,” she said.
 NE pandemic recovery funds 

The couple’s effort to offer a South Omaha spot where startups could create and show wares has had ups and downs. Their grand vision proposal was among 367 North and South Omaha applications vying a few years ago for a state grant from federal pandemic-related funds. The Nebraska Legislature earmarked and state officials awarded about $235 million for economic development projects for the areas disproportionately impacted by COVID-19.

State officials ultimately awarded the Pelshaw Group $50,000, much less than the $10 million requested. Those dollars have been directed toward a narrower slice of the plan, a job-preparedness program for Nebraskans transitioning from incarceration. 
The couple eventually turned to a different building site and a downsized plan, working now with Heinson Enterprises, which has owned the old Kitty Clover structure since the 1990s. A spokesman for the family-owned enterprise said it saw potentially new and greater use amid the growth of business, residential and recreational activity in and around the downtown of Nebraska’s largest city.
Artists who are situated mostly on the main level — in former administrative office suites turned studios that cover about 11% of the building — have signed leases that give them or the owner the right to terminate at any time, offering flexibility for both sides. 
“We’re in startup mode, testing the market to determine what is the highest and best use for the facility,” said spokesman Kyle Fowler. “They’re testing us out. We’re testing them out.”

Brokers Seth Campbell and Conner Dana of Campbell Dana Commercial Real Estate continue to seek one or more industrial users for the expansive lower level, and possibly a section of the main floor.
So far, the owners have invested roughly $4 million in a new roof, modern facade and building infrastructure. Depending on future uses, Fowler said, more renovations could be ahead.
The Pelshaws hope to add even more creative tenants, including a barber and a tattoo artist, and say the parking lot is an alluring amenity. They envision an outdoor sculpture garden starting with an uncommissioned J. Doe that will be adorned with historical mementos honoring the site’s previous chapters. 
 Slanted wall, industrial vibe 

While Ilaamen’s career launched in her homeland of Guatemala, it has advanced in Nebraska and during a three-year stint at long established Hot Shops Art Center in Omaha’s north downtown. Tenants consider Clover24 to be a mini version of Hot Shops, where artists feed off each other’s energy and often work collaboratively.

For Bob Pelshaw, who grew up in South Omaha, he hoped to provide a supportive and financially accessible space for area entrepreneurs. He recalls as a kid going outside and soaking in the smell of potato chips being made.
Both he and his wife said they appreciate the industrial vibe and unique spots throughout Clover24 that offer ways to be creative.
One of the studios has a slanted wall, interesting for hanging art. Another has curves for corners. There’s the “chip fryer gallery,” the “brick gallery” and an eclectic bathroom Ilaamen decorated with mashup portraits combining traits of art greats Andy Warhol and Bob Ross.
Said Ilaamen: “We want love in every corner, fun places everywhere you go.”

(Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Imagine you’re a veteran in Wheat Ridge, or a single mom in Lamar living with chronic pain. You’ve finally found something that works: a legal, plant-based supplement that helps you stay off opioids. But then, just as things start to stabilize, the state passes a law that could complicate how you access it.
That’s what just happened to thousands of Coloradans. On Thursday, Gov. Jared Polis signed Senate Bill 25-72 into law. We appreciate his commitment to public safety and consumer protection. But this law makes things more confusing, not safer. For the people who rely on kratom-derived products to manage pain or recover from addiction, it’s a major step backward.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
I’ve worked in public policy for over 20 years, and I represent the Holistic Alternative Recovery Trust (HART), a nonprofit advocating for science-based kratom regulation (to be clear, we don’t sell or profit from these products). We’ve been trying to get rules in place that protect consumers and reflect real-world use for years. This bill doesn’t get us closer to that goal.
Kratom is a plant-based supplement long used in Southeast Asia and now increasingly used here in Colorado. One of its natural compounds, 7-hydroxymitragynine, or 7-OH, is found in products that patients say have helped them avoid returning to painkillers or heroin. Especially in rural and low-income areas, where access to traditional treatment can be limited, these products can mean the difference between stability and relapse.
In 2022, Colorado’s own state feasibility study laid out a clear, science-backed path for regulating these products. It advocated setting dosage limits, requiring testing and labeling, and establishing strong oversight. But SB-72 doesn’t follow that roadmap. It was rushed through in the final days of the legislative session and now leaves Colorado with a fragmented and unclear system. Safe products could be sidelined while dangerous ones remain on shelves.
Consider the facts:

Claim: The bill bans unsafe high-potency products.
Reality: It doesn’t. The most dangerous products — high-mitragynine shots and kratom/kava blends — are still on shelves. Meanwhile, safer products made by responsible companies are pushed out.
Claim: It regulates 7-OH.
Reality: The law sets a 2% cap on 7-OH but excludes anything above that threshold from regulation altogether. That leaves patients, businesses, and law enforcement in regulatory limbo.
Claim: It adds safety and labeling rules.
Reality: The bill makes only minor changes for kratom and none for 7-OH, even though that’s often the compound patients rely on most.

There’s also been public discussion tying this bill to the tragic death of Daniel Bregger. We deeply respect his family and their advocacy. But the facts matter: At the time, 7-OH products were not commercially available. Using that tragedy to justify this law distracts from the real dangers SB-72 fails to address.
The law now excludes many 7-OH products from the definition of a “kratom product,” but offers no clarity on how they should be regulated. 7-OH remains legal in Colorado, but SB-72 creates confusion instead of guidance. That helps bad actors more than consumers. Retailers don’t know what they can sell, patients don’t know what they can trust, and law enforcement doesn’t know what to enforce.
We want regulation. In fact, the brands we work with already follow many of the rules this bill should have required, such as limiting dosage based on science, testing products, and labeling ingredients. These are basic protections. But SB-72 doesn’t ensure they’re followed by everyone. It’s a major missed opportunity.
Colorado has built a national reputation for bold, evidence-based leadership on cannabis, psychedelics, and public health. SB-72 doesn’t live up to that legacy.
But it’s not too late.
Let’s come back to the table, this time with patients in the room. We can still build a framework that’s clear, fair and focused on safety. Colorado can still lead. We just have to choose to.

(Max McCoy/Kansas Reflector)Each day now in Lawrence, where my family and I live, I watch the clouds roll in and the rains come.
The spring storm season thunders and flashes and pours, and the lawns flourish and gutters overflow. I sit here in my home office through the evenings and watch as the lightning casts strange shadows. I hear the rain pelting the roof. Later on, when I take our dog out for a walk, the rains have usually slowed and the neighborhood smells earthy and damp, while the doused roads shine under streetlamps.
During these days, my son hangs around the house. School has ended, and summer activities remain a few weeks distant. He plays video games and dotes on the pets. My husband’s work has shifted into its busiest season, so some days I only see him toward the end of the day.
I seem to live now, for a week or two at least, in a small protected bubble. The rains come and the world rumbles and my son and I stay indoors and wait for the storm to pass. Aren’t many of us doing that right now, staying in those kind of bubbles, waiting for the skies to clear? We can create those bubbles in different ways. Some of us watch seasons of old situation comedies, following the adventures of Sam and Diane and Cliff and Norm on Cheers (rest in peace, George Wendt). Some of us watch horror movies (I enjoyed Nicholas Roeg’s “Don’t Look Now” the other night). Some of us find escape through exercise or alcohol or other activities that change our brain and body chemistry.
It is the season of survival.
We endure the weather. It’s different for all of us. Here in Kansas, the weather might be a private prison company pressing to reopen facilities to serve Immigrations and Customs Enforcement. It might be a law that denies critical yet misunderstood health care to teenagers. It might be your immigration status if you study at a university. It might be an uncertain economic climate that threatens small business in towns and cities.
In uncertain times, we search for comparisons. We judge today’s storm against the storms of the past. We survived those, we tell ourselves, so surely we must survive these ones. Those storms may have even been worse, we tell ourselves. We should expect spring rains, Discover Magazine explains, as humid summer air collides with dry winter air. The mixture forms clouds, yields precipitation.
We still wait indoors, swaddled in decades-old quilts and drinking hot tea.
The metaphor strains. My correspondents will write me email messages insisting that determined Kansans can weatherproof their homes. We can work together to find community and purpose during these dreary, overcast days. We need not — must not — hide from the work ahead of us.
I understand these things, agree with them, have written them before. We can both endure and act. The stormy season will pass. These times will end. The clouds will clear and the sun will nudge itself above the horizon, and we will pick up the pieces. I will mow the lawn and pick up the random branches that fell from the giant tree in our front yard. Cleanup awaits, and it will take the whole subdivision pitching in.
Yet while spring storm season continues, at least let me have these gloomy evenings. Let me embrace poetry and fiction and imagination leaps. Grant me the time to recharge, to dote on my family, to enjoy distractions for a handful of days. We all deserve time to center ourselves, to feel protected from the inevitable deluge.
These moments of grace will steel us for a long, hot summer.

Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderGeorgia Democrats are calling for clarity in the state’s abortion law as the case of Adriana Smith continues to grab headlines worldwide.
Undiagnosed blood clots in Smith’s brain left the 30-year-old nurse brain dead months ago, but doctors have kept her organs functioning through medical devices. Family members told media outlets Smith’s body was being kept alive despite no chance for her to recover because she is pregnant and removing her from life support could violate the state’s ban on most abortions after six weeks.
Georgia’s top lawyer disagrees with that interpretation of the law.
  Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr speaks at the Georgia Chamber of Commerce’s Eggs and Issues event in Atlanta early in the 2025 legislative session. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
“There is nothing in the LIFE Act that requires medical professionals to keep a woman on life support after brain death,” Attorney General Chris Carr said in a statement. “Removing life support is not an action ‘with the purpose to terminate a pregnancy.’”
But a public statement does not come with the force of law, said Sen. Nabilah Islam Parkes, a Duluth Democrat, and when it comes to the practice of medicine, legal gray areas can lead to tragic outcomes.
Speaking at a press conference Thursday at the state Capitol, Islam Parkes called on Carr to issue a legally binding opinion to answer a series of questions she said would spell out when doctors could treat a pregnant woman in a way that could harm or kill the fetus: Is a hospital legally required to maintain a brain dead pregnant woman on life support? What precisely constitutes a medical emergency under the law? Under what conditions does a pregnancy meet the threshold of incompatibility with life? How does the law affect legal standing of advanced directives and end-of-life planning for pregnant Georgians?
“These questions are not theoretical,” Islam Parkes said. “They’re urgent, because as long as this law remains vague, we will continue to see families traumatized, providers criminalized and patients left behind. Doctors are being forced to make impossible choices, families are trapped in grief and fear and women are dying.”
Islam Parkes was referencing two high-profile deaths, Georgians Amber Thurman and Candi Miller, who both died in 2022 after suffering complications from taking abortion pills. Thurman died in a hospital after doctors waited nearly a day to perform a routine procedure to remove fetal tissue from her uterus; Miller died after family members said she was afraid to seek medical care because of the recently enacted law.
Democrats said there are likely more cases that do not end in death.
  Kaycee Maruscak said the pain of experiencing a miscarriage was exacerbated when she could not receive treatment for more than a week because doctors were skittish of potentially violating the state abortion law. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
of Gwinnett said she had already picked out a name for her unborn daughter, Sawyer Nicole Christian, but in March, a day after Maruscak held a gender reveal party, she discovered her daughter’s heart had stopped beating.
“In a matter of seconds, we went from preparing to welcome her into our lives to trying to figure out how to say goodbye,” she said at the Capitol press conference. “My doctor was sympathetic, but because of the restrictive abortion laws, my care was limited to a list of abortion clinics. No follow-up plan, no guidance and no support. Over the next two days, I called clinic after clinic, continuously having to repeat and relive that Sawyer did not have a heartbeat. My insurance recommended me to go to the emergency department because of increasing septic symptoms, so I did. I spent seven hours there in pain, in grief, and in shock, only to be discharged with no treatment, no resolution and no care.”
Maruscak said she spent more than a week carrying her daughter’s remains.
“What happened to me is not rare. It is not an outlier. It’s happening every day,” she said. “One in four women experience a miscarriage. Over half of them need medical intervention to complete it safely. This is not just a political issue, it’s a medical one.”
Senate Minority Leader Harold Jones made no bones about the party’s ultimate goal of repealing the six-week abortion ban, which went into effect in 2022 after the United States Supreme Court overturned the federal right to abortion and left the matter to states.
“As that fight continues, we must stand with and demand clarification from our governor and attorney general,” Jones said. “What rights do women have under this law? Georgians have been asking this question. We as legislators have been asking this question and the people standing here today have been asking this question, yet Georgia’s leadership has stayed silent.”
  Sen. Ed Setzler. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
The author of Georgia’s abortion bill, Acworth Republican Sen. Ed Setzler, accused Democrats of playing politics in an attempt to drum up headlines.
“My heart goes out to Adriana, her family, and the young son inside of her who is struggling for his life,” Setzler said. “Nabilah Islam Parkes and the Democrats are sickening at the depths they will go to drag Adriana’s hurting family, who is trying to save the life of their grandson, through a sick political debate about expanding abortion.”
“The Democrats are making attacks as loudly as they can to try to seize media attention,” he added.
Conservative radio host and Georgia Life Alliance board member Martha Zoller said tragic cases like Maruscak’s are not the result of the state’s abortion ban – sometimes referred to by supporters as the “heartbeat bill” – but of hospitals misunderstanding or misapplying it.
“Once you’ve had a miscarriage or you’re in the process of a miscarriage, there is no heartbeat, so there should be no reason for care to be withheld or anything like that,” she said. “That’s the over-legalization of the medical care business with not allowing providers to be providers and to do what’s best for patients. And that has nothing to do with the heartbeat bill. That has to do with the structure at the hospital. The care for a miscarriage is not denoted as something that’s a method of abortion in the heartbeat bill, and once you’ve had a miscarriage, there is no heartbeat, so the heartbeat bill doesn’t come into play.”
“It’s a travesty that the Democratic caucus continues to mislead women and scare them for their own political purposes,” she added.

Sears/Maryland Matters)When you wake up Sunday, it will be harder to collect damages from the state for child sexual abuse and easier to find relief at a pick-your-own farm, new rules will start the long process of slowing utility rate increases and a new law will again delay the start of a paid family and medical leave program
And chromite will be the official state mineral, a fact you can toast with the new official state cocktail, the orange crush.
Those are the most notable of just over 100 new laws that take effect on June 1, many of them duplicates. They range from local alcohol and bond bills to a severe retrenchment of a 2023 law on damages for victims of child sexual abuse that could have left the state open to billions in legal expenses.
It’s the first batch from the 849 bills from the 2025 General Assembly that have been signed into law, most of which will take effect on July 1 or Oct. 1.
But this first batch included some significant legislation, the most high-profile of which may have been House Bill 1378 which overhauls the Child Victims Act that passed to great fanfare just two years ago.
Racing to the courthouse to beat new law
Attorneys in and outside of Maryland spent the last week rushing to courthouses around the state to file claims for victims of institutional child sex abuse, working to beat the June 1 law that will cut potential awards in half and make it harder for victims to make multiple claims.
“Since this law was enacted by the legislature, even before the governor signed it, our firm has been devoting, — I’m not even exaggerating to say — probably about 80-plus percent of its time, energy efforts and resources, into getting these lawsuits filed,” said Emily Malarkey, a partner in the Baltimore firm Bekman, Marder, Hopper, Malarkey & Perlin.
In the last six weeks, Malarkey’s firm filed 50 lawsuits on behalf of 250 clients, just one firm among many representing potentially thousands of clients. One case came in at 10 p.m. Thursday, from an out-of-state firm that needed local attorneys to assist in filing.
“We’re exhausted,” Malarkey said. “It has been a Herculean effort, that was never our intended plan.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Those numbers are part of what drove lawmakers to pass the bill dramatically limiting a two-year old law that allowed victims who were otherwise barred from suing because of time limits to file civil lawsuits. The 2023 law created a scenario in which state and local governments could be on the hook for billions in potential liabilities.
Under the old law, damages were capped at $1.5 million per “occurrence” of abuse in a lawsuit against a private institution such as a school or church. In cases involving government entities, the cap was $890,000 per occurrence.
The new law slashes the caps as of June 1 — to $700,000 for private institutions and $400,000 for public institutions. And the “per occurrence” language goes away.
Lawmakers rushed to address the issue after legislative analysts warned in January that, under the old caps and with the potential of more than one occurrence per claimant, the cost to settle more than 3,100 cases that had been filed at the time could run into the billions. That would be troubling in good economic times, but the January warning came as the state was looking at an existing $3.3 billion structural deficit for fiscal 2026 and a similarly sized one for fiscal 2027.
The new law not only has financial consequences for victims. It could also limit the number of future cases, as lawyers consider whether they can afford to take on clients under the new caps.
“After June 1, it’s going to be really hard, I think, to find good representation, because not only did the legislature cut the cap, but the legislature cut the attorney fees that can be charged,” Malarkey said. “It’s going to be very difficult for businesses like mine to handle these complex, expensive, difficult cases stemming from decades ago, with dead witnesses and lost documents on a 20% contingency fee. We just can’t do it.”
Thousands of cases are pending in Maryland courts.
Malarkey said the vast majority — cases against the Archdiocese of Baltimore and the Department of Juvenile Services — will likely work their way through Baltimore City Circuit Courts. Prince George’s County courts will likely see the bulk of cases against from the Catholic Church’s Washington diocese. The rest, including cases against local schools and other institutions, will be heard in counties around the state.
What price power? New law doesn’t have quick answer
The Next Generation Energy Act that takes effect Sunday passed with just as much fanfare and will be felt by virtually every Marylander — but with none of the urgency of the Child Victims Act overhaul. The most immediate change, a rebate on people’s electric bills, won’t come before July.
In fact, the only noticeable change on June 1 is likely to be another increase in utility bills, while the law aimed at reining increases in grinds to life.

Senate Bill 937 and House Bill 1035 were part of a three-bill energy package touted by Democratic leaders in response to rising utility bills over the winter that blew up legislators’ phone lines and email inboxes with constituent complaints. The bills’ backers said the measures included short-, medium- and long-term solutions to complex issue of rising energy costs in Maryland.
The first change Marylanders will notice is the “Legislative Energy Relief Refund,” a credit averaging $80 per household that will be divided between bills next month and in January 2026. But the next round of rate increases is set to kick in after June 1.
Baltimore Gas & Electric customers got a break Thursday when the Maryland Public Service Commission ordered the utility to take next month’s expected $21 per month increase and spread it over several months, lowering the increase by $10 to $15 for the average household during the summer months. But rates will jump in September — overall, BGE customers will pay the same amount, but it will be spread out more evenly.
Customers of other utilities are likely to see increases between $4 and $18 per month, according to a report commissioned by the Maryland Office of People’s Counsel.
Meanwhile, most of the bill’s provisions will unfold farther into the future.
The law includes changes at the PSC meant to rein in utility spending, including on new natural gas infrastructure, and encourage the construction of new power sources and energy storage technology — all with the goal of slowing price increases for ratepayers.
It calls for the PSC to open a procurement window — in October — for generators of “dispatchable” energy, which must contribute a certain amount of reliable energy to the grid with lower greenhouse gas emissions than coal or oil, according to the bill. It could include new natural gas, an option that angered environmentalists. The PSC will open another procurement window in January, for battery storage technology.
Environmentalists were pleased that the bill removes a renewable energy subsidy from trash incinerators that generate power, long one of their goals.

	Republican critics said the bill will do little to bolster in-state power generation, and blamed Democrats for driving fossil fuel power plants out of business and pushing costly clean energy policies on utilities. In fact, experts say the rate increases are caused by a combination of factors, from rising energy demand, to policies of regional electric grid operator PJM, to utilities pursuing overzealous improvements to the natural gas system.
Another bill in the Democrats’ package, which takes effect July 1, prevents local governments from banning large solar panel facilities through zoning. House Bill 1036/Senate Bill 931 raised concerns in farming communities, who worry that productive farmland could be lost to solar panels, but it’s not clear they will be able to meet a weekend deadline to petition it to referendum.
The final bill, to set up an energy planning office focused on the state’s long-term energy picture, was vetoed by Gov. Wes Moore (D), who said that other offices do that already and that it was too costly.
Delay for FAMLI, disappointment for immigrants
At least one new law does nothing — for another 18 months. The Family and Medical Leave Insurance program was supposed to start on July 1, but House Bill 102 defers the start of the program until Jan. 1, 2027. And that’s just the date when payroll deductions and employer contributions would start to be collected for the programs, benefits for someone who needed to take time off for a family issue of a health emergency would not start to be paid out until Jan. 1, 2028.
It is the third time the program start date has been pushed back since the FAMLI law was approved by lawmakers in 2022. Passage of the bill was a bitter pill for advocates, who said family emergencies can’t wait 18 months. Moore administration officials said the delay was unfortunate. But they also said that with the state facing a $3 billion budget deficit at the start of this year, and with continued uncertainty coming out of Washington under the  Trump administration, another delay was the only prudent thing to do.

The Maryland Values Act, meanwhile, does something, but it’s a lot less than its backers had hoped. As drafted, House Bill 1222 would have prohibited “287(g)” agreements, under which local police can essentially act as immigration agents, detaining people on suspicion of immigration violations and holding them for federal agents. A handful of sheriff’s departments in the state have entered into 287(g) agreements with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
Senators stripped out the 287(g) language from the House bill and the Senate was not budging as the clock ticked down on the session. With literally minutes left in the 2025 General Assembly session, the House relented.
The final version of the Maryland Values Act has nothing on 287(g) but does add protections against release of immigrants’ personal records and other data the state holds. It also includes language to help “sensitive locations” — churches, schools, hospitals and the like — respond should federal agents show up. Those locations had been off limits to immigration enforcement under the Biden administration, but that restriction was quickly lifted under the Trump administration.
Studying guns in schools, more
House Bill 782 requires a thorough assessment of guns in the state’s public high schools and middle schools, and report on the best way to detect the presence of guns in schools and the best way to report such information to police. The law will take effect just days after the first-degree murder conviction Friday of Jaylen Rushawn Prince, 16, in the shooting death of 15-year-old Warren Curtis Grant in a bathroom at Joppatowne High School on Sept. 6, 2024, according to news reports.
The bill, originally sponsored by Del. Vanessa Atterbeary (D-Howard), calls on the Maryland Center for School Safety, a unit within the Maryland Department of Education, to meet with members of every local school system in the state and evaluate the security infrastructure currently in place. The center will also be required to evaluate “widely accepted” methods that are available but not currently used by school systems, analyze software that can be integrated with security cameras and study the use of metal detectors, even handheld devices, at school entrances.
The center will have to present an interim report to legislative leaders as well as to the Senate Education, Energy and the Environment Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee by Dec. 1, 2025. A final report would be due by Dec. 1, 2026.
Other bills that become laws June 1 include:

Senate Bill 376 will require the Maryland Department of Health to regularly report to the legislature on the progress it has made to reduce a significant backlog of required annual nursing home inspections. Under the new law, the department will need to start providing quarterly reports to lawmakers on the progress of nursing home inspections, and the Office of Health Care Quality will have to report to local jurisdictions every six months on the progress of inspections in their individual counties.
Motorists using Interestate 83 in Baltimore will have to watch their speeds. House Bill 913, passed earlier this year, authorizes doubling the number of automated speed-monitoring devices on the city portion of the highway from two to four cameras.
For bills that ended up passing both chambers unanimously, lawmakers spent an inordinate amount of floor time — and offered an inordinate number of bad puns — for Senate Bill 544 and House Bill 559, the agritourism porta-potty bills. When the new law takes effect June 1, it will allow certain wineries, farm breweries and farms engaged in “agritourism” — like pick-your-own fields and corn mazes — to meet the requirement for on-site lavatory facilities by providing portable toilets with soap and water and located at least 25 feet from any wells.

And finally… chromite! And an orange crush
Two new state symbols — an official state mineral and a cocktail — join the list of about two dozen that includes official state sports, dogs, cats and dinosaurs, among others.
Chromite, a commercially valuable mineral first discovered in Baltimore County in the early 1800s, has become the official state mineral with the enactment of House Bill 411. The effort was a passion project for David Shore, who first testified on the bill nearly a decade ago. Now, at age 18, Shore’s effort not only passed the House and Senate but landed on the desk of the governor.
And the rising tide for chromite lifted another state symbol effort.
In the waning hours of the 2025 session, a bill making the orange crush — a vodka and juice drink invented in Ocean City — the official state cocktail was going nowhere. But as lawmakers were finishing their work, a late amendment in the House added Orange Crush to Senate Bill 764, the Senate’s version of the chromite bill. Senators concurred before the final gavel fell, and Maryland got an official state cocktail to go with its official mineral.

(Maryland Matters file photo)In his coverage of the downgrade of Maryland’s credit rating by Moody’s from the coveted AAA to AA1, Bryan Sears pointed to Moody’s acknowledgement of Maryland’s “wealthy and diverse economy,” solid financial planning and proactive management by officials, including slowing expenditures and raising new funds.
But the report also noted that Maryland was particularly vulnerable to “shifting Federal policies and employment” in comparison to other states with triple-A ratings: Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah and Virginia.
In plain-speak, Maryland’s administration was well equipped to handle any organic financial issues arising from budgetary deficits, and/or ambitiously funded programs. But our reliance on federal jobs meant that no one could foresee or plan for such eventualities.

Among all the states with a triple-A rating, Maryland’s economy is the only one which is dominated by the government sector. Being a small state and adjacent to the nation’s capital, Maryland’s largest source of income is income tax. Almost one in 10 Maryland workers is a federal employee. The only variable NOT in control of the state administration is the employment of federal workers.
It isn’t hard to see the connection.
Republican delegates and senators who tout Moody’s warnings about Maryland’s rating prior to this current federal administration taking charge are forgetting that the programs with high price tags, like the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future, were hit because of the COVID-19 economy.
We barely had time to come up to the surface to take a breath of air before being submerged again by this second Trump administration! The GOP needs to take a hard look at themselves, and their blind obeisance to the walking body of malfeasance they regard as their president.
Here is the bottom line: Moody’s downgraded Maryland’s credit rating because, despite the Moore administration’s best efforts, they could not fix the damage done by DOGE and their dismantling of federal government.
Maryland, D.C. and Virginia have the maximum number of federal employees – both Maryland and D.C. had their ratings downgraded. Virginia is a much larger state and has other economic avenues to offset the loss of federal jobs, even though it, too, has taken a substantial hit to its economy.
Blame, if it is to be assigned, lies with the Trump administration and its hatchet approach to federal infrastructure. Believe me, the damage goes far beyond a credit rating — the United States will be feeling the effects of this sabotage for decades to come.

Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerMONTPELIER — After a drawn-out day of disagreements and false starts, the Vermont Legislature bailed on its plan to wrap up business for the year on Friday, failing to come to a deal, at least for now, on this year’s landmark education reform bill.So strained were the talks, the House and Senate couldn’t even immediately agree on when negotiations would continue.The Senate gaveled out for the night shortly after 11 p.m. Senate President Pro Tempore Phil Baruth, D/P-Chittenden Central, told his colleagues that coming to an agreement needed more time, and the Senate would instead gavel back in at 2 p.m. Saturday.“We’re going home now,” Baruth said. Soon after, around 11:30 p.m., the House adjourned until Monday at noon. From there, House Speaker Jill Krowinski, D-Burlington, said the chamber would be holding brief sessions without taking any actions, known as “token sessions,” until mid-June. That’s when legislators had previously penciled in to hold votes to override potential vetoes by Gov. Phil Scott.  “We’ve been putting compromises on the table all day, trying to find a path forward,” Krowinski said in an interview after ending her chamber’s business for the night. “This is a top priority for this legislative session, and we have to get it right. And at the end of the day, everyone was feeling like it needed more time.”Legislative leaders said they expect the joint House and Senate panel hashing out the education bill, H.454, to continue meeting in the coming weeks, though the schedule was not immediately clear.Both chambers signed off on a handful of other bills Friday, including sweeping housing legislation that would set out a program to finance infrastructure around new developments, a bill that would make it harder for neighbors to sue farmers over impacts the farm may have on their properties, and other bills on motor vehicles, cannabis and drug price caps.However, the outcome leaves the session’s highest-profile work unfinished. Following an election where property tax rates drove voters, leading to a wave of Republican victories in the House and Senate, Democratic legislative leadership pledged to heed voters’ call for a more affordable education system. Yet four months in, the path toward that future state remained murky.The parties began Friday closer than they ended it. Early in the day, the House and Senate conference committee members appeared to reach some tentative agreements on H.454. But as the hours wore on, negotiations — at least in public — faltered. The committee had been unable to lock in key details. Left unsettled was which funding formula to use, what to do about school choice and private schools and how to limit spending before school districts consolidate down the road. Meetings of the conference committee — three senators and three house members — were continuously postponed. Legislators and legislative staff scrambled in and out of rooms. Lobbyists lingered in the halls. As the conference committee drifted further and further from either chamber’s original position, the possibility of explaining the hugely complex and fast-changing piece of legislation to 180 lawmakers looked near-impossible. The vast majority of lawmakers dawdled as the conference committee worked in fits and starts, with people playing cards and sipping drinks throughout the Statehouse. The House, Senate and Scott have made education reform the year’s key issue. All three parties agreed on the need to consolidate school districts and transition the state to a new funding formula. But for months, the parties have reached little consensus on the intricacies and the timeline of that generational transformation. Baruth had told his chamber around 10 p.m. that agreement still looked possible.“It’s frustrating,” he said on the floor, describing the delay, “but the way I think about it is, your constituents and my constituents sent us here for this night because they want us to do our work, they want us to finish it up, pay strict attention and then be done and go home.”That proved overly optimistic.Read the story on VTDigger here:  With education bill at an impasse, Vermont Legislature kicks the can on adjournment.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/education-conference-4-20250530-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-05-31 01:01:26.306052

We reject the idea that there’s only so much to go around—especially when the numbers show otherwise.,"With just a few days left in this year’s legislative session, residents are waiting with bated breath to see whether the Connecticut legislature steps up and delivers a bold budget that invests in core programs, protects workers, tenants,  and immigrants, and meets the needs of our communities – or falls back on tired excuses and political theater.
Let’s be clear: Connecticut has the money.
It’s not because Governor Lamont can’t; it’s because he won’t.
We’ve heard it before: that supporting one group of workers must come at the expense of another; that if we fund fair contracts, we can’t fund public education; that if we invest in healthcare, we have to cut services somewhere else. But this is a false and dangerous narrative, and we will not allow it to divide us.
Nursing home and group home workers with SEIU 1199NE have exhibited bravery and determination in their contract fight and as a result have won state funding to support raises. But those purple shirts are still showing up at the State Capitol because this represents just one chapter of their fight.
People are multidimensional: they are workers, immigrants, parents, students, taxpayers, and more. We cannot silo issues just like we cannot silo people. Efforts to divide us only distract from the real issue: the Gov. Ned Lamont’s refusal to tax the wealthiest Connecticut residents or modify fiscal policies to reflect current realities.
We reject the idea that there’s only so much to go around—especially when the numbers show otherwise.
The state is sitting on a projected $2.3 billion surplus—the second largest in state history— and our Rainy Day Fund remains full. Meanwhile, our wealthiest residents and corporations continue to reap the economic benefits of our upside-down tax structure.
If Governor Lamont declares extraordinary circumstances, modifies the fiscal roadblocks and supports progressive taxation, our communities won’t just survive attacks from the federal government, but thrive in the face of adversity.
All year, thousands of advocates have testified, emailed, called and rallied, sharing the human stories that should be driving our budget process: Stories of students whose schools are facing millions in deficits; of looming layoffs to immigrant families left vulnerable by Governor Lamont’s veto threats on key protections in the TRUST Act; of workers facing stagnant wages and rising costs.
Faith, labor and community leaders have been clear about the robust investments that are needed across various issue areas. We cannot let proponents of the fiscal roadblocks use the victory of one group of workers as an excuse to cut other sectors. This narrative is not only divisive but also misleading. It pits one essential public service against another, ignoring the broader fiscal context and the state’s capacity to invest in all its communities.
This isn’t about choosing between students and nurses, or workers and services. It’s about whether we continue to govern by fear and austerity —or choose to invest in the future we all deserve.

The state Senate on Friday evening appeared likely to debate well into the night the details of what would be, if passed, the most significant piece of housing legislation to emerge from the Connecticut legislature in years.
House Bill 5002, which narrowly passed the House earlier this week after nearly 12 hours of debate, takes on zoning, parking policy and homelessness. It aims to increase housing supply, cut down on rent prices and encourage use of public transit, among other measures.
Over the past few years, housing costs have risen across the country. Homelessness has increased, and a recent study said Connecticut has the most constrained housing market in the nation.
“Housing is one of the biggest concerns when we knock on doors and talk with our constituents, every town hall, everything we hear is how housing is too scarce, it’s too expensive,” said Housing Committee co-chair Sen. Martha Marx, D-New London.
Housing has long been a politically difficult issue in Connecticut. It’s growing harder for many families to afford to live in the state, and advocates say the state needs to do more to push zoning reform and other policies to make housing cheaper.
But Republicans, some moderate Democrats and opponents of H.B. 5002 say they think control of these issues should remain with local government.
Sen. Rob Sampson, R-Wolcott, who has been a vocal opponent of many of the ideas in the bill, questioned the existence of a housing crisis during debate Friday.
“If there is a housing shortage, it’s simply based on the fact that there’s not enough affordable listings for housing available out there in the marketplace,” he said, saying it’s “either not being advertised, or it’s not being made available by the people that possess it.”
He said there would be a housing crisis if there wasn’t enough housing for the population, and Connecticut hasn’t seen much population growth in recent years.
Experts and economists say housing shortages are more complicated than that. The market needs vacancies in order to keep costs down, and even when there is not population growth, there can be household growth as children get older and leave their parents’ homes.
Leaders on Friday said it seemed likely some Democrats would side with Republicans voting against the bill, and it could be a narrow margin for passage.
Planning and zoning
One policy in the bill, which drew political angst, is known as “Towns Take the Lead,” which is similar to fair share measures proposed in past sessions.
The proposal divides housing need among towns based on regional need and assigns each town a set number of units to plan and zone for, with those proposals required to be included in their 8-30j plans, which are due every five years. 
It uses a formula to determine how many units of affordable housing towns need to plan and zone for, with a general goal to increase housing stock and cut down on segregation. The bill contains some other specifications for the housing, including requirements to build units for families and for certain income levels.
Under the bill language, towns can contest their assigned numbers and tell the legislature how many units they think they can accommodate, and lawmakers will approve or deny the towns’ proposals.

The legislation also includes Gov. Ned Lamont’s proposal to offer towns easier pathways to moratoriums under 8-30g. The decades-old housing law offers developers court remedies if their affordable housing proposals are denied, unless it’s for a reason of health or safety.
Towns can get moratoriums under the law by showing they’re making progress toward increasing their percentage of designated affordable housing and are exempt from the law if at least 10% of their housing stock is designated affordable.
Lamont’s proposal allows municipalities to establish a “priority housing development zone” that set a minimum density of four units per acre for single-family housing, six for duplexes or townhouses and 10 for multi-family housing.
The zones allow this type of development “as of right,” or without a special hearing before the local planning and zoning commission. Towns that adopt these zones have easier pathways to moratoriums under 8-30g.
It’s a controversial proposal among housing advocates who oppose changes to 8-30g and say too many adjustments could render the law ineffective.
The bill also aims to get towns to increase residential density near train and bus stations by prioritizing certain infrastructure funding for towns that establish “transit-oriented districts,” where certain development is allowed as of right before the planning and zoning commission.
The bill, known as Work, Live, Ride, and pushed by advocacy group Desegregate Connecticut aims to increase the housing stock and encourage people to use public transportation, which advocates say is good for the environment.
Opponents say the prioritization of funding means that towns that don’t participate in the program could risk losing funding they need for roads and bridges.
Town requirements
The bill bans minimum off-street parking requirements for certain residential developments. This allows developers to cut down on building costs by not adding as many parking spaces. 
Advocates say removing parking minimums allows more housing to be built in areas that may already have sufficient street parking or are close to public transportation. Meanwhile, opponents say it weakens local control and runs the risk that developers will ignore parking needs.
The bill requires towns to allow developers to convert commercial buildings to residential with nine or fewer units without a special hearing before the planning and zoning commission.
Planning and Development Committee co-chair Sen. MD Rahman, D-Manchester, said it will use office space and other commercial areas that have been empty since the COVID-19 pandemic. Opponents say it will usurp local control.
H.B. 5002 also includes a couple of measures to help the unhoused population. It bans towns from using so-called “hostile architecture” on public property. Hostile architecture is an urban design architecture in which certain public structures are designed to discourage behaviors such as sleeping or lying down in public. It often comes in the form of spiked surfaces under bridges, narrow benches or rocks strewn across grassy areas.
Homelessness has been increasing over the past few years in Connecticut, and as shelters reach capacity, more people are forced to stay outside.

The bill also expands the number of fair rent commissions in Connecticut, mandating that any town with a population of 15,000 or more establish a commission, which are local bodies empowered to hear and make legally binding rulings on landlord-tenant issues such as complaints about unfair rent increases or housing conditions.
This year’s bill requires an additional 32 towns to have fair rent commissions and allow towns to establish regionalized commissions through their local councils of government, according to 2023 population estimates.
Supporters say the commissions help make sure rent increases aren’t excessive. Opponents fear that small towns may struggle to find people to volunteer to be members of the commissions.
If passed, the bill next heads to Lamont’s desk for his approval.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2025_0530_SR_Session_280-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-30 23:58:59.304280

CHICAGO — Federal prosecutors are asking for a lengthy 12 ½-year prison sentence for former Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan, calling the longtime Democratic power broker “steeped in corruption” and alleging he lied on the witness stand when he testified in his own defense earlier this year.

In their 72-page filing Friday evening, prosecutors also called for a $1.5 million fine in addition to prison time for the 10 corruption charges — including bribery — on which Madigan was convicted in February.

“The crimes charged and proven at trial demonstrate that Madigan engaged in corrupt activity at the highest level of state government for nearly a decade,” prosecutors wrote in their sentencing memorandum. “Time after time, Madigan exploited his immense power for his own personal benefit by trading his public office for private gain for himself and his associates, all the while carefully and deliberately concealing his conduct from detection.”

But in a competing filing published to the court docket two hours later, Madigan’s attorneys argued the former speaker should only serve five years’ probation, including a year of home detention followed by community service.

Madigan is scheduled to be sentenced June 13.

Along with Madigan’s legal arguments for no prison time, his attorneys also filed hundreds of pages of character letters asking U.S. District Judge John Blakey for leniency in sentencing, upon which Madigan’s lawyers bolstered their request.

“Throughout his 83-year life, Mike quite literally changed the lives of tens of thousands of people in his district on the south side of Chicago,” Madigan’s filing stated. “He positively impacted millions of people throughout the State of Illinois. The more than 200 letters submitted on Mike’s behalf demonstrate that this is not hyperbole.”

Madigan, who stepped away from public life in early 2021 as the feds’ investigation swirled around his inner circle, spent five decades in the Illinois House, including 36 as House speaker — the longest tenure of any legislative leader in the country. He also spent 23 years as head of the state’s Democratic Party, granting him even more power over Illinois’ political landscape.

Split verdict

After three months of testimony from more than 60 witnesses and dozens of hours of secretly recorded audio and video, a jury convicted Madigan on 10 of 23 counts he was facing. But jurors acquitted the former speaker on seven counts and deadlocked on another six, including an overarching racketeering charge.

The former speaker’s convictions involved alleged bribery from electric utility Commonwealth Edison, which hired five of the speaker’s allies on no-work contracts at various times from 2011 and 2019 — an eight-year period during which ComEd was pushing for major legislation in the General Assembly. The jury also convicted Madigan on supporting counts related to an alleged scheme to help get Chicago alderman-turned-FBI mole Danny Solis appointed to a lucrative state board position, though he was acquitted of the bribery charge pertaining to the same alleged scheme.

Some of the trial’s most dramatic moments came in January, when Madigan made the stunning decision to testify in his own defense. The high-risk move opened him up to blistering cross-examination from lead prosecutor Amarjeet Bhachu, who left the U.S. Attorney’s office in March and isn’t a party to sentencing recommendations.

Over two days, Bhachu sparred with the former speaker, and weeks later he and his colleagues quoted Madigan’s testimony back to the jury during closing arguments in an attempt to prove he’d lied on the witness stand.

Prosecutors leaned on that alleged perjury once more in Friday’s sentencing memorandum, counting his “obstructive conduct” as a key justification for their sentencing recommendation.

“Madigan has expressed no remorse for his crimes, nor has he acknowledged the damage wrought by his conduct,” prosecutors wrote. “Indeed, Madigan went so far as to commit perjury at trial in an effort to avoid accountability, and he persists in framing his actions as nothing more than helping people.”

Madigan repeatedly claimed — and his attorneys repeatedly argued — that he was ignorant of the fact that the collective $1.3 million his allies earned from their ComEd contracts was for performing no work. Instead, the former speaker and his lawyers framed those contracts as the result of mere job recommendations, which they argued was a core component of Madigan’s job as speaker.

But as a result of Madigan’s testimony, U.S. District Judge John Blakey reversed a pre-trial decision and allowed prosecutors to play a damning wiretapped phone call for the jury in which Madigan laughed about ComEd contractors having “made out like bandits.” In the call, the former speaker’s co-defendant, longtime Springfield lobbyist Mike McClain, laughed, too, replying, “for very little work.”

Prosecutors cited that call in its Friday filing as evidence the former speaker wasn’t forthcoming when he ""testified that McClain never said he believed or suspected that any of the people that Madigan had referred to ComEd were not working.”

“This testimony was a lie,” the feds wrote in their filing.

Prosecutors also ripped Madigan’s attempts on the witness stand to distance himself from McClain, his longtime close friend and advisor, which the feds said “completely undermined” the former speaker’s “credibility as a witness.”

“The multitude of recorded conversations, emails, and documents presented at trial established a uniquely close and longstanding relationship of mutual dependence between Madigan and McClain and demonstrated that Madigan was lying when he tried to distance himself from his key operative,” prosecutors wrote.

“Madigan assigned McClain, and only McClain, to carry out the most sensitive assignments and requests and to engage in the most potentially politically explosive conversations when Madigan wanted bad news delivered, including to legislators who served under Madigan.”

The jury in February deadlocked on all six counts pertaining to McClain, but he faces his own sentencing in July on charges related to the ComEd bribery scheme after a jury in May 2023 convicted him and three other ex-utility executives and lobbyists for their roles.

Plea for leniency

Of the more than 200 letters filed Friday with Madigan’s legal arguments for a non-custodial sentence, many came from former constituents or other Illinoisans who wrote about how the former speaker helped them in some way.

Letters also came from prominent faith leaders across the state, 40 former staffers, prominent labor leaders and three dozen former elected officials, among them several Republicans like former Gov. Jim Edgar. Attorneys also included an op-ed in support of Madigan penned by former GOP Gov. Jim Thompson before his death in 2020.

All four of Madigan’s children wrote lengthy letters, including former Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan, whom the former speaker adopted after marrying her mother Shirley in 1976. In addition to writing about how Madigan operated in the world of Illinois government and politics that her adoptive father introduced her to, Lisa Madigan’s letter highlighted what the former speaker’s attorneys called “a key consideration” for Madigan’s sentencing: his wife’s health.

“Mike keeps my mother alive,” Lisa Madigan wrote in her letter, which said Shirley Madigan suffers from “a severe lung disease” and has “rarely been well enough to leave the house” in the last five years since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, as she’s “extremely susceptible to infections” and has been hospitalized three times.

“She is able to remain in their house primarily because of the care my father provides,” Lisa Madigan wrote. “He shops for groceries, brings her food (as you heard during the trial), does laundry, and generally takes care of her and their house.”

Lisa Madigan was referring to a lighthearted moment on one of the wiretapped calls played for the jury in which the then-speaker read a menu of soup options to his wife over the phone.

Madigan’s attorneys wrote that even “one day of imprisonment” for Madigan “will upend her (Shirley’s) entire life.”

“Mike presence is medically necessary to provide the direct assistance, supervision, and emotional support required to maintain Shirley’s well-being in a familiar home environment, which is paramount for patients with Shirley’s conditions,” the filing said, going on to refer to Madigan as Shirley’s “caretaker.”

The former speaker’s lawyers also referred to Madigan’s own age as a mitigating factor for sentencing, though leaned more heavily on kneecapping prosecutors’ arguments that a 12 ½-year sentence would serve as a deterrent.

“The defendant respectfully submits that a sentence of imprisonment would be greater than necessary to protect the public or deter him from criminal conduct,” the filing read. “Mike does not pose a risk of committing new crimes. He will never hold public office again.”

Madigan’s attorneys went on to detail “intense public embarrassment for (the former speaker) and his family,” which they argued “is a significant punishment in and of itself.” They also claimed the former speaker’s grandchildren “are teased at school” because of Madigan’s criminal case.

“As one example, Mike was publicly compared to a mob boss,” Madigan’s filing read. “Politicians also continue to use Mike as a cheap political shot, without any regard for his history of good works and positive impact on Illinois. ... He will also live the rest of his years as a felon.”

Other notable letter-writers on Madigan’s behalf included former U.S. Sen. Carol Moseley Braun, former Illinois Supreme Court Justice Tom Kilbride, Democratic mega- fundraisers Michael Sacks and Fred Eychaner and Chicago Bulls and White Sox owner Jerry Reinsdorf. While many former Democratic allies of Madigan penned appeals to Judge Blakey, only a few currently hold office — among them state Reps. Marcus Evans, D-Chicago, and Curtis Tarver, D-Chicago, along with Auditor General Frank Mautino.

Several authors of Madigan’s character letters had testified in trial, including his former law partner Vincent “Bud” Getzendanner, whose time on the witness stand was spent trying to explain the ethical firewall the Madigan & Getzendanner real estate law firm had with official state business.

In his letter, Getzendanner joked that he was “pretty sure” Madigan was “only human” and also poked a hole in the longtime Springfield mythology Madigan’s daily lunchtime apple, which he said demonstrated the former speaker’s “famous willpower.”

“Strangely enough, on many occasions I subsequently found an unexplained residue of chocolate chip cookie crumbs on his plate,” Getzendanner wrote, later apologizing to the judge for his sense of humor.

The bill now heads to the House and, if passed into law, would create a groundbreaking new fund for early childhood education that draws from surplus funds, with up to $300 million invested each year. Also included in the bill are new supports related to special education for school districts, teachers and students.
Advocates cheered and legislators embraced on Friday night after the passage of Senate Bill 1, calling it a major step forward in a state where the too-small and underfunded early childhood education sector has made it difficult for working families, especially mothers, to pay for and even find quality infant, toddler and pre-K programming for their kids.
Advocates of the bill include Gov. Ned Lamont, who pledged in February to make a game-changing investment in early childhood, drawing on surplus funds. At the time, Lamont was focused on creating a universal pre-K fund. S.B. 1 represents a more wide-ranging effort to create not just free or low-cost pre-K but also slots for infant and toddler care, something that advocates and educators say is sorely needed.
Office of Early Childhood Commissioner Beth Bye said Friday that the governor was feeling great about the bill.
“The governor was very flexible with that (infant and toddler spots),” Bye said, “because he knows that’s a big challenge, too.” 
Under the plan, families making up to $100,000 a year would pay nothing for the child care services, which would be run through Early Start programs, while families making more than $100,000 a year would pay no more than 7% of their annual income, with no income limit. The bill would also improve salaries for workers in those centers so that they’re more in line with public school teacher salaries and includes a health care subsidy program for those workers.
As the Senate prepared to vote on the bill, President Pro Tem Martin M. Looney, D-New Haven, discussed a report from Dalio Education on “disconnected youth” as a motivator. Looney said, “so many of our children come to kindergarten unprepared to be there,” and then experience humiliation when they realize they are already behind their peers. He said that sets them on a path toward disconnection from school down the road, whereas the proposed bill would create a chance to come to school prepared for success.
Sen. Ceci Maher, D-Wilton, who is co-chair of the Committee on Children, celebrated the bill’s passage. 
“I’m so excited about this transformational bill, for parents, for providers, for advocates, for everyone who has had a hand in this, from the governor to OPM to the office of the treasurer, to the legislature,” she said. “It means we are making a permanent investment in the future of child care in our state, and it is the first state in the union to do this.”
Maher said what distinguishes Connecticut from states like Vermont and New Mexico, which have also made investments in early childhood education, is that Connecticut is taking a holistic approach to trying to make improvements throughout the system, from provider pay to creating more spaces. “It will change the nature of child care in Connecticut,” she said.
But critics of the bill argued that the state would be violating its fiscal guardrails in using surplus money to pay for it all. Sen. Eric Berthel, R-Watertown, and Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield, attempted and failed to pass an amendment to the bill that would have used money from the general fund instead of surplus funds. Harding argued that in using surplus funds, legislators were being dishonest with their constituents.
“You’re telling your constituency, ‘Well, legally we can do this within the guardrails,’ but you know as we all know that it violates the spirit of why the guardrails are there,” he said.
Harding said that the surplus should only go toward one of two things: the rainy day fund or paying down the state’s debt. “If we can’t find $40 million as a priority in a multibillion dollars budget toward early childhood and early education initiatives, I think our priorities are lost,” he said.
But the bill’s transformational aspirations rely on using surplus funds, and socking them away into an endowment that would grow over time. As time goes on, 10% of those funds could be used each year, an ever-larger sum as the fund continues to build. 
While there may have been disagreement earlier in the session about the best path forward to address the early childhood education crisis, the smiles, handshakes and cheers from lawmakers and advocates who had once championed different bills showed unity. 
“This is the result of a long, constructive set of negotiations to try and get to something that really works,” said Merrill Gay, the executive director of the CT Early Childhood Alliance.
“It’s amazing, said Eva Bermúdez Zimmerman, the coalition director of Child Care for CT, “and next year we’ll be back to ask for more money.”
The bill also includes supports for special education, which Sen. Sujata Gadkar-Wilcox, D-Trumbull, said respond to feedback collected by the Select Committee on Special Education, which she co-chairs. 
The bill includes a $10 million grant to create better special education programming in some districts so that students don’t have to travel out of district. And it requires programs to send out notifications when staffing changes, like substitute teachers, last more than 10 school days — disruptions that can have a big impact on special education students. It also creates an educational ombudsman who would help mediate issues that arise when families are having trouble accessing services. The special education provisions in the bill complement those in House Bill 5001.
“Education has to be a priority for Connecticut, we are building our future,” Gadkar-Wilcox said. From early childhood to special education to higher education, “we need to think about how these pieces are interconnected.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2025_0530_SR_Session_148-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-30 23:00:43.612625

“For one person to stand in the way of it is, really, unacceptable,” said Secretary of State Sarah Copeland Hanzas, a key proponent of the election legislation.

Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerMONTPELIER — A bill that would make a host of changes to the state’s election laws, including an expansion of who must file campaign finance disclosures, appeared to be facing dim prospects Friday — even though the House approved the legislation in March.The reason the bill, H.474, hadn’t yet advanced in the Senate, on what could be the final day of this year’s legislative session?“He’s right there,” Vermont Secretary of State Sarah Copeland Hanzas told VTDigger at the Statehouse Friday afternoon, pointing at Senate President Pro Tempore Phil Baruth, D/P-Chittenden Central, as he walked by in a hallway.According to the secretary, Baruth told Rutland Republican Sen. Brian Collamore, chair of the Senate Government Operations Committee, which has been reviewing the elections bill, not to advance it to the floor unless the House Government Operations Committee advanced another, unrelated bill — a Burlington charter change proposal on which Baruth is the primary sponsor.Rep. Matt Birong, D-Vergennes, said the House panel he chairs didn’t have the votes to pass out the Burlington bill, S.131, which would ban guns from bars and other venues that serve alcohol in the city.  The Senate passed the measure last month, though Gov. Phil Scott has signaled he does not support it.“We were told that the (elections) bill would not move until the Burlington charter” advanced in the House, Birong said in an interview Friday on the House floor.Baruth also lives in Burlington and represents the city in the Senate.Asked about Copeland Hanzas and Birong’s comments Friday evening, Baruth said, “I wouldn’t repeat private conversations” and contended that he “wouldn’t link” the charter change with the elections bill.Secretary of State Sarah Copeland-Hanzas speaks about small donation campaign finance reform during a press conference at the Statehouse in Montpelier on June 18, 2024. File photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerBaruth said the elections bill wasn’t moving forward in the Senate because lawmakers ran out of time to take it up amid other competing proposals. Legislative leaders had been planning to adjourn for the year late Friday, though it wasn’t certain they would. “Burlington has waited 12 years for that charter — and it’s crazy that it’s being held up in the House,” the pro tem added. The city also attempted to get a ban on guns in bars approved by the Legislature in 2014, but wasn’t successful.Copeland Hanzas and Deputy Secretary of State Lauren Hibbert were both at the Statehouse Friday pushing to get the election bill over the finish line, Copeland Hanzas said. As it passed the House, the bill also includes a slate of measures she said would improve how municipal clerks can run local elections.Copeland Hanzas accused Baruth of playing “political gamesmanship.”“The important reforms that are in that elections bill are going to benefit every single municipal clerk across the state, and benefit our office and make it easier for us to ensure that we have fair, secure and error-free elections,” she said. “And so for one person to stand in the way of it is, really, unacceptable.”Copeland Hanzas added that it’s possible the bill would not advance in a similar form during next year’s session, in 2026, because legislators typically try to avoid making many changes to election laws in a year when they, themselves, would be on the ballot.Collamore, the Senate Government Operations Committee chair, said Friday that he believed his committee would have passed out the election bill with four of its five members in support. He declined to say whether Baruth, the pro tem, had influenced the bill’s fate.“I won’t comment on that,” he said in an interview Friday evening. Birong said some Democrats on his House committee were concerned the charter change would be confusing if guns were prohibited in bars in one city, but nowhere else in the state.Gov. Phil Scott had expressed similar concerns with the bill and told reporters last week at a press conference he would veto it if it reached his desk. Legislators would be unlikely to succeed on a vote to override any potential veto this year. Birong had strong words for the pro tem, as well.“I find it very discouraging that, especially in this day and age where we’re trying to do everything we can to maintain the sanctity of our elections, that a charter request from the pro tem’s district would jeopardize such an essential piece of legislation,” he said.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Election bill falters at 11th hour after Senate president ties its fate to Burlington gun bill he backed.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/phil-baruth-1-20250523-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-05-30 22:01:18.992622

SPRINGFIELD — Illinois Democrats introduced what a leading budgeteer described as a $55 billion budget Friday evening ahead of a Saturday deadline to pass the fiscal year 2026 spending plan.

The 3,363-page spending proposal was unveiled after 6 p.m. At the time the Senate’s lead budget negotiator, Sen. Elgie Sims, D-Chicago, briefed reporters on the plan; an exact proposal for raising about $1 billion in revenue to pay for it had not been made publicly available.

But Sims said lawmakers are not using broad tax hikes to balance the budget, although the plan does call for specific tax increases in certain areas. Sims said the proposal includes new taxes on gambling as well as tobacco and vape products. He also hinted that some businesses will pay more under the plan – though Illinois’ constitution mandates that the state corporate income tax remain a flat rate.

“We're trying to make sure that individuals pay their fair share, and corporations, who are the most prosperous are most profitable, also pay their fair share,” Sims said.

The plan is roughly in line with what Gov. JB Pritzker proposed in his February budget address as budget talks in Congress have injected uncertainty in state finances.

“This budget recognizes that there are significant challenges that we have, that we will face, and it makes sure that the chaos that is coming out of Washington, we're prepared for it,” Sims told reporters Friday night. “We're not running away from our responsibility. We're running towards it.”

A health care program that provides benefits to undocumented immigrants in Illinois between ages 42 and 64 also appears to be eliminated. Pritzker proposed eliminating the program to save the state $330 million.

“He did not include the HBIA (Health Benefits for Immigrant Adults) program in the budget,” Sims said. “But again, that's in recognition of the challenges that we're seeing coming out of Washington and the devastating effects that those proposals are having on our state and states across the country.”

Pritzker proposed a $55.2 billion spending plan in February, but revenue forecasts have declined since then. The latest estimate in early May from the governor’s office pegged FY26 revenue at $54.9 billion while the General Assembly’s independent Commission on Government Forecasting and Accountability projected revenue would come in at $54.5 billion – $1 billion below Pritzker’s February revenue estimate.

Expected declines in federal funding and a diminishing economic outlook have caused the downward revisions.

But the yet-to-be-filed revenue plan would make up a little over $1 billion in revenue, according to Sims.

Another source of new revenue in the budget proposal is a delinquent tax payment incentive program. The program is designed to help the state recuperate overdue tax payments. The program was proposed by Pritzker and is estimated to generate about $198 million in revenue.

With Medicaid funding cuts possible from Congress, Sims said the budget makes “significant” increases for the state’s hospital systems, in particular safety-net hospitals. He said the plan also builds in wage increases for direct service providers.

The proposed budget also fully funds the annual increase to the K-12 evidenced-based funding model with $350 million.

Lawmakers will also see their salaries rise as part of the budget, going to a $98,304 base salary from roughly $92,000. That’s an annualized rate of increase that is set by law.

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Two weeks ago, Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy announced a hiring freeze for most state agencies, paused new state regulations, and restricted state workers’ travel.
The governor’s administrative order arrived amid growing concerns about state spending, and much of it is similar to orders issued during the COVID-19 pandemic emergency and the oil price shock of the mid-2010s.
But this order has a new wrinkle: a pause on new state regulations.
“In order for agencies to focus their attention on the State’s core mission of providing essential services to Alaskans and maximizing operational efficiency, there is, effective immediately, a freeze on the promulgation of new regulations by all agencies. This freeze does not apply to regulations currently out for public notice,” the governor’s new order states.
If laws enacted by the Legislature and governor are the building blocks of state government, regulations are the mortar that holds them together: Regulations, proposed by state agencies or boards and commissions, cover the details that laws don’t, prescribing how state agencies should implement those laws.
“Governor Dunleavy issued Administrative Order 358 to ensure we are spending wisely and living within our means. This temporary pause on new regulations gives agencies time to evaluate priorities and reduce unnecessary regulatory growth,” said Jessica Bowers, a spokesperson for Dunleavy.
Since Dunleavy’s order, the state’s public records system shows only one new regulations package has been posted for public comment. In the same period last year, the online public records system shows seven. There were three during the same stretch of 2023 and five during that stretch of 2022.
This year, one of the biggest items affected by the governor’s order is a packet of regulations that would fully implement last year’s Ballot Measure 1, which requires paid sick leave and a minimum wage increase for workers starting July 1.
The measure, which was approved by 58% of participating Alaska voters last year, also forbids “captive audience meetings,” in which employees must listen to an employer’s views on religion, politics or unions.
New regulations require a 30-day comment period where the public can suggest changes to the final draft, and those regulations typically don’t become effective until 30 days after the final version is signed by the lieutenant governor.
In March, Adam Weinert, a special assistant to state Department of Labor Commissioner Cathy Muñoz, said that “the regulation packet is currently with the Alaska Department of Law, and we intend to have the packet out for a 30-day public comment in the near future.”
More than two months later, the packet still has not been published for public comment. The Department of Labor has not answered multiple requests for further information.
The delay has alarmed some of the measure’s supporters, who think it could be part of a national pattern.
In Nebraska and Missouri, voters also passed paid sick leave ballot measures last year. In both places, state legislators proceeded to overturn those ballot measures this spring.
Here in Alaska, five Republican members of the state House introduced a bill that would roll back Alaska’s voter-approved law.
“As those issues have won at the ballot box, really since 2016, we have seen an escalation of attacks to direct democracy and voter-approved initiatives,” said Chris Melody Fields, executive director of the Ballot Initiative Strategy Center, a national progressive organization.
“We’ve seen that especially on the economic justice ballot measures that were passed in 2024,” she said.
The Alaska bill lacks the support needed to pass the House or Senate and may be unconstitutional, which leaves regulatory hurdles as the last obstacle before it becomes effective.
Bowers, in the governor’s office, cited the text of the governor’s administrative order and said that agencies “can submit a waiver to move forward with paused regulations if the regulations are necessary to protect the safety of the public or to meet other essential State responsibilities.”
By email, she confirmed that the Department of Labor has submitted a waiver request and that it is under review. 
The Alaska Department of Law, which has been examining the regulations package for more than two months, did not answer a question on Friday seeking information about the status of that review.
Joelle Hall, president of the Alaska chapter of the AFL-CIO, a federation of 63 national and international labor unions, said that regardless of what happens with the regulations, Ballot Measure 1 will become law on July 1.
She supported the measure and has been tracking its implementation with interest. 
“Those regs need to have a 30-day comment period … they should have been out 90 days ago, so they could have taken in public comment,” she said.
Without regulations, Alaskans will still be entitled to sick leave and a higher minimum wage, but employers might not know how to keep track of that sick leave and report it properly, she said.
She noted that the Department of Labor has an FAQ about the measure.
Other organizations, including the Foraker Group and the law firm Landye Bennett Blumstein have also published detailed explanations on the new law going into effect.
Attorney Scott Kendall said that a regulations package could still go forward after the law becomes effective. 
But Hall said that still leaves employers guessing.
“You’re going to have a lot of employers who are confused about how they’re going to track things,” she said.
Of the state’s decision to wait on releasing regulations, she said, “I’m not sure what they think they’re doing aside from confusing people.”",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/250422-Capitol-flags-copy-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-30 22:01:18.992622

It’s the latest wave of immigrants from Southeast Asia to come to the state. This is part one of a  five part audio series, Mabuhay sa Alaska, by KMXT and breaks down how and why those teachers are here, as well as what it means for both Alaska, and the island nation.
Serjoe Gutierrez stood above the Kodiak High School Orchestra, violin in hand, as students rifled through their sheet music for pieces like “The Barber of Seville” and “Canyon Sunset.” Gutierrez often plays with his students instead of conducting them.
Gutierrez, who was born and raised in the Philippines, was in his fifth year of teaching there when he decided he wanted to try to work in another country.
“I think it’s time for me to come out of my comfort zone, explore a lot of opportunities, since I’m still young,” he said.
Alaska wasn’t high on his list. Kodiak barely made it on his radar.
“Kodiak was the last school district I applied to because it was the last school district that pop(ped) out of my Google browser,” Gutierrez said. “And I told myself, ‘Well if not in Kodiak, maybe the United States is not for me.’”
He’s now in his third year of teaching here.

Gutierrez’s immigration story is one of hundreds already playing out in schools all over Alaska, from the Aleutians to the North Slope to Southeast, as dozens of school districts have hired from the Philippines amid a national shortage of certified teachers.
School districts are cutting out the middleman
Gutierrez has become well known in Kodiak. Parents chat with him at student concerts, and he hosts a Filipino music show on KMXT. He plays piano at a local church, as well as violin for charity auctions and in the community’s theater.
He has even joined the Kodiak Island Borough School district’s efforts to recruit more teachers from his home country. In January, Gutierrez helped lead a group of Alaska school administrators on a recruiting trip to the Philippines.

Until recently, school districts have relied on third-party agencies to recruit teachers. But with demand up and opportunities to cut out middlemen, Kodiak’s district has led the way to recruit directly from the Philippines.
Some parents and Kodiak community members have criticized the practice for being too expensive. Kodiak Island Borough School District spent about $28,000 to send a team of 4 people this year, including Gutierrez. Teams like that screen hundreds of candidates in a single trip.
Working with lawyers and visa fees cost an additional $7,000 per teacher hired. Districts also can pay another $2,400 if they want to work with immigration lawyers to extend visas.
Hiring through an agency can cost a district about $27,000 per teacher.
And districts aren’t the only ones that pay when going through agencies. When Gutierrez started looking for work abroad three years ago, he had to pay $50 just to learn how to apply for jobs in other countries. Many teachers in the Philippines make only about $400 per month. He’s heard of some agencies charging teachers thousands of dollars once they’ve been placed in the U.S.
“The best of the best”
It took the group of administrators about two days to travel from Anchorage to the Philippines for the most recent recruitment trip. On the first day of recruiting, in a hotel conference space near Manila, candidates wore Western dresses and suits – even tuxedos. Others wore traditional Filipino formal wear, like embroidered shirts called barong tagalogs and distinctly shouldered filipinianas.

The room was full of candidates with graduate and postgraduate degrees. Some of the administrators said that on recruiting trips within the U.S., candidates were often fresh from their undergraduate colleges.
The Bering Strait School District has hired up to 60 teachers in a single year – about a third of its total teaching staff. The district has hired international teachers through an agency before, but this was its first time sending someone to recruit directly.
Tera Cunningham leads the district’s human resources. She’d never seen so many people vying for teaching jobs in Alaska.
“It’s exciting to see so many well-trained, well-prepared people who genuinely just want to help kids,” she said.
  Recruiters like Tera Cunningham work in teams of two to screen eight people at a time. (Photo by Brian Venua/KMXT)
 
The candidates had only a few minutes to introduce themselves and impress the administrators. Out of the first group of 120 candidates, less than a third had callbacks that day.
“It is intense to do it this way, and we know we’ll get the best of the best here,” Cunningham said.
She said meeting candidates in person helps her visualize them in action.
“And so I’m excited to see who that looks like, what that looks like when they make it through and they’re finally at our sites,” she said.
But not every school district can afford to visit the Philippines. That’s part of why Jennifer Schmidt with the Alaska Council of School Administrators joined the group. She said that the trip makes sense for districts with many openings, but some have only one or two.
The council, which handles the Alaska teacher and personnel system, received grant money from the U.S. Department of Education to improve the state’s retention and recruitment.
Kodiak’s school district has led the recruiting trips so far, but Schmidt said the eventual goal is for her to take the lead. She said ideally, schools wouldn’t need to recruit from abroad, but there just aren’t enough American and Alaska-grown candidates.
“It’s going to take a lot of turnaround and a lot of change in the state of Alaska for us to have enough teachers in Alaska and in the U.S. that are going to want to come and teach there,” she said.

SPRINGFIELD — Criminal justice reform advocates say legislation to seal criminal records for certain nonviolent crimes, which passed Friday in the House, would unlock economic opportunity for thousands of Illinoisans.

The so-called Clean Slate Act has failed twice before, but activists see renewed fiscal messaging as the key to reinvigorating the campaign. This time, the bill’s sponsor points to a “diverse coalition of stakeholders” and backing from business groups as signs Illinois could become the 13th state to enact similar legislation.

“This is something I've worked on for six long years, and now we have law enforcement and the business community — folks like the Illinois Retail Merchants Association, the Illinois Manufacturers Association — all on board,” Rep. Jehan Gordon-Booth, D-Peoria, said in an interview. “Not as a neutral party, but they are proponents. They want to see this bill passed.”

Like earlier proposals, Senate Bill 1784 would require law enforcement agencies to automatically seal records for nonviolent criminal convictions twice a year — Jan. 1 and July 1. The records would no longer be public, although law enforcement and state’s attorneys would retain access.

Gordon-Booth has sponsored Clean Slate legislation twice before — once in 2021 and again in 2023 — but neither bill progressed past committee.

Just a few days before the 2025 legislative session concludes, she filed it again. Within two days, it passed the House mostly along partisan lines, and is headed for debate on the Senate floor.

The session ends at midnight Saturday, although the bill could still pass after that deadline.

People convicted of certain violent offenses — including sex crimes against minors, DUI, reckless driving and violent offenses that require sex offender registration — would be ineligible to have their records sealed.

“I want to make this very, very clear: Serious criminal records are not eligible for automated sealing,” Gordon-Booth said during floor debate.

Gordon-Booth argued that conviction records trap formerly incarcerated individuals in a state of perpetual punishment, eclipsing access to employment, housing and educational opportunities. She said Clean Slate would remove these barriers, helping system-impacted people reintegrate into society instead of recidivating.

Paul Rothschild, managing director of operations for the Illinois Coalition to End Permanent Punishment — a group that advocates for the rights of people with criminal records — said he agrees. He said the justice system fails to follow through on its own promise: Once someone has served their time, they are entitled to a second chance.

“We believe that people should be accountable for the crimes that they commit. But we also believe there is an implied covenant that when they finish, they're supposed to be returned to the world made whole, and that covenant is not being kept by society. They're being forever subjugated in that lower caste, that lower class,” Rothschild said.

More than 3 million Illinoisans have arrest or conviction records, and an estimated 921,000 people are eligible for “sealing relief” — but only about 10% actually petition to have their records cleared, according to statistics from Live Free Illinois, a grassroots organization aimed at reforming the state criminal justice system and part of the Clean Slate Illinois steering committee, which coordinates the campaign’s messaging and advocacy efforts.

The bill would automate the process for individuals with nonviolent convictions to have their records sealed, once they have served their sentences, completed probation, and remained crime-free.

Many eligible individuals are deterred by steep fines, complex paperwork and long waiting periods, Gordon-Booth said. The “burdensome” process has contributed to massive court backlogs, according to Clean Slate Illinois.

“It’s going to automate the process, so this way we don't have to go through that whole trying to get the paperwork, trying to go through all the rigmarole,” said Chauncy Stockdale, who was formerly incarcerated and is now a member of the Live Free Illinois Fellowship, a reentry program that supports returning citizens.

The measure passed the House 81-28, with five Republicans joining Democrats in support of the measure. No Democrats voted against the bill.




During debate on the House floor, Minority Floor Leader Rep. Patrick Windhorst, R-Metropolis, voiced concerns about the tentative $18 million price tag, and whether the state is capable of fully funding the policy in the years ahead, leaving counties to cover the cost.

“If this isn’t funded, we’re either going to be sending a large unfunded mandate to our counties, or we’re making a promise to 2.1 million people that will not be fulfilled without any funding,” he said.

Gordon-Booth detailed a three year “implementation ramp,” which would give the state time to identify funding sources for the local circuit clerks. She also said the Illinois State Police would absorb the initial costs and emphasized the state’s commitment to supporting circuit clerks in the rollout phase.

“It is our full intention to provide clerks with all that they need to implement this,” she said. “We are not going to send an unfunded mandate to our local governments.”

‘Workforce and economic policy’

On April 10, nearly 300 members, supporters and advocates from Live Free Illinois chapters gathered in front of the Abraham Lincoln monument in Springfield for Advocacy Day, calling on lawmakers to introduce the Clean Slate Act.

Live Free Illinois — a faith-based nonprofit focused on ending gun violence and mass incarceration — organizes Black congregations to push for systemic change. The organization is involved in the broad-based Clean Slate steering committee, which also includes the Fully Free Campaign, the Illinois Coalition to End Permanent Punishments, and Impact for Equity.

The day before, Muslim leaders also advocated for Clean Slate legislation at Illinois Muslim Action Day.

Beyond criminal justice reform, advocates pushed a new messaging angle this year to usher the legislation across the finish line: Clean Slate could boost Illinois’ economy.

As of April, Illinois has one of the highest unemployment rates in the country, at 4.8% — above the national average of 4.2%, according to the data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Jerika Richardson, senior vice president for equitable justice and strategic initiatives at the National Urban League, said the act would open doors for thousands of people who have been barred from work because of background checks.

“There are so many employers and businesses across this country who are struggling to find the workers that they need, and part of the reason is because these records are barriers,” Richardson said. “If Illinois passes the Clean Slate Act, you won't have to worry about businesses going to another state or leaving the country.”

An amendment to the Illinois Human Rights Act, signed by Gov. JB Pritzker in 2021, expanded legal protections for state workers by prohibiting discrimination based on criminal convictions, in addition to arrest records. Yet many say they continue to face employment hurdles despite the law.

People with conviction histories earn an average of 25% less than those with clean records — a gap the National Urban League says costs the state billions of dollars in lost wages. According to a news release from the National Urban League, the Clean Slate Act could generate more than $4.7 billion in lost wages for Illinois, easing economic disparities and addressing labor shortages.

Gordon-Booth echoed Richardson’s point, adding that her office frequently hears from constituents who are missing out on life-changing chances.

“I get calls from people saying, ‘I had an opportunity to get my dream job, and it fell through because of something that I did when I was 18 or 19.’ And we're talking about folks that are in their 30s,” Gordon-Booth said. “They have not gone through the process of hiring a lawyer, going through the court-mandated process, and folks are losing out.”

(Photos courtesy of Nebraskans for Medical Marijuana)LINCOLN — Lawmakers approved the governor’s two appointees to the Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission on Friday over opposition from long-term advocates that the new members could delay or derail the rollout of the voter-approved medicine.
In separate votes, the Legislature approved the six-year commission appointments of Dr. Monica Oldenburg of Lincoln, an anesthesiologist, and Lorelle Mueting of Gretna, prevention director for Heartland Family Service. 
Oldenburg’s confirmation vote was 34-11. Mueting’s was 27-16. 
Committee advances Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission appointees

The two appointees needed at least 25 votes to be confirmed. Had one or both been rejected, Gov. Jim Pillen could still appoint someone else in the interim, without a legislative vote until 2026, or the same person if he chose.
Much of Friday’s debate on the confirmations, about 30 minutes for each nominee, revolved around whether the personal views of each woman could be separated from their new professional roles. For multiple years, Mueting and Oldenburg have opposed medical cannabis legislation at the State Capitol, including Mueting earlier this year.
Those legislative efforts were often supported by Nebraskans for Medical Marijuana and other long-time advocates who, in November, succeeded after a decade of pushing to legalize and regulate the medicine, often facing pushback from top state officials.
Appointee support and positions
The 71% voter approval for legalization and 67% for regulations also created the new state regulatory commission that Mueting and Oldenburg will now join. They will serve with the three commissioners on the Nebraska Liquor Control Commission, per the ballot measure.
Those commissioners are Bruce Bailey of Lincoln and Kim Lowe of Kearney, with one vacancy still to be filled by Pillen to represent Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District.

State Sen. Rick Holdcroft of Bellevue, the chair of the Legislature’s General Affairs Committee that advanced Oldenburg 5-2 and Mueting 5-3, called the two candidates highly qualified.
He said Oldenburg’s extensive experience, combined with deep concern for the health, safety and overall well-being of Nebraskans through her 18 years of medical service, would shine. Holdcroft added that Mueting had a strong record of promoting public health issues while thoughtfully balancing public health goals with public safety considerations.
Multiple senators, including State Sen. Jared Storm of David City, said the two would make a great team and keep Nebraska focused on medicine, not recreational marijuana.
“I honestly don’t know of two better people to be on this board,” Storm said Friday.
Mueting had said last week that her goal as a prevention specialist for 24 years has been to prevent people from having substance use problems and that she’s looked at medical cannabis from a “360-degree view.”
“Helping to guide the rulemaking process around the needs of the people it’s intended to serve is my goal,” Mueting said. “There’s nothing about that goal that says we need to sacrifice public health and safety to attain it.”

Oldenburg said last week that she is “not a prohibitionist” of cannabis but is “pro-research.” She said cannabis has “a place in pain management” for certain ailments that cause suffering.
“Nebraska needs to seize the opportunity to be slow and deliberate in the manner in which we determine how best to designate appropriate conditions for medical cannabis and regulate those entities that will dispense medical cannabis in our state,” Oldenburg said. “I look forward to working with various parties to ensure that we in the State of Nebraska get this right.”
‘It’s about trust’
State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair, who like Storm is a Republican, opposed Mueting but supported Oldenburg. Hansen brought Legislative Bill 677 earlier this year to set clearer medical cannabis regulations and guardrails with the backing of volunteers from the 2024 campaign.
LB 677 fell 10 votes short of advancing on May 20, the opposition of which Storm led. Mueting testified against the bill in March.
Hansen said he was concerned about Mueting’s impartiality and that lawmakers shouldn’t appoint someone who believes in prohibition to the Liquor Control Commission or someone who works for PETA to the Nebraska Brand Committee.

He said the same goes for someone to the Medical Cannabis Commission who “denies the legitimacy of medical cannabis to the very body tasked with implementing this regulation.”
“This isn’t just about professional qualifications,” Hansen said. “It’s about trust. Trust in the will of the voters. Trust in the integrity of this new commission and trust that we are putting the right people in place to carry out a law passed and overwhelmingly supported.”
State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha, vice chair of the Legislature’s General Affairs Committee, said that while both Mueting and Oldenburg might be nice people, he was worried about “artificial hurdles.” He supported LB 677 partly because it would have set a path toward “access.”
The Medical Cannabis Commission is charged “exclusively” with the power to regulate the control of the possession, manufacture, distribution, delivery and dispensing of cannabis for medical purposes in the state. Rules and regulations for medical cannabis dispensaries are due July 1 under the voter-approved laws. Licensing is supposed to begin by Oct. 1.
LB 677 supporters and other advocates had voiced concerns that the Medical Cannabis Commission could craft regulations that prevent meaningful “access.”
Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers has already vowed to sue the commission if it issues any medical cannabis licenses. He argues it is against federal law.
‘Slow-roll access for patients’
Hansen said the public is paying attention, noting that the remaining dozens of gubernatorial appointments that lawmakers considered over the past five months, lawmakers had received 21 online comments.

But for Mueting and Oldenburg combined, lawmakers had 208 online comments, Hansen said.
Crista Eggers, executive director of Nebraskans for Medical Marijuana, said the Legislature again threw a “wrench” in the will of Nebraska voters. She criticized senators who used the ballot measures as a reason to oppose Hansen’s LB 677 but then voted to confirm appointees who “will slow-roll access for patients in this state.”
Eggers said the mission continues to be on patients, as it has been “from day one,” despite what some legislative opponents say.
“The representatives in the state that have misrepresented our mission will see their day where the people hold them accountable. Mark our words,” Eggers said in a statement. “The patients of this state may be weary, may be tired, but they stand strong and will hold lawmakers accountable for their votes. They have the blood of Nebraskans on their hands.”

Speaking at U.S. Steel’s Irvin Plant in West Mifflin, a week after he announced the partnership with Japan’s Nippon Steel, Trump criticized the Biden administration for relaxing steel industry protections in 2021.
“The exemptions that they gave allowed foreign competitors that come in and steal our industry, steal our jobs and bring them back home and bring them home by the boatload,” Trump said standing in front of steel mill workers in orange, reflective coveralls and hard hats. Some held signs reading “Make U.S.S. Great Again.”
Trump said the 25% tariff on foreign steel he reinstated at the start of his second term would increase to 50% to “even further secure the steel industry in the United States.”
“Nobody is going to get around that,” he said.

Nippon began courting U.S. Steel in December 2023 with a $14.9 billion offer, which was approved by shareholders. Political opposition to the sale centered on the national security implications of selling one of America’s largest steel companies to a foreign corporation. The deal was stranded for most of last year as President Joe Biden awaited a recommendation from the Council on Foreign Investment in the United States.
Like Biden, Trump also initially opposed the sale, but announced May 23 in a post on Truth Social that the deal was back on. He described it as a “planned partnership” between the Japanese and American companies that would bring $14 billion of investment in a matter of months. 
The domestic steel and aluminum industries have long been a focus of Trump’s trade policy. He reintroduced the 25% tariff on imports of the metals even before he announced his broad duties on products made overseas that he said would bring manufacturing back to American shores. 
“When I came into office eight years ago, I proclaimed a simple but truly important principle, if you don’t have steel, you don’t have a country,” Trump said. “A strong steel industry is not just a matter of dignity or prosperity and pride, it’s above all, a matter of national security.”
In his hour-long speech, Trump also touched on his administration’s immigration policy and recognized Pennsylvania elected officials in the audience, including Rep. Dan Meuser (R-9th District), a likely GOP candidate for governor next year.
“If you run, you’ve got my support,” Trump said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Trump’s remarks, however, focused on the long-delayed merger but provided few additional details for anxious investors. Nippon and U.S. Steel have not officially disclosed terms of the rumored transaction. Earlier this week, U.S. Sen. Dave McCormick (R-Pa.) said the merger would be subject to a “national security agreement” under which the U.S. government would appoint some of the company’s directors.
Trump, instead, highlighted how he said it would benefit the Monongahela River Valley, where three of U.S. Steel’s plants employ nearly 4,000 workers. 
Nippon would invest $2.2 billion to increase production in the Mon Valley Works and $200 million in the company’s Advanced Technology Research and Development Center in nearby Munhall.
The post-merger U.S. Steel would also maintain all of its currently operating blast furnaces at full capacity for a minimum of 10 years. “We have that as a commitment,” Trump said.
And Trump promised there would be no outsourcing work or layoffs and that every U.S. Steel worker would receive a $5,000 bonus. 
“You’ve gone through a lot, it’s closing. It’s not closing,” Trump said to the crowd.
He brought several union leaders to the microphone, including Jason Zugai, vice president of USW Local 2227, and a third-generation steelworker. Zugal thanked elected officials including McCormick, Mueser and state Senate President Pro Tempore Kim Ward (R-Dauphin) for their concern as the sale took shape. 
“These investments are life changing for all the men and women here today and for our communities,” Zugai said. 
USW International President David McCall said in a statement Friday evening that the union remains concerned about the effects the merger will have on national security, its members and the communities where they work.
“We have not participated in the discussions involving U.S. Steel, Nippon Steel, and the Trump administration, nor were we consulted, so we cannot speculate about the meaning of the ‘planned partnership’ between USS and Nippon or the ‘golden share’ that some politicians have claimed will be issued to the federal government,” McCall said.
McCall said the union’s only concerns are the long-term viability and sustainability of the current U.S. Steel facilities to safeguard the employment and retirement security of its members. So far, he said, the union has seen only public relations and not commitments in writing.
“Issuing press releases and making political speeches is easy. Binding commitments are hard,” McCall said.

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — A legislative effort backed by Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers to ban most consumable hemp and other THC products in the state stalled Friday and will now wait until at least 2026.
State Sen. Kathleen Kauth of the Millard area, sponsor of Legislative Bill 316, asked that her Legislative Bill 316 be “passed over” on Friday. She waited to do so until just 10 minutes before a two-hour debate would have ended, a time when Kauth would have needed 33 votes to survive a filibuster. After that, she would have needed 25 votes to pass LB 316 and send it to Gov. Jim Pillen.
Kauth had the backing of most of the officially nonpartisan Legislature’s 33 Republicans. But Republican State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair held to his promise to oppose LB 316 if it wasn’t amended to explicitly protect medical cannabis products.
Medical cannabis
Kauth tried to address Hansen’s concerns and would have, said Hansen. But lawmakers ran out of time, because State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha and other opponents successfully blocked LB 316 from being amended.

Hilgers has argued that THC products with delta-8 are already illegal, to which Cavanaugh said Friday that if that’s true, a bill isn’t needed.
Hansen said the current “environment” with Hilgers, who has opposed medical cannabis and has launched a statewide campaign against delta-8, could be “hostile.” Hansen said there was language in LB 316 that could “greatly impact” medical cannabis.
“That’s something I cannot have,” Hansen said. “I think the people passed [medical cannabis] for a specific reason, and I think they are then due to have what they voted for.”
Hilgers helped lead opposition to Hansen’s proposal for clearer medical cannabis regulations and guardrails with 53 sheriffs. His LB 677 fell short 10 votes of advancing on May 20.
Part of Friday’s last-ditch effort featured pressure on State Sen. Jane Raybould of Lincoln, who said she was concerned about “bad actors” in the THC arena but didn’t want to take away the health products some Nebraskans rely on.

Raybould echoed Hansen that lawmakers should allow a new medical cannabis regulatory commission to proceed with directives for those products.
Kauth said multiple times during the debate that her bill had nothing to do with medical cannabis and that more than a dozen amendments from Cavanaugh made it “impossible” to seek the changes needed to keep her bill moving forward.
“No one is going into anyone’s homes and searching their medicine cabinets,” Kauth said. “That is more hyperbole and hysteria from the left.”
Health and safety
State Sen. Jared Storm of David City, who prioritized Kauth’s LB 316 for this year’s session, encouraged Nebraskans not to buy the “garbage” products. He repeated that he would never jeopardize “the health or safety of our citizens of this state, especially children and young adults, for revenue.”
LB 316 would prohibit raw hemp above 0.3% tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) of any concentration and with processed hemp prohibit the lesser of 0.3% THC on a total weight basis or 10 milligrams per package, effective Jan. 1. The mature stalks of Cannabis sativa and its fiber, oil, cake and any other naturally derived products would not be considered hemp, leaving a narrow legal path for some hemp-based products such as fibers and textiles.
  State Sen. Jared Storm of David City, center. March 26, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
If the bill passed, it would have included a “consumer safe harbor period” through the end of 2025 to give consumers time to discard any “illegal hemp” as newly defined under LB 316. Legal products would have faced an additional 10% wholesale tax at the time of purchase.
The new excise tax revenue raised would have been directed toward property tax relief.
Besides protecting the voter-approved medical cannabis laws, Kauth also worked with State Sen. Tom Brandt of Plymouth to offer an “affirmative defense” in court if someone could prove they previously legally purchased what would have become “illegal hemp” under LB 316. That could include a receipt.
‘Good’ and ‘bad’ actors
State Sen. Dan McKeon of Amherst, a Republican who represents a Pleasanton-based hemp company that has offered tours to state senators of its facilities, said there are good actors that lawmakers should be working with.
State Sen. Dan Lonowski of Hastings, a close ally of McKeon, said there are no “good actors.”
Nebraska lawmakers again advance ban of most THC, consumable hemp products

Kauth read a letter from Hilgers that had said if LB 316 passed, his office would have announced a pause on new civil enforcement actions against “businesses operating in good faith” for at least 120 days, exactly through the end of 2025. Kauth declined to provide a copy of the letter because LB 316 did not pass.
Kauth and Storm said they now hope Hilgers ramps up his legal efforts against THC stores. 
Many hemp-focused businesses said the broad language in LB 316 would shut down their industry, even as supporters said the bill wouldn’t touch them. Kauth said Friday that some businesses that were fighting the changes are essentially “admitting that they are selling dangerous, untested, unregulated, synthetic pot products.”
“They are pushing the health and well-being of their pocketbook above the health and well-being of Nebraskans,” Kauth said. “I’m extraordinarily disappointed that that is where we have come.”
‘We’re not people’s parents’
Cavanaugh, who again led opposition to the bill, said regulations and not a ban were still the best path forward. He said LB 316 would go in the “opposite direction” of economic development for budding businesses who are “good actors.”
His LB 16, to implement regulations on THC products, did not advance from the Judiciary Committee this year, and lawmakers repeatedly rebuffed his efforts.

Cavanaugh repeated Friday that he is “ready, willing and able to work on a regulatory scheme that will actually do this the right way and answer all the concerns that people have.”
State Sen. Terrell McKinney of North Omaha, who also pushed for regulations, said Kauth’s bill could cause more harm than good and that the state should let people be adults.
“Why do we have to act as if we’re the moral compass for the state? We’re senators. We’re not people’s parents,” said McKinney.
State Sen. Margo Juarez of Omaha said she had purchased CBD with hemp in it for her nearly 101-year-old mother, but she didn’t have a receipt for the product.
Cavanaugh said the proposed defense provision only dealt with individuals, so businesses would have needed to destroy or sell all products by September, when the bill, if passed, would have taken effect. If not, business owners would risk “countless felonies,” Cavanaugh argued.
What would be banned?
The debate on LB 316 has seen senators forcefully disagree with what would be banned, with supporters arguing it would only ban “synthetic” chemically modified hemp or THC, while opponents said the bill would stretch to CBD, creams, ointments and most other products.
Part of that is because LB 316 would count the THC level based on all concentrations — delta-8, delta-9, delta-10, etc. — and not just 0.3% delta-9 THCc. Cavanaugh and State Sen. Wendy DeBoer of Omaha have said that it could criminalize possessing a gummy as a felony.

Supporters of LB 316, however, say that only chemically modified “synthetic” products would be banned.
Nebraska lawmakers in 2011 already banned “synthetic” marijuana, such as K-2 or spice. Most hemp or other hemp-derived products require chemical modifications, such as heat.
‘We could have stopped it’
State Sen. Tanya Storer of Whitman said that while, as a conservative, she doesn’t think government should be in the way of business or entrepreneurship, government does have a role to protect people “from things that they couldn’t otherwise do for themselves independently.”
“Individuals do not have the capacity to know the processes that go into developing a product. That’s what we have things like the FDA for,” Storer said, referring to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
Cavanaugh, McKinney, Raybould and State Sen. George Dungan of Lincoln repeatedly said that was part of the reason why regulations, not a ban, would be better, treating the products similarly to alcohol, tobacco or other drugs.
Kauth said that with lawmakers’ failure to move forward, senators must own that the next time someone dies because of the products, they will know: “We could have stopped it.”
LB 316 will return next year one vote away from passing, with eight minutes to go in the third round of debate, though it’s unclear what amendments might come. Rescheduling would be up to Speaker John Arch of La Vista.

[…]","Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin leads a meeting of the DNC Executive Committee in Little Rock on May 30, 2025. (Screen grab from livestream)Ahead of a meeting of the Democratic National Committee’s Executive Committee in Little Rock on Friday, DNC chair Ken Martin said the national party is committing the largest financial assistance to state Democratic parties ever.
“The DNC will push out over a million dollars every month to the state parties,” Martin said in an interview. That includes $22,500 a month to the Arkansas Democratic Party to help it mobilize its efforts to improve the party’s position in the Natural State, he said.
“Arkansas is one of the only states where we saw legislative gains (in 2024),” he said. Democrats gained a single seat in the 100-member Arkansas House in the state’s only majority-Latino district last year.
 “There’s real opportunity for us, but that means we have to take advantage of it. Arkansas is really an important part of the calculus of how we build our future,” Martin said.
Little Rock was a hub of Democratic Party activity this week. The Association of State Democratic Committees met Wednesday and Thursday, according to the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette. The DNC Executive Committee met Friday at the Doubletree Hotel on Markham. 



 
At Friday’s meeting, Martin talked about steps he’s taking to make the party more transparent and democratic in the wake of Kamala Harris’ loss to Donald Trump and the election of a narrow Republican majority in the U.S. House of Representatives. He also presented lists of his nominees for various party committees that will be voted on when the DNC meets in August.
Martin’s remarks in the meeting echoed his comments in an interview with the Arkansas Advocate Friday morning.
He acknowledged that Democrats are not popular with many voters and that the party faces a crisis.
“People don’t have faith and trust in the party,” he said.
Asked what will change people’s minds, Martin cited Missouri, where measures on paid family leave, minimum wage and abortion protections were on last year’s ballot.
“All of them passed overwhelmingly… Those same voters went down the ticket and voted for Trump and independents. So clearly, the policies that we support as Democrats are wildly popular throughout the country. What isn’t popular is the Democratic Party … so for us, when we talk to voters and make an appeal to them, we need to talk to them about the issues that they already know will make a material difference in the lives of their families and communities,” he said.
He also said party leaders need to change their Washington, D.C.-oriented mindset. 
“We have to actually understand that some of these areas that we’ve lost over time are because we didn’t make the investment of time, energy and money. We stopped organizing. We stopped working in places like Arkansas in a meaningful way. As a result they become red,” Martin said.
“We didn’t come here just because Little Rock is beautiful. We came to send a message,” he said. “I’ve watched Arkansas change over the years, and I know we can change it again.”
He said he’s focused on rebuilding the party infrastructure, especially in Republican-controlled states like Arkansas. He noted that political power in the U.S. is shifting to the South, where six of the 10 fastest-growing states are.
“If we don’t lay down a foundation here, we won’t be prepared to meet that moment when it comes upon us. I don’t want to be caught flatfooted when the map shifts. If we do get caught flatfooted, we could be in a permanent minority for a long time.”
He cited research that showed public perceptions of the two political parties have changed. 
“A majority of Americans now believe that the Republican Party best represents the interests of the working class and poor and the Democratic Party is the party of the wealthy and elites. Just to prove the point, the only two groups we overperformed with in the presidential campaign were college-educated voters and wealthy households.
“That’s not sustainable,” the DNC chair said.
Democrats need to focus on an economic agenda that gives people some hope that better days are in front of them not behind them, he said. 
“It’s about focusing on an agenda that will give people a sense that we see them, we hear them and we’ve got some ideas on how we can actually improve your lives,” he added. “We have to give them a sense that we give a damn about them and their families and we’re going to fight for them.”",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ken-Martin-at-DNC-Exec-mtg-1024x576.png,,,2025-05-30 20:04:27.043721

As of early Friday evening, negotiators were still at work putting the finishing touches on Senate Bill 4, a sprawling piece of legislation that lawmakers hope will offer between $250 million and $500 million in direct savings to ratepayers by borrowing money to pay off portions of the public benefits charge on people’s bills.
But while members of both parties are in broad agreement on the need for legislation to lower prices, a debate over one provision of the bill, which addresses the powers of Connecticut’s Public Utilities Regulatory Authority, has threatened to upend the precarious negotiations.
Republicans are demanding that Democratic leaders and the governor’s office, who are hammering out the bill’s language, alter a section of the bill they argue would concentrate more power with PURA’s leader, Marissa Gillett. As the session hurtles toward its constitutional deadline next Wednesday, their power to filibuster and ultimately block legislation only grows.
“I’d like to see something that is actually going to reduce energy costs,” House Minority Leader Vincent Candelora, R-North Branford, told reporters Friday. “I’m hopeful we’re going to get there but I’m not going to back down.”
The section in question first appeared in a draft of the bill that was circulated around the state Capitol last week. It would allow Gillett or her successor to assign a hearing officer to rule on “procedural, evidentiary and intermediate matters” in cases that appear before utility regulators.
Critics quickly noted that the language appears to touch on an issue that’s the subject of a lawsuit filed in January by the state’s two utility companies, Eversource and Avangrid. The lawsuit alleged Gillett has made herself, in essence, a hearing officer, issuing unilateral decisions in hundreds of matters dating back to 2020. In court filings, attorneys for the agency have rebutted those claims and argued Gillett has revised longstanding practices to provide for more input from her fellow commissioners.
The original text in the draft bill would have made the hearing officer language effective retroactive to Jan. 1, 2025 — before the lawsuit was filed — prompting Candelora to accuse Gillett of interfering in the bill-drafting process to give herself cover from the litigation.
Candelora said the objectionable language was initially was dropped from newer versions of the bill after concerns were raised last week, only to reemerge in recent days.
A spokeswoman for PURA said Gillett was presiding over a rate case on Friday and was not immediately available for comment. 
One of the key drafters of the legislation, state Sen. Norm Needleman, D-Essex, said the section of the bill in question originated from an effort by House members to address the ongoing dispute over administrative procedures between PURA and the utilities. Since then, the co-chair of the Energy and Technology Committee said it’s become a headache he’d rather not deal with.
“My position on this from the very beginning was even talking about this issue — which was a House ask to clarify procedure — even talking about it while there’s an ongoing lawsuit, is a bad idea,” Needleman said. 
Still, Needleman said the section remained a point of contention Friday and was one of the last remaining issues that needed to be resolved before lawmakers could read and vote on the bill. With the Senate planning to break for the weekend, the soonest a vote could happen is Monday. 
“I’m out of time,” Needleman said. “I don’t have a lot of negotiating space, I can’t drag this out.”
House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, told reporters earlier Friday that the bill would need to have bipartisan support in order to make it through the House next week due to the dwindling amount of time left in the session and his desire to maintain what is a strong working relationship with Candelora, the Republican leader.
When asked about the origins of the language dealing with PURA, Ritter confirmed Needleman’s account that the section originated in the House with both Republican and Democratic support. However, he said it evolved beyond their initial idea after going through a comment process that involved members of Gov. Ned Lamont’s office, PURA and the Office of Consumer Counsel, among others.
Ritter said he also agreed with Needleman that the retroactive date in the language was made in error, and that it would be corrected in the final version of the bill.
“It was not a conspiracy,” Ritter said. “The original concept comes from the House, and we’re going to try to get it right, because it’s a big part of the bill.”
Candelora, meanwhile, said he would like to see the bill include language that would require any matter before PURA to be assigned to a panel of commissioners, who could then vote to appoint their own “presiding officer,” rather than leaving that decision up to the chair. He also reiterated his desire to have Lamont fill a pair of vacancies that have existed since the lawmakers expanded the number of PURA commissioners from three to five in 2019.
“There’s still a fundamental struggle with how much authority to give the chairman of PURA versus having the commission act as a panel,” Candelora said. 
Ritter said he shared Candelora’s concerns and remained hopeful that the two chambers could work out a compromise. Needleman, meanwhile, said he’s asked the Attorney General’s office to weigh in on the latest draft of the bill to ensure that any language dealing with PURA’s procedures does not interfere with ongoing litigation.
A spokeswoman for Attorney General William Tong said Friday afternoon the office was still waiting to see the latest language in the bill.
If either Tong’s office or members of the House object to that language, Needleman said he’s prepared to strip the section out of the bill altogether in hopes of getting to a final agreement. 
“Here’s the bottom line: This bill is about saving money. I’m trying to get to the maximum amount of savings for ratepayers,” Needleman said. “All the other stuff is superfluous.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025_0123_SR_PressConferences491-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-30 20:04:27.043721

Street takeovers
On its second try, the House of Representatives passed a bill allowing municipalities to create regulations prohibiting street takeovers.
Debate over the bill was paused last week when Republicans brought up concerns about a part of the bill allowing municipalities to destroy ATVs and dirt-bikes that were seized by the police after violating municipal ordinances if the owner does not claim the vehicles within 30 days.
The amended bill increases the 30 days to 90, assuaging concerns that vehicle owners might not be able to locate an ATV within 30 days if the vehicle was stolen.
It also changes the penalty for multiple counts of participation in a street takeover from license forfeiture to a two-year license revocation and a $2,000 penalty.
Rep. Gale Mastrofrancesco, R-Wolcott, one of four people who opposed the bill, said she was still concerned about a portion prohibiting people from gathering to observe a street takeover.
“My concern is that you see something going on in your neighborhood, in the area, and you’re curious … they can be fined for that. We can’t prohibit people from coming out of their houses and observing anything,” she said.
But Rep. Greg Howard, R-Stonington, said the municipality would have to prove that the person gathered in the area for the purpose of watching the street takeover in order to enforce that.
The bill passed 144-4.

Sunday hunting
A bill to allow Sunday hunting on private lands advanced out of the House on Wednesday, despite the opposition of many in the majority party.
Hunters have spent years pushing to end restrictions on Sunday hunting, which critics have described as one of Connecticut’s last remaining “blue laws.” In 2015, lawmakers voted to allow a limited exception for bow hunting.
House Bill 7231 would go further, allowing Sunday hunting with firearms on private properties of at least 10 acres.
“We’ve talked about the concept for a little while… this year we’re taking a strong next step,” said state Rep. John-Michael Parker, D-Madison, the co-chair of the Environment Committee.
Opponents, however, argued that hunting would disrupt the activities of hikers and others who seek to get outdoors on Sundays. An amendment added to the bill just prior to Wednesday’s vote attempted to ease those concerns by restricting hunting within 40 yards of a blue-blazed hiking trail, even on private lands.
Still, the bill created divisions within the Democratic caucus.
“I am not satisfied, many of the people who testified over the years in front of the Environment Committee are not going to be satisfied with this 40-yard designation,” said state Rep. Mike Demicco, D-Farmington.
The House voted 101 to 45 to advance the bill on Wednesday, with all of the opposition coming from Democrats. It now heads to the Senate for further consideration.

Emergency voucher housing program
Most of Connecticut’s congressional delegation signed a letter urging the Appropriations Committee to continue funding the Emergency Voucher program, which helps thousands of people across the country pay for their housing, according to a news release sent Friday.
The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development announced earlier this year that it would discontinue the program, which offers rental aid to families experiencing homelessness or at risk of homelessness. The department cited rising rents as the reason the program was becoming untenable.
“The EHV program provides rental assistance to help end and prevent homelessness,” the letter said. “At a time when housing costs and homelessness continue to rise, we respectfully request that you provide adequate funding in the FY26 THUD Appropriations bill to renew all EHVs to ensure that those who have been served by the program do not lose their housing support and to ensure landlords continue receiving the rental payments they depend on to maintain their properties.”
The program serves about 107,000 people across the country.
Sens. Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal signed the bill, as did Reps. Jim Himes, Jahana Hayes, Joe Courtney and John Larson.

HUSKY delivery
A bill that would ensure that the legislature is part of any change to the Medicaid delivery model passed through the Senate on Friday afternoon. Senate Bill 985 requires the commissioner of the Department of Social Services to submit any plans to change the payment model for Medicaid, called HUSKY in Connecticut, to legislative committees. Currently, the executive branch has authority to make such a change, through DSS.
Gov. Ned Lamont previously commissioned a study to investigate whether returning to a managed care Medicaid model would be more cost efficient. Even studying the possibility of a switch was met with fierce opposition. The resulting report found that Connecticut’s current system — a managed fee-for-service model — boasts lower costs and similar levels of access when compared to peer states. S.B. 985 is designed to ensure that lawmakers would have a say if the subject returns to the table in the future.
Sen. Matthew Lesser, D-Middletown, who is the co-chair of the Human Services Committee, said there is no issue that has attracted more interest across the nation this year than Medicaid.
“There are massive changes happening at the federal level, changes that we’re certainly concerned about in this building. And the question is, when considering major changes or changes to the HUSKY Health Program, should the legislature be at the table? And this bill seeks to make sure that it is.”

,DC,2025-05-30 23:09:47+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Trump sends detailed budget request cutting spending by $163 billion to Congress,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-sends-detailed-budget-request-cutting-spending-163-billion-congress,,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration released significantly more detail about its budget request Friday evening, giving Congress the information it needs for lawmakers to draft the annual government funding bills.The 1,224-page document sheds light on where exactly President Donald Trump and White House budget director Russ Vought want lawmakers to cut federal spending during the upcoming fiscal year.The Office of Management and Budget released a “skinny” version of the annual proposal in early May, requesting lawmakers cut domestic spending by $163 billion and keep funding for defense programs flat in the dozen annual appropriations bills.While the documents in that request provided some insight into how Trump wants to reshape the size and scope of about $1.7 trillion in discretionary funding, which is spending that Congress directs, they didn’t include the level of detail that the Appropriations committees need to begin their work.The appendix document released Friday should aid in that, though it does not represent a full budget request. That type of proposal would include the White House’s goals for mandatory programs, like Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, which make up about two-thirds of federal spending. Such spending is required by law and is not subject to annual appropriations.A full budget request also typically includes tax policy proposals, though with Republicans in Congress already working to enact an extension of the 2017 GOP tax law in the “big, beautiful bill,” those sections would likely be of little use to lawmakers at this point.Work on spending bills launchingThe House Appropriations Committee is scheduled to release and debate its 12 government funding bills throughout June, before voting to send those measures to the floor.Chairman Tom Cole, R-Okla., will likely include funding levels and policy closely aligned with the White House request, since legislation in that chamber can pass a floor vote with a simple majoritySenate Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Susan Collins, R-Maine, has a more challenging task, since regular bills in that chamber require bipartisanship to get past the 60-vote legislative filibuster. Republicans control the Senate with 53 members.In general, that means the Senate panel’s bills tend to look much more like the final version that becomes law than the House bills, though not always. Both chambers are supposed to reach a bipartisan, bicameral agreement on the dozen bills before the start of the next fiscal year on Oct. 1, but that rarely happens.Congress is much more likely to use a stopgap spending bill until mid-December to give members more time to negotiate funding levels and policies on thousands of government programs.The House and Senate were unable to reach agreement for this fiscal year, and instead leaned on a series of three continuing resolutions to keep the government up and running.Partial shutdown could loom againTensions over the proposed funding cuts in Trump’s first budget request of his second term could reach a boiling point if Cole, Collins, House ranking member Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut and Senate ranking member Patty Murray cannot broker an agreement before their deadline.Failure to enact some sort of government funding legislation — either the dozen full-year bills, or a stopgap spending measure — would lead to a partial government shutdown. Murray, D-Wash., wrote in a statement released Friday evening that it was “telling that President Trump has chosen to release his budget on a Friday night with no fanfare whatsoever.”“This is a draconian proposal to hurt working people and our economy, and it is dead on arrival in Congress as long as I have anything to say about it,” Murray wrote. “But this is just another reminder we need Republicans to join us to reject these reckless cuts, focus on the investments we actually need to make in our communities and security, and to finally force Trump to follow the law and end his devastating funding freeze.”DeLauro wrote in a statement that the ""government envisioned by President Trump only serves billionaires and the biggest corporations and would do nothing to lower the cost of living.”“This is not a complete budget,"" she wrote. ""We are supposed to start putting together the funding bills for 2026 next week. If, as expected, House Republicans follow what President Trump has proposed so far, it is not a serious effort to deliver for the American people.”",,,,2025-05-30 20:04:27.043721

The list was compiled in response to President Donald Trump’s April 28 executive order directing federal authorities to identify so-called sanctuary jurisdictions nationwide.

Photo courtesy of the Education Justice Coalition of VermontThe entire state of Vermont and three of its cities are listed on a new Department of Homeland Security list identifying so-called sanctuary jurisdictions across the United States — but Vermont officials say their policies adhere to federal immigration laws and help build trust with and reassure immigrants.Released Thursday night, the list of more than 500 cities and states identified as sanctuary cities, schools or states are seen by the Trump administration as “defying federal immigration law,” according to a Department of Homeland Security press release.“Sanctuary cities protect dangerous criminal illegal aliens from facing consequences and put law enforcement in grave danger,” and the department is “committed to exposing these lawless jurisdictions to the public and making them accountable for not respecting the rule of law,” the release stated.The list was compiled in response to President Donald Trump’s April 28 executive order directing federal authorities to identify so-called sanctuary jurisdictions nationwide that are “deliberately obstructing the enforcement of federal immigration laws and endangering American citizens.” The Trump administration has threatened to suspend or end federal funds to those schools, cities or states.While Vermont has not declared itself as a sanctuary state, it “maintains full compliance with federal law while protecting the Constitutional rights of citizens and the State,” Amanda Wheeler, Gov. Phil Scott’s spokesperson, wrote in a Friday email. “This means, Vermont doesn’t stand in the way of the federal government carrying out federal immigration laws in Vermont,” she wrote.After considerable delays and pressure from immigrant advocacy groups, the state last year updated its fair and impartial policing policy that aims to reduce bias based on citizenship status.READ MORE
The governor in 2017, however, signed legislation days after then-U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions threatened to revoke law enforcement funding from sanctuary cities and states that block police from telling federal authorities about unauthorized immigrants in their custody.The 2017 guidelines provide an outline for municipalities to consider when adopting policies on municipal law enforcement interactions with federal immigration officials. A fact sheet put out by Scott further stresses “Vermont’s response does not put federal dollars at risk because it does not establish Vermont as a ‘sanctuary jurisdiction.’”After families and staff in Vermont’s most diverse school district strongly advocated for the measure, the Winooski School District in February became the first in Vermont to pass a sanctuary school policy that remains active and compliant with existing law, according to Superintendent Wilmer Chavarria.Winooski “continues to abide by its policy to affirmatively protect the rights of students and families regardless of their immigration status and to take proactive measures to educate our community of those rights,” he wrote in an email Friday. “Our policies and procedures are respectful of the law and while we monitor ‘demands’ from the Trump administration, we will be ready to comply only when those demands have a sufficient legal basis. As of this moment, our policy remains within the law,” Chavarria added.The Department of Homeland Security release contained no details, but local authorities believe the administration will target policies that restrict federal immigration authorities from accessing property and information. This could apply to existing sanctuary city or school guidelines as well as fair and impartial policing guidelines in Vermont.Montpelier and Burlington have both in place.Burlington Mayor Emma Mulvaney-Stanak said Friday the city’s fair and impartial policing policy, aimed at preventing discrimination in law enforcement and preventing officers from enforcing civil immigration law, does not violate federal law and is needed “to keep our community safe.”Burlington Mayor Emma Mulvaney-Stanak on Friday, April 4. Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDigger“Burlington, like other communities identified as sanctuary jurisdictions, has a proud history of welcoming immigrants and refugees,” she said in a press release issued Friday afternoon. “We will not back down from ensuring the safety of all who live, work and visit our community.”Such policies help build trust between immigrant communities and police departments and ensure “people can call for help without fear of discrimination based on immigration status,” Mulvaney-Stanak added. The Burlington School District has not declared itself a sanctuary school, but it did issue guidelines regarding federal immigration efforts to staff in January and partnered with local agencies to educate new American families about their rights. Superintendent Tom Flanagan said he is concerned about the Homeland Security directive. He is not sharing details about the agencies the district has partnered with to help immigrant families in order to protect them.“Thankfully, no deportations have occurred in schools or on school grounds. We continue to work closely with families and community partners to make sure they feel safe and understand their rights,” he said in an emailed statement Friday. “Families and staff understand that we cannot keep anyone 100% safe from illegal deportation and they have told us they are grateful for the steps we have and continue to take.”“We also believe we continue to do what is morally right and that we are operating in a way that complies with federal and state law,” he wrote.Montpelier adopted its sanctuary city resolution in 2016 affirming that local law enforcement willnot enforce federal immigration policy at the request of the federal government. The capital has also adopted a fair and impartial policing policy modeled after the state policy that makes clear “enforcement of civil immigration law is a federal responsibility, and establishes that the Montpelier Police Department (MPD) shall not engage in such enforcement,” City Manager Bill Fraser said in a Friday press release.The Homeland Security release claiming sanctuary jurisdictions “protect violent criminal illegal aliens” comes a day after the second large-scale immigration enforcement incident in Vermont in just two months.Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials detained 10 people in the town of Newport Thursday after they finished work at a construction site nearby. Some were carrying proof of their immigration status and are being scheduled for release. The status of the other detainees is not yet clear.Last month, ICE detained nine migrant workers at a dairy farm in Berkshire, four of whom have already been deported to Mexico. Three others were released Friday, according to a press release from Migrant Justice.READ MORE
Molly Gray, executive director of the Burlington-based nonprofit Afghan Alliance, wrote in an email that the sanctuary list is intended to “intimidate Vermonters through fear and coercion.”“This administration may be comfortable with violating due process, and unlawfully targeting immigrants and refugees but Vermonters are not and won’t have any part in it. This Administration might abandon its promise and responsibility to Afghan Allies, but Vermonters will not,” she wrote.The Homeland Security release is “another attempt from the federal government to force private and public institutions into “voluntarily” changing their conduct, policies, or practices—even when institutions’ rights and responsibilities, and the law, have not actually changed,” Falko Schilling, advocacy director of the ACLU of Vermont, said in an emailed statement.Presidential executive orders cannot change laws, Schilling said. He said the Trump administration is “trying to use its executive power to pressure institutions into pre-emptive compliance with its policy goals in an end run around not only Congress, but the autonomy of individual states.”Some states and advocacy groups across the country have been challenging presidential orders, arguing they are unconstitutional, particularly around immigration as the Trump administration carries out a promise to ramp up mass deportations.A federal court in Vermont has played a central role, most recently helping to free detained Palestinian student Mohsen Mahdawi and pause the transfer of detained student Rümeysa Öztürk.Students at Champlain Valley Union High School last week staged a “hands off” walkout in protest of the impact of the federal government’s immigration enforcement policies. An early suspension of a parole program for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans led two Nicaraguan students to leave the country by the end of April.“We’ve heard from students, educators, and community members, students can’t learn if they don’t feel safe. No student should have to fear for their friends, family, or their own safety in the presence of immigration officials, especially in a place of learning. Sanctuary school policies make schools safer for all students,” said Kayla Loving, a coordinator at the Education Justice Coalition of Vermont that helped draft a K-12 sanctuary school policy used by Winooski.This is not the first time Vermont communities have faced federal threats over their sanctuary status. In 2018, the U.S Department of Justice sent letters to 28 cities and states, including the state of Vermont and city of Burlington, warning they may not be in compliance with federal immigration law.None of the communities named in the Department of Homeland Security list had received letters as of Friday.Attorney General Charity Clark on June 18, 2024. File photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerVermont Attorney General Charity Clark, who continues to join other states in a growing list of legal actions challenging Trump administration actions, said this list is no surprise. She said her office is prepared and will continue to fight for the rule of law and the rights of Vermonters.“Any Vermont official who receives a notice as a result of this list should continue to follow state laws and policies, which are in compliance with federal law and designed to build the trust necessary to protect public safety,” Clark said in an emailed statement. “It’s the federal government’s responsibility to enforce immigration laws, and state and local law enforcement should remain focused on public safety in our communities.”The crackdown on immigration has many immigrant families nervous and on edge, according to Shabnam Nolan, executive director of the King Street Center, a community center that serves youth in Burlington.“We continue to hear worry, even from those with legal status, about their safety amid recent federal statements. When any statement or action — whether from institutions or individuals — casts doubt on belonging, children feel it first. We hear their questions. We see their fear. And we hold space for their hope,” Nolan said Friday.The center’s role, she said, is to provide stability and connection to every child and caregiver. “And no matter what, we will continue to play this role,” Nolan said. “We remain committed to listening deeply, responding thoughtfully, and standing alongside our families through uncertainty and beyond.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont sanctuary jurisdictions respond to Homeland Security list, say policies comply with federal law.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/champlain-valley-high-school-protest-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-05-30 20:04:27.043721

The footage shows that after calling 911 to report an armed burglar dressed in all black, a woman met officers at her door in that same style of clothing and pointed a handgun at them.
The post Body cam footage shows Casper homeowner raising gun at officers responding to 911 call appeared first on WyoFile .","A woman shot and killed by police in April raised a handgun in the direction of officers after meeting them at the door of her central Casper home, body camera footage released Friday by the Casper Police Department shows.
The woman called police to her own home just after midnight on April 28 on a report of an armed burglar that appears to be false.
The footage, which includes a warning that viewer discretion is advised, shows that after calling 911 to report an armed burglar dressed in all black, 37-year-old Jody Cobia met officers at the door to her home in that same style of clothing, holding a handgun. “Where the fuck are my children?” Cobia yelled as she stepped toward the officers and raised a handgun in their direction. 
Cobia is a mother of three, but did not appear to have custody of her children, according to court records previously reviewed by WyoFile. Police found no one else in the home, the video shows.
When Cobia raised the gun, officers expressed surprise and stepped back while two of them fired, according to the body camera footage released late Friday afternoon. The two officers fired five rounds over two seconds, according to narration by the department included in the footage. 
Four officers responded to the burglary report initially. After shooting Cobia, they searched the rest of the house, and did not find any evidence of an intruder. Department officials had previously told the public there was no indication that Cobia’s report of a burglar was accurate and that they believe she made the call to draw police to her home. 
After searching the home, officers and paramedics provide life-saving measures to Cobia, but the first officers to reach her say on the body camera footage that they can’t feel her pulse. Immediately after shooting Cobia, some officers moved to enter the home, but a supervisor on scene told them to wait for about 15 seconds, while he yelled into the house and tried to ascertain if anyone else was home. 
Officers take time to make sure no one else is in the house, including the possible armed burglar, and do not begin to give Cobia medical attention until around eight minutes after she was shot. 
In the audio of the 911 call, a woman, presumably Cobia, tells dispatch someone “armed and dangerous” had broken into her house. The audio of the call released Friday does not identify the caller as Cobia, but the department said she made the call in its May 7 release. 
“He’s wearing all black,” the caller says. “Please show up.” 
She repeatedly tells the dispatcher to “hurry up,” but is not whispering into the phone on the call. “He’s inside,” the caller says, “please get inside. Please get over here.” 
The caller tells the dispatcher the burglar is in a back room of the house, after previously saying she herself was in that same room. That appears to give the dispatcher pause. “And you’re in the back room?” the dispatcher asks the caller. 
“Yeah, I’m running away from him,” the caller says. She ends the call shortly after that. 
Officers arrived on scene about three minutes after the 911 call, which began one minute after midnight. Body camera footage then shows four officers approaching the house, shining flashlights along exterior walls and windows as they do so. 
When an officer nears the door, Cobia appears to open it before he can knock. The pistol police say she held is difficult to make out in the body camera footage, but she appears to be holding it down by her waist as she opens the door. She then swings it up toward the officer’s head and takes hold of it in both hands as she yells about her children. Police fire at her immediately after that. 
The incident remains under review by the Wyoming Division of Criminal Investigation, according to the Casper Police Department. After that inquiry, the case will be sent to the Natrona County District Attorney’s Office, which will decide whether the shooting was justified.

Emilie Kornheiser, D-Brattleboro, gestures across the table as House and Senate members of the education reform bill conference committee meet at the Statehouse in Montpelier on Friday, May 30, 2025. Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerYou couldn’t walk 10 steps under the golden dome Friday without someone asking if we were getting out of here today. Legislative lawyers are under-rested and over-extended. Lawmakers have skipped too many meals. And everyone has a pet theory — so-and-so wants a delay, someone has a secret proposal they’re waiting to unveil. But it’s not looking good, folks, thanks to the ed bill. Here’s how it was going down (so far). After a stalled morning, the H.454 conferees gathered for a brief meeting after 11. Despite an air of pessimism preceding the discussion, both sides expressed willingness to compromise on key issues that threatened to delay the day. The surprise came later. I’ll get to that. House members, for their part, signaled a willingness to consider allowing districts to spend less than the amount a foundation formula would provide in full. Senate members suggested they would consider the House’s version of a property tax credit, which would significantly expand eligibility and relief over the existing system but cost more overall. Reaching agreement looked much less likely hours later. When the group returned at 2:45 with the Senate’s latest draft, there were some new ideas. Quite a few. For example, a potential expansion of school choice. Components of a foundation formula pulled from a couple of weeks ago. And if districts can’t pass a budget by a certain date, they get 90% of a foundation formula rather than the full thing — unless they’re a fully non-operating district, in which case they don’t have to vote and get 100% of the foundation formula. As the surprises arrived, both conferees and spectators struggled to control their shock. Eyebrows raised, one lobbyist leaned to the next and mouthed, “this is wild.”The new language proliferated throughout the Senate’s proposal — but was not in the chamber’s original bill, the House’s version or the governor’s recommendations. With frustration palpable, Rep. Peter Conlon, D-Cornwall, chair of the House Education Committee, called for a recess. When the group reconvened at 5 p.m., the Senators first appeared to pull their large changes off the table, before clarifying that most of it was still in play.“Do you believe passing this tonight is the right answer?” Conlon asked the Senate members, holding up the afternoon surprise. Sen. Seth Bongartz, D-Bennington, appeared to nod. But Sen. Ann Cummings, D-Washington, was less sure.“I don’t know if that is the right answer. That was 15-minute at lunch’s attempt to come up with an answer,” she said. Sen. Scott Beck, R-Caledonia, spoke up. “We had a bill that was one caucus all the way through, and now we’ve got to square it up with both caucasus and a Republican governor. So I guess, let’s dig in.”— Ethan WeinsteinOn the moveAfter several days of acrimonious debate, the House and Senate reached a deal on this year’s housing bill, S.127, on Friday afternoon. Scott administration officials indicated that the Republican governor will support it. The chambers each accepted the compromise and passed the bill by early evening.The bulk of the disagreement between the two chambers centered around a new infrastructure financing program for housing development, which would leverage the increased tax revenue from new construction to pay back loans for infrastructure like water lines, roads and sidewalks. The House had added a host of guardrails to the initiative in an effort to protect foregone property tax revenue from the Education Fund. The Senate — and the Scott administration — had pushed for fewer rules, arguing that a more flexible version of the initiative would help add more homes to the grand list and spread out the burden of rising education costs.Tensions ran high during a conference committee this week as the two sides sparred, leaving observers to wonder whether lawmakers might walk away from the negotiating table. But by Friday afternoon, they settled their differences on a few key points: they agreed to significantly raise a cap on the amount of tax-increment a state council can approve for new projects each year, and they scrapped a previously-added sunset to Vermont’s existing, larger-scale tax increment financing program.The crowded room erupted in applause when House members agreed to Senate members’ last offer.“Thank you for this step – for really creating a new tool for housing creation,” said Sen. Alison Clarkson, D-Windsor.— Carly BerlinThe House on Friday morning approved a Senate proposal to push back the effective date of a proposed cap on the cost of outpatient pharmaceutical drugs. The measure, included in H.266, was originally proposed by the House with a transitional cap beginning July 1. But the Senate nixed that initial cap, settling only on a slightly lower cap that would take effect next January.Supporters have said a cap on outpatient pharmaceuticals could provide the most immediate relief to health care insurance costs of any measure lawmakers have considered this year. The bill now heads to Gov. Phil Scott for his consideration. — Shaun RobinsonA bill that would overhaul Vermont’s response to homelessness is also headed to Gov.

The Connecticut Senate on Friday overwhelmingly passed the most significant reform to the state’s towing policies in decades, a measure lawmakers said would help protect drivers from predatory towing.
House Bill 7162 overhauls the state’s century-old towing statutes and comes in response to an investigation by the Connecticut Mirror and ProPublica that showed how state towing laws have come to favor tow companies at the expense of drivers. It takes several steps to make it harder to tow vehicles from private property and easier for drivers to retrieve their vehicles after a tow.
The bill, which passed the House of Representatives last week with wide bipartisan support and little debate, sailed through the Senate on a 33-3 vote.
“It’s reform that ensures transparency, it ensures fairness and accountability, but does all of this without undercutting the essential work that ethical and professional tow operators do each and every day for us, keeping our roads safe and our properties accessible,” said Transportation Committee Co-chair Sen. Christine Cohen, D-Guilford. “We’ve learned over the years, and particularly over the last year due to some investigative reporting, of some particularly egregious circumstances.”
A spokesperson for Gov. Ned Lamont said the governor plans to sign the bill into law.
Republican Sen. Tony Hwang, ranking member of the Transportation Committee, also spoke in favor of the bill. The bill got about a half hour of debate ahead of passage, and there were no comments in opposition.
Hwang, who represents Fairfield, said the bill strikes the right balance between the interests of towers and consumers.
“I want to acknowledge that our press had an important part to bring out transparency and some of the bad actions, and I think in this bill we address some of those issues,” Hwang said. “We took measures to ensure that there is due process, and what has been discovered to have occurred in a criminal action, I believe, should never, ever happen again, to undermine the trust that we have to have in this process.”
Connecticut’s law allows tow companies to begin the process to sell vehicles after just 15 days. CT Mirror and ProPublica found that it is one of the shortest windows in the nation, and that the law has particularly impacted people with low incomes. Reporters spoke with people who said towing companies required them to pay in cash or wouldn’t allow them to get personal belongings out of their vehicles. Many couldn’t afford to get their towed vehicles back and lost transportation or jobs because of it.
After weeks of negotiations, lawmakers said they came to a compromise with the towing industry. Two bills were merged to include massive reforms to towing procedures from private property and rate increases for highway tows that typically follow car accidents.
The bill that passed and would take effect Oct. 1 requires tow companies to accept credit cards and doesn’t allow them to tow vehicles immediately just because of an expired parking permit or registration. Vehicles can’t be towed from private property without notice unless they’re blocking traffic, fire hydrants or parked in an accessible spot.
Under the bill, towing companies can still start the sales process for vehicles worth $1,500 or less after 15 days, but they would now have to take more steps to give the owner a chance to claim the vehicle. The Department of Motor Vehicles would be required to check whether the driver filed any complaints about the tow before approving the sale, and the tower would have to send a notice ahead of the sale to the registered owner and lienholders via certified mail, with receipts of delivery.
The actual sale couldn’t go through until 30 days after the tow.
The bill also requires that towers take at least two photos before they tow a vehicle — one of the violation that resulted in a tow and another of any damage to the vehicle. Cohen said this would help determine if vehicles had any missing parts before the tow, a seeming nod to the news organizations’ story about a DMV employee who the agency’s investigators found schemed with a towing company to undervalue vehicles and sell them for thousands in profit. (The employee denied he did anything wrong, and the agency ultimately took no action in that case.)
The bill also establishes a working group to study how to handle proceeds from the sales of towed vehicles. State law requires that towing companies hold profits in escrow for a year in case the vehicle owner claims them, then remit that money to the state. But CT Mirror and ProPublica found the DMV never set up a system for that process to occur.
Additionally, it calls for the DMV to work with the state’s attorney general to develop a consumer bill of rights on towing.
Tow companies have to be available after hours and on weekends to allow people to get their vehicles or personal property. In a story published this month, CT Mirror and ProPublica reported that tow truck companies sometimes hold onto people’s belongings to pressure them into paying their towing fees.
Under the new law, drivers will be allowed to retrieve their belongings from their vehicles, even if they haven’t paid the towing fees. State regulations currently allow vehicle owners to retrieve only “personal property which is essential to the health or welfare of any person.”
Cohen listed many of the issues outlined in the news outlets’ reporting as “some of the worst abuses of predatory towing practices.”
Timothy Vibert, president of Towing and Recovery Professionals of Connecticut, said the industry initially opposed the bill because towers believed it would impede their ability to tow cars and clear traffic. He also said towers weren’t involved enough in the original draft. But they worked with lawmakers on the bill over several weeks, and he issued a statement in support this week.
“The people of Connecticut deserve safety, accountability and transparency when their cars are towed, and so do the people who work for Connecticut’s towing companies who risk our lives every day to make our roads safe,” Vibert said. “We all need clear, easy-to-follow rules.”
DMV Commissioner Tony Guerrera commended the House and Senate.
“The DMV fully supports this initiative, as it not only enhances the framework for fair and equitable enforcement of towing laws but also provides a clear path forward for our agency to advance these efforts,” Guerrera said in a statement.
Cohen said that the bill aims to “fix a broken process,” and that lawmakers had worked on some aspects of it for years before the bill passed.
News of the bill’s passage brought relief to Melissa Anderson, who was featured in a CT Mirror and ProPublica story after her car was towed and sold from her Hamden apartment because of an expired parking permit.
The bill requires a 72-hour grace period before a car can be towed for an expired parking sticker to allow people time to get a new one.
“I’m glad we made a difference,” Anderson said. “This is going to help a lot of people.”
The bill next heads to Lamont’s desk.
“The Governor appreciates all the work that went into this legislation, which provides greater protections for the public and their vehicles,” Lamont’s spokesperson, Rob Blanchard, said in a text message. “He plans on signing the legislation once it reaches his desk.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2025_0530_SR_SenateTowingBill_121-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-30 19:05:52.978540

Greg Gianforte vetoed a “river census” bill, arguing the work to collect data can be done in a “more cost effective manner,” but the sponsor said a special revenue account has the money, and Montana needs clarity about river use.
House Bill 762 would require Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks to produce a report of all watercraft, from rafts to inflatable flamingoes, along 966 miles of 16 rivers in the state.
Rep. Joshua Seckinger, a river guide, said the legislation is necessary because rivers are busy, and attempts have been made to regulate them, but with only anecdotal evidence, not hard data.
In his veto letter, however, Gianforte argued the cost of the river census was much too high, and the project too large, although he said the bill is “well intended.”
“House Bill 762 drains $2.6 million from the state parks account, which would otherwise be used to address important infrastructure projects at our state parks, including maintenance backlogs,” Gianforte said in his veto letter.
The bill had bipartisan sponsorship. It earned 102 approvals altogether in its final votes in both chambers — 29 in the Senate and 73 in the House.

Support from two thirds of the Montana Legislature triggers an automatic veto override poll from the Secretary of State.
Friday, a spokesperson for the Secretary of State’s office could not be reached via email about the status of polling. Friday, the bill wasn’t among the list of those currently being polled.
However, in a letter to his colleagues, Seckinger, D-Bozeman, said he hopes they consider overriding the veto. He said he respectfully disagrees with the governor’s assessment the bill “took too big a bite at the apple.”
“First, there is no additional cost to taxpayers,” Seckinger wrote. “The bill would have been funded entirely from a special revenue account within FWP, which is supported by vehicle registration fees, the cannabis excise tax, and state park registrations.
“Even with HB 762, this fund would have had a $6 million ending balance. Without the bill, the fund’s balance will now grow to $8.6 million — unused, and continuing to expand.”
In a phone call with the Daily Montanan, Seckinger said he agreed the cost “was not insignificant.”
But if fiscal conservatism is the goal, he said, he would advocate for lowering license plate fees, cannabis taxes, and the other sources of funds for the account.
In his letter, Seckinger also said the bill would have provided a “comprehensive understanding of river use,” and objective, baseline data is needed — “and we need it soon.”
(A separate study out of Montana State University will review popular river stretches not included in the bill.)
In his veto letter, Gianforte, a Republican, agreed that river usage “has increased dramatically in recent years.”
However, he said he believes the state can achieve the same goal over a longer period, potentially using a pilot program to study a portion of the river stretches in the bill.
“The idea of a pilot program is just an example, and over the course of the interim, I look forward to working with the bill sponsor, members of the Legislature, and FWP officials to find a more cost effective way of addressing this important need,” Gianforte said in the letter.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/61CED28A-14EE-495A-B106-057924317CC1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-30 19:05:52.978540

Montana, filed suit in U.S. District Court on Thursday against the federal government over a series of climate and energy policies.
The plaintiffs in the lawsuit, Lighthiser v. Trump, argue three of Trump’s executive orders issued earlier this year to “unleash” the fossil fuel industry and remove climate protections threaten their constitutional rights to life and liberty. 
“President Trump’s EOs falsely claim an energy emergency, while the true emergency is that fossil fuel pollution is destroying the foundation of Plaintiffs’ lives,” the lawsuit states. “These unconstitutional directives have the immediate effect of slowing the buildout of U.S. energy infrastructure that eliminates planet-heating fossil fuel greenhouse gas pollution … and increasing the use of fossil fuels that pollute the air, water, lands, and climate on which Plaintiffs’ lives depend.”
The lead plaintiff, 19-year-old Eva Lighthiser, from Livingston, is one of several Montana plaintiffs who also filed the landmark Held case, which prevailed in Montana District Court and, in late 2024, in the Montana Supreme Court. Lighthiser is joined in the suit by Rikki Held, Lander and Badge Busse — sons of former Democratic gubernatorial candidate Ryan Busse — and five others from the Montana lawsuit, as well as young people from Hawai‘i, Oregon, California, and Florida. 
Plaintiffs from Hawai’i were also involved in a successful youth-led climate lawsuit against the state’s Department of Transportation. 
During a seven-day bench trial before Lewis and Clark District Court Judge Kathy Seeley in 2023, Held and 15 youth plaintiffs were found to have a right to a stable climate system under Montana’s constitutional right to a “clean and healthful environment.”
The Held decision, affirmed by the state Supreme Court in December, is mentioned numerous times in the Lighthiser case, and several of the same law firms are representing the plaintiffs in the new suit.

Eleven federal agencies and their respective agency heads, including the Department of Energy, Department of Transportation, Environmental Protection Agency, and NASA, are named as defendants along with the president. 
Three of Trump’s executive orders — 14156, 14154 and 14261 — declare a “national energy emergency” and direct numerous federal agencies to “unleash American energy” by accelerating oil, gas and coal production on federal lands, and bolster fossil fuel development. They also roll back funding that bolstered climate protections, including through the Inflation Reduction Act. Various clean energy grant programs, including wind, solar battery storage and electric vehicles, were also targeted in the orders. 
The 126-page complaint argues that the federal directives threaten the plaintiffs’ health and wellbeing by accelerating harms from the fossil fuel industry and climate change. 
“Plaintiffs were born into and now live in a destabilized climate system. Fossil fuel pollution has created this emergency—a dangerous situation for Plaintiffs requiring immediate action,” the suit states. “… EPA reports that climate change effects, including heat, displacement, financial or food insecurity, loss of recreation, loss of sleep, and risk of PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder), harm children’s health.”
The plaintiffs are asking for the court to find the three executive orders “and any implementing executive actions” unlawful, unconstitutional and invalid, and seek a permanent injunction against implementing and enforcing the orders. 
In a statement, Deputy White House press secretary Harrison Fields said the executive orders are part of President Donald Trump’s efforts to protect Americans.
“Promoting domestic energy production is crucial for shielding American families from price volatility and securing a stable energy supply for our nation and its allies. The President has a proven history of bolstering American energy production and will restore our nation’s position as a global energy leader,” Fields said in a statement.
A representative for the Department of Justice declined to comment. 
In a press release about the lawsuit, Lighthiser said Trump’s executive orders amount to a “death sentence for my generation.” 
“I’m not suing because I want to — I’m suing because I have to. My health, my future, and my right to speak the truth are all on the line. He’s waging war on us with fossil fuels as his weapon, and we’re fighting back with the Constitution.” 
In the suit, the plaintiffs list harms experienced in their young lives related to climate change, including from longer wildfire seasons that affect their health, increasingly extreme weather patterns that affect their livelihoods, and changes to their local environments and cultural homes. The suit also mentions the executive orders’ effect on decreasing career opportunities for some plaintiffs, through canceled climate science research and study programs. 
The complaint also condemns the federal government’s directives to implement the executive orders by “a wholesale scrubbing, suppression and dismantling of government agencies’ climate science, thereby blinding the government,” and argues that the  President exceeded his constitutional and statutory authority— “acting ultra vires” — in issuing the executive orders. 
The youth are represented by Our Children’s Trust, an Oregon-based law firm, along with Gregory Law Group, McGarvey Law in Kalispell, and Public Justice. 
l“These young plaintiffs refuse to be collateral damage in a fossil fuel war on their future,” lead attorney Julia Olson of Our Children’s Trust said in a press release. “They are demanding accountability where it still matters—in a court of law. The executive branch is not above the Constitution, and these young people are here to prove it.”

Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) renewed his call for the Upper Pecos watershed to be protected from mining claims in a letter sent recently to the top federal forestry official.
In the May 23 letter to U.S. Forest Service Chief Tom Schultz, Heintch notes that watershed is crucial for fishing, agriculture and traditional uses, but “has a history of poorly managed mining projects.”
He noted New Mexico officials are still cleaning up pollution from a 1991 spill when snowmelt flooded an abandoned mine. The slurry spilled into the Pecos River and killed thousands of fish across 11 miles. New Mexico has spent millions of dollars on the cleanup, which remains ongoing.
“I would like to extend an invitation to you to visit New Mexico and the Pecos area so you can hear firsthand from local leaders, Tribes, community members, farmers, business owners, recreationists, and others while experiencing the beauty of this watershed,” Heinrich wrote. “While there, you can see why this river is so valuable and witness the very real threat of mining pollution that still exists.”
The invitation comes as the Trump Administration reversed a decision to temporarily ban new mining development in the Upper Pecos made in December, prompting rebuke from members of the delegation, local officials and Pueblos of Jemez and Tesuque. 
Heinrich’s letter contained additional entreaties from tribal leaders to visit, so Schultz can better understand the region’s importance.
“Water is the blood of the Pueblo and all nearby communities. We cannot afford to again
place our life-giving waters in the hands of foreign-owned mining corporations,” wrote Tesuque Gov. Earl Samuel in a separate letter.
Emails to the U.S. Department of Agriculture requesting comment about the letter and any response from Schultz went unreturned Friday.
Luis Soriano, a spokesperson for Heinrich, said the office had not received a response to the letter as of Friday afternoon.

(Getty Images)Amid national outbreaks, a confirmed measles case hasn’t yet hit Utah — but as nearby states report cases, the highly contagious virus could be closing in. 
Meanwhile, Utah’s childhood vaccination rates have been on a steady decline for years. 
Local and state public health officials say it’s likely a matter of time before the Beehive State gets its first measles case, and they’re bracing for if or when it happens. 
“We’re always looking at cases in other states,” Rich Lakin, immunization program manager at the Utah Department of Health and Human Services, told Utah News Dispatch this week. “We’ve been ready for a long time, but so far so good. We haven’t had any cases here in Utah.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
But to be prepared, Lakin said state public health officials are working with local health departments, clinics, and physicians to ensure they know how to quickly identify a measles case and properly handle it when someone comes in for treatment. 
Nic Rupp, spokesperson for the Salt Lake County Health Department, said county health officials “monitor the status nationwide every day.” 
“We will likely see a case locally as infections get closer geographically and as people travel more this summer,” Rupp said.
In the meantime, he said the Salt Lake County Health Department is encouraging populations with low rates for the MMR vaccine (which protects against measles, mumps and rubella) to get up to date on their shots as part of efforts to minimize the spread of the virus “when a case does show up here.” 
The last reported measles infection in Utah was reported in March 2023, according to state health officials. 
“A person who was not vaccinated traveled outside the U.S. and brought measles back to Utah,” the state’s website says. “We do not believe anyone else in Utah got measles from this person.” 
Before that 2023 case, three people in Utah had measles in February 2017. 
Outbreaks
So far this year Utah’s neighboring state of Colorado has confirmed five cases, according to NBC News’ outbreak tracker. New Mexico has seen 79 cases, 14 of which have been reported in the last four weeks. In Texas, 753 cases have been confirmed, with 60 reported in the last four weeks. 
NM measles cases rise to 78, with possible exposures at Santa Fe and Albuquerque Walmarts

As of Thursday, a total of 1,088 confirmed measles cases have been reported in 2025 from 33 states, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Those include Alaska, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York City, New York State, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and Washington.
Fourteen outbreaks have been reported so far in 2025, and 90% of those confirmed cases (977 of 1,088) have been outbreak associated, according to the CDC. For comparison, 16 outbreaks were reported during 2024, and 69% of cases (198 of 285) were outbreak associated. 
Utah’s vaccination rate is dropping, on pace with regional declines
For several years now, Utah health officials have tracked a decline in the state’s early childhood MMR vaccinations. 
According to the state’s immunization dashboard, the percentage of Utah children that received at least one dose of the MRR vaccine at 24 months old has dropped from 94.5% of those born in 2019 to 89.8% of those born in 2021. 
“It has dropped,” Lakin said. 
  (Courtesy of the Utah Department of Health and Human Services)
He pointed out that the region, which also includes the states of Colorado, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wyoming, has gone from a 98.3% for the birth year of 2019 “all the way down to 86.4%.”
“So the region as a whole is not doing very well,” he said. That concerns public health officials because travelers tend to visit nearby states, “anytime you get cases in other states, then it increases our chances of getting a measles case here in Utah.” 
The ideal vaccination rate to reach herd immunity protection against measles is 95%, he said. Young children are also most at risk if they contract the virus. 
“The thing that would concern us the most would be for an adult to get measles, and then you pass it to a 6-month-old that hasn’t been vaccinated yet,” he said. 
The state’s dashboard is currently using the latest available data from 2023, Lakin said, but state officials are working to update it soon with 2024 data. Health officials expect that Utah’s immunization rate has continued to decline. 
“The expectation is, yes, it is continuing to decline,” he said, though he added, “by how much, I do not know yet.” 
Poll: Belief in false measles claims correlated with lower vaccination rates

State 2023 data shows public school districts tend to have higher immunization rates than charter schools. In Salt Lake County, Canyons, Granite, Jordan, Murray and Salt Lake City school districts, all had more than 95% immunization rates for the second dose of MMR vaccine in K-12 schools, compared to 91.8% in charter schools. 
However, according to that data, only 92.3% of kindergartners in Salt Lake County are up to date on measles vaccination — below the ideal 95% herd immunity threshold. 
Last year, Axios reported Utah has one of the nation’s highest rates of childhood vaccine waivers. Religious exemptions accounted for the fastest-rising share of exemptions since before the pandemic, accounting for 13% of Utah’s waivers last year, up from 5.9% in 2019, according to a state report released last year. The vast majority, however, are attributed to “personal belief,” accounting for 84.9% of the waivers in the 2023 to 2024 school year. 
Measles vaccine is safe and saves lives
Given the troubling pattern of declining vaccination rates across Utah and other states amid deepening distrust of institutions in the U.S., Lakin acknowledged its “difficult” to encourage people to vaccinate their children, but he said health officials will continue to try to ensure Utahns get accurate information. 
“Look at the history,” he said, adding that back in the 1800s, “if your child lived to be an adult, you were very happy. Because they either got smallpox or they got measles or they got mumps, or they got rubella, tetanus, or diphtheria. … I mean, think of all these vaccine preventable diseases that we just don’t see anymore, and it’s because of vaccinations.”
Nonpartisan poll finds ‘remarkably low’ trust in federal health agencies

Lakin said “unfortunately people are losing sight of what these vaccinations are doing and getting the wrong information in such a fast-paced world that we live in now.” 
“They’re not getting the right information anymore,” he said. “That’s what our continued message is — that vaccinations have been one of the greatest public health achievements we have seen, and we want to continue to keep people safe through vaccinations.” 
In a news release issued back in February — after Texas announced the first death of a school-aged child from measles — the Salt Lake County Health Department urged people to ensure they’re protected. 
“For decades, the MMR vaccine has been proven safe and effective,” said Dorothy Adams, executive director of the Salt Lake County Health Department. “Ensuring now that you and your loved ones are adequately protected will help prevent serious illness in our community if this current multistate measles outbreak spreads to Utah.” 
Measles is one of the most contagious viruses known, and it can be so easily spread that people who are not immune have a 90% chance of catching it if they go near an infected person. Someone with measles can spread it to others even before they know they are ill, and the virus can linger in the air for up to two hours after an infected person has left the area.  
Salt Lake County health officials said the best protection against measles is to be immunized with two doses of the MMR vaccine, which can prevent more than 97% of measles infections. In the remaining 3% of cases — when a fully vaccinated person catches measles — the symptoms are milder, the illness is shorter, and the infected person is less likely to spread it. 
Unvaccinated people, including children who are too young to be vaccinated, are more likely to experience severe complications from a measles infection. 



How to know if you’re up to date on measles shots
Measles vaccine recommendations vary based on age and vaccination history. Here’s what public health experts recommend: 

Children should receive two doses of measles vaccine: one dose at 12 to 15 months of age and another at 4 to 6 years. 
Adults born before 1957 generally do not need to be vaccinated because they are likely already immune to measles due to widespread infection and illness before the measles vaccine became available in 1963. 
Adults who were vaccinated before 1968 should have a second dose because the vaccine used from 1963 to 1967 was less effective than the current vaccine, which became available in 1968. 
Adults who were vaccinated in 1968 or later are considered fully protected whether they have one or two doses, though certain higher risk groups (college students, health care workers, international travelers) should have two doses.

(Courtesy of Los Alamos National Laboratory)As New Mexico water and fire managers prepare for increased drought and wildfire danger this summer, Los Alamos National Laboratory officials say the lab has taken steps to mitigate those threats on its campus.
LANL provided a media tour mid-week to highlight those steps, but did not allow outside photography or recording.
“We’re very proud of our preparedness efforts for wildfire,” said Deputy Laboratory Director of Operations Mark Davis from the floor of the Emergency Operations Center, as videos of the 2022 Cerro Pelado fire played across six screens on the wall. “We want to show our efforts to communicate how our mitigation efforts will protect the lab, workforce, community and environment.”
The state has identified the towns of Los Alamos and White Rock as high risk areas for wildfire threats, including LANL, which spans 36 square miles of mesas and canyons. The lab and surrounding town have been evacuated twice in the past 30 years due to fires. That included evacuations for two weeks during the Cerro Grande Fire in 2000, which burned 43,000 acres total, including 45 lab buildings and 7,500 acres of LANL property. Los Alamos evacuated for another 10 days during the 2011 Las Conchas fire, which burned more than 156,000 acres, though only one acre on the lab’s property.
In 2022, during the same time the Hermit’s Peak-Calf Canyon fires raged, the Cerro Pelado fire, also caused by a controlled burn, sparked up and ultimately burned 45,000 acres, requiring the lab to move to remote work in preparation for an evacuation.
In 2022, at the request of the Biden Administration, LANL released its Climate Change Vulnerability Assessment and Resilience Plan, which showed that increased wildfire presented the highest risks to equipment, electricity systems, onsite radioactive waste processing, buildings, water systems and communications systems.
Critics say climate threats to the laboratory are compounding. LANL’s proposed thinning is “a slow job, but certainly necessary,” said Greg Mello, the executive director of nuclear nonproliferation nonprofit Los Alamos Study Group. But he said the hazards with climate change are stacking up.
“We just wish that the laboratory wasn’t straining against every single environmental constraint that there is on that plateau,” Mello said. “The laboratory is too big and trying to do too much in a place that was never appropriate for a laboratory of the present scale, let alone the additional laboratory facilities and staff that they envision.”
The approximately 18,000 people employed at LANL work mostly in science and engineering, from modeling infectious diseases to increasing the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile.
“Our missions are vital and critical to national security and they cannot fail,” Davis said.

The here and now
The Jemez wilderness bears scars from the Cerro Grande and Las Conchas fires. Large bald patches with skinny charred remains of the ponderosa pines stand among scrub oak brush replacing the once-forested area.
Recent scattered rainstorms offered a small reprieve, but the area remains in Stage 1 fire restrictions — an elevated threat level that restricts all campfires or outdoor burning.
Laboratory facilities are interspersed on the top of mesas to higher elevation ponderosa pine forests, separated by canyons and arroyos filled with brush. The lab is bordered by federally managed forests; San Ildefonso and Jemez Pueblos; and Santa Fe and Los Alamos County land.
The patchwork of agencies has complicated firefighting and mitigation efforts in the past, said Jeff Dare, who leads the Emergency Operations Center, but Cerro Pelado offered a framework for more cooperation with members of county government and liaisons for surrounding federal agencies and tribal governments.
The lab is part of the Master Cooperative Wildland Fire Response Agreement, which allocates additional resources such as helicopters and personnel to fight any wildfire that does appear, Dare said, adding: “It protects the laboratory before it can get here.”
 ‘Hope is not a strategy’
The more recent focus has been trimming back the areas around lab buildings, roads and utility lines, said Richard Nieto, LANL’s wildland fire program manager. Trimming has occurred on an estimated 12% to 15% of lab property.

“Hope is not a strategy,” Nieto said, adding that the area needs to better adapt to fires when they happen. “This area was meant to burn; it’s what we have to deal with, ecologically.”
But overgrowth is a challenge. Much of the higher-elevation ponderosa forests sport 400 to 1,300 trees per acre, rather than the healthier 50 to 150 trees per acre, he said. Habitats for two endangered species and archeological sites also require consideration.
Beyond trimming, the lab is working on developing plans for prescribed burns, but will take another three to five years to realize, he said.
Preparations on the plateau
On the other side of lab property, fences looped with concertina wire and sporting signs warning of radiological hazards contain Area G.
Vaguely merengue- shaped white tents — coated in fireproof material — stand amid the juniper and piñon scrub. Inside, under crisscrossed steel frames, stacked white containers on metal pallets contain legacy waste from the lab’s work in the nuclear program.
The facilities are geared to reducing fire concerns, said Gail Helm, the facility operations director for N3B, which is contracted to manage the 10-year $2 billion dollar cleanup of Cold War Era legacy waste. The tents include fire detection and suppression. Concrete barricades surround them to prevent vehicle accidents and potential fires. Under the Stage 1 fire restrictions, a water truck remains onsite at all times.
To the west of Area G lies Technical Area 53, where the lab logs and stores new transuranic nuclear waste — such as gloves contaminated with plutonium — produced at the new plutonium pit production site. The waste is eventually disposed off-site at the Waste Isolation Pilot Project outside of Carlsbad.
Thomas Vigil, the deputy group leader at the Chemical and Waste Facilities said LANL is doing “its due diligence” to follow every protocol to keep the public and workers safe.
“This is my state, this is where we live,” he said. “I live just down the road, and it’s important to me.”

,DC,2025-05-30 22:00:21+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"PBS, Minnesota public TV station sue Trump over executive order cutting off funds",Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/pbs-minnesota-public-tv-station-sue-trump-over-executive-order-cutting-funds,,"WASHINGTON — The Public Broadcasting Service and Lakeland PBS in Minnesota sued the Trump administration Friday, arguing an executive order seeking to cut off their federal funding violates the Constitution and would “upend public television.”The lawsuit was filed just days after a collection of National Public Radio stations sued President Donald Trump over the same executive order, which blocked the Corporation from Public Broadcasting from funding the networks.PBS wrote in its 48-page filing that it disagrees with claims made by the executive order, including that federal spending on public media is “corrosive to the appearance of journalistic independence” and that the news organization doesn’t present “a fair, accurate, or unbiased portrayal of current events to taxpaying citizens.”“PBS disputes those charged assertions in the strongest possible terms,” the lawsuit states. “But regardless of any policy disagreements over the role of public television, our Constitution and laws forbid the President from serving as the arbiter of the content of PBS’s programming, including by attempting to defund PBS.”The case was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, but hadn’t been assigned to a judge as of Friday evening.White House: PBS supports ‘a particular political party’White House principal deputy press secretary Harrison Fields wrote in a statement responding to the lawsuit that the “Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) is creating media to support a particular political party on the taxpayers’ dime.“Therefore, the President is exercising his lawful authority to limit funding to NPR and PBS. The President was elected with a mandate to ensure efficient use of taxpayer dollars, and he will continue to use his lawful authority to achieve that objective.”The lawsuit says Trump’s executive order violates the law that governs the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which gives it independence from politicians who might try to control its programs.“Congress took pains to ensure that the development of public television would be free from political interference, including with respect to content and funding decisions,” the suit states.It also claims implementing the order would violate the First Amendment of the Constitution.“The EO makes no attempt to hide the fact that it is cutting off the flow of funds to PBS because of the content of PBS programming and out of a desire to alter the content of speech,” the lawsuit states. “That is blatant viewpoint discrimination and an infringement of PBS and PBS Member Stations’ private editorial discretion.”PBS says federal funds ‘instrumental’ for operationsThe lawsuit says the loss of funding from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting envisioned in the executive order would upend programming at PBS and its member stations throughout the country.“Public television stations receive approximately $325 million in annual federal funding from CPB, nearly all of which goes to PBS Member Stations,"" the lawsuit states. ""Those funds, which comprise more than 50% of the overall budgets of certain PBS Member Stations, are instrumental to enabling them to operate, to produce programming that serves their local communities, and to pay PBS dues that make PBS programming and services possible.”",,,,2025-05-30 18:06:14.949870

Protect AR Rights and For AR Kids filed a motion to intervene in the case […],"Efforts to collect signatures for two proposed ballot measures for the 2026 election will begin this fall, following the attorney general's approval of ballot language Thursday. (Mary Hennigan/Arkansas Advocate)The League of Women Voters of Arkansas and the state attorney general argued in federal court filings this week that two ballot question committees are not entitled to intervene in the League’s lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of direct democracy laws.
Protect AR Rights and For AR Kids filed a motion to intervene in the case on May 14, arguing that their interests aren’t “adequately represented” because the League’s suit didn’t challenge all the laws they intended to. The committees also argued that intervening is more efficient than filing a separate lawsuit, which they said would likely be consolidated with the League’s complaint under federal court rules. 
Arkansas grassroots organizations seek to intervene in lawsuit challenging direct democracy laws 

In its response to the motion, which was filed by Little Rock attorney David Couch on Wednesday, the League of Women Voters of Arkansas and ballot question committee Save AR Democracy (SARD) argue the two ballot question committees don’t have standing and have no right to intervene because they are not questioning LWVAR’s ability to challenge the laws in the original complaint. 
LWVAR filed a federal lawsuit against the Arkansas secretary of state in April alleging that eight recently approved state laws governing direct democracy violate the First and 14th amendments to the U.S. Constitution. 
Direct democracy is the process by which Arkansans can propose new laws or constitutional amendments and place them on the ballot for a statewide vote. Arkansas is one of 24 states that allow citizen-led initiatives, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
The motion to intervene from Protect AR Rights and For AR Kids seeks to challenge two laws not included in the League of Women Voters’ suit — Act 602 of 2025, which prohibits ballot titles from being written above an eighth-grade reading level, and Act 236 of 2023, which mandates petition signatures must be collected from at least 50 counties instead of 15 as directed in the Arkansas Constitution, according to court filings. 
Protect AR Rights and For AR Kids also seek to add an additional defendant, Attorney General Tim Griffin, who is not a party to the pending litigation but is counsel for the secretary of state, which would further complicate the matter, according to LWVAR’s response. 
Grade-level requirement
In the defendant’s response, also filed Wednesday, Griffin noted that when he certified For AR Kids’ popular name and ballot title for a proposed education-related constitutional amendment on Feb. 26, the ballot title didn’t need to meet the reading-level requirement because Act 602 was not yet in effect.
The League and Save AR Democracy made the same point in their filing to argue that For AR Kids lacks standing to challenge the reading-level law. 
Protect AR Rights submitted its own proposed direct-democracy ballot title on May 19 that’s still under review by the attorney general. LWVAR argues this group also does not have standing because its proposed ballot title has not been rejected because of Act 602. 
LWVAR argues that challenging Act 602 is further complicated because Griffin substituted and certified Save AR Democracy’s ballot title on May 21 so that it would meet the eighth-grade reading level test. 
“Even if Protect AR Rights had standing, the inclusion of that issue in the litigation would unnecessarily complicate this matter,” the response states. “Nothing would prohibit Protect AR Rights from instituting litigation if it is denied a ballot title to meet the eighth grade reading level test.”
Griffin argues that the motion to intervene should be denied because Protect AR Rights is the only party that can challenge Act 602. This is also the only claim that can be made against the attorney general, he said. 
State law requires the attorney general to certify or reject proposed ballot titles within 10 business days. The deadline for a response to Protect AR Rights’ proposal is June 3. Because it is still under review, allowing the ballot question committee to intervene “would require finding an injury in fact where such harm is hypothetical and not concrete,” Griffin wrote. 
“Because Plaintiff SARD was able to satisfy the Act 602 requirement, the court has to resort to speculation to determine that Protect AR Rights’ ballot title could never be at an eighth-grade reading level,” he said. “For the same reasons, Protect AR Rights cannot bring a cause of action against Attorney General Griffin.”
County signatures
Regarding the proposed intervenors’ challenge to the 2023 law requiring signatures from 50 counties, LWVAR’s response notes that this law is already being challenged by the League in Pulaski County Circuit Court. The case has been fully argued, briefed and is awaiting the court’s ruling. 
Plaintiffs argue there is no need for the claim to be pursued at this time and if it were allowed, it should be held in abeyance under the Pullman Doctrine, which provides that federal courts defer to state courts if the state ruling would resolve the federal issue. 
“The issue before the Circuit Court is simply, can the Arkansas General Assembly amend the Arkansas State Constitution by statute? The League believes that it cannot, and a ruling in its favor would resolve the federal issue,” according to court documents.
Griffin also cited the Pullman Doctrine and noted that the losing party in the case is expected to appeal to the Arkansas Supreme Court. 
“Thus, the [federal] Court should abstain from exercising jurisdiction over this claim, which is only being made by Movants to intervene,” he wrote. “Standing alone, this claim cannot be a basis for Movants to be entitled to intervention.” 
Additional concerns
LWVAR further argues that Protect AR Rights’ proposed ballot measure “would conflict with and be in direct competition with” Save AR Democracy’s approved measure because both seek to amend Article 5, Section 1 of the state Constitution, which governs the state’s initiative and referendum process. 
“It would be improper for the Protect AR Rights to intervene in litigation filed by SARD to get a measure approved that directly competes with the measure already approved and being circulated by SARD, in that it would create unnecessary conflict,” according to LWVAR’s response. 
Save AR Democracy also argues Protect AR Rights’ proposed ballot measure contradicts with a claim made in the complaint — that the “exhaustive list of disqualifying offenses” that prohibits individuals from collecting signatures is unconstitutional. 
“The measure submitted by Protect AR Rights to the Attorney General for approval would enshrine this very prohibition in the Arkansas constitution,” the response says. “This represents a core political and policy difference between SARD and Protect AR Rights and would inject unnecessary controversy and conflict into the litigation.”
Protect AR Rights’ proposal also sets forth a procedure regarding a legal challenge to the ballot title that “differs substantially” from Save AR Democracy’s procedure. 
Save AR Democracy’s measure would require an approved ballot title to be submitted to the secretary of state who publishes notice of approval and the procedure for challenging the approval. The measure would establish a 45-day window during which a challenge could be filed with the Arkansas Supreme Court. 
The Protect AR Rights measure would require a challenge to be filed within 10 business days of the attorney general sending the sponsor a letter approving the ballot title, but it provides for no notice. Providing the public “adequate notice and opportunity” is essential to due process, the response states.

According to Alyssa Chen, a coordinator with Education Justice, schools in Montpelier and Brattleboro also held protests.READ MORE
At Champlain Valley Union High School, the May 21 protest was particularly resonant. Last month, two of the students’ peers chose to leave the country in response to the federal government’s attempt to revoke the humanitarian protections granting them legal residence. The teens were originally from Nicaragua, a country that has been experiencing state-led violence and repression since 2018. They had been sponsored by a local family member and looked forward to furthering their education in the United States. Faced with potential deportation and an uncertain future, they chose to leave instead.While, as with the two high school students, the impact of some of the changes in the Trump administration’s immigration policies have been acute in the district, the student protest rejected a broad swath of the federal government’s actions, including the administration’s challenge to birthright citizenship.“We can’t control every decision made by those in power, but we can control how we show up for each other, and when we lead with empathy, when we choose compassion over fear, that’s when real change begins,” Lily Williams, one of the senior class co-presidents said to the students gathered.Armed with signs bearing slogans such as “Borders shouldn’t define humanity,” and “Education not deportation,” the students marched down the sidewalk beside the school.Champlain Valley Union High School students walked out of class last week to protest federal immigraiont policy. Photo by Briana Brady/Shelburne NewsThe school administration was on board with the student action. One of their librarians provided a speaker system and microphone. Other teachers and staff, decked out in reflective vests, helped guide the teens safely through the parking lot. Their principal, Katherine Riley, stood nearby.For Olivia Ceiri, a sophomore and member of the school’s Racial Alliance Committee, this action was just one of many she encouraged students to take, suggesting that they build a habit of standing up for what they believed.“If we are willing to commit our time, love and well-being to the betterment of others, we will not be denied. We pledge to each other our responsibility to act and agree to stand by our values no matter the cost,” Ceiri said.The Education Justice Coalition of Vermont, which helped organize students across the state wanted to support the students to plan the walkouts themselves.“I’ve been working with like, half a dozen youth leaders, and several dozen other youth who have been attending weekly meetings on and off to plan the walkout so that it’s coordinated and supported. And so, mainly, we created a toolkit,” Chen said.In this way, the coalition wasn’t just leading the students in protest. As Ceiri wanted, they were teaching the kids how to lead each other in protest.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Champlain Valley Union students protest immigration policies.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/cvu-protest-1.jpg,,,2025-05-30 18:06:14.949870

If you or someone you know may be experiencing a mental health crisis, contact the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline by calling or texting “988” or chatting online at http://988lifeline.org/.
A 64-year-old man from Cuba started strangling himself and saying he was going to kill himself after federal agents arrested him at the Miami immigration court on Friday morning.
Jesus Rodriguez Delgado, 64, started yelling in Spanish that he would kill himself rather than be sent back to Cuba, said Karla De Anda, a community advocate who called for help as U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents struggled to remove Rodriguez Delgado’s handcuffed hands from his neck.
“It was the most horrible thing I’ve seen in my life,” De Anda said in Spanish. “Hopefully, they’ll help him because he can’t go back to Cuba.”
The man’s reaction wasn’t surprising to his partner, Elisavel Torres, who told Florida Phoenix from inside the courthouse that Rodriguez Delgado had been a political prisoner in Cuba for 28 years and had lived in Mexico for six years before coming to the U.S. De Anda added that Rodriguez Delgado had said he had been imprisoned and would be killed if deported to Cuba.
Torres wept as she said that she couldn’t understand why the judge agreed to dismiss Rodriguez Delgado’s deportation case — exposing him to expedited removal. An application for permanent residency that Rodriguez Delgado submitted in January states he entered the country under humanitarian parole in 2021. Torres said Rodriguez Delgado received a work permit in April.
“He had told me he wouldn’t go back to Cuba, that he would die first, and it will be that way,” Torres told the Phoenix in Spanish.
ICE and Homeland Security Investigations officials arrested at least seven people during the four hours that the Phoenix reporter observed activity inside the courthouse.
Reports emerged last week of arrests in immigration courts across the country after judges dismissed cases at the request of the Department of Homeland Security. Still, Rodriguez Delgado’s attempt to strangle himself was the strongest reaction advocates witnessed on Friday. Others arrested cried and some remained quiet and looked at the ground.
‘You show up and get deported anyway’: Migrants with court hearings face an impossible choice

The agents told Torres that they would make sure Rodriguez Delgado was OK and would give him a list of pro bono attorneys, but couldn’t at the time of his arrest say where he would go. Torres, a U.S. citizen, said the couple knew about the arrests but still decided to come to the hearing from Naples rather than requesting an online hearing.
“We had faith in God that we were doing everything right, so we said we would come in person,” Torres said. “What a huge mistake.”
Her tears intensified as she told Rodriguez Delgado’s daughter about her father’s arrest over the phone.
“I was born in this country, and I am ashamed to say I’m American,” Torres said, adding that there were no words to describe how she felt when federal agents placed her partner in handcuffs.
Immigrants lack legal representation
Immigration attorney Cindy Blandon told the Phoenix that she’s noticed those who end up arrested for expedited removal lack lawyers. Few people in the court on Friday morning had attorneys, with some citing money as a barrier to obtaining legal representation.
Having an ongoing asylum or permanent residency case doesn’t exempt people from expedited deportations, Blandon said.
“Being placed under an expedited removal process doesn’t mean your case is closed,” she said. “People have a right to due process. The problem is that if you don’t have legal representation and you don’t know how to navigate the situation, you will likely end up deported.”
The mood on various floors of the courthouse grew more tense as people awaiting hearings heard about or saw the arrests.
But Blandon, De Anda, and Maria Asuncion Bilbao, with the American Friends Service Committee, noted that the arrests in the court appeared much calmer compared to the mass raids, such as the one that took place in Tallahassee on Thursday.

(Jordan Hansen / Daily Montanan)Potentially dangerous and possibly record-breaking warm weather is headed to western Montana this weekend.
On Thursday, the National Weather Service Office in Missoula issued a heat advisory from noon to 9 p.m. on Saturday. Temperatures in the upper 80s and 90s are expected for a wide swath of western Montana stretching from the Canadian border down through the Flathead, Missoula and Bitterroot valleys.
NWS Meteorologist Jennifer Kitzmiller, based in Missoula, said seeing temperatures in the 90s this early in the year was atypical. Anaconda, Eureka, Libby and Phillipsburg are some of the places that could approach their daily high record mark, if not break it.
“We’re looking at setting records for daily high temperatures tomorrow and a lot of places in western Montana,” Kitzmiller said. “And previous records date back to 1986 … we haven’t seen temperatures this warm, this time of year, for like 40 years.”
The heat is being driven by a strong ridge of high pressure in the West, according to a NWS national report. Temperatures are expected to dip back down on Sunday.
“It’s not going to be hugely different, but it’ll cool us back down,” Kitzmiller said.
The weather service also issued some recommendations, including drinking plenty of water and staying out of direct sunlight. 
Warm weather also draws people to bodies of water, especially on a weekend, which can add a degree of danger. May 24 was particularly deadly as a woman drowned near Missoula near Maclay Bridge and a kayaker died near Craig. Additionally, a 68-year old Missoula man last seen on Wednesday is presumed to have drowned near the Lochsa River in Idaho.
Lifevests should always be worn when on or in the water, and a close eye should be kept on children. Additionally, alcohol can enhance hypothermia, and cold water can make even experienced swimmers lose muscle control.
“The rivers and streams are still running fast and cold,” Kitzmiller said. “And there’s that extra threat, despite the warm temperatures, for hypothermia.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/BigHoleRiver-Stock-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-30 18:06:14.949870

“All of these red states, I think we’re late to the party,” said South Carolina state Rep. Beth Bernstein, a Democrat who sponsored a bill this year to increase state employees’ paid parental leave from six to 12 weeks. It passed the majority-Republican South Carolina House in April with strong bipartisan support.
This year, Alabama, Iowa and Mississippi joined 37 other states in granting paid parental leave to thousands of state workers.
The trend has gathered steam in recent years. Some experts link it to the cascade of state abortion bans that followed the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2022 Dobbs decision, which dismantled the federal right to abortion. Under fire from critics to do more to care for babies once they’re born, at least a dozen conservative-led states with abortion bans have since granted or expanded paid parental leave for their state employees.
But others say the increasing bipartisan support for measures that help working parents is also a reaction to economic realities.
“What we’ve seen, especially in more conservative states, is the public sector has experienced a lot of turnover,” said Kameron Dawson, legal director of the Southern Office of A Better Balance, a legal organization focused on workplace rights. “They’re looking for tools to recruit younger employees.”
Paid parental leave is the time off granted to workers for the birth or adoption of a baby, to care for a child, or to recover from a stillbirth or miscarriage. Without it, employees are left to cobble together their sick leave and vacation leave — or go unpaid — to stay home with a child and heal.










We’re trying to attract and retain state employees and teachers, and we’re in competition with everyone around us, and the private sector as well. 


– Alabama Republican state Rep. Ginny Shaver


Alabama Republican state Rep. Ginny Shaver watched her daughter, a public school teacher, struggle to get the leave she needed after the births of her children in recent years.
“With her second, she had complications in her pregnancy and used up her [paid vacation and sick] leave before she even had the baby,” Shaver told Stateline. Her daughter contracted COVID-19, and the baby had to spend time in neonatal intensive care. “It was a very difficult time, and she had to take unpaid leave.”
Last year, Shaver and Democratic state Sen. Vivian Figures worked to win approval of a paid parental leave bill for state employees. It failed.
But they tried again this year. With the support of Republican Gov. Kay Ivey, the state legislature — which has a Republican supermajority — passed it nearly unanimously. The new law gives female state employees, including teachers, eight weeks of paid parental leave in connection with birth, stillbirth or miscarriage, and gives male employees two weeks. Adoptive parents get eight weeks for one parent and two for the other.
Shaver said she thinks the law passed thanks to vocal support from the governor and increased awareness of the issue due to the work she and Figures did in previous sessions.
“And the fact that all of the southeast states around us offered it,” Shaver said. “We’re trying to attract and retain state employees and teachers, and we’re in competition with everyone around us, and the private sector as well.”
Keeping talent
For many Republicans, the workforce development argument for paid leave is a persuasive one. For states such as Alabama and South Carolina that have some of the lowest workforce participation rates in the nation, paid leave can be a tool to keep more people — particularly women — working. And it can be a way to retain educators as many states struggle with teacher shortages in K-12 schools.
“For several years we’ve seen state legislatures acknowledging the importance of child care to businesses and the economy,” said Feroza Freeland, policy director at the Southern Office of A Better Balance. “But in the last few years, we’ve seen a growing recognition that paid leave is another piece of that puzzle.”
States have taken up the issue because the federal government has not. The United States is a global outlier; among 38 peer nations, it’s the only one that doesn’t mandate paid parental leave, according to the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development. The group comprises 38 democracies with market-based economies.
The federal Family and Medical Leave Act, passed in 1993 and extended in 2020, only requires public agencies and companies with at least 50 employees to give up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for parents of newborns or newly adopted children, or caregivers of sick family members.
Gov. Kim Reynolds calls Iowa ‘a pro-family state’
During his first term, President Donald Trump publicly supported some forms of paid family leave and signed a defense bill that gives 12 weeks of paid parental leave to most federal employees.
Paid family leave was a signature issue for his daughter Ivanka Trump, at the time a senior adviser to the president. She even held a paid leave and child care summit at the White House in late 2019.
That set the stage for other Republicans to take up the issue more publicly. And after the Dobbs decision, family-friendly policies have increasingly become conservative talking points in states with restrictive abortion laws.
After the Mississippi House unanimously passed a paid parental leave bill earlier this year, Republican House Speaker Jason White celebrated the bill as a reflection of Mississippi’s status as a “pro-life state.”
In a post on X this week announcing her signing of a new paid parental leave law, Iowa Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds called Iowa “a pro-family state.”
North Carolina was one of the first Southern states to grant paid parental leave to state workers in 2019 when then-Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, signed an executive order. In 2023, several months after the Dobbs decision, the state’s majority-Republican legislature extended paid parental leave to public school employees by tacking it onto a law banning most abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy.
Meanwhile, Indiana Republican Gov. Mike Braun signed an executive order in March to add up to eight additional weeks of paid leave for “childbirth recovery” to the state’s existing four weeks of paid parental leave.
Iowa law gives four weeks of paid leave
The new laws won’t apply to most residents, because they only cover state employees. But they could have a downstream effect.
Shaver, the Alabama lawmaker, said she hopes her state’s new law will not only help the state be competitive with the private sector, but also set a precedent for other employers to follow.
“I hope they will see it’s in their benefit to offer what they can,” she said. “It may not be eight or 12 weeks, but even offering a reduced or flexible work schedule can help families.”
Just over a quarter of private-sector workers have access to paid family leave through their employer as of March 2023, according the most recent data from the U.S. Department of Labor.
Among the lowest-wage earners, that share drops to 6%.
State paid leave programs run the gamut in terms of what they offer. While Alabama’s new law offers up to eight weeks of leave for all state employees, including teachers, Mississippi’s offers six and does not require public schools to offer paid parental leave to their employees.
Iowa’s new law grants four weeks of paid leave for the birth or adoption of a child and one week of paid paternity leave. Tennessee’s law, passed in 2023, only offers paid leave to workers in the state’s executive and judicial branches.
But a few states are already expanding their offerings: Last year, Georgia legislators voted to double paid parental leave from three to six weeks.
And some states have gone further than just state employees: 13 states and the District of Columbia have mandated paid family leave for all workers, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center. Most of those states are located in New England or on the West Coast and all are Democratic-led. Ten more offer voluntary paid family leave statewide that’s provided through private insurance.
Sandwich generation
Experts say the shift in attitude toward family-friendly policies can also be attributed to a generational shift.
“A lot of younger lawmakers are more willing to champion the issue of paid leave,” said Freeland, of A Better Balance. “They’re understanding it because they’re seeing it in their own lives, or seeing friends and family members going through this.”
In South Carolina, Bernstein’s bill faced some opposition from members of the state’s ultra-conservative Freedom Caucus and Family Caucus. Some lawmakers questioned the potential costs of the bill, or criticized it as government overreach.
South Carolina Republican state Rep. Josiah Magnuson, a member of the Freedom Caucus, said he believed the bill would be a financial burden on public school districts that could lead to raised taxes.
“You’re saying, let’s tax the people of South Carolina, most of whom don’t get paid parental leave, and give them to state employees who already have six weeks’ paid parental leave,” Magnuson told lawmakers in April before the House voted to pass the bill.
He also said he doesn’t like that the increased paid leave “puts the foot in the door a little more for the government to be involved in the home.”
The opposition frustrated Bernstein, who pointed out that the state’s 2022 law that granted six weeks of paid parental leave passed the legislature almost unanimously. This year’s bill expanding that leave passed the House but hasn’t seen movement in the Senate. It can be picked up again when the legislature returns in January.
Other South Carolina Republicans backed the bill, citing their own families’ experiences following the birth of their children, reported the South Carolina Daily Gazette.
More conservative states are also responding to the needs of “sandwich generation” employees who may be caring for aging parents as well as children, Freeland said.
Earlier this year, Tennessee became the first Southern state to expand its state paid leave policy beyond just parental leave. The state legislature voted almost unanimously to extend its six-week paid leave policy to cover state workers providing end-of-life care to a family member.
“We’re seeing a growing recognition that people need support for these types of family or caregiving needs,” said Freeland, “and that it strengthens the workforce and economy to be able to provide that.”

State regulators have reinstated the license of an Iowa insurance agent who was convicted of falsifying records that resulted in increased commissions.
State records indicate that in February 2024, Country Mutual Insurance notified the Iowa Insurance Division that it had fired one of its agents, Pablo Castillo of Norwalk, for allegedly submitting forged documents that he had created to establish clients’ eligibility for coverage and to provide them with discounts on home insurance.
It was alleged that in order to sell an auto insurance policy to three separate consumers, Castillo fabricated letters from another insurance company to falsely suggest each of the consumers had no prior gaps in their insurance coverage. In a fourth case, Castillo allegedly fabricated a letter from State Farm Insurance to explain a consumer’s involvement in two accidents.

Castillo was also accused of fabricating roofing invoices from fictitious businesses for at least four clients as a way of enhancing the value of any subsequent claims related to roof repairs.
In October 2024, the Iowa Insurance Division charged Castillo, 38, with engaging unfair, deceptive and dishonest conduct. Division records indicate that at a hearing on the matter, Castillo admitted falsifying the records, explaining that he did so to ensure his clients would be covered.
Iowa Insurance Commissioner Douglas Ommen subsequently suspended Castillo’s license for 30 days, stating that he found Castillo to be “a sincere, well-intentioned individual with generally good moral character.”
In November 2024, Polk County prosecutors charged Castillo with fraudulent sales practices and felony insurance fraud for falsifying records so he would “earn commissions on his sales that would otherwise be denied by the company.”
In April 2025, Castillo pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of misdemeanor tampering with records. He was sentenced to two years of probation, fined $855 fine, and granted a deferred judgment that will seal any court records related to the conviction upon the successful completion of probation.
Earlier this month, the Iowa Insurance Division ordered that Castillo’s license be reinstated. Pursuant to the 2024 suspension order, Castillo will be required to file with the division a periodic “summary of his work in the business of insurance.”

,DC,2025-05-30 21:30:25+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Trump ‘blatant’ refusal to comply in deportation case shows growing rift with judges,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-blatant-refusal-comply-deportation-case-shows-growing-rift-judges,,"WASHINGTON — A federal judge in Maryland slammed the Trump administration Friday for its “blatant lack of effort to comply” with her order earlier this month to report steps taken to facilitate the return of a second wrongly deported man to a notorious mega-prison in El Salvador.“Defendants’ untimely response is the functional equivalent of, ‘We haven’t done anything and don’t intend to,’” U.S. District Judge Stephanie Gallagher, whom President Donald Trump appointed in 2018, wrote in her order blasting a nonresponse from the Department of Homeland Security.“Telling this Court that ‘[i]t is DHS’s understanding that Cristian is in the custody of El Salvador,’ adds nothing to the underlying record and simply reflects a lack of any effort to obtain or provide information regarding Cristian’s ‘current physical location and custodial status,’” she wrote.Friday’s order from Gallagher is the latest scathing remark from federal judges who have found the Trump administration either violated their preliminary injunctions or restraining orders, or have broadly invoked executive privileges to stonewall information in immigration cases.Gallagher, like other federal judges who have found themselves in the spotlight for blocking immigration-related policies, raised concerns about the Trump administration skirting due process rights and slow-walking rectifying deportation mistakes as the government continues its aggressive campaign of mass deportations.Officials at the White House, the Department of Homeland Security and President Donald Trump himself have continued to claim broad authority to conduct immigration removals. They have lashed out against the judges, labeling them as “activists” and accusing them of blocking the Trump administration’s agenda.“Its very important that we're able to get these people out fast,” Trump said during a press availability in the Oval Office Friday. “We have judges that don't want that to happen. It's a terrible thing.” Violating removal protectionsTwo cases of men whom the administration sent to El Salvador despite court orders blocking their removals stemmed from the first major case of the administration apparently disregarding a judicial order: a temporary restraining order from U.S. District Judge James E. Boasberg not to remove migrants under the 1798 Alien Enemies Act.Despite the mid-March temporary restraining order from Boasberg, three planes landed in El Salvador hours later and roughly 300 men were sent to the Salvadoran mega-prison Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo, or CECOT. Maryland resident Kilmar Abrego Garcia, and a 20-year-old referred to in court documents only by the pseudonym Cristian, whose case Gallagher is handling, were among them.Abrego Garcia had, since 2019, a court order protecting him from deportation to his home country of El Salvador because an immigration judge was concerned he would face gang violence if returned.Cristian, who arrived in the U.S. as an unaccompanied minor, was part of a class action that barred removal from the U.S. while his asylum case was pending in immigration court.In both cases, the administration has said it is powerless to compel the Salvadoran government to release them, an argument Gallagher expressed frustration with Friday.“Defendants simply reiterated their well-worn talking points on their reasons for removing Cristian and failed to provide any of the information the Court required,” Gallagher wrote.The U.S. is paying El Salvador up to $15 million to detain removed immigrants.“As a Venezuelan native, he is in El Salvador only because the United States sent him there pursuant to an agreement apparently reached with the government of El Salvador,” Gallagher wrote.Judges see pattern of defianceIn Abrego Garcia’s high-profile case, U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis, also in Maryland, said “nothing has been done” by the Trump administration to facilitate Abrego Garcia’s return. Administration officials have admitted he was mistakenly deported to CECOT.Xinis recently denied the Department of Justice’s request for an extra 30 days to submit documents on its efforts to return Abrego Garcia.He remains in a lower-level prison in El Salvador, despite a Supreme Court order from April that directed the Trump administration to facilitate his return to the U.S.A judge in Massachusetts found the Trump administration violated his preliminary injunction barring third-country removals of migrants without due process after eight men were deported to South Sudan and given less than 24 hours to challenge their removal to a county on the cusp of another civil war.Boasberg, who sits in a federal court in the District of Columbia, found probable cause to hold Trump officials in contempt for violating his temporary restraining order that ordered deportation planes carrying men removed under the Alien Enemies Act to be returned to the U.S. over concerns they did not receive due process.The Trump administration has challenged all those decisions on an emergency basis to the U.S. Supreme Court.‘A judge in Boston running foreign policy’Top administration figures have argued it is the judges who have overstepped, trespassing on the executive branch’s role in setting foreign policy.In the Oval Office Friday, Trump singled out U.S. District Judge Brian E. Murphy, who is overseeing the case in Massachusetts.“You can’t have a judge in Boston running foreign policy in places all over the country because he has a liberal bent or he’s a radical left person,” Trump said.Murphy was appointed by former President Joe Biden.That case, which centers on removing migrants to a country they are not citizens of, could play an outsized role in the legal battle over the administration’s approach to immigration after Supreme Court decisions this month have allowed the Trump administration to end two temporary legal programs and exposed more than 800,000 immigrants to potential deportation.Many of those who lost protections hail from countries that are deemed too dangerous for return.‘Get them out rapidly’The Trump administration has publicly stated Abrego Garcia will not return and accused him, without producing evidence, that he is a leader of the MS-13 gang.The president has also acknowledged that if he wanted to, he could secure the return of Abrego Garcia from El Salvador. But Trump said he would not, alleging that Abrego Garcia has gang ties.The president posted pictures on social media of Boasberg, who was pressing Department of Justice attorneys for answers on if his order was deliberately violated. It prompted a rare response from Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts, who stressed the importance of an independent judiciary.While the Supreme Court eventually lifted Boasberg's nationwide injunction on the use of the Alien Enemies Act, federal judges in Colorado and parts of New York and Texas have blocked use of the wartime law within their districts, citing concerns about due process.Top Trump officials, such as Deputy White House Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, have floated suspending habeas corpus, which allows people who believe they are being unlawfully detained to petition for their release in court.Habeas corpus claims are currently the only avenue that Venezuelans subject to the Alien Enemies Act have to challenge their deportation under the wartime law.“We can't keep them for years here as they go through trial,” Trump said Friday of swift deportations. “We have to get them out rapidly.” Abrego Garcia and CristianIn an April order, Gallagher wrote that Cristian’s case is similar to Abrego Garcia’s and that “like Judge Xinis in the Abrego Garcia matter, this court will order Defendants to facilitate Cristian's return to the United States so that he can receive the process he was entitled to under the parties' binding Settlement Agreement.”In that order, Gallagher said the federal government must show “a good faith request to the government of El Salvador to release Cristian to U.S. custody for transport back to the United States to await the adjudication of his asylum application on the merits by (U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services).”On May 6, she affirmed her decision that the Trump administration must facilitate Cristian’s return, but put her own order on pause to allow for Department of Justice attorneys to appeal to the 4th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals.The appeals court declined the Trump administration's request to pause her order.Gallagher said Friday she would give the Trump administration officials until Monday to “remedy their noncompliance.”",,,,2025-05-30 18:06:14.949870

(John Coletti/The Image Bank)The U.S. Department of Energy announced Friday the cancellation of 24 awards issued by the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations that impacts
two businesses in Alabama.
American Cast Iron Pipe Company and United States Pipe and Foundry Company, LLC were both set to receive $75 million in grant money from the Department of Energy but will no longer receive the funding in light of the grants getting canceled. 
“While the previous administration failed to conduct a thorough financial review before signing away billions of taxpayer dollars, the Trump administration is doing our due diligence to ensure we are utilizing taxpayer dollars to strengthen our national security, bolster affordable, reliable energy sources and advance projects that generate the highest possible return on investment,” said U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright said in a DOE press release. “Today, we are acting in the best interest of the American people by cancelling these 24 awards.”
A message was left with both companies Friday seeking comment.
According to a press release, American Cast Iron Pipe Company made it to the negotiation stage of the awards process and was planning to use the funding to replace single cupola furnaces with four coreless induction furnaces. This would have reduced the facility’s CO2 emissions by an estimated 62% and the melting/holding process CO2 emissions by 95%. 
The U.S. Pipe and Foundry Company said in a press release that they planned to use the money for Phase 1 of U.S. Pipe’s Iron Electric Induction Conversion project. The project involved replacing a coke-fired furnace with electric induction melting furnaces and would have resulted in an “estimated 73% reduction in carbon intensity at the Alabama Works ductile iron pipe production facility.”
Of the 24 awards given, nearly 70% were signed between Election Day last year and Jan. 20. By cancelling the awards, the Department of Energy is generating $3.6 billion in savings for Americans. 
The DOE said the awards have been terminated because they “failed to advance the energy needs of the American people, were not economically viable and would not generate a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Birmingham-Alabama-1024x680.jpg,,,2025-05-30 18:06:14.949870

The passage of Legislative Bill 647 was delayed because State Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha wanted to remove State Sen. Tony Sorrentino’s proposal due to what she called a broken “agreement” regarding State Sen. Ashlei Spivey of Omaha, which would have helped schools fund long-term substitutes so teachers could take paid time off around significant life events.  
State Sen. Brad von Gillern of the Elkhorn area said there was no “agreement” with the Legislature’s Revenue Committee. 
“There was no deal,” he said. “I was invited into a conversation to talk about the bills that were at play, including Senator [​Ashlei Spivey]’s bill. I told the participants in that meeting clearly that I will not make a deal. Each bill needs to stand on its own.”
The “deal” involved a bipartisan group on the Education Committee and the state’s largest teachers’ union — which led to a month-long effort to get a package of proposals out of committee. That package is dead, replaced by a watered-down clean-up bill. 
LB 647 advanced 35-13. That tally included the support of two Democrats, State Sen. Eliot Bostar of Lincoln and Dan Quick of Grand Island. Bostar said that he voted against including Sorrentino’s proposal during the last round of debate but decided to vote for LB 647 as a whole because it was needed to balance the budget. State Sen. Dan Quick of Grand Island said his constituents have asked to be in favor of Sorrenino’s proposal. 
At least 42 states already allow such savings accounts to cover tuition at K-12 private schools, which was first allowed federally in 2018 after congressional passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, for up to $10,000 per beneficiary per year. A 529 savings plan — in Nebraska, NEST 529 — offers tax breaks to encourage families or students to donate and allows the savings to grow tax-free and be used for an approved educational purpose. 
Nebraska voters in November repealed the state’s new school voucher or scholarship program that was set to steer public dollars to private schools, though conservative lawmakers and Gov. Jim Pillen have pledged to keep trying to pass a replacement.  Public school advocates have argued against using public funds for that purpose and said voucher programs in other states have bled public money needed for public education.

SPRINGFIELD — Terminally ill Illinoisans may have the legal option to end their own life with the help of a physician next year under a bill approved by lawmakers Thursday.

The procedure, which advocates and the bill call “medical aid in dying,” would give people in a sound mental state with severe health issues the option to end their life with the help of a doctor.

Under Senate Bill 1950, doctors would be allowed to prescribe terminally ill patients a lethal dose of medication that they could self-administer at a time of their choice.

Advocates for the procedure, which is legal in 10 states and the District of Columbia, say it provides agency to people at the end of their life.

“I want to enjoy the time I have left with my family and friends,” Deb Robertson, a terminally ill woman, told lawmakers via Zoom on Wednesday. “I don’t want to worry about how my death will happen. It’s really the only bit of control left for me.”

The measure passed in the House 63-42 after more than an hour of intense, sometimes tear-filled debate. It now awaits action in the Senate. Senators have a matter of hours to pass the bill before their scheduled adjournment Saturday.





The bill outlines a process that includes two doctors recommending the procedure, sometimes referred to as medically assisted suicide, and limits the people who are eligible. People must be of sound mind and have a prognosis of less than six months.

Death certificates of those who use the procedure would also list their underlying diseases, not “suicide,” reflecting the common belief among advocates that the procedure should not be called suicide. Bill sponsor Rep. Robyn Gabel, D-Evanston, noted in debate Thursday that the provision would also “prevent inappropriate suicide investigations.”

But even with these protections, some oppose allowing the procedure.

Medical associations are divided on the issue. The American Medical Association, the largest and most influential medical association, notes an “irreducible moral tension” inherent in the practice.

The AMA’s Code of Ethics, for many years, said the procedure is “fundamentally incompatible with the physician’s role as healer.” The association has recently softened its stance, opening the door for physicians to act on their own conscience on the matter.

Rep. Bill Hauter, R-Morton, a practicing physician, opposed the bill and told his colleagues during debate Thursday that it “changes forever the soul of medicine.”

During the House debate, the division among the health care industry reared its head. Rep. Nicolle Grasse, D-Arlington Heights, is a hospice chaplain and was supportive of the bill.

“I've seen hospice ease pain and suffering and offer dignity and quality of life as people are dying, but I've also seen the rare moments when even the best care cannot relieve suffering and pain, when patients ask us with clarity and peace for the ability to choose how their life ends,” she said.

Outside of health care, religious groups and disability rights advocates are also divided. Members of both parties invoked their faith during floor debate, including Rep. Maurice West, D-Rockford, an ordained Christian minister.

“Life is sacred. Death is sacred, too,” West said. “The sanctity of life includes the sanctity of death. This bill allows, if one chooses by themselves, for someone with a terminal diagnosis to have a dignified death.""

Republicans, who are generally more aligned with pro-life religious groups, opposed the bill. Catholic groups say procedures like medically assisted suicide violate the church’s teachings and many conservative protestant groups oppose the practice as well.

Rep. Adam Niemerg, R-Dietrich, said the procedure does not “uphold the dignity of every human life.”

“This does not respect the Gospel,” Niemerg, who is Catholic, said during debate. “This does not respect the teachings of Jesus Christ or uphold the values of God.”

Disability rights activists are also split on the issue. Sebastian Nalls, a policy analyst at the disability rights organization Access Living, said that if the procedure is legalized, insurers may pressure some sick people into it instead of expensive treatment.

“This bill carries far too many loopholes and lacks oversight to be safe and equitable, but the bottom line for Access Living is this: The existence of assisted suicide is a threat, to not just the kind of health care we deserve, but a threat to our ability to live and die with dignity,” Nalls said in a committee hearing Wednesday.

Other disability rights advocates, like Beth Langen, note that ""disability is not terminal.”

“Death, like life, is easier to navigate when you know you will have options to choose from, even if you never need to,” Langen said at Wednesay’s hearing.

Recent increases in success rates at hunting exceedingly difficult-to-kill wolves are “really good,” a Wyoming biologist said, because it shows that fair-chase tactics are still working. 
The post What’s it take to kill a Wyoming wolf? Nearly 500 hunting days, and then it’s likely a youngster appeared first on WyoFile .","Last fall, hunters put in their time pursuing Wyoming deer. They spent 12 days afield, on average, per kill. About 60% were successful.  
Elk hunters had a slightly tougher go of it. Statewide, they drove, hiked and glassed an average of 19 days to successfully harvest a wapiti. Nearly 53% punched their tag.
It’s no secret that large carnivores, which occur at lower densities, are notoriously more difficult to locate, close in on and kill. Even aided by stinky bait — a common, legal tactic — Wyoming black bear hunters spent 66 days in the field per animal downed in 2023, the last year of available data. Success rates were starkly lower: Just 14%. 
Then there’s the wolf. 
Intelligent, relatively sparse in population, and often aided by many sets of packmate eyeballs to spot threats, wolves have proven exceptionally difficult to kill in parts of Wyoming where hunters are restricted to fair-chase tactics.
This graph shows hunter success rates and effort since Wyoming gained jurisdiction over its wolves in 2012. From 2014-2016, no hunt occurred because the state’s population was relisted under the Endangered Species Act. (Wyoming Game and Fish Department)

Wyoming Game and Fish Department biologist Ken Mills shared the data at a hunting season-setting meeting in Pinedale this week. During the 2023 season, the last year data was available, hunters in Wyoming’s trophy game area, where wolves are regulated, logged about 450 days per animal they managed to kill. Success rates registered at 2.7%. (Mills is still sussing out the numbers from the 2024 wolf hunt, though he expects an uptick in success.)
At least in Wyoming, those numbers are pretty typical, according to a graph the state agency’s longtime wolf biologist presented to four members of the public and a handful of colleagues. There was a time, he said, when wolves were smartening up to hunting pressure so well it was even a concern — hunter-days logged per wolf climbed from 300 to more than 500 between 2017 and 2021.

“If it continues to increase, there’s a lower probability that we’ll be able to use fair-chase hunting as a management tool,” Mills said. “If wolves are learning so much, and avoiding hunting so well, we’re going to have [a] low harvest and we’re not going to be able to attain our [target population] objectives.” 
For that reason, he said, improvements in success and days spent hunting per kill from 2022 to 2024 were “actually really good” to see.
“OK, fair-chase hunting is working,” Mills explained of his thinking. “It’s still a good tool to be able to manage wolf numbers, which is certainly my preference.” 
In Montana and Idaho, the only other Lower 48 states that currently hunt wolves, wildlife managers tasked by their state legislatures with killing more wolves have shifted gears, adopting tactics like trapping, snaring and night-hunting with thermal imagery that have remained prohibited in Wyoming’s wolf trophy game area. (In Wyoming’s predator zone, encompassing 85% of the state, virtually anything goes, even running over wolves with snowmobiles.)

It’s unclear based on easily accessible data how hunter success in Montana, Idaho and Wyoming’s wolf predator zone compares to the numbers Mills presented from the tightly regulated trophy game area. During the 2023-’24 wolf season in Montana, roughly 1.6% of hunting and trapping license holders killed a wolf, but the harvest report doesn’t track hunter effort. Idaho, likewise, doesn’t provide hunting effort data in its wolf harvest report, though at one point in the past, license-holder success was as low as 0.4% in the Gem State. 
In Wyoming, the wealth of data also provides some insight into the types of animals the lucky few successful hunters are ultimately pulling the trigger on. Especially early in the season, the preponderance of animals killed are young: either that year’s pups, yearlings or 2-year-olds. 
“About a third of the wolves taken in September were juveniles, and that declines through time,” Mills said. 
The majority of wolves killed in Wyoming’s hunt are either pups, yearlings or 2 year olds, especially early in the season. (Wyoming Game and Fish Department)
Back in 2018, Game and Fish tacked on September to its wolf hunt. Shortly afterward, Mills recollected, officials bumped the start date back a couple of weeks to avoid killing pups on “rendezvous sites” — where the young of the year get stashed after leaving the den. 
The first six or so weeks of the Wyoming hunt — Sept. 15 through October — remain the easiest time of year to kill a wolf, the data shows. That’s because success increases when hunting localized wolves, like the youngsters tied to a rendezvous site. 
“Especially year to year, people figure out where wolves are hanging out,” Mills said. “They know where to go.” 
Wyoming’s 2025 wolf hunting season proposal would bring mostly modest changes from the 2024 season. The maximum number of wolves that could be killed would increase from 38 to 44 animals, though that must pass muster with the Wyoming Game and Fish Commission.
Stability in Wyoming’s wolf population and regulated wolf hunt have become the norm.

Joni Ernst held a town hall at Aplington-Parkersburg High School in Parkersburg May 30, 2025. (Screenshot via C-SPAN)PARKERSBURG, IOWA — At a sometimes raucous town hall meeting Friday morning, U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst faced vocal opposition to her support for spending cuts to programs such as Medicaid and SNAP.
Like many other Republican lawmakers holding events with constituents throughout the country, Ernst faced a crowd at the Aplington-Parkersburg High School who were upset with decisions made by President Donald Trump and the GOP-controlled Congress — particularly as they relate to funding for health care and food assistance programs included in the “big, beautiful” budget reconciliation bill that narrowly passed the U.S. House earlier in May.
Though Ernst said the Senate would make changes to the measure and advance their own version of the legislation, she defended reductions in spending for Medicaid at the town hall, saying the changes will not impact people in need but will remove from the program “illegals that are receiving Medicaid benefits” and able-bodied adults who are not working.
“People will die,” a woman shouted at the stage as Ernst answered one of several questions about the cuts.
“People are not — well, we all are going to die, so for heaven’s sake,” Ernst said in a response that was met by further shouts and jeering from the crowd.
Ernst said she agrees with most of the provisions on Medicaid included in the House version of the budget reconciliation bill, saying that it was targeted at changes to the public health care program that “made it much easier to get onto Medicaid, but much tougher to take people off of Medicaid.” Ernst said many people on Medicaid currently are working full-time and have access to other benefits.
“What we have to do is make sure that those that are not eligible by the federal standard for Medicaid are not receiving Medicaid,” Ernst said. “What we do need to do is make sure that those that are part of a vulnerable population have access to Medicaid and receive those full benefits. So what we’re trying to do is strengthen Medicaid by directing the dollars to the people that actually meet the requirements of the program.”
In its House form, the bill includes a $625 billion reduction in federal spending for Medicaid over 10 years, according to estimates from the Congressional Budget Office. It also includes 80-hour-per-month work requirements for people between ages 19 and 65 to continue receiving Medicaid health coverage, with several exceptions for people with disabilities and complex medical conditions, pregnant people, tribal community members and parents of dependent children.
Elizabeth Kehret, who works for Lutheran Services in Iowa, said she was troubled by the potential impact of Medicaid cuts for pregnant woman, saying that she was previously enrolled on Medicaid during her four pregnancies before the state revised eligibility for postpartum coverage, changing it from families with incomes of 375% of the federal poverty line to those at 215% of the federal poverty line.
Kehret said she was concerned the federal Medicaid spending cuts would cause similar cuts for care in states across the country, meaning pregnant people, who may also have private health coverage, will struggle to pay for the medical care required both before and after their child is born.
“I heard you say earlier about people who work full time but still get Medicaid — yeah,” Kehret said. “I meet with dozens of women who have dual enrollment, where they have private insurance as well as Medicaid, and it helps cover the things that their private insurance doesn’t, or that high deductible. … Medicaid is extremely important to the smallest and most vulnerable population in Iowa.”
Ernst said there were provisions to allow continued Medicaid coverage for pregnant people in the House bill.
“Because you are part of that vulnerable population, we want to make sure that you have access to Medicaid,” Ernst said. “So you will hear examples of those like the able-bodied, 30-year-old man who is taking advantage of the program, not working. What we’re asking is that please engage in work activities, engage in volunteer activities, be enrolled in a training program, and then that makes you Medicaid eligible.”
Similar concerns were brought up about the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, that provides food assistance to low-income individuals. Under the House budget plan, some costs of SNAP would be moved to the states, in addition to adding other work requirements. Ernst said the House bill is correcting “overpayments” from states on SNAP, in addition to removing “people that have not been eligible for these programs by law as it is currently written” from public assistance.
Several veterans also spoke at the event, criticizing Republicans and Elon Musk’s DOGE Service for cuts to veterans’ assistance programs and cuts to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. In response, Ernst said, “We’re not cutting veterans benefits.”
Several veterans have been outspoken about changes made by DOGE to the VA, including the cut of roughly 2,400 VA jobs in early March.
Ernst has been a major supporter of DOGE and efforts to make government more “efficient,” saying Republicans and Musk are focused on removing areas of unnecessary spending and “streamlining” existing programs and services. Ernst highlighted the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) as an entity that can be made more efficient through DOGE efforts in response to a question on federal support following natural disasters.
“Department of Government Efficiency … the E is not about elimination, it is about efficiency,” Ernst said. “So how can we do better as a federal government to respond to the people on the ground?”

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) A federal judge has ruled in favor of intervening environmental groups and dismissed a lawsuit against a decades-old rule that connects wetland protections to federal farm benefits. 
The lawsuit, filed by CTM Holdings LLC against the U.S. Department of Agriculture, alleged the law, commonly known as “swampbuster,” is unconstitutional. In March, federal representatives and intervening environmental groups argued in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Iowa that CTM Holdings had no standing in the case. 
The lawsuit arose when CTM Holdings sought to farm a 9-acre portion of property that had previously been designated a wetland. The company, which rents the property to farmers, alleged in the complaint that the USDA “unconstitutionally” conditions its farm benefits through swampbuster. The company also argued the wetlands in question were dry but the federal agency would not remove the wetland designation.

Iowa Farmers Union, Iowa Environmental Council, Dakota Rural Action, and Food & Water Watch intervened in the case in support of the USDA with the goal of upholding the swampbuster rule, which they argued protects water quality, habitat and land. 
Iowa Environmental Council attorney Michael Schmidt said swampbuster serves as a “foundational conservation practice” to protect wetlands and habitat, prevent flooding and improve water quality. 
“This court’s thorough decision upholds the practical conservation measures that have been the standard for decades,” Schmidt said in a statement. “Commonsense measures like Swampbuster support Iowa farmers and everyone downstream from them.”
Judge says plaintiff ‘repeatedly’ lacks the standing to bring ‘any of its claims’
The intervenors argued, and Chief Justice C.J. Williams upheld that CTM Holdings had not suffered injury from swampbuster, nor had the company “exhausted its administrative remedies,” such as asking for a redetermination of the area. 
In March, during oral arguments on a motion, legal counsel from Pacific Legal Foundation and Liberty Justice Center, on behalf of CTM Holdings, said the company requested a redetermination of the land by the Natural Resources Conservation Service, or NRCS, but said the agency hardly ever changes a determination. 
The counsel representing the USDA said the agency’s records do not show a request for redetermination. 
Union of Concerned Scientists pushes for wetland protections in Farm Bill

Williams agreed with the USDA and the intervenors following a review of the communications and forms between the USDA and CTM Holdings. 
“If plaintiff’s intention was to request a review of the 2010 wetlands determination, nobody else in the world could possibly have known it,” Williams wrote in the ruling, adding that the company’s alleged injury was not “actual or imminent” but rather a “speculative chain of possibilities.” 
If the 9-acre area was indeed no longer wetland and the company actually requested a redetermination of the land, Williams wrote that CTM Holdings should have “no problems.” 
Arguments of unconstitutionality fail
The lawsuit argued swampbusters, formally known as the Wetland Conservation Compliance provisions of the 1985 Farm Bill, is unconstitutional for two reasons. 
First, it argued that government benefits cannot be conditioned. Per swampbuster, landowners must agree to avoid “any activity that alters natural wetlands” to remain eligible for USDA benefits like crop insurance and other subsidies farmers rely on. 
Williams wrote that the argument for unconstitutionality “misses the point” as it is framed in the suit. He explained that swampbuster is an “exercise” of Congress’ spending power, which may have conditions attached to it.

The complaint also alleged swampbuster is an unconstitutional “taking” of private land, and the requirement to avoid altering the property is akin to an unpaid easement. 
Williams rejected this argument as well, noting that CTM Holding does receive reimbursement for the wetland area in the form of USDA benefits. Additionally, he noted that property owners can still do “many things” to the designated wetland while complying with the law, including logging, which CTM Holdings did. 
Williams dismissed the case “with prejudice” meaning it cannot be refiled at a later date. 
Liberty Justice Center, one of the litigation firms representing CTM Holdings in the case, said the decision was “disappointing” but the group plans to appeal the case to the Eighth District Court of Appeals. 
“We’re confident that the appellate court will ultimately rule that this federal law is unconstitutional,” Liberty Justice Center said in a statement. “This law has been taking land from farmers for years, and we look forward to continuing to fight this unconstitutional law.” 
Aaron Lehman, president of the intervening Iowa Farmers Union, said he is “very happy” with the dismissal and believes the decision will be upheld, “no matter how far the plaintiffs want to take it.” 
“Farm programs need to have integrity,” Lehman said. “When we have voluntary participation in programs, we expect that it’s going to have conservation compliance attachments that make sense for the farm, make sense for the neighbors and (make) sense for the entire community.” 
Dani Replogle, a staff attorney with Food & Water Watch, said the decision is an “unequivocal victory” for sustainable farms and clean water. 
“The message is clear: we will not let fringe legal theories turn our wetlands into sacrifice zones for corporate landlords,” Replongle said in a statement.

(Kyle Martin/For the North Dakota Monitor)A special session of the North Dakota Legislature is still up in the air as the attorney general reviews options to fix an error with a line-item veto.
Meanwhile, legislative leaders this week directed staff to do legal research on possible scenarios that would prompt the Legislature to come back into session, including a recent appeals court ruling that affects legislative districts.
Gov. Kelly Armstrong’s general counsel has asked for an attorney general’s opinion on his line-item veto of Senate Bill 2014. Armstrong’s veto message only indicated he objected to a $150,000 grant, but the message was accompanied by red lines crossing out a section of the bill that also included $35 million for the Housing Incentive Fund.

Attorney Chris Joseph wrote in his request for an opinion that the red marking “merely serves as a color-coded visual aid.” He asked for an opinion on whether the governor’s written veto message or the visual pen marks on the bill satisfy the constitutional requirements of a line-item veto.
Mike Nowatzki, spokesman for the governor, said the opinion will determine the next steps. 
Armstrong previously said he would call lawmakers back for a special session if necessary to correct the mistake. Legislative Council estimates a special session would cost $65,000 per day.
Senate Majority Leader David Hogue, R-Minot, said Wednesday during a meeting of Legislative Management that he asked Legislative Council staff to brief legislative leaders on scenarios that might prompt lawmakers to reconvene.
One question Hogue raised is whether the Legislature has a duty to act in response to the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals ruling that overturned a 2023 district court ruling that found the state’s 2021 redistricting plan unlawfully diluted the voting power of Native American voters. A federal judge had ordered the Legislature to change its district map, but if the appellate court’s ruling stands, the state would revert back to the 2021 plan. The plaintiffs, which include the Spirit Lake Nation and Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa, have asked for a rehearing before the full 8th Circuit.
Hogue also asked staff to provide a legal briefing related to the governor’s vetoes and whether that would prompt legislators to reconvene. Armstrong issued seven line-item vetoes on six bills after the session adjourned. 
Previously, Legislative Council Director John Bjornson said a special session was the only obvious legal remedy to fix the error with the veto, but he said this week his staff continue to research the issue.
Other situations that might prompt the Legislature to reconvene are a significant drop in the price of oil that changes the state’s budget outlook or federal funding cuts that have major impacts to state or local subdivisions, Hogue said.
If lawmakers call themselves back into session, they have six remaining days of their 80-day limit. If Armstrong calls a special session, that would not affect the 80-day limit.

The Iowa Board of Behavioral Health Professionals recently charged social worker Jaime L. Roggenbauer of Bettendorf with knowingly making misleading or untrue statements in the practice of social work, or engaging in unethical conduct harmful to the public, by attempting to practice social work while intoxicated. The board also accused her of interfering with her previous employer’s information technology systems.
According to the board, Roggenbauer had provided counseling services at a children’s advocacy center located in Rock Island, Illinois, since January 2022. She was fired on March 19, 2024, the day her co-workers reported that she appeared chatty, animated and unsteady — a departure from her typical demeanor.

The board alleges that Roggenbauer was fired after she refused a chemical test for intoxication. According to the board, she then changed the password to the center’s therapy documentation system, which locked other part-time providers out of the center’s database.
Roggenbauer denied the allegations, but to resolve the case she recently agreed to a settlement that entails her license being placed on probation for two years, during which time she will work with a practice monitor.
Court records show that in 2022, Roggenbauer was convicted of first-offense drunken driving.



Social workers charged with ethics violations
Other Iowans recently sanctioned by the Iowa Board of Behavioral Health Professionals include:
— Kelly Sachau of Sioux City, who is alleged to have maintained a relationship with a patient from April 2021 to the present. According to the board, the patient received therapy services from Sachau while the two maintained a personal relationship. In October 2022, Sachau ended her relationship with the practice group where she worked and took the patient’s therapy records and notes with her to her new practice without the patient’s written consent. She was charged with failing to comply with ethics guidelines related to patient boundaries and records.
Sachau denied having a dual relationship with the patient and denied improper handling of client records and information. To settle the case, she agreed to pay a $750 civil penalty and have her license placed on probation for two years during which time she will work with a practice monitor and complete training on ethics, clinical documentation and professional boundaries.
— Trisha Tonelli of Des Moines, who allegedly disclosed confidential information related to the care of a client. She was charged with failing to comply with ethics guidelines on confidentiality, and was issued a warning that similar conduct in the future could result in further disciplinary action. As part of her settlement agreement with the board, Tonelli agreed to complete six hours of ethics training.

(Getty Images)Utah has some of the best infrastructure in the country when compared to other states, although its canals and levees are in need of repair. 
That’s according to the American Society of Civil Engineers’ report card, released Thursday, which gives the Beehive State an overall C+ grade. That’s tied with Georgia and Wisconsin for the highest score of all U.S. states and territories. 
“A C+ means our infrastructure is meeting the needs of Utahns, but there’s still room for improvement,” said Craig Friant, a civil engineer who worked on the report. “This is a sign that we’re doing things well here in Utah.”
While the state has one of the highest grades, the rest of the country is not far behind. The national grade is C, and most states and territories received a C or C- grade — South Carolina and Louisiana each received a D+, West Virginia received a D and Puerto Rico received a D-, the lowest grade. 
According to the American Society of Civil Engineers, or ASCE, an A grade is defined as exceptional and fit for the future; B is good and adequate for now; C is mediocre, requiring attention; D is poor and at risk; and F is failing, requiring critical attention and unfit for purpose. 
The report lists 12 separate areas of infrastructure for each state. Consider Utah’s report: 

Aviation: C+
Bridges: B
Canals: D+ 
Dams: C+
Drinking water: B- 
Hazardous waste: C+ 
Levees: D- 
Roads: B+ 
Solid waste: B-
Stormwater: C 
Transportation: B- 
Wastewater: C 

The majority of the state’s levees and canals are old, according to the report — most levees are more than 60 years old, and many of the state’s canals were built in the 19th century for irrigation purposes. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The report also noted that data isn’t readily available for levees and canals, which poses another risk. 
“These are systems that protect households and businesses from flooding, yet we don’t know their condition in many cases, which is a major public safety hazard,” said Friant, who pointed to outdated levees in Salt Lake County that protect residential areas from flooding during runoff or storms. 
These levees don’t currently meet the Army Corps of Engineers standards, putting them at risk of being delisted — if that happens, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, could eventually reclassify the land surrounding the Salt Lake City International and Provo City airports as flood plains, according to the report. That could “drastically” alter how the land is assessed and insured, engineers say. 
Recommendations for improving Utah’s infrastructure
What can the state do to boost its grade? The report gives several recommendations, including more analysis and better funding when it comes to infrastructure. 
“Specifically, detailed written plans are critical for the areas of water resources, canals, transportation, transit, and waste management,” the report reads. “The state should be providing consistent financial support for project improvements, maintenance, resiliency, and risk reduction through reliable funding streams year after year that facilitate this planning.” 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Prioritizing funding for bridges is another recommendation. Even though Utah received a B, engineers say many of the state’s bridges are nearing the end of their “service lives.” 
The state should also increase funding for its Dam Safety Program. Utah currently has hundreds of dams considered “high hazard,” which means if they fail, it would cause severe damage and loss of life. 
That includes the Panguitch Lake Dam, which showed signs of seepage last year after cracks appeared near the top, likely the result of ice pushing up against the concrete. The roughly 1,700 residents of Panguitch were put on notice to prepare for evacuation, but crews were able to break the ice away and stabilize the dam. 
Utah has a big, expensive and potentially dangerous dam problem

To avoid a repeat scenario, the report recommends the state dump at least $10 million each year into the Dam Safety Program and try to rehabilitate all dams within 50 years. “An increase to $20 million per year would allow faster repairs but could still require 25 years for all required repairs,” the report reads. 
Bolstering “multi-modal” transportation options — like expanding bus or train networks —is another recommendation as the state deals with rapid population growth. 
And lastly, Utah should make sure the Great Salt Lake reaches and remains at healthy levels — replacing canals with pipelines will help reduce evaporation, and could ultimately result in more water flowing to the lake, according to the report.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GettyImages-584917952-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-30 18:06:14.949870

Amber Duke, the executive director of the ACLU of Kentucky, said in a statement that “decisions about health care are and should remain private, and we will not be providing additional details about the dismissal.
“People have the right to control their own bodies without government interference, and we will never stop fighting to restore abortion access in Kentucky,” Duke said. “We are strategizing our next steps in this fight. In the meantime, our work to address the commonwealth’s maternal mortality rates and lack of widespread paid leave coverage will continue as long as Kentucky remains a forced-birth state.”
Poe’s lawsuit was the fourth challenging Kentucky abortion laws since the United States Supreme Court in 2022 overturned the landmark Roe v. Wade ruling that had protected the right to abortion for almost 50 years. The ruling triggered Kentucky’s ban into effect.
The first challenge, filed by abortion providers, advanced in Jefferson Circuit Court but was rejected on appeal.
In December, a woman filed a lawsuit similar to Poe’s challenge, stating she was pregnant and did not wish to be. Within days of filing her lawsuit, though, the pregnancy lost viability and she ended her challenge of the law.
In two cases, Kentucky courts, including the state Supreme Court, have rejected challenges to the ban on grounds that the plaintiffs lacked standing to bring the action; the U.S. Supreme Court has likewise avoided ruling on the merits of abortion bans.

,Mississippi Today,2025-05-30 21:05:33+00:00,Mississippi Today,"Hosemann, White vow to focus on school choice, teacher pay, K-12 issues in ’26",Taylor Vance,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/05/30/hosemann-white-vow-to-focus-on-school-choice-teacher-pay-k-12-issues-in-26/,The two legislative leaders outlined priorities for 2026 after a contentious special session required because the House and Senate could not pass a budget during regular session.,"One day after concluding a raucous special session to pass a state budget, Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann and House Speaker Jason White told reporters they’re planning to focus on K-12 education policy next year during the 2026 session. 
Hosemann, the Republican leader of the Senate, said he wants to pass legislation to give public school teachers a pay raise and find a way to allow retired teachers to work in the classroom again. 
“Without an educated workforce, Mississippi’s momentum will not continue,” Hosemann said at a press conference on Friday. 
State law sets the salary for public school teachers based on how much college education they have received and how long they have taught. The last time the Legislature raised teacher salaries was during the 2022 session. 
White, a Republican from West, conducted a press conference Friday, but he excluded some media outlets including Mississippi Today. But according to a recording of the press conference in his Capitol office, White intends to push lawmakers, again, to consider school choice legislation and will form a study committee to conduct hearings on the issue during the summer. 
“Our sister states surrounding us here in the South all have basically open enrollment now,” White said. “Now, are we ready to go that far? Do we have the votes to go that far? I don’t know that. But it’s time we have a real conversation about what is best for kids and parents and not the status quo or what might upset somebody somewhere.” 
Full school choice policies typically give state dollars to families and allow them to use that money for their child’s K-12 education, regardless of whether they attend a public or private school. But it’s unclear if White would push for full school choice or a more moderate measure.
Earlier this year, the speaker pushed the House to vote for a bill that allows students in D and F-rated districts to transfer to another school, public or private. However, the bill died on a legislative deadline without a vote from the entire House. 
The House also passed a public-to-public “open enrollment” bill to allow students to transfer to a public school district located outside of the district they live. But a Senate committee killed the measure without bringing it up for a vote.
Mississippi currently has a very limited form of “open enrollment” that allows students to transfer from their home district to a nearby school district. However, the transfer requires the approval of both the home and receiving school districts. 
The House’s proposal would have prevented the home district from blocking the student’s transfer. 
Hosemann on Friday said he was personally in favor of both of those proposals, but he was unsure if a majority of the Senate would vote for the measures. 
Other priorities White outlined were: 

Continuing to focus on improving the city of Jackson, especially the capital city’s water and sewer systems 
Reforming the public employee retirement system 

Hosemann’s other priorities include: 

Restructuring government agencies and their office space 
Banning student cell phones in public K-12 schools 
Free community college tuition",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/05181115/AP23340713371286-scaled.jpg,,,2025-05-30 17:05:40.985741
,DC,2025-05-30 21:01:25+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Musk departs White House but says DOGE will carry on; won’t comment on report of drug use,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/musk-departs-white-house-says-doge-will-carry-wont-comment-report-drug-use,,"WASHINGTON — Billionaire Elon Musk said Friday he will continue to advise President Donald Trump despite stepping away from his official role as a special government employee.During a wide-ranging Oval Office press conference, Musk — sporting a bruised right eye he blamed on a punch he invited from one of his sons, 5-year-old X — also said he expects U.S. DOGE Service will continue trying to cut at least $1 trillion in federal spending, setting the middle of next year as a target date.“This is not the end of DOGE, but really the beginning,"" Musk said. ""My time as a special government employee necessarily had to end — it was a limited time thing, it’s 134 days I believe, which ends in a few days. So it comes with a time limit. But the DOGE team will only grow stronger over time. The DOGE influence will only grow stronger.”Musk then compared his initiative to Buddhism, a religion practiced by hundreds of millions of people, saying DOGE jobs were “like a way of life” that he hoped would permeate throughout the federal government.DOGE’s efforts so far have led to about $160 billion in spending cuts, Musk said. That’s a small fraction of the $6.8 trillion the federal government spent during the most recent fiscal year and short of the goal he set before joining the administration.Musk said DOGE was “relentlessly pursuing” at least $1 trillion in spending cuts to benefit American taxpayers, shortly after pointing out a golden eagle on the ceiling of the Oval Office that Trump said used to be plaster.“Nobody ever really saw it. They didn't know the eagle was up there, and we highlighted it,” Trump said. “Essentially it’s a landmark, a great landmark, and that's 24-karat gold. And everybody loved it. Now, they all see it when they come in. So it's been good.”Musk hailed Trump for ensuring the Oval Office “finally has the majesty that it deserves."" Neither man shared how much was spent to redesign the eagle.Musk plans to refocus his professional efforts on his companies, including Tesla and SpaceX.New York Times story on Musk drug useTrump said he “hopes” that Musk continues to advise him on government issues, even though he will no longer be employed by the White House.Republican lawmakers, Trump said, are “totally committed to making the DOGE cuts permanent and stopping much more of the waste in the months to come.”“We want to get our great, big, beautiful bill finished and done,” Trump said, referring to a tax and spending cuts package the House passed earlier this month. “We put some of this into the bill, but most of it's going to come later. We're going to have it (codified) by Congress, affirmed by Congress. In some cases, we’ll make cuts, in some cases we'll just use it in a different layer to save the money. But it's hundreds of billions of dollars.”Musk declined to answer a question about a bombshell New York Times report published earlier in the day that detailed his ongoing use of drugs, including ketamine, ecstasy and psychedelic mushrooms.Trump desires bigger tax cuts from SenateTrump said during the press conference he hopes the U.S. Senate amends the “big, beautiful bill” by cutting more government spending, without specifying which programs.That package would cut about $1.5 trillion in federal funding for several programs during the next decade, including Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office is expected to release its full analysis of the package next week, including how changes made just before the bill went to the floor will impact state budgets and people’s access to safety net programs.Trump also called on senators to further lower taxes in the package,“It's an unbelievable bill…It cuts, you know, it's a huge cutting,” Trump said. “But there's things I'd like to see, maybe cut a little bit more. I'd like to see a bigger cut in taxes. It's going to be the largest tax decrease or cut in the history of our country. I'd like to see it get down to an even lower number. I was shooting for a slightly lower number. I would have liked to have done that.”Trump appeared to renew his call for Congress to completely eliminate the debt limit, even though the tax and spending cuts package would raise that ceiling by $4 trillion.""I agree with Elizabeth Warren on that. I think we should get rid of it,” Trump said, referring to the Democratic senator from Massachusetts. “It's too catastrophic.”",,,,2025-05-30 18:06:14.949870

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Members of the House Committee on Finance on Thursday appeared to see the need for a bill that would let municipalities impose a $2 tax on tickets to large venue events despite opposition from event promoters and business owners.
Providence Democratic Rep. Rebecca Kislak introduced her bill with a shout-out to her mom in Miami by recounting her mother’s words: “‘Why are you in the news about this ticket tax? What’s the big deal? All big metropolitan areas and cities have taxes like this to support the cities where events are held.’ So thanks, Mom, for that.”  
Kislak’s H6334 was submitted at the request of the Providence City Council as part of a multipronged approach to fend off budget chaos following a multimillion dollar settlement last November between the city and the state education department. Kislak is also the sponsor of H6162,  by Providence Mayor Brett Smiley, which would allow the city to increase its total tax levy in fiscal year 2026 beyond the state-mandated 4% growth cap. 
The tax levy bill passed the House floor 56-17 Tuesday after about an hour of heated discussion, with House Republicans joining progressive Democrats in opposing the bill’s passage. The legislation lingers still in the Senate, where it was heard in committee for the first time, also on Tuesday. 
Kislak’s event ticket tax bill bears the signature of at least one Providence Democratic co-sponsor, Rep. David Morales, who opposed the levy bill, plus five other Providence Democrats, and Democratic Reps. Brandon Potter of Cranston and June Speakman of Warren.
While the bill was designed with Providence in mind, it would authorize any municipality to adopt a local tax of up to $2 per ticket on events held at “large venues,” or those with 800 or more seats, per the bill’s definition. The Division of Taxation would be responsible for collecting the tax and then redistributing it to municipalities.
Revenue from ticket taxes would not count toward the tax levy hike cap codified in state law. That complements the tax levy hike legislation, by allowing towns and cities to up their tax income without risking the chance of going over the 4% annual limit on how much municipalities can raise taxes.    
“Every city and town, increasingly, is facing difficulties in overreliance on property tax as the main workhorse for how we can do our business, how we can take care of city services,” Providence City Council President Rachel Miller told the committee Thursday, adding that the bill “is one kind of tool in the toolbox” to help dig the city out of its fiscal hole.
Miller estimated the new fee could generate around $3 million annually for Providence, which would help offset the rising cost of services in the capital city without discouraging event attendance.
The bill was held for further study Thursday, as is standard practice.
City Council Chief of Staff June Rose said in an email Friday that a Senate companion is in the works.
Anthony Vega, a spokesperson for Mayor Smiley, said the city administration is still reviewing the bill. 
The state’s Division of Taxation has read the bill, however, and thinks it needs to be redrafted. In a letter to the committee, Neena Savage, tax administrator, testified that parts of the bill as written are “ambiguous” and suggested filing it under local tax statutes rather than the state’s broader sales tax code. 
Asked about the tax official’s take, Kislak said via text Friday that she was planning to review everything over the weekend, and “would be glad to provide additional clarifications based on the feedback last night.” 
“This is enabling legislation and I’m confident the cities and towns will refine this in locally appropriate ways as they write ordinances, if they so choose,” Kislak wrote.

Concerns about competition
Kislak’s bill managed to coalesce support among her colleagues. It also did the same for the opposition — venue managers and hospitality lobbyists — who showed up Thursday night to oppose the bill, many of whom argued that the proposed fee is small, it will disadvantage Rhode Island in a competitive live entertainment market.
“It’s not so much about passing it on to the patron,” said Dan Schwartz, general manager of The VETS Auditorium. “You know, what we hear when bills like this come up is, ‘We’re just going to skip bringing our show to Rhode Island.’”
Written testimonies opposing the legislation also came from the legal counsel for the Providence Bruins, South Kingstown Town Councilor Jay G. Wégimont, and Joseph Paolino Jr., former Providence mayor and noted downtown real estate magnate.
“This legislation targets the very institutions that help drive Providence’s economic engine, and at the worst possible time,” Paolino wrote, adding that his luxury hotel The Beatrice is always booked when a popular show or game is in town. 
Contrasting the naysayers was the Finance Committee, including a relentless Rep. Teresa Tanzi. The South Kingstown Democrat asked many questions of the industry advocates who came to testify, although she was befuddled as to why they even showed up.  
“This $2 thing — I’m shocked that you guys are even here opposing it, to be quite honest with you,” Tanzi said. “Because in the larger scheme of things, your ticket holders are being ripped off on so many other levels, and the city is being inconvenienced on so many other levels.”
Tanzi suggested that if proprietors were truly concerned about ticket prices, they would investigate different options for ticket delivery — like Dice, a platform that allows people to resell tickets only at face value, and only through its own app, rather than secondary markets.
Tanzi also grilled Lawrence Lepore, the general manager of the Amica Mutual Pavilion. Tanzi asked Lepore to what extent the state subsidizes its largest concert venue at 14,000 seats. Lepore replied it’s about $27 million a year, including debt service. 
“So you’re not self-sustaining anyway,” Tanzi said.
“The operation is self-sustaining. But of course, the debt service is not,”  Lepore replied.
“We subsidize it to a tune of $27 million a year?” Tanzi asked.
“That’s correct,” Lepore said, and Tanzi concluded with a “Thank you. Thank you very much.”

Taxpayers subsidize big venues
Rich Lupo sold his titular concert venue in 2017, but the longtime music promoter warned that Providence is already “a secondary city in the booking world.”
“[This bill] would just piss them off,” Lupo said of booking companies. “I think it could be $1, it could be $10. You just don’t want to anger the powerful agencies, and bands as well.”
From his seat on the committee, bill co-sponsor Hull was canny with Lupo, pointing out that he’s known him for decades, and fondly recalls how Lupo grew his titular venue since opening it in 1975.    
“I’ve seen what you’re capable of doing,” Hull told Lupo.
That’s why Hull was firm that the businesses should be capable of weathering a $2 surcharge — especially places like the Amica Mutual Pavilion, which is housed in the tax-exempt Rhode Island Convention Center but still benefits from city services.  
Sharon Steele, speaking on behalf of the Jewelry District Association, disagreed. She pointed to another Smiley proposal and Kislak bill for a 7% “consumption tax” on the city’s parking lots and garages. The ticket tax would add “insult to injury” for downtown venues already burdened by tax policies, she said.
Hull told Steele he subscribes to the Rhode Island Philharmonic — Steele was once on its board — then narrowed his eyes, smiled, and made a case for the value of expression: “The arts are special. And if I had to pay an extra $2 to see the arts, I’d be more than happy to pay it.” 
“I appreciate that, but the Philharmonic’s not doing well these days,” Steele said, adding that such plights are common right now for nonprofits. “And we’re sure not getting any help from the feds.”
“The $2 is necessary,” Hull replied.

(Courtesy photo)It remained unclear on Friday who will become the treasurer for New Mexico’s ruling political party, following the previous treasurer’s resignation after just one month on the job.
Julie Rochman, of Albuquerque, resigned as treasurer for the Democratic Party of New Mexico on Wednesday, in a resignation letter addressed to all of the party’s members, who elected her and the rest of its leadership on April 26.
Rochman wrote she is concerned DPNM’s officers don’t reflect New Mexico’s diversity. Including herself, three of the four officers are not originally from New Mexico, two are older white women, one comes from a rural area and none speak Spanish, she wrote.
“Most distressing to me, in our minority-majority Hispanic state, is DPNM’s lack of a single Hispanic executive,” Rochman wrote. “This is a glaring deficit and strategic negligence.”
Rochman wrote the party should replace her with “someone who represents the very people we’ve overlooked for too long — ideally a Hispanic leader rooted in a rural space.”
DPNM spokesperson Daniel Garcia told Source NM on Friday party rules do not determine a timeline for replacing its treasurer, however, “DPNM wants to move expeditiously in finding a replacement to fulfill the position’s work without interruption.”
The new treasurer will be selected by the party’s officers, Garcia said, including Chair Sara Attleson, Vice Chair Cam Crawford, Secretary Brenda Hoskie and the three congressional district vice chairs. 
“Right now there are not specific individuals under consideration, but the process will be conducted in a thorough, transparent process,” Garcia said.
Rochman wrote that Attleson and Crawford “have squashed efforts for all officers to work together as a team” and “intentionally excluded” her.
“They don’t inform or engage with me,” Rochman wrote. “In short, they’ve made clear that my expertise and input are unwelcome.”
In a statement, Attleson denied Rochman’s allegations that she wasn’t welcome in the party, and defended its leaders’ diversity.
“Contrary to her letter, we welcomed Julie to be a part of the movement we’re building,” Attleson said. “Unfortunately, shortly after the election, she decided this team wasn’t an ideal fit for her.”
Attleson pointed to the majority of New Mexico’s statewide and federal elected leaders being Hispanic, including Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, along with several of the congressional district vice chairs.
Rochman told Source NM it is great that so many elected officials in New Mexico are Hispanic, “but it doesn’t excuse the fact that the party doesn’t look like the state.”
Attleson also pointed to Crawford’s background as a young Black man, and Hoskie’s membership in the Navajo Nation and fluency in Diné.
“New Mexico Democrats proudly draw our strength from our diversity, which is apparent in our leadership,” Attleson said. “At a time when billionaires are dictating public policy and Donald Trump is eliminating essential services, we have to stay focused on fighting for working class New Mexicans, not turning on each other.”
‘Trumpian’ nondisclosure agreement refused
Rochman wrote that she received a nondisclosure agreement in late May after weeks of no communication about ongoing party affairs and strategic planning. Rochman told Source NM in an interview that Sean Ward, the party’s executive director, asked her to sign it.
A copy of the unsigned NDA shows it would have barred Rochman from saying or doing anything that would damage the reputation of any of the party’s officers, staff or volunteers.
Rochman wrote in her letter that the NDA is inconsistent with her values and undermines her right to free speech and her obligation to speak truth to power.
“Essentially, it would be a gag order for the rest of my life,” she wrote.
Rochman told Source NM that she feels the document’s non-disparagement language “was very targeted” at her because she doesn’t get along with Attleson.
“It seemed very Trumpian to me,” Rochman said. “There had been some other things that were rather Trumpian, and I just didn’t want to be associated with an administration that was going to govern that way.”

(Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)Elon Musk’s tenure as a special government employee in the White House came to an end Friday, prompting Florida Democratic U.S. Rep. Maxwell Frost to say that his efforts reveal that a “corporate slash and burn mentality is not how you run a country.”
Musk had been leading the so-called “Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which, according to its website, last updated on May 26, saved taxpayers an estimated $175 billion. However, one watchdog website tracking the cuts says it was more like $16 billion.
  Maxwell Frost via U.S. House
But there were significant cuts that have been damaging, including to international medical and food assistance programs. “The legacy will be a dark legacy,” Frost told a Phoenix reporter on Friday during an interview on WMNF-88.5 FM in Tampa.
Among the first and most prominent budget cancellations that came from DOGE was to dissolve the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), which has funded the majority of U.S. humanitarian and development assistance worldwide to people. That included stopping funding to the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), an HIV prevention program that has operated through USAID since 2003.
U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said this week that it was “a lie” to say that anybody around the world has died because of the USAID cuts. However, through a modelling program, a research team at Boston University that studies infectious diseases has estimated that the loss of lives from USAID cuts stands at more than 300,000 worldwide, with more than 200,000 of those being children.
“These USAID cuts are devastating,” Frost said. “Global health is important to health here. The projections on HIV on how that is going to explode globally … and we could see an epidemic of HIV again in the United States over the coming years because of the way that  people travel.”
A study published this week by the liberal-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities reported that the Trump administration and DOGE have implemented new phone service restrictions that the Social Security Administration estimates will require people to make nearly 2 million additional trips to understaffed Social Security field offices every year.
“I’ve been speaking with folks who receive disability from SSI [Supplemental Security Income] who literally [say] the wait times are longer than they’ve ever been,” Frost said. “People are dying, waiting for the benefits that they deserve. And so these cuts were not made in good faith.”
Codifying DOGE
Musk and other conservatives like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis have bemoaned that President Trump’s major tax and spending bill that narrowly passed the U.S. House of Representatives last week doesn’t codify the spending cuts made by DOGE over the past four months. However, House Speaker Mike Johnson says that Congress will vote to codify those cuts of up to $9 billion in a bill that will soon be introduced in the House.
“People are seeing impacts now, but they’ll see impacts years into the future as well,” says Frost. “I think this bill that Johnson is bringing to codify some of the DOGE cuts in part is meant to placate Elon. It’s why the bill is coming up at the exact moment that he is leaving.”
While progressives like Frost hailed Musk’s departure from Washington, Florida Republicans were celebrating his accomplishments Friday afternoon.
“Under @elonmusk, @DOGE has done a phenomenal job identifying and helping cancel waste, fraud, and abuse from government,” said Southwest Florida Congressman and 2026 gubernatorial candidate Byron Donalds on X. “As we carry out the annual appropriations process this summer, Congress must follow the lead of DOGE and eliminate this egregious spending once and for all.”
“Just like he launched @SpaceX beyond the stars, @elonmusk propelled @DOGE into orbit — leading the charge to cut waste, fraud, and abuse at hypersonic speed,” said Jacksonville U.S. Rep. Aaron Bean on X. “His vision for transparency and accountability will continue to reshape government spending and push for real fiscal responsibility. The mission isn’t slowing down — it’s only gaining altitude!”
‘Special government employee’
In his announcement reintroducing legislation this week that would require federal agencies and departments to verify the eligibility of individuals 105 years of age or older for federal benefits. Sarasota area U.S. Rep. Greg Steube credited DOGE for bringing attention to the issue.
“No American who has paid into Social Security and Medicare should see their benefits compromised by scam artists or incompetent bureaucrats,” Rep. Steube said in a statement. “It shouldn’t have required DOGE examining the rolls to ensure 12 million Americans listed as 120 years old or more were finally properly recorded as deceased.”
(The Associated Press reported earlier this year that Musk’s claims that “tens of millions” of dead people receiving Social Security checks was “overstated.”)
As a “special government employee,” Musk was forced to end his tenure at the White House on Friday because federal law says such employees are appointed to perform temporary duties “for a period not to exceed 130 days during any period of 365 days.”
Frost said that Musk’s temporary status as a federal employee was “misused” and predicted that “when Democrats take back the House we’re going to have to put some guardrails on that designation because it was misused for Elon Musk.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-30 20:54:03+00:00,CT Mirror,CT approves unemployment benefits for strikers; veto expected,Mark Pazniokas,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/30/ct-unemployment-benefits-striking-workers/,Passing the bill despite Lamont’s promised veto reflects the influence of organized labor and Democrats’ desire to be recorded on the issue.,"A bill that would add Connecticut to the short list of states providing jobless benefits to strikers won final passage Friday, an organized labor victory muted by Gov. Ned Lamont’s promised veto.
The unusual decision by House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, to allot scarce time for a bill opposed by the governor reflects the influence of organized labor and desires of the House Democratic majority caucus to be recorded on the issue.
“It’s a big policy implication for a large swath of the caucus on an issue that you know they feel passionate about, particularly in light of the national federal government’s changes to the ability to collectively bargain,” Ritter said.
Lamont, a Democrat who has twice been elected with significant labor support, and the House Republican minority said removing the prohibition on strikers from getting unemployment benefits is a distinction Connecticut cannot afford as it tries to improve its economy and shed an anti-business reputation.
“I support the right to organize. I’m going to oppose any efforts to interfere with that right coming out of Washington, D.C.,” Lamont said. “If you want to make sure this is a state that grows and adds good paying jobs for people, I don’t think that striking worker bill is the way to go.”
The promised veto is a source of friction with labor as the governor nears an expected decision on whether to seek a third term as governor, something 60% of Democrats favor, according to a University of New Hampshire poll.
Connecticut is one of the most highly unionized states in the U.S., but overall membership has faltered since the 1980s, especially among private-sector workers. Only 6.7% of private-sector workers are unionized in the state, compared to 67% of state and municipal employees.
Ed Hawthorne, the president of the Connecticut AFL-CIO, said the labor federation still hoped Lamont might reconsider his veto, but the passage by the General Assembly would be significant nonetheless as unions look for ways to show influence in a difficult time for labor.
“In Connecticut, we need to lead. And, you know, the labor movement in Connecticut is strong, and we need to show the rest of the nation what you know our values are,” Hawthorne said.
Connecticut has been early in other labor advances that took root elsewhere, notably the nation’s first mandate on private employers to offer sick days or other paid time off, a paid family and medical leave program, and an hourly minimum wage exceeding $16.
Labor advocates say the strikers’ benefits bill is a necessary counter to the advantages most employers have at the bargaining table, especially since the Trump administration has left the National Labor Relations Board with insufficient members to act and shrunk the ranks of labor mediators.
“This really is a fight against the Donald Trump administration,” Hawthorne said. “It’s more important than ever, because we don’t have a backstop right now. You saw it in the Pratt & Whitney strike.”
The International Association of Machinists recently ended a 23-day strike at the jet-engine manufacturer. The union says if Connecticut had strikers’ benefits, the settlement would have come sooner.
In a letter to lawmakers urging the rejection of Senate Bill 8, the company’s parent, RTX Corporation, asserted that the opposite was true.
“The just-completed Pratt strike underscores this,” wrote Peter Holland, the vice president for state and local government relations. “It’s reasonable to assume employees would have withheld their labor much longer, holding out for a more valuable offer from Pratt.”
House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, said the House debate Friday was a dangerous, if confusing, political gesture by Democrats.
“Obviously we scratch our heads over spending a day on a striking workers bill that we know the governor wants to veto,” Candelora said. “We think it certainly sends the wrong message to our business community. Even the fact that we’re taking that bill up is really dangerous.”
Candelora noted that Pratt has manufacturing plants outside of Connecticut.
“I think that bill goes well beyond politics,” he said. “I am really concerned the same way the governor is concerned of the message that it sends to our business community and the impact it could actually have.”
Hawthorne agreed the bill sends a message but not the one articulated by Candelora and the governor.
“There’s a clear choice with this bill on who you stand with when you show up to a picket line,” Hawthorne said. “Are you standing with the workers? Or are you standing with the CEOs that have forced them out there?”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_7657-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-30 17:05:40.985741

Festivals, shows and parties celebrating LGBTQ+ Vermonters are happening from Springfield to Newport this June.

Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerAnytime the Savoy Theater in Montpelier shows the Rocky Horror Picture Show, they’re cleaning up the theater for weeks, according to the theater’s marketing director, Leah Fishman. The cult classic features audience participation moments, including $5 prop bags full of messy objects like handfuls of uncooked rice. But Fishman said the cleanup was well worth the trouble. “It takes weeks, but we never regret it. It’s always so fun,” she said. Rocky Horror is one of six cinematic events planned for the theater’s Queer Film Festival, a three-week-long celebration of LGBTQ+ films and shorts, both modern and classic. The festival, now in its fourth year, is one of Vermont’s many events celebrating Pride Month this June. Pride Month events stretch all the way from Springfield to Newport, along with Bethel, Rutland, Morrisville, Barre and Essex, according to the Pride Center of Vermont. It kicks off two days early with Montpelier Pride on Friday, which includes a parade, music on the Statehouse lawn and street art. Just don’t look for Burlington on the list of June events: Vermont’s largest city has its annual Pride event scheduled for September, according to the Pride Center. Along with town-sponsored events, local venues have planned a wide variety of Pride-themed entertainment. Barre LGBTQ+ bar Foxy’s has an amateur drag night slated for June 7, while Babes Bar in Bethel has Gay Trivia planned on June 26 with the motto “Anyone can play but it’s gonna be gay.”One of Savoy’s screenings has a Babes Bar tie-in: “One Night at Babes,” the first of its Queer Shorts events, depicts the bar’s connections to the LGBTQ+ community and its rural neighbors, Fishman said.Another film at the festival, the surreal trans allegory “I Saw the TV Glow,” had its Vermont premiere at the Green Mountain Film Festival in 2024, but the Savoy never had the chance to screen it. Montpelier Pride was held on the lawn of the Statehouse in Montpelier on Friday, May 30. Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDigger“We’ve had it sort of in our back pocket for a while, hoping for a chance and sort of saving it for Pride,” Fishman said. Fishman said the film festival was inspired by the love of “queer cinema” among Savoy staff members, some of whom are LGBTQ+ themselves. “We’re looking for a way to sort of share and bring new people and new voices into the theater,” she said. “Whether that be through highlighting new filmmakers or sharing stories that they love, that perhaps the community hasn’t seen yet, or engaging folks in the community in a new way and really celebrating queer voices.”Kell Arbor, health and wellness director for the Pride Center, helped select the films this year and chose ones that would bring out a mix of “the youths and the elders.” A portion of ticket sales will go to the Pride Center as well.Along with helping to organize Montpelier’s pride events, Arbor plans to be “DJ Kell” at a pride-themed silent disco just over the border in Lebanon, New Hampshire, on June 16. Arbor, whose pronouns are fae/faer, said the Pride Month festivities were even more essential this year as the Trump administration rolled back federal funding for HIV prevention and other LGBTQ+ health care in Vermont. “It’s hard to come in joy and pleasure when we’re living in such trauma, pain and grief — and, we need it more than ever, and the brighter we’re beaconing, the more it’s helping other people feel like they’re not alone,” fae said. Read the story on VTDigger here:  Queer Film Fest kicks off Pride Month in central Vermont.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/montpelier-pride-1-20250530-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-05-30 18:06:14.949870
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-30 20:50:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Connecticut leaders respond to ‘sanctuary’ designation by federal government,Emilia Otte,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/30/ct-trump-sanctuary-jurisdiction/,Six CT cities and the state itself were on the Trump administration’s list of ‘sanctuary jurisdictions’ publicly released on Thursday night.,"When Mayor Justin Elicker learned that New Haven was on a list of six “sanctuary cities” designated by the federal government in Connecticut, he said he wasn’t surprised. 
“This is something we expected, and we are proud of it. New Haven is proudly a welcoming city. It’s one of our defining characteristics and values,” Elicker said at a press conference on Friday. 
On Thursday night, the Department of Homeland Security released a list of over 500 cities, counties and states that the agency deems “sanctuary jurisdictions.” Included on that list are six Connecticut cities — East Haven, New Haven, Windham, New London, Hartford and Hamden — and the state of Connecticut itself. 
“Sanctuary city” does not have a clear legal definition, but the Trump Administration defines it as areas that “obstruct the enforcement of Federal immigration laws, according to the federal government’s website. 
“Sanctuary jurisdictions including cities, counties, and states that are deliberately and shamefully obstructing the enforcement of federal immigration laws endangering American communities. Sanctuary cities protect dangerous criminal aliens from facing consequences and put law enforcement in peril,” a press release from the department reads. 
State leaders and local elected officials from the six cities have responded to the designation in a variety of ways: with pride, confusion and denial. 
“That’s a mystery to me. I really have no idea where [President Donald Trump] is coming from,” Mayor Michael Passero of New London told the Connecticut Mirror on Friday. 
Passero said New London has always followed federal and state law. He said a person’s immigration status isn’t relevant to local law enforcement, and it’s not their policy to ask. But he said that shouldn’t qualify the city as a “sanctuary jurisdiction.” 
Passero said New London, which has always considered itself welcoming to immigrants, may not fit with Trump’s idea of what America should look like. 
“New London has always been, for 400 years, a multicultural city, because we’re a seaport,” he said, adding that his own parents were immigrants. 
Mayors Lauren Garrett of Hamden and Arunan Arulampalam of Hartford underscored the variety of backgrounds that make up their cities’ populations and criticized the federal government’s statements.  
“Hamden is a place that prides itself on diversity, we respect all of our neighbors, and we are in complete compliance with state and federal law. We will not be bullied by a federal administration that clearly does not understand how the law works, nor will we play into their game of shifting focus away from their campaign of defunding essential public services,” Garrett wrote in a statement. 
Arulampalam said in a statement that he was committed to “ensuring that every resident, regardless of where they come from or what their story is, has the opportunity to succeed.”
“While my administration remains laser-focused on real solutions that protect our community, it is clear that current federal policies do not share this commitment to safety and threaten to undermine the gains we have made,” Arulampalam added.
Mayor Joseph Carfora of East Haven called the designation “absurd” and “baseless.” He said the town planned to reach out to the Department of Homeland Security “to understand how such an unfounded statement was made without any consultation or communication with our office.” 
State Officials Respond
Both Attorney General William Tong and Gov. Ned Lamont said the Trump administration’s claim that Connecticut had “self-identified” as a sanctuary jurisdiction was false. 
“There is nothing in our laws or statutes that says Connecticut is a ‘sanctuary’ state. We are not. That is a meaningless term,” Tong said in a statement. 
But Republican lawmakers pointed to the legislature’s recent passage of a bill that will expand the state’s Trust Act — Connecticut’s law outlining the circumstances under which local and state officials may work and communicate with the federal government’s efforts to detain unauthorized migrants. The bill received final passage earlier this week; Lamont has not yet signed it.
“It’s no surprise the Department of Homeland Security labeled Connecticut and several of its communities as ‘sanctuary jurisdictions,’” House Minority Leader Vincent Candelora, R-North Branford, said in a statement on Friday. “Democrats in the legislature have taken extreme positions, expanding the Trust Act far beyond its original purpose of protecting victims and maintaining safety. Instead, it now shields illegal immigrants who are endangering our communities.”
The current Trust Act, which was passed in 2019, generally prohibits Connecticut law enforcement from arresting someone solely on the basis of a detainer — a request from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement that police hold a person for up to 48 hours so federal agents can pick them up — with some exceptions.
Local law enforcement and corrections officials in Connecticut may only comply with a federal detainer request if ICE presents a judicial warrant, if the person is on a terrorist watch list or if the person in their custody has been convicted or pleaded guilty to a class A or B felony — crimes like murder, sexual assault, kidnapping, robbery and first-degree manslaughter.
House Republicans drafted a letter to Lamont earlier this week asking that he veto the Trust Act expansion, which allows individuals to sue over alleged violations of the law, but also adds 13 new crimes to the list of those for which state and local law enforcement can comply with a federal detainer request. 
In the letter, Republicans said they felt the law “too often protects individuals who pose real threats to our communities, rather than promoting safety and cooperation.”
Senate Minority Leader Steven Harding, R-Brookfield, and Sen. Rob Sampson, R-Wolcott, referred to Connecticut in a statement as a “super sanctuary state” and said the expanded Trust Act would “further hinder federal law enforcement and burden property taxpayers.”
But House Majority Leader Jason Rojas, D-East Hartford, said he didn’t think the “sanctuary” designation should change the legislature’s decision to go forward with the Trust Act expansion. He said lawmakers had discussions with immigration advocates about trying to ensure the bill didn’t result in retaliation from the federal government, which could hurt the same people the bill was trying to help. 
“ But at the end of the day, you can’t totally compromise on your values because of political threats and intimidation,” Rojas told CT Mirror. 
Rojas said he didn’t have an opinion about the “sanctuary state” designation. “ I think about the people who are just trying to live their lives, raise their families, go to work. If there’s a level of confidence that we can give them that they’re welcome here, I think we should do that,” he said. 
Speaker of the House Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, said in a statement that Connecticut was not a “sanctuary jurisdiction.”
“The Trump Administration is continues to use divisive language to frighten and confuse people,” Ritter said. 
Lamont spokesperson Rob Blanchard said Lamont plans to sign the Trust Act expansion that lawmakers approved. 
“Connecticut’s Trust Act, which was originally bipartisan, is consistent with federal constitutional standards and reflects sound public safety priorities. I am focused on making sure people feel safe in our schools, churches, and elsewhere. Nothing about this makes Connecticut a ‘sanctuary’ in any legal or practical sense – it makes our state one that upholds the Constitution, respects the rule of law, and prioritizes the safety and well-being of our communities,” Lamont said in a statement. 
Elicker said at the press conference that he, too, wanted New Haven residents to feel safe going about their lives. 
“We want our residents to be comfortable calling the police to report a crime… we want our residents to seek out healthcare should they need it. We want to make sure our immigrant children are comfortable and safe going to school,” Elicker said.  
He said New Haven did not “obstruct justice,” but that they also would not take on the federal government’s responsibility for immigration enforcement. 
“Our police department has already too many things to worry about without having to be commandeered by the federal government to implement an unjust and inappropriate policy,” he said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AP_Hartford_skyline-1024x629.jpg,,,2025-05-30 17:05:40.985741

Each week, the clerk of the House of Representatives publishes a report of the bills that Gov. Janet Mills has signed into law and those that she has allowed to become law without the endorsement of her signature. 
Those reports have become more robust as dozens of bills have received passage and enactment votes during each House and Senate session in recent weeks.
Since May 23, Mills has signed 45 pieces of legislation into law, according to the report published Friday. The new statutes protect confidential information for utility customers, advance energy storage, and call for the removal of toxic firefighting foam concentrate from the former Brunswick Naval Air Station.
While most of the new laws won’t take effect until 90 days after the Legislature adjourns for the session, 10 included specific language to take effect upon the governor’s signature. 
There were also a handful of bills that became law without Mills’ signature. They include:

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota’s proposal to implement work requirements for Medicaid expansion could be “an exercise in futility” now that the federal government is also considering it, said state Department of Social Services Secretary Matt Althoff.
The state began drafting its proposal immediately following the end of the state legislative session in March, Althoff said, before debates about work requirements heated up at the congressional level.
Department officials presented their plan at the state Board of Social Services meeting Friday morning via video conference, just before the first of two public hearings on the proposal.
“Respectfully, humbly, we ask for your grace,” Althoff told board members, “because we’re asking for your feedback on something that might be obsoleted by the vote of 100 senators and the stroke of a pen from our president.”
Medicaid is government-funded health insurance for people with low incomes. South Dakotans voted in 2022 to expand Medicaid to adults with incomes up to 138% of the poverty level, a decision that allowed the state to capitalize on a 90% federal funding match — funding that could be in jeopardy, pending the outcome of congressional action. Last year, voters passed another constitutional amendment to let the state seek approval from the federal government to impose work requirements on expansion enrollees.
Difference between SD and federal proposals
At the federal level, proposed Medicaid work requirements would mandate those between ages 19 and 65 who rely on the program to work, participate in community service, or attend an educational program for at least 80 hours each month. The work requirement would be applied at the time of application, and Medicaid renewal would be changed to every six months instead of an annual basis.
Health care advocates form coalition urging Republicans to take their ‘Hands Off Medicaid’

South Dakota’s plan would require adult Medicaid recipients work, train, attend school or serve as a caretaker for a child or elderly or disabled person in their home unless they meet an exception. Compliance with the state-level work rules would be reviewed on an annual basis, at the time of Medicaid renewal, rather than at the time of application. The state would not require a set number of hours of work or education time.
Heather Petermann, Medicaid director at the department, said the requirement would be a “complement” to Medicaid to “encourage” work without “trying to track arbitrary work hours.” 
“This approach really recognizes that for many individuals who need assistance with health care, that comes first,” Petermann said. “Then it allows them to maintain their health so that they can work, or obtain the health needed to seek employment.”
The federal government also has more exceptions in its proposal than the state, including tribal community members, people who are in foster care or were in foster care who are younger than 26, and people released from incarceration in the last 90 days.
South Dakota would allow exceptions for people who are:

Pregnant or postpartum.
Disabled, as determined by the Social Security Administration.
Diagnosed with cancer or another serious or terminal medical condition by a physician.
In an intensive behavioral health treatment program, hospitalized or living in a nursing home.
In an area with unemployment 20% or more above the national average and are exempt from Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program requirements for able-bodied adults without dependents.

As of last month, 30,542 South Dakotans were covered by the Medicaid expansion. The state estimates 80% of them already work or qualify for an exception.
SD seeks Medicaid work rules in spite of similar moves by Congress

The proposed state-level work requirement would reduce enrollment by an estimated 5-10% in the first year. That would save the Medicaid program between $48.9 million and $71 million in the first year, the department says.
The federal proposal as it stands now will cost more administratively than South Dakota’s proposed work requirements, Althoff added. States “will be asked to absorb” costs if the federal proposal is adopted. The state’s proposal requires less administrative oversight to reduce anticipated costs, due in part to the state’s tight budget approved by the Legislature this year.
“That’s just sort of naming the tension about how not having new funds is sort of an important wrinkle to our development process,” Althoff said. “It’s really having to be done within an existing budget.”
Board member Colleen Winter said the proposal is “respectful” of the individuals the department serves.
Work requirements are already in place for some federal programs, such as SNAP, and state efforts, such as child care assistance and parental reunification expectations within Child Protection Services.
Department hears from one person during public hearing
While more than 20 people sat in on a virtual public hearing regarding the state’s proposed Medicaid work requirements on Friday, only one member of the public spoke.
Attorney Nathaniel Amdur-Clark spoke on behalf of the Great Plains Tribal Leaders Health Board. He said his client wants to see an exception for Indian Health Service beneficiaries.
Native Americans who are tribal enrolled members are eligible to receive health care services through the federal Indian Health Service. Those individuals are eligible for Medicaid coverage even if they do not meet other Medicaid requirements, such as income limits, “to implement and further trust and treaty obligations the U.S. has to provide health care” for tribal members, Amdur-Clark said. 
Though Althoff and Petermann did not respond to Amdur-Clark’s comments about IHS patients, they did address the subject during the earlier board meeting. Petermann said the proposal includes “geographic exemptions,” including areas of the state with “high unemployment.”
“Things like that would also apply to tribal members and American Indians, but we otherwise did not call out or exclude American Indians,” Petermann said. “The approach is that this is a benefit and we want that dignity and pride to be part of the benefit for everybody, so they would be treated the same in this approach.”
Amdur-Clark added that there are technical concerns regarding exemptions in the proposal and that more work is needed to achieve “real tribal consultation.” The department met with some tribal leaders last week to discuss the proposal, Althoff said.

Shelly Ten Napel, CEO of the Community HealthCare Association of the Dakotas, said in an emailed statement that her organization is monitoring state and federal work requirement proposals closely. The group did not give input at the first public meeting, but plans to share its perspective on state work requirements during the public comment period.
Ten Napel opposed last year’s ballot measure authorizing the state’s pursuit of work requirements. Compared to the work requirement proposal being considered in Congress, Ten Napel said, the state proposal is “overall pretty reasonable.”
Gov. Larry Rhoden’s administration “did a careful job of responding to concerns” raised during the debate last year, Ten Napel said, including administrative burdens and exceptions.
“We look forward to working with them to ensure smooth implementation of the new rules if they are approved by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services,” Ten Napel said in the statement. “We also encourage members of Congress to take a careful look at the common sense approach South Dakota is taking and rethink some of the heavy-handed rules currently under consideration in the Big Beautiful Bill.”
The “big beautiful bill” is the budget reconciliation legislation that the U.S. House sent to the Senate last week, including a Medicaid work requirements provision.
Petermann said during the board meeting that South Dakota could perhaps seek to impose its own work requirements, even if the federal legislation passes.
“For example, some of the draft language does include references to things like ‘the provisions from the federal legislation cannot be waived,’ but we don’t know whether that means states still could or couldn’t have something that is less or more restrictive, as long as it has the same components,” Petermann said. “We really don’t know for sure yet.”
If the state moves forward, it will submit an application to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in July or August. After that, the proposal would go through a federal comment period and application review.
The department’s next public hearing on the proposed Medicaid work requirements is set for 11 a.m. Central on June 12 at the Sioux Falls office of the Department of Social Services, and online.

(Photo by Jacquelyn Jimenez Romero/Washington State Standard)COLFAX – A long-anticipated bridge replacement project over North Fork of the Palouse River is being postponed until 2029 because of the state’s transportation budget shortfall.
“We were ready to go. In fact, the ad date was supposed to be October,” said Ryan Overton, communications manager for Washington State Department of Transportation’s eastern region.
The $13 million project would have replaced two aging bridges on State Route 26 and U.S. Highway 195 with a single structure designed to accommodate wide loads, heavy truck traffic, and a shared-use path at the north end of town. A roundabout was also planned to improve traffic flow at the intersection of the two highways.
“We are trying to understand why it was postponed,” Overton said.
He said WSDOT had been working with the community since December 2022, having town halls with the city council, farmers and the trucking community to ensure they got local feedback on the project.
According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, one bridge was built in 1931, with an average of 6,470 in daily traffic. The other, built in 1936, has an average of 243 in daily traffic.
Both bridges are rated in “fair condition,” according to the transportation department.
Matt Hammer, public works director for Colfax, said the delay won’t cause immediate issues but could lead to higher costs in the future because of inflation. He also said the city is in the midst of designing a water improvement upgrade; the new bridge was going to support a new water pipe for future development.
“There’s no leaks happening, but the current Highway 26 bridge supports our water pipeline,” Hammer said.
Since they were notified of the delay, he said the city is scaling back its water infrastructure project until WSDOT provides further updates.
“It’s not really hurting us right now, but we put some time and effort and a little bit of money into planning for something that didn’t work out for us,” Hammer said.
Casey Jones, manager and part owner of Jones Truck and Implement, said his business has been involved in discussions with WSDOT about replacing the bridge for about a decade. While he’s not immediately affected by the delay, the main concern is the life expectancy of the two aging bridges.
“We just had the largest tax increase in Washington state’s history that I’m aware of, so resources are limited for building projects, and there are hundreds of bridges that are at the end of life in Washington state,” Jones said. “Nobody knows what the life expectancy for sure is of those bridges, but they’ve served this community very well.”
The only major issue he recalled was a 1996 flood that forced the closure of Highway 195 when water levels reached the bottom of one of the bridges.
“The water was cresting and hitting the bottom of the bridge. So that had been the only case where there had been a possible failure,” Jones said.
Jones raised concerns about how the proposed roundabout would affect large agricultural equipment with the amount of traffic and heavy hauling that runs through the area north of Colfax, including for grain, hay and livestock. He said moving into the new bridge design and having the roundabout has been a “scary proposition,” because farmers and truckers are going from four lanes across that area to 2½.
“It’s a pretty important piece of infrastructure for our whole farming community,” Jones said.
Overton said WSDOT remains committed to the bridge replacement project and will continue working with local community members in the lead-up to 2029.
“We’ve been able to work with WSDOT to come up with a design that will fit our region and fit for future growth of our region and look forward to the improvement,” Jones said.

(Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Ivy Tech Community College will lay off 202 employees statewide as it responds to significant cuts in state funding and frozen tuition rates, the school system’s president, Sue Ellspermann, announced Friday.
The layoffs — affecting both full-time and part-time workers — represent about 2.8% of Ivy Tech’s total workforce, including 180 full-time positions, or 5.3% of its full-time staff, according to data provided by the college. The reductions include 38 faculty members, 162 staff and two administrative faculty.
In a Friday letter to school employees, Ellspermann said the layoffs are a result of a $54 million shortfall over two years, driven by a 5% cut in state appropriations to higher education institutions. An additional 5% in potential funding held in reserve by the State Budget Agency deepened the financial strain.
“Because the college’s primary revenue sources are state appropriations, tuition, and fees, these developments have had an immediate effect on our planning,” Ellspermann wrote in her letter. “We have reached the difficult decision to adjust our staffing levels, in addition to efforts to reduce our operational expenses.”
Story continues below.
Important Budget Update and Staffing Changes
“Staffing reductions are always difficult decisions that we do not make lightly,” Ellspermann continued. “These changes do not reflect the value of their work, but rather the harsh financial reality we currently face.”
Layoffs began Friday and will continue into next week. Affected Ivy Tech workers will receive separation packages, according to Ellspermann’s letter.
The largest number of layoffs occurred at the college’s Systems Office in Indianapolis, which is slated to lose 44 employees. Among the other campus cuts are 21 staff in Indianapolis; 14 each in Bloomington and Columbus; 12 in Kokomo; 11 in Evansville; and another 11 in South Bend/Elkhart.
 


The General Assembly appropriated about $243 million and $245 million for the 2023-24 and 2024-25 school years, respectively. The latest state budget passed earlier this year will drop that funding to about $236 million in both the 2025-26 and 2026-27 fiscal years.
In a separate letter sent to state lawmakers on Friday, Ellspermann said that student services and academic quality remain priorities, noting that all 19 campuses across Indiana will remain operational. She emphasized that the college has no tenured faculty and “will have the continued ability to adjust the size of our faculty nimbly as enrollment and industry needs fluctuate.”
Ellspermann added that Ivy Tech has previously implemented other cost-saving measures, including rolling technology fees into tuition and eliminating distance education charges, which together cost the college more than $9 million annually in lost revenue.
“This is a challenging moment for our college, but I know Ivy Tech is strong,” Ellspermann said. “I remain confident in our resilience and in our commitment to our students and to one another.”

[…]","The entrance to the Montana Supreme Court (Photo by Eric Seidle/ For the Daily Montanan).In a sprawling, 61-page decision that had about as many opinions attached to it as members of Montana’s highest court, a majority of justices said that the State of Montana, specifically the governor’s office, should pay attorneys fees in a public documents fight between the office and groups wanting more information about a mining executive.
However, the particular details before the court were not whether a former mining executive should be permitted to lead a mining company after his former company was found to be a “bad actor” by state law. Instead, the Montana Supreme Court weighed in on when the government should pay attorneys fees in the public records dispute.
In a fractured mix of majority, concurring and dissenting opinions, at least four justices agreed that Lewis and Clark District Judge Christopher Abbott should have given attorneys fees to the Montana Environmental Information Center and Earthworks, which had sued Gov. Greg Gianforte for documents related to Phillips S. Baker, Jr., and permitting documents related to both Hecla Mining and the Montanore mine. The MEIC argued that the state had not enforced its “bad actor” provision against Baker, the Hecla CEO, because of his leadership in a company that went went bankrupt, while leaving millions of dollars of mining mess to be taken care of in perpetuity by the state.
MEIC and Earthworks, which won the public documents fight against the governor, also asked for attorneys fees because they brought the lawsuit under the Montana Constitution’s right-to-know provisions. In the state, judges have discretion to award attorneys fees when private groups or individuals are successful in vindicating constitutional rights, like obtaining public documents.
Previously, the Montana State Supreme Court had been reluctant to recommend a checklist of conditions that have to be met in order to award attorneys fees, instead relying on the judgment of district or trial court judges. However, a majority of the court decided to take up the issue, saying that more guidance was necessary for judges, something a minority, including Chief Justice Cory Swanson, balked at. The dissenting opinions centered on the idea that judges should still have latitude to decide on a case-by-case basis, and that if the Legislature wanted to mandate attorneys fees, it should be done in law.
Justice Laurie McKinnon wrote the majority opinion, with James Jeremiah Shea, Katherine Bidegaray and Ingrid Gustafson concurring. Justices Jim Rice and Beth Baker, along with Swanson were in the minority.
The majority pointed out in the case that the governor’s office had employed a “novel” legal theory that Abbott debunked, but even so, “the court found the governor’s office shirked its clear legal duty to MEIC’s request.”
“When a party succeeds in litigation based on a right to know request, it has performed a public service in ensuring that Montana’s government is appropriately transparent and accountable to the people,” the majority opinion said.
The justices reasoned that if constitutionally protected rights are meaningful, then litigation — or the ability to take the government to court — must be accessible.
“The result of the district court’s order — that MEIC prevailed and undeniably performed a public service, yet it is denied attorney’s fees — is dissonant with the foundational purposes of Article II, Section 9, and actively disincentivizes citizens from enforcing that right,” the majority opinion said. “For citizens to be able to enforce the provision against the government, litigation must be accessible; for litigation to be accessible, there should be a basic presumption towards awarding attorney’s fees when the party seeking to enforce the right to know has prevailed on its merits.”
The majority shifted the blame back to the Montana Supreme Court, saying the state’s provisions for awarding attorneys fees had created a “vacuum of necessary guidance,” and the majority wanted to more fully develop the advice.
Abbott had determined that because Gianforte had not acted in bad faith, and because attorneys fees would essentially be borne by Montana taxpayers, he decided not to award attorneys fees.
However, the court said the calculus Abbott used — whether there was evidence of bad faith — shouldn’t be the deciding factor in the right-to-know cases.
“When a plaintiff prevails on the merits of a right to know dispute, it means that, whether in good faith or bad faith, the government pushed back against the constitutional presumption and, in doing so, violated a fundamental right,” the opinion said. “But because we have previously neglected to suggest a presumption — or even a preference — for awarding fees in this context, even plaintiffs with an exceptionally strong case and an egregious violation must carefully consider whether it is worth the risk of winning the documents but losing fees.”
The court’s opinion also said it was taking up the matter because it’s essential for courts and citizens to understand fundamental or Constitutional rights.
“We seek to provide basic guidance that works to encourage and strengthen the people’s exercise of a fundamental constitutional right. This presumption does not eliminate judicial discretion, but rather structures it to reflect the constitutional emphasis on transparency,” the ruling said. “This presumption is not a novelty imagined at the whims of this court; it is part of the fabric of the right to know which has been errantly lost to an unboundedly deferential standard that allows for results fundamentally at odds with the Constitution.”
Leaders from both Earthworks and MEIC cheered the decision, saying the decision was a win for residents who want to keep tabs on government officials.
“Montana’s Constitution guarantees the public the right to know what government is up to. Justice only works when every person has the ability to oversee their government,” said Anne Hedges, executive director with MEIC. “This decision will ensure the public can continue to access government documents and will prevent abuse when the government officials refuse to comply with the constitution.”

(Jeff Beach/North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota colleges are being advised to assess their risk and campus policies as the number of measles cases continues to grow in the state. 
Burke County on Thursday became the fourth North Dakota county with a confirmed measles case, the state Department of Health and Human Services reported. 
Grand Forks County reported another measles case Friday, bringing the state total to 29 cases, the most for the potentially fatal disease since 1978. 
The health department, on its measles information website, added two additional exposure locations in Crosby in Divide County, which neighbors Burke County.
The State Board of Higher Education on Thursday discussed the measles outbreak as campuses prepare to host summer youth camps and tours for prospective students. 
“Campuses have expressed concerns about camps that they run in the summer,” Vice Chancellor Lisa Johnson said in an update for the board. She noted that many campuses also are home to a child care facility.  
As states loosen childhood vaccine requirements, health experts’ worries grow

Only four of the 29 people in North Dakota who have contracted measles since May 2 are over age 19, according to the state health agency. Williams County was the first to report a measles case, followed by Cass and Grand Forks. All 29 people were unvaccinated, according to state officials. Two hospitalizations have now been reported, one in Cass and the other in Grand Forks County. 
Johnson encouraged the 11 schools in the North Dakota University System to assess how many unvaccinated people are on campuses and consider being proactive.
“One thing that we can do as campuses … is reach out to your local health providers, health department and doing some sort of vaccine clinic,” Johnson said. 
Johnson encouraged campuses to get a handle on who is and is not vaccinated through voluntary self-reporting. 
If there are students in campus housing and on meal plans who are required to self-isolate because of a measles exposure, colleges will need to have a plan for providing meals and other accommodations. 
She said that exemptions from vaccination requirements have become easier to obtain in recent years. She said she recognized that campuses are probably not eager to mandate vaccinations and then have to deal with exemption requests. 
Board member Casey Ryan of Grand Forks is a retired doctor. He noted the long incubation time of the measles virus, allowing people who don’t realize they are infected to spread the disease. 
“You really have to push the vaccination,” Ryan said. “I understand it’s a personal choice.”
Interim Chancellor Brent Sanford said the good news is that the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine is effective and readily available and that vaccination rate among adults in most areas of the state is high.

(Aerial photography by Ed Saunders)NorthWestern Energy, the state’s largest public utility, tried to stop an energy engineer who planned to testify about climate change from participating in a rate case as an expert witness.
It also attempted to curtail testimony based on an Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report.
The monopoly utility argued some of the testimony was an attempt to introduce “inadmissible hearsay and exhibits,” such as the IPCC report.
The IPCC is an international United Nations body set up to assess science related to climate with 195 members.
The utility also said the energy engineer sought to offer “improper legal opinions as a nonlawyer” and requested the Montana Public Service Commission strike that testimony.
On a 3-2 vote Tuesday, the Montana Public Service Commission supported a staff recommendation to allow the engineer, with the Montana Environmental Information Center, to testify as an expert witness.
But the PSC agreed he could not offer legal conclusions, as also recommended in the draft order from staff.
A minority on the commission tried to block expert testimony from the witness.
The order to allow the engineer to testify as an expert happened when PSC President Brad Molnar urged the commission to avoid a double standard and treat the witness fairly.
The PSC is all Republican, and Molnar said if the commission determined the MEIC witness wasn’t an expert, a future commission with a different political makeup could use the same rationale to disqualify witnesses for NorthWestern Energy.
He also said the commission will have the ability to test the engineer’s testimony.
“If there is one golden nugget in there, either substantiated by cross examination or refuted by cross examination, it has been worthy of our time,” Molnar said.
Molnar also said the argument to silence the engineer was not based in fact.
“What we have is a desire to stop one person from testifying because one other moving party (NorthWestern) in this soon-to-be drama doesn’t want people to hear what he has to say,” Molnar said. “And I can’t go with that.”
The dispute is one small debate in another rate case filed by NorthWestern Energy and already drawing scrutiny after a 2023 settlement the PSC approved that hiked electric bills nearly 28%.
Montanans have been fighting about the effects of climate change in different political arenas, including at the utility regulatory agency.
The witness whom NorthWestern tried to block, Nick Fitzmaurice of the Montana Environmental Information Center, said in written pre-filed testimony the utility has “neglected to account” for risks that climate change poses to its operations and credit.
“Corporate analysts have specifically and repeatedly noted that ‘climate change’ creates multiple risks for NorthWestern Energy,” Fitzmaurice said in part of his testimony. “Moody’s identified climate change as posing multiple risks to NorthWestern Energy.”
Attempts to cull and curate witness testimony in cases aren’t new, but the debate this week shows the pending rate case as another battleground over the role played by climate change in energy costs.
In an email to the Daily Montanan, NorthWestern spokesperson Jo Dee Black said the utility was not attempting to disallow information in the case.
“This motion was made not to limit an issue or topic but to ensure the professional standards for qualification as an expert witness were upheld,” Black said. “NorthWestern did not have any issues with this witness testifying as a lay or fact witness.”
However, Anne Hedges, with the Montana Environmental Information Center, said NorthWestern admits it doesn’t employ any scientific expert on climate change itself.
Hedges said it’s disingenuous for the utility to try to bill customers for climate impacts such as wildfire yet try to stifle the person giving testimony about climate change.
“Not having testimony means the commission can’t consider climate change at all, and that is exactly what they want,” Hedges said of NorthWestern. “So good for Brad Molnar. Good for the commission.”
In its motion, NorthWestern called on the PSC to strike “irrelevant evidence” from Fitzmaurice, energy transition engineer for the MEIC.
Fitzmaurice holds a bachelor’s degree in industrial management systems engineering from Montana State University and has worked in energy policy and modeling, according to his MEIC biography.
The utility tried to exclude his statements about its emissions and the economic impacts of climate change in Montana, and it tried to exclude testimony from Kyle Unruh of Renewable Northwest.
NorthWestern also disputed Fitzmaurice as an expert witness — experts are allowed to rely on reports, or “hearsay” not personally experienced, to explain their opinions.
NorthWestern, though, said Fitzmaurice should only be allowed to testify as a “lay witness” — meaning he could testify only from personal experience, which would exclude testimony based on an IPCC report.
Witnesses in rate cases file written testimony in advance of hearings.
At the meeting this week, PSC legal counsel Lucas Hamilton said staff found some of the testimony Fitzmaurice provided to be “impermissible legal conclusions” more appropriately submitted later on in the case.
However, Hamilton said staff recommended finding Fitzmaurice’s testimony relevant, contrary to NorthWestern’s motion, although he said its credibility would be up to the commission to determine.
Before the PSC approved the recommended order from staff, Commissioner Annie Bukacek moved to disqualify Fitzmaurice, with support from Commissioner Jennifer Fielder.
Bukacek said Fitzmaurice “has not done enough actual work” in his field, and she had yet to meet an “expert in climatology or energy policy” who didn’t have a doctorate degree.
“Standards matter in any field that provides critical information, such as energy policy,” Bukacek said.
In response to a question, however, Hamilton said without a point of reference from the parties, the standard for qualifying a person as “an expert” within the field of energy policy is discretionary.
In the meantime, he said, the Montana rules of evidence call for a liberal interpretation of who is an expert — and allow an expert’s testimony to be scrutinized.
PSC staff attorney Amanda Webster said if the PSC deemed Fitzmaurice a “lay witness” as opposed to an expert, it would “effectively preclude him” from testifying altogether.
“There wouldn’t be much left of his testimony,” Webster said.
The move to oust Fitzmaurice from the list of experts failed, with only Bukacek and Fielder in support. Commissioners Randy Pinocci and Jeff Welborn supported Molnar’s move to adopt the draft order prepared by staff.
Pinocci said he didn’t want a disqualification by the PSC to lead to a costly lawsuit alleging the commission had drawn an improper conclusion about an expert.
Unruh, with Renewable NorthWest, declined to comment beyond his written testimony. The order from the PSC denied NorthWestern’s move to strike his remarks.
Relying in part on an IPCC report, Unruh argues NorthWestern is putting Montana ratepayers at “substantial economic risk” and “regulatory risk” by ignoring the effects of greenhouse gas emissions.
But Hedges, with the MEIC, said NorthWestern Energy has become more bullish, and the rate case is demonstrating “their new aggressive position toward the commission and toward customers.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Methane-Plant2.int_-1024x819.jpg,,,2025-05-30 17:05:40.985741

With a narrow balance of power in the U.S. Senate, if U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan has the courage to work with Sen. Lisa  Murkowski, he can help stop this unprecedented attack on health care and core Medicaid services. President Donald Trump and Republicans are trying to cancel Alaskans’ Medicaid health coverage to finance tax cuts for the ultra-wealthy, and those elitists will succeed if our senators don’t fight back.
Alaska has one of, if not the highest rates of suicide, child abuse, domestic abuse, and sexual assault in the nation. Many of the victims utilize services that are funded by Medicaid. This may include individualized therapy and family therapy, intensive behavioral support in community and school settings, case management that secures outside resources for families in need such as food stamps, housing, therapeutic foster care placements, and reunification with families or adoption. Without access to these services, Alaska’s suicide rates could climb, crime rates could increase, and more children could enter foster care without the supportive treatment they need to navigate their trauma. 
As a frontline mental and behavioral health worker, I worry for the youth I serve and how lack of available services and strained capacity will impact their growth. I worry that in the future, I may see youth that I have served living on the streets, turn to drugs to cope, or succumb to suicide. This month, Anchorage lost the Crisis Recovery Center that provided emergency care to teens experiencing mental health crises. Can we really afford to lose anything more? 
Our senators have the chance to ensure the youth of Alaska have a safe and stable future. Based on public statements, U.S. Republican Senators Murkowski, Lisa Collins of Maine, and Josh Hawley of Missouri all oppose cuts to Medicaid. Sullivan could be a deciding vote.

(Photo courtesy of VisitGreenvilleSC)When President Trump’s top trade adviser attacked BMW in Greer, the local reaction was swift and fierce.
“He’s divorced from reality,” said Spartanburg County Council Vice Chair David Britt, speaking of that top official, Peter Navarro. “He has a twisted view of the United States. He lives in the ‘70s.”
Ouch. But there’s more: “This is why you don’t let people and passengers on a plane fly it,” Britt added.
In other words, Britt was inviting Navarro, architect of Trump’s controversial tariff policies, to kindly butt out of the Upstate’s business.
In ruby red South Carolina, that’s some tough talk directed at Trump’s influential trade adviser.
What prompted the strong reaction from Britt and Upstate business leaders was Navarro blasting BWM and Mercedes for importing car parts to make finished vehicles in South Carolina.
“This business model where BMW and Mercedes come into Spartanburg, South Carolina, and have us assemble German engines and Austrian transmissions — that doesn’t work for America. It’s bad for our economics. It’s bad for our national security,” Navarro said.
Navarro was referring to BMW’s sprawling manufacturing facility known as Plant Spartanburg. But he got the Mercedes plant location wrong. It’s near Charleston, not Spartanburg.
Navarro believes Trump’s tariffs will force auto companies to manufacture all car parts, “from bolt to body,” here in the U.S.
“Peter Navarro is out of touch,” Britt said. “He needs to visit Plant Spartanburg with BMW if he really wants to see what’s going on. My blood boils when this sort of thing happens.”
Tariffs raise costs
The strong reaction by Britt and Upstate business leaders was really not surprising.
The not-so-secret reality of the Upstate economy is that it’s driven by massive foreign investment and strong international imports and exports.
The globalization goose lays the golden eggs. Or call it a Carolina wren.
The Upstate economy is internationally connected. Tariffs raise costs, obstructing the smooth and successful operation of South Carolina’s top manufacturers. Those higher costs are passed on to the American consumer in the form of higher prices.
In the Lowcountry, meanwhile, David Wren reports in the SC Daily Gazette that Volvo Cars has halted production at its Ridgefield plant because of a parts shortage caused at least in part by Trump’s fluctuating tariffs.
Trump, it seems, is a president who likes walls, whether on the southern border or in the form of trade barriers like tariffs.
The average U.S. tariff rate is 17.8%, more than seven times the 2.5% Trump inherited, the Financial Times recently reported.
But the Upstate’s iconic symbol is not a wall but a bridge. Aptly named “Liberty Bridge,” the expansive footbridge towers over the beautiful Reedy River Falls near downtown Greenville.
The modern miracle of Greenville — and if you’ve been around at least three decades or so, you know what a miracle it is — is built on trade freedom, not on trade war.
Washington speaks of economic adversaries. The Upstate seeks out economic partners.
With classic Southern hospitality, the Upstate has welcomed hundreds of international businesses such as Germany’s BMW (more than 11,000 workers), France’s Michelin (more than 9,000 workers), Sweden’s Eloctrolux, Switzerland’s Nestle, Japan’s Fujifilm, and Germany’s ZF, Bosch, Adidas, and Draexlmaier, just to name a few.
The Greenville Area Development Corporation points out that South Carolina as a whole frequently ranks as the No. 1 state for attracting jobs through foreign direct investment per capita.
More than 250 international firms from 28 countries have a major presence in the Upstate.
“We welcome this melting pot of residents and visitors with open arms,” the Greenville development corporation says.
‘Good for America’
In a joint statement, the Greenville Chamber of Commerce and OneSpartanburg rose to the defense of BMW, drawing attention to the Upstate’s diversified and globalized economy: “BMW Group’s Plant Spartanburg drove Upstate South Carolina’s transformation from a declining textile economy to a thriving center of advanced manufacturing.”
BMW packs an economic wallop, employing more than 11,000 workers and providing a $26.7-billion impact for South Carolina.
The plant is the largest exporter of vehicles by value in the U.S., shipping 225,000 vehicles worth more than $10 billion in 2024, Upstate business leaders said.
BMW has produced 5 million vehicles in Greer since the plant opened in 1994.
U.S. Rep. William Timmons, who represents Greenville and Spartanburg counties in Congress, and Gov. Henry McMaster also added their support for BMW’s policies.
“I can assure you that BMW is good for South Carolina and America,” Timmons said.
The SC Daily Gazette’s Jessica Holdman provided a detailed and in-depth report on how Trump’s tariffs could cause serious harm to South Carolina’s thriving auto industry.
Tariffs raise prices on imported car parts and potentially undermine car exports from South Carolina.
Trump has scaled back some of his disruptive auto tariffs, but not permanently.
Globalization doesn’t deserve all the credit for the Upstate’s bustling and ever-growing economy, but international investment and free trade have been an unambiguous godsend for the region and the entire state.
Upstate businesses will weather the storm, knowing that the nation eventually will return to its free-trade foundation.
After all, the Upstate’s defining symbol is a bridge, not a wall.

The American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit in federal court in that year, claiming Monroe County Sheriff Richard Ramsay unlawfully detained and nearly deported the U.S. citizen. 
U.S. Judge Kathleen Williams ruled in favor of Brown on summary judgement Friday on two counts: unconstitutional seizure in violation of the Fourth Amendment and false imprisonment. 
According to court records, Brown, born in Philadelphia in 1968, turned himself in for a probation violation in 2018 after testing positive for marijuana. His fingerprints were submitted to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which identified him as having a final removal order and he was held by the county to be taken into federal custody. 
While in custody, Brown insisted to sheriff deputies that he was a citizen and offered a birth certificate. County officials did nothing to contest ICE’s claim that Brown was not a citizen, Williams wrote. 
“Mr. Brown repeatedly informed MCSO of his U.S. citizenship prior to the new arrest and offered documentation of his claims. The Court finds that this is the exact type of information that renders the earlier probable cause determination to be stale, requiring some sort of action on MCSO’s part to verify or inquire about ICE’s probable cause determination.”
The 2018 arrest was the second time Brown had been arrested after being suspected of not being a U.S. citizen. ICE had been looking for someone else named Peter Brown, with a different middle name. 
According to court findings, sheriff’s employees routinely accessed a database that identified Brown as a citizen, but did not pass that information on to ICE.

After Brown’s time in jail for the probation violation concluded, he was immediately re-arrested to be held for ICE and potential deportation to Jamaica. He was transported to Krome Detention Center in Miami. Once there, he told ICE agents he was a citizen. The agents checked his birth certificate and arranged for his release. 
Brown had called ICE multiple times from county jail, but was unable to get through.
“MCSO could have contacted ICE to investigate Mr. Brown’s claims of citizenship or, if unwilling to do that, released him based on their own records that dissipated probable cause. To hold otherwise would be to permit law enforcement agencies to use the collective knowledge doctrine as both a sword and a shield,” Williams wrote. 
That’s a principle that law officers can rely on information provided by other police agencies.
Oral arguments for the case were held on May 15, 2024. 
“We have seen the ICE detainer system fail time and again, but the County still chose to put Mr. Brown through this nightmare,” said Cody Wofsy, deputy project director of the ACLU’s Immigrants’ Rights Project. “At a moment in which we are seeing a raft of unlawful immigration arrests of citizens by federal and local authorities, this decision is a key reminder that the Fourth Amendment safeguards us all.”
In a 26-page partial summary judgement, Williams denied the sheriff’s motion to throw out Brown’s case.
“The Court is not ordering that MCSO cannot comply with ICE detainers and warrants. Instead, the Court’s holding today is simply that, when MCSO possesses information indicating that an individual in MCSO custody is a U.S. Citizen, MCSO cannot abdicate its legal responsibility and turn a blind eye to this information,” Williams wrote. 
“The Court merely holds that, MCSO cannot choose to do nothing as they did here.”

(Photo by Nancy Lavin/Rhode Island Current)A battle for the open Senate District 4 seat is taking shape, with half a dozen candidates filing declaration papers with the Rhode Island Secretary of State’s office by Friday’s 4 p.m. deadline. The upcoming special election features four Democrats, one Republican and one independent candidate.
The upcoming Aug. 5 special election marks the first time the district spanning North Providence and the northern part of Providence will have a new state senator in over 40 years. Voters will choose the person who will fill the unexpired term of Senate President Dominick Ruggerio, who died April 21, at age 76. Ruggerio was first elected to the Senate in 1984.
Each declared candidate still must secure 100 signatures from certified voters within the district to qualify for the ballot. The signature deadline is June 10.
The four Democratic candidates would first compete in a special primary on July 8. 
Among the Democratic contenders is former state representative Marcia Ranglin-Vassell of Providence. The 64-year-old Providence Public Schools teacher served three terms representing Rhode Island’s House District 6 before deciding not to run again in 2022.
In a May 2 Facebook post announcing her intent to run, Ranglin-Vassell touted a “proven track record of fighting and winning.” During her six years in the House, she championed progressive policies like a $15 minimum wage and gun control alongside education and equity initiatives.
Education reform was a top priority for fellow Democratic candidate Manny Taveras. Taveras, 40 of North Providence, also emphasized housing and small business services in his May 14 campaign announcement.
Manny Taveras is the younger brother of former Providence Mayor Angel Taveras, who led the capital city from 2011 to 2015. The younger Taveras also worked for the Providence mayor’s Office of Neighborhood Services from 2008 to 2010, according to his LinkedIn page. He now works as an account executive for private pharmacy benefits manager MedImpact, according to his LinkedIn. This will be his first run for elected office.
Also in the running is Democratic North Providence Town Councilman Stefano Famiglietti. Famiglietti, 33, recently opened his own law practice in Providence focused on employment matters, and has served as a city councilor since 2018. In a May 20 campaign announcement, Famiglietti stressed municipal services and responsible budgeting as priorities if elected to the state Senate seat.
Rounding out the Democratic primary ballot is Lenny Cioe Jr., a nurse at Blackstone Valley Community Health who unsuccessfully challenged Ruggerio in the last three Democratic primaries. The 65-year-old North Providence progressive announced he was entering the race Friday afternoon, 30 minutes before the deadline to file paperwork with the Rhode Island Secretary of State.
Cioe in a statement said his campaign will focus on “local issues,” including “price gouging” by utility provider Rhode Island Energy, and protecting Medicaid and other health programs from federal funding cuts.
The lone Republican, Alexander Asermely, also waited until the final day to formally enter the race. He said in a statement he felt it was time to “step up and use my voice,” lamenting economic, educational and infrastructure shortcomings across the state and within the district.
The 39-year-old father and lifelong North Providence resident works as an attorney for Bellotti Law Group in Boston, according to his LinkedIn page. Asermely is also a political newcomer, having never run for office before.
Asermely does not have any primary opponents, putting him on the path to the August special election as long as he submits the requisite voter signatures.
Also bound for the general election ballot: independent candidate Stephen G. Tocco. The North Providence resident and retired chief of Rhode Island Capitol Police served on the Smithfield Town Council from 2004 to 2007. He also ran multiple unsuccessful campaigns for state Senate, including against Ruggerio in a three-way Democratic primary in 2022. All but one of his prior candidacies for office have been as a Democrat; in 2020, he ran as an independent candidate for the Senate District 22 seat, which spans parts of Smithfield, North Providence and Lincoln.
While the seat was held by a Democrat for the last 40 years, the district is nearly evenly split between registered Democrats and independents, who comprise 45% and 44%, respectively, of its 22,300 registered voters as of May, according to data with the Rhode Island Department of State. The remaining 11% of voters are registered Republicans.
Voters have until June 8 to register, or disaffiliate, ahead of the July 8 primary election. Early voting is set to begin June 18, running through July 7.
The winner of the election will serve the rest of Ruggerio’s two-year term, through 2026. 
State lawmakers are paid $19,817 a year.

(Henry Redman | Wisconsin Examiner)For the seventh time, Gov. Tony Evers ordered the Progress Pride Flag to fly over the Wisconsin State Capitol for LGBTQ Pride Month. 
This year, Pride Month begins on the 10th anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Obergefell v. Hodges, which gave same-sex couples the right to get married in 2015. But Evers’ celebration of LGBTQ pride is occuring as the administration of President Donald Trump attacks the rights of transgender people and a recent Gallup poll found that Republican acceptance of same-sex marriage has fallen to its lowest level in nine years. 
“When the Pride Flag flies above the People’s House, it sends a clear and unequivocal message that Wisconsin recognizes and celebrates LGBTQ Wisconsinites and Americans,” Evers said in a statement. “Every day, but especially today and this month, we reaffirm our commitment to striving to be a place where every LGBTQ kid, person, and family can be bold in their truth and be safe, treated with dignity and respect, and welcomed without fear of persecution, judgment, or discrimination. I promised long ago that, as governor, I would always fight to protect LGBTQ Wisconsinites with every tool and every power that I have. I will never stop keeping that promise.”
In the executive order Evers signed Friday, he notes that the LGBTQ has been under attack in recent years, including in Wisconsin where Republicans have tried more than once to pass legislation attacking transgender children.
“Despite historic victories, in the last several years, there has been a significant increase in anti-LGBTQ legislation introduced in state Legislatures across the country, including in Wisconsin, that have targeted LGBTQ kids and people and increased dangerous anti-LGBTQ rhetoric, as well as efforts on a state and national level to erase LGBTQ history and stories.” 
The Progress Pride Flag flying above the Capitol includes the recognizable LGBTQ rainbow colors and a chevron of additional stripes that represent LGBTQ people of color, the transgender community and people with HIV/AIDS.

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)Job Corps centers in Albany and Brunswick are set to shut their doors by June 30 after the U.S. Department of Labor announced plans to suspend operations at nearly 100 locations nationwide.
The Job Corps program dates back to 1964 and was created as part of President Lyndon B. Johnson’s “War on Poverty.” The program, which claims to be “the largest nationwide residential career training program in the country,” works by providing low-income students ages 16 to 24 with housing, education, career training and employment assistance, primarily in industries like manufacturing, construction and health care. 
However, the program encountered serious hurdles during the COVID-19 pandemic, and currently faces a $140 million budget deficit that Department of Labor officials estimate could grow to $213 million by next year. The federal agency cited a report from April highlighting metrics like the average annual cost per student, average total costs per graduate and total violent crime rates.
“Job Corps was created to help young adults build a pathway to a better life through education, training, and community,” U.S. Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer said in a statement. “However, a startling number of serious incident reports and our in-depth fiscal analysis reveal the program is no longer achieving the intended outcomes that students deserve.”
In total, 99 centers that are run by contract agencies will be forced to close should the plan take effect. An additional 24 centers owned and operated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture will not be affected by the closures. Atlanta is home to the program’s Region 3 office, overseeing centers across Georgia, Alabama, Florida, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee. 
The Department of Labor said it plans to arrange transportation back home for roughly 25,000 currently enrolled students, and to connect them with other educational and employment resources. It is unclear how many students across Georgia will be affected. Calls to the Atlanta-based Jobs Corps office were not answered and emails sent to two top officials received a bounce back message.
Lawmakers in Congress were quick to push back against the sudden closures, citing a long history of bipartisan support for the program.
“The Job Corps program is the embodiment of a hand up and not a handout,” said U.S. Rep. Sanford Bishop, an Albany Democrat who co-chairs the bipartisan Congressional Job Corps Caucus. “It provides workforce skills and training that empower participants to become self-sufficient and productive citizens. Today’s foolish action by the White House and the United States Department of Labor to close the Job Corps program will shatter the dreams and aspirations of tens of thousands of promising students.”
Critics of the closures, including the National Job Corps Association, have also argued that the data used to compile the report is misleading, since it focuses solely on metrics from 2023, a year when the program was still struggling to recover from pandemic-era hurdles that lowered enrollment and graduation numbers.
Notably, this is not the first time President Donald Trump’s administration has targeted the Job Corps program for closures. Sonny Purdue, the former Georgia governor who later served as Agriculture Secretary in the first Trump Administration and is now the chancellor of the Georgia Board of Regents, also attempted to shutter nine Job Corps centers and transfer an additional 16 centers to private contractors back in 2019. However, he quickly dropped the bid after encountering fierce congressional pushback — including from then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.

Sabrina Cervantes maintained from the start that she wasn’t drunk or on drugs after she was cited for DUI.,"In summary
California Sen. Sabrina Cervantes maintained from the start that she wasn’t drunk or on drugs after she was cited for DUI. 


Prosecutors will not file DUI charges against California Sen. Sabrina Cervantes, after a blood test showed she had “no measurable amount of drugs or alcohol in her system” following a crash last week in Sacramento a few blocks from the Capitol.
“We have reviewed all the submitted evidence, including police reports, witness statements, and laboratory results. Based on our ethical duty and the burden of proof in a criminal trial, the Sacramento County DA’s Office declines to file any charges in this case,” Shelly Orio, a spokeswoman for the Sacramento District Attorney’s Office, said in an email.
The announcement is a vindication for Cervantes, a 37-year-old Democrat from the Riverside area. She maintained from the start that she wasn’t impaired and that Sacramento police officers “accosted” her at a hospital where they detained her for several hours. 
Cervantes did not immediately respond to a request for comment today.
The Sacramento Police Department responded with an emailed statement in response to a CalMatters interview request.  
“During their interaction with Sen. Cervantes, they observed objective signs that led them to believe she may have been impaired while operating a motor vehicle,” police said. “The officers remained professional throughout, taking time to explain the process and answer all of the senator’s questions.”Officers said Cervantes initially declined to participate with officers’ sobriety tests. So they asked a judge for a warrant for Cervantes to submit to a blood test and told Cervantes they had requested one.
“While the warrant was being written and processed, the senator agreed to voluntarily provide a blood sample, however, since the warrant process was already underway officers waited until it was signed by a judge before proceeding with the blood draw, which was conducted by a licensed phlebotomist,” police said. 
The May 19 crash happened around 1 p.m., less than an hour before she was supposed to be on the floor of the state Legislature.
Last week, CalMatters reviewed footage from a nearby office building’s security camera that appears to show Cervantes wasn’t at fault in the crash.
The footage shows a white SUV rolling through a stop sign and careening into Cervantes’ black sedan at the intersection of 14th and S streets in midtown Sacramento. Cervantes appeared to have had the right-of-way as she drove east on S Street.
Sacramento police said the other driver was cited for failing to stop at a stop sign. Last week, CalMatters filed a public records request seeking body camera footage and police reports.
In the statement, police said they will release some documents later Friday and are still processing others.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/042423-Assembly-Floor-0424-MG-CM-08.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-30 17:05:40.985741

DemasA federal judge on Thursday said the director of the Michigan Department of Corrections and other defendants did not meet their burden of proof when they alleged that the plaintiffs in an ongoing dangerous conditions lawsuit did not exhaust their administrative remedies before going to court.
It was yet another win for the plaintiffs in Bailey v. Washington, which has been gestating in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan since 2019.
In an order released Thursday by U.S. District Judge Stephen Murphy of the Eastern District of Michigan, the court found significant flaws with the department’s grievance process. MDOC Director Heidi Washington and other department defendants said that the plaintiffs failed to use that process to its fullest extent before filing a lawsuit, but Murphy noted that the flaws in the system prevented the plaintiffs’ grievances from being heard by the department.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“By detailing the consequences of the inadequate ventilation in their grievances, the plaintiffs gave MDOC ‘a fair opportunity to address [the] claims on the merits before federal litigation was commenced,’” Murphy wrote.
Washington and the department defendants moved twice for summary judgment in the case but were denied. After the defendants moved for an evidentiary hearing to resolve factual issues, the matter was moved to a magistrate, who found Washington and department officials failed to meet their burden of proof in showing that plaintiff Paula Bailey and others did not do everything they could to raise concerns over the prison’s declining conditions.
Washington and the defendants challenged the magistrate’s findings, specifically objecting to the assertion that the grievances related to ventilation in the prison had sufficiently put the department on notice. 
Murphy on Thursday said at least two relevant grievances shared in the evidentiary hearing had effectively put the department on notice. 
Murphy also noted that the department had repeatedly rejected grievances as untimely despite circumstances beyond the control of inmates.
bailey-order-overruling-226-objections-and-ado
Washington and the defendants had challenged that portion as going outside the scope of the court’s referral on the factual matters in question, but Murphy said the mail system used by Corrections and its inherent delays were a large part of why the grievances were deemed untimely.
“Faced with this and other issues, the Report found that the grievance policy was unavailable to the plaintiffs Bailey, Clark, and Zentz,” Murphy wrote. “In doing so, the report commented on the prison mailbox rule. The report’s findings, and the way in which [U.S. Magistrate Judge Elizabeth Stafford] explained her findings, may have an impact on future cases. But the court will not hold off on adopting the two pages just because they may have consequences in other cases. The objection is overruled.”
The lawsuit alleges that the department maintained poor conditions at the Huron Valley Women’s Correctional Facility, which later led to the presence of toxic mold. The case was initially dismissed along with Pearson v. Corrections, but was later revived by the courts on an amended complaint.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/IMG_2381-768x1024.jpg,,,2025-05-30 16:07:04.220283

“Luther’s reputation as a selective liberal arts college that is known for its involved students, committed faculty and staff, and a strong sense of community inspired me to apply, and I am delighted to accept President Chamberlain’s offer,” Bacon said in the release. “Given my experience at a faith-based residential liberal arts college and my own life-changing experiences attending a residential liberal arts college, I am excited to engage with the challenges and opportunities that are ahead for Luther College.”
Bacon previously served as faculty and administrator for the College of Saint Benedict, a women’s college, and Saint John’s University, a men’s college, as the institutions share curriculum, faculty and leadership. There she worked to oversee academic affairs and the colleges’ division of student success, according to the release, among other duties.
Once at Luther College, Bacon will oversee a combined department of academic affairs and student success and engagement, the release stated. The college brought academic and student affairs together into one program in 2021, Chamberlain said in the release, and its more holistic methods of serving students have seen success. Bacon said in the release she’s ready to work with the Luther community to “ensure that students receive a holistic, immersive experience that is both academically enriching and personally transformative.”
Chamberlain said he is excited to work with Bacon and see her “impact on improving the experiences of students, faculty and staff” at the college.
“Dr. Bacon brings to Luther College a passion for supporting the holistic development that students should experience, inside and outside of the classroom, at residential, liberal arts colleges,” Chamberlain said. “Informed by her academic training as a social psychologist and her progressive experience as an academic administrator, Dr. Bacon’s empathetic, relational and collaborative approach emphasizes engaging stakeholders, considering alternative perspectives, and using data to inform decision-making processes.”

A campaign website and social media account for Sen. David Yates, the Democratic Whip from Louisville, were updated Friday to reflect his plans to run for Jefferson County clerk next year. His website now has a campaign kick-off scheduled for Monday, June 9, with appearances by Louisville area Democrats, including U.S. Rep. Morgan McGarvey and former U.S. Rep. John Yarmuth. 
Yates’ updated website comes on the heels of another Democratic senator leaving the caucus. Sen. Robin Webb, of Grayson, changed her party affiliation Friday to join the Republican Party. 
Bobbie Holsclaw, the Jefferson County clerk since 1998, is an elected Republican in Louisville, a Kentucky city where voters tend to favor Democrats. She faced some criticism after the November election following an issue with e-poll books that delayed lines early in the day. Democrats sued to keep the polls open longer in the day, but a Jefferson Circuit judge denied their emergency request. 
Yates’ campaign did not immediately return an emailed request for comment. 
An attorney, Yates was elected to the Senate in 2020. He won reelection in November for the 37th Senate District, taking more than 60% of the vote in the general election.

Unlike criminal bonds, bond seekers only have to post 10% of the bond cost, which many families can’t afford.","Activists protest the agenda of President  Donald Trump during a rally near the water tower on the Magnificent Mile on Jan. 25, 2025, in Chicago, Illinois. (Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)In his six years helping run the Casa San José Bail Fund, Guillermo Perez says lately, he has been attending more ICE bail hearings and helping getting more undocumented immigrants out of detention than ever. 
“People are scared right now, immigrants are being attacked like never before,” said Perez, an immigration activist and retired Steelworkers union organizer. 
In late April, ICE raided a popular Mexican restaurant in Beaver County, 1942 Tequilas and Tacos. Eight employees were detained, one of several that activists say have been happening in Pittsburgh at laundromats, apartment buildings, and even school bus stops. The latest raids in the region were in Braddock and Wilkinsburg in the final days of May. 
For activists like Perez, each raid put them into a scramble to figure out how they could assist immigrants and their families affected. One way is through the Casa San José Bail Fund, which he helped found.
The fund is helping to ease fears by getting immigrants out of detention and giving them legal resources to fight deportations. Founded during the first Trump Administration in 2019, the Casa San José Bail Fund has raised more than $200,000 from people in the Pittsburgh area. Unlike criminal bonds, bond seekers only have to post 10% of the bond cost, which many families can’t afford. 
Since its inception, it’s made 61 loans to various families and helped protect dozens of families from deportation. 
Across Pennsylvania, two other ICE bail funds have emerged to help immigrants in detention.
In Lancaster, where 42% of the population is Latino according to the U.S. Census Bureau the Parish Resource Center maintains the Immigration Bond and Advocacy Network. In Philadelphia, the New Sanctuary Movement maintains the Community Fund for Bond and Legal Support.
Unlike the Casa San José ICE bail fund, which raises all of its money locally, both funds are part of the National Bail Fund Network. The network also helps in providing bail funds for American citizens jailed on criminal charges. 
“They connect different bond funds,” says Peter Pedemonti of the New Sanctuary Movement of Philadelphia. “So if we might not have all the money, we could connect with a fund in Massachusetts or somewhere else to pull money together.”

Pedemonti says that there is a growing nationwide movement aimed at getting more immigrants out of ICE detention. 
“At a time where there’s been a daily assault on immigrant families, both on the ground with ICE agents and also from the White House with policy coming out. I think it is, it is really important to have that, like that concrete small action and that concrete action of liberation,,” says Pedemonti. “It’s a small victory for one family.”
Studies have shown that immigrants who can get out of immigration detention are far less likely to be deported. Some fleeing violence can seek asylum and other venues to achieve legal status successfully. The process can often take years, but some immigrants have found legal ways to stay in the United States. 
However, those who stay in detention are sometimes subject to isolation and conditions, which advocates have often described as inhuman and unsanitary. 
“What they do is they put tremendous pressure on people to just go ahead and sign away their rights to due process,” said Perez. “They just use incarceration as a way of pressuring people to self-deport”.

The fund works with a network of immigration attorneys to review the circumstances of each case and assess the likelihood that a bond could be successful. 
“If we assess that they do have a possible path for why they should be allowed to legally stay in the United States, then we go ahead and try to get them legal representation so that they can see if they’re eligible to get a bond,” said Perez. 
Unlike traditional bail funds, Casa San José does not charge interest and allows families to repay the bail over the years. The funds are then reused to help other immigrants get bail. 
Perez says it has helped mobilize immigrants around Pittsburgh to become politically active in groups like Casa San José. 
“Rather than just handing somebody money and wishing them best of luck, we want them to continue to be involved (with) Casa San José, to be involved in helping other people in the community who are being impacted by deportations as well,” said Perez. “So the goal of the bond fund is not only obviously (to) get people out of detention, but also to try to convey that the community is stronger when we support each other”. 
Some donors  sign up to give the fund $20 a month, but the bulk of the money comes from several large fundraisers.  A variety of community groups in Pittsburgh are holding these types of events to support its efforts. 
In late March, Temple Sinai was packed with over 100 Jewish activists who showed up for the “De-ICE Ball.” 
“There’s nothing like when the Jewish community shows up. You guys are no joke,” said Monica Ruiz, the director of Casa San José, to a clapping crowd of Jewish activists.
The event raised more than $18,000.
“I’m shocked at how many people showed up,” said Harry Hochheiser, one of the organizers.
Hochheiser is a member of the Dor Hadash Synagogue. In 2018, one of their congregation’s members, Dr. Jerry Rabonwitz, was killed when a shooter killed 11 Jews who attended three different congregations located in the Tree of Life Synagogue complex, just a few blocks from Temple Sinai. The Oct. 27, 2018, attack is the deadliest attack against Jews in American history. 
The shooter said that he murdered them because their congregations were fundraising to help immigrants through the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society.
“I think to some extent, that’s faded from people’s memories a little bit, even here, but it’s definitely in the back of my mind,” Hochheiser said. 
Hochheiser said Jews, though, are largely motivated to help immigrants due to their own history of persecution. 
He pointed out the fundraiser was taking place right around the 86th anniversary of the United States turning away the SS St. Louis, which was carrying over 900 Jewish refugees fleeing Hitler. They were denied entry to the United States and 254 of the passengers would later be killed in the Holocaust when they were returned to Europe. 
“It’s knowing your history, and it’s looking back to think, ‘Hey, you know what, what was it like for my grandparents,'” he said. “I can’t imagine being turned back or turned away.” 
At a time when many activists say that they feel helpless in stopping the Trump administration’s deportation efforts, organizers say giving to the Casa San José Bail fund gives them a tangible way to help people. 
“I think particularly at this moment, there are a lot of people who are just looking to do something,” said Hochheiser.

(Photo by John McAnulty/Getty Images)The Mount St. Helens visitor center is reopening its doors with the first major renovations since it opened in 1986.
Starting on May 31, the center will be open daily from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Prior to the renovation, exhibits remained largely unchanged since they were first installed nearly four decades ago, and only six years after the volcano erupted. The center closed Sept. 30, 2024, and work began on upgrades with funding from the state.
The $1.1 million renovation will be centered around the Cowlitz Indian Tribe and the 1980 eruption and will feature more tactile, sensory, interactive exhibits tailored to kids and families.
Mount St. Helens is famous for its massive eruption on May 18, 1980, which killed 57 people, blasted away part of the mountain, and spewed about 540 million tons of ash.
The mountain has played a central role in the customs and culture of the Cowlitz Tribe and other Indigenous people across this region. Washington State Parks worked closely with the tribe to highlight its culture and traditions and provide visitors a holistic understanding of the mountain and the tribe’s perspective.
New exhibits include contemporary and historic works by Cowlitz artists and in the Cowlitz language. One of the exhibits includes a new film of a Cowlitz spiritual leader, Tanna Engdahl. Additionally, there are several short films that highlight the tribe’s use of natural resources.
Since the eruption, the mountain’s landscape has undergone significant changes. Scientists have since deepened their understanding of both the eruption and ongoing volcanic activity within the mountain, said Sarah Fronk, a spokesperson for Washington State Parks.
“The exhibits have been updated to reflect current science and to provide a broader story about the mountain’s long history of eruptions,” she added.
Visitors can expect an enhanced experience with hands-on learning through interactive displays and storytelling, along with improvements to the reception desk design and the flow of the building. Accessibility improvements have also been made inside and outside the building.
Some of the new offerings include a “Make-a-Quake” exhibit that lets you create your own shockwaves with a seismograph, a new and improved “walk-in” volcano that takes you inside a replica of the mountain, and a “Volcano Blasters” pinball machine.
There are also over 80 historic artifacts, volcanic rocks, a wetland exploration area, and a three-dimensional relief map of the mountain.
A new “Junior Volcano Explorer” activity booklet and badge program is also offered to kids.
Admission for children under 7 is free. The cost is $2.50 for youth ages 7 to 17 and $5 for adults.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/mount-st.-helens-1024x685.jpg,,,2025-05-30 16:07:04.220283

Turtle Mountain, Spirit Lake Nation and three tribal citizens are challenging a ruling in a voting rights case. (Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)The Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa, Spirit Lake Nation and three tribal citizens this week asked the full 8th Circuit Court of Appeals to review a three-judge panel’s finding that they lack standing to bring a voting discrimination case against the state of North Dakota.
In a 2-1 decision earlier this month, the panel overruled a North Dakota federal district court’s decision that a redistricting plan adopted by the state in 2021 diluted the voting power of Native voters.
“Turtle Mountain fought hard for a fair and legal map. When the state draws unlawful districts, Courts must step in to protect voters — not pave the way for injustice,” Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Chairman Jamie Azure said in a statement published by the Campaign Legal Center, one of the organizations representing the plaintiffs in the suit. “We will continue to fight for fair representation.”
Appeals court rules against North Dakota tribes in voting rights case

The panel’s decision didn’t speak to whether the map itself was discriminatory; instead, the judges found that private individuals cannot use a key federal civil rights law as a vehicle to file cases under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which outlaws race-based voting discrimination.
The panel in its ruling sent the case back to North Dakota U.S. District Judge Peter Welte with instructions to dismiss the lawsuit. If its ruling stands, North Dakota would revert back to the 2021 map.
But if the plaintiffs’ request for an en banc rehearing is granted, the case would go before all 11 judges on the 8th Circuit for review.
“Section 2 is the foundational statute that Congress enacted to fight the scourge of racial discrimination in voting, but citizens in this circuit can no longer enforce the right it provides them,” the plaintiffs argue in a brief urging the full appellate court to consider the case.
Private individuals and groups previously could file discrimination lawsuits against governments under just Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act without having to invoke Section 1983, a separate civil rights statute.
Then, the 8th Circuit in a controversial 2023 ruling on an Arkansas voting rights case found that Section 2 alone doesn’t give private parties the right to sue. Instead, the circuit declared that it is the responsibility of the U.S. Attorney General to file Section 2 discrimination cases.
Tribes, state argue redistricting case to federal appeals court

For more than a year, the question remained open as to whether Section 1983 offered a viable alternative for bringing such Voting Rights Act claims. In a May 14 ruling, the three-judge panel decided it does not.
In a majority opinion, the panel wrote that the language of the Voting Rights Act indicates that Congress didn’t intend for citizens to file race discrimination claims through Section 1983.
The lone dissenting judge on the panel — Chief Judge Steven Colloton — noted in his opinion  that private plaintiffs have brought more than 400 actions under Section 2 since 1982.
The plaintiffs in their brief point out that the 8th Circuit is the only appellate circuit in the country to rule that Section 2 cannot be enforced through lawsuits brought by private citizens. The circuit includes North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Nebraska and Arkansas.
“Outside of this circuit, every American citizen can rely on an unbroken line of Supreme Court and circuit precedent to enforce the individual rights given to them by Congress in the Voting Rights Act,” their filing states. “But as a result of the panel decision here, and the prior decision in Arkansas, American citizens in this circuit are denied that right.”
The lawsuit was triggered by a redistricting plan adopted by the North Dakota Legislature in 2021 that placed the Turtle Mountain and Spirit Lake reservations in new districts.

U.S. District Court Judge Peter Welte in 2023 ruled that the new map was discriminatory and ordered the Legislature to implement a new map that placed the reservations in the same voting district.
Three Native American lawmakers from that district were elected in 2024: Sen. Richard Marcellais and Rep. Jayme Davis — both citizens of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa — and Rep. Collette Brown, a citizen of the Spirit Lake Nation and plaintiff in the lawsuit.
“The fair map we secured led to a historic first — a Spirit Lake Nation member elected to the North Dakota Legislature,” Spirit Lake Nation Chairperson Lonna Jackson-Street said in a Wednesday statement published by the Campaign Legal Center, one of the organizations representing the plaintiffs in the case. “This decision threatens that progress and weakens our voice in state government.”
Marcellais had previously served 15 years in the statehouse until he lost his bid for reelection in 2022. He was reelected in 2024. 
Davis was first elected in 2022, then reelected last year.
If the 2021 map is reinstated, three state lawmakers would move to different districts, according to the North Dakota Secretary of State’s Office. Rep. Colette Brown, D-Warwick, would go from representing District 9 to District 15. Rep. Donna Henderson, R-Calvin, would switch from District 15 to District 9B, while Sen. Kent Weston, R-Sarles, would switch from District 15 to District 9. They would all have to seek reelection in 2026.

(Brett Kelman/KFF Health News)Despite years of patient complaints and quality-of-care concerns, Ballad Health — the nation’s largest state-sanctioned hospital monopoly — will now be held to a lower standard by the Tennessee government, and state data that holds the monopoly accountable will be kept from the public for two years.
Ballad is the only option for hospital care for most of the approximately 1.1 million people in a 29-county swath of Appalachia. Such a monopoly would normally be prohibited by federal law. But under deals negotiated with Tennessee and Virginia years ago, the monopoly is permitted if both states affirm each year that it is an overall benefit to the public.
However, according to a newly renegotiated agreement between Ballad and Tennessee, the monopoly can now be considered a “clear and convincing” benefit to the public with performance that would earn a “D” on most A-to-F grading scales.
And the monopoly can be allowed to continue even with a score that most would consider an “F.”
Six years into an Appalachia hospital monopoly, patients are fearful and furious

“It’s an extreme disservice to the people of northeast Tennessee and southwest Virginia,” said Dani Cook, who has organized protests against Ballad’s monopoly for years. “We shouldn’t have lowered the bar. We should be raising the bar.”
The Ballad monopoly, which encompasses 20 hospitals and straddles the border of Tennessee and Virginia, was created in 2018 after lawmakers in both states, in an effort to prevent hospital closures, waived federal antitrust laws so two rival health systems could merge. Although Ballad has largely succeeded at keeping its hospitals open, staffing shortages and patient complaints have left some residents wary, afraid, or unwilling to seek care at Ballad hospitals, according to an investigation by KFF Health News published last year.
In Tennessee, the Ballad monopoly is regulated through a 10-year Certificate of Public Advantage agreement, or COPA — now in its seventh year — that establishes the state’s goals and a scoring rubric for hospital performance. Tennessee Department of Health documents show Ballad has fallen short of about three-fourths of the state’s quality-of-care goals over the past four fiscal years. But the monopoly has been allowed to continue, at least in part, because the scoring rubric doesn’t prioritize quality of care, according to the documents.
Angie Odom, a county commissioner in Tennessee’s Carter County, where leaders have clashed with Ballad, said she has driven her 12-year-old daughter more than 100 miles to Knoxville to avoid surgery at a Ballad hospital.
After years of disappointment in Tennessee’s oversight of the monopoly, Odom said she was “not surprised” by Ballad’s new grading scale.
“They’ve made a way that they can fail and still pass,” she said.
Virginia regulates Ballad with a different agreement and scoring method, and its reviews generally track about one or two years behind Tennessee’s. Both states have found Ballad to be an overall benefit in every year they’ve released a decision.
Neither Ballad Health nor the Tennessee Department of Health, which has the most direct oversight of the monopoly, answered questions submitted in writing about the renegotiated agreement. In an emailed statement, Molly Luton, a Ballad spokesperson, said the company’s quality of care has steadily improved in recent years, and she raised repeated complaints from the hospital system about KFF Health News’ reporting. The news organization has reviewed every complaint from Ballad and has never found a correction or clarification to be warranted in the coverage.

Tennessee Health Commissioner Ralph Alvarado, who has more than once described the regulation of Ballad Health as a matter of national importance, has declined or not responded to more than a dozen interview requests from KFF Health News to discuss the monopoly.
“Our effort and progress serve as a model for health care in Tennessee, the Appalachia Region, and the entire nation,” Alvarado said in a May news release about the monopoly, adding, “We do not take our role lightly as we remain committed to transparency in our COPA oversight.”
Tennessee’s revised agreement was negotiated behind closed doors for more than a year and announced to the public in early May. As part of that announcement, Tennessee said it wouldn’t score Ballad next year, to give the company time to adjust to the new scoring process.
Under that process, the minimum score Ballad needs to meet to show a “clear and convincing” public benefit has been lowered from 85 out of 100 to 70 out of 100. The new agreement also awards Ballad up to 20 points for providing Tennessee with data and records — for example, a report on patient satisfaction — regardless of the level of performance documented. The state can also raise or lower Ballad’s overall score by up to 5 points in light of “reputable information” that is not spelled out in the scoring rubric.
Therefore, Ballad can score as low as 65 out of 100, with nearly a third of that score awarded for merely giving information to the state, and still be found to be a “clear and convincing” benefit to the public, which is the highest finding Tennessee can bestow, according to the agreement. And Ballad could score as low as 55 out of 100 without the monopoly facing a risk of being broken up, according to the new agreement.
The agreement also increases how much of Ballad’s annual score is directly attributed to the quality of care provided in its hospitals, from 5% to 32%. But the agreement obscures how this will be measured.
Tennessee sets “baseline” goals for Ballad across dozens of quality-of-care issues — like infection rates and speed of emergency room care — and then tracks whether Ballad meets the goals. The new agreement resets these baselines to values that were not made public, leaving it unclear how much the goals for Ballad have changed. Health department spokesperson Dean Flener said the new baselines would not be disclosed until 2027.
Cook, the longtime leader of protests against Ballad, said she believes Tennessee is attempting to silence data-supported criticism until the final year of the 10-year COPA agreement, which ends in 2028.
By then, any outrage would be largely moot, she said.
“If you are going to wait until the last year to tell us the new measurements, why bother?” Cook said. “It is clear, without a shadow of a doubt, that the Tennessee Department of Health is putting the needs and concerns of a corporation above the health and well-being of people.”

(Photo by Andrew Roth/Michigan Advance)MACKINAC ISLAND – With a little over a month until the July 1 deadline, Michigan Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks (D-Grand Rapids) told the Michigan Advance she has concerns about whether the Legislature would be able to pass the state’s budget for Fiscal Year 2026 before the end of June.
“We’re at the stage where we need to negotiate the differences between a House budget and a Senate budget, and the House has not passed what you can reasonably or meaningfully call a budget that we can even negotiate from. So they’re pretty far behind in the process. And so that gives me pause about that deadline,” Brinks said. 
Michigan House Republicans took control of the chamber in the 2024 election, winning a 58-52 majority and bringing an end to Democrats’ trifecta control of the House, Senate and governor’s seat. As a result, the Legislature has deadlocked, passing only four bills since the start of the year. 
Michigan House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) has repeatedly refused to commit to meeting the July 1 deadline, when lawmakers are legally required to pass a budget. However, the state’s fiscal year does not start until Oct. 1, with Hall telling reporters in January that the budget may not be done until Sept. 30. A failure to have a budget in place by the Oct. 1 deadline would force a state government shutdown.
As Democrats raise alarms about the potential for a shutdown, House Republicans have passed what they call a “shutdown prevention plan” which allocates $20 billion for critical programs like schools and local law enforcement if the Legislature cannot reach an agreement by the end of September.

While there is no penalty if lawmakers fail to agree on a new budget by July 1, Brinks noted in an interview with the Advance during the Mackinac Policy Conference that completing the budget on time is critical for municipalities, K-12 schools and universities. 
“They’re all making their plans right now for how they expend resources and serve their folks that they serve. I don’t want to show up at my kid’s school and find out that they didn’t know enough about the resources they have coming from the state to be able to hire enough teachers to teach the kids and have larger class sizes. That’s a completely unnecessary thing, and it’s completely avoidable,” Brinks said. 
And while Hall has slammed the Democratic-led Senate for failing to act on bipartisan road funding legislation and policies establishing a public safety and violence prevention fund to support local law enforcement and community violence intervention organizations, Brinks said those conversations need to be held in the context of the state’s budget. 
“You know something like the public safety trust fund, while there’s a policy element to it, it’s essentially a budget conversation. So get back in the room and have a budget conversation. I know our appropriations chairs have had some conversation, but there’s so much more to the process…. This is exactly the kind of thing that could be worked out in a budget process, and there will, by necessity, need to be compromise,” Brinks said. 
Similarly, allocating $3 billion towards road funding should also be subject to bipartisan discussion, Brinks said. 
“So far, there hasn’t been a lot of willingness to actually have those conversations between us from Matt Hall, and so, you know, at that point, they’re simply just ideas that have been thrown out in the ether. The real work comes in the conversation, in the negotiation, in the sitting down and hashing things out,” Brinks said.
“It’s not glamorous, right? You don’t get to start in your own press conference for two hours as a negotiation. That’s not negotiating. If he wants to do that, that’s fine. But in addition to that, he’s going to have to really find some time or empower his caucus, and there are some capable people there to sit down and really, do that work,” Brinks said. 
While the House and Senate were able to break through their deadlock earlier this month to extend the filing deadline for lawmakers’ legally-required financial disclosures amid frustrations with the rollout of the state’s new financial reporting  system, Brinks said there are several other policies they could be working on if Hall was interested. 
“We could be talking about prescription drug affordability. We could be talking about ways to ensure, you know, we have more affordable housing, we could, you know, be talking about FOIA, you know, something that passed with a really strong bipartisan vote,” Brinks said. 
In January, members of the Senate voted 33-2 to advance Senate Bills 1 and 2 to the House. The package looks to extend FOIA to include the Legislature, the governor and the lieutenant governor, which are exempt under the current state law. However, Hall has declared the package dead, calling them “a very low priority.”
While Hall has pointed to the public safety trust fund as a bipartisan slam dunk, Brinks said the same about FOIA reform.
“It could be an easy bipartisan win that really helps improve transparency and the ethical environment in our state,” she said.

The attorneys for former Ohio House Speaker Larry Householder and former Republican leader Matt Borges are feeling “hopeful” after a Cincinnati politician convicted of bribery got a pardon from President Donald Trump.
Once convicted of accepting $20,000 in bribes, former Cincinnati City Councilmember PG Sittenfeld’s slate has been wiped clean.
President Donald Trump pardoned the Democrat, who was sentenced to more than a year in prison in 2023.
And with this pardon comes interest from other influential Ohio politicos.
We asked Householder’s attorney Scott Pullins if that gives him hope for Householder.
“Yeah, I can’t comment, obviously, on what we’re doing right now, what I’m working on, our legal team’s working on,” Pullins replied. “But it certainly gives us a lot of hope.”
Thursday, Borges’s appeals attorney, Dennis Belli, said in a phone interview that the Sittenfeld pardon also gives him hope.
In March 2023, a jury found Householder and Borges guilty of felony racketeering in the largest public corruption and bribery scandal in state history.
And earlier this month, a panel of federal court judges upheld the convictions of Householder and Borges.
Clemency
We asked Gov. Mike DeWine if he believes Householder and Borges should be pardoned.
“Look, I don’t have any comment about the pardons,” he responded. “These are decisions that are made by the president of the United States. I have authority in regard to state pardons, and I always will tell you about why I made a decision.”
Pullins has been telling us for months now that the former speaker is seeking clemency, arguing the FBI was politically motivated in arresting the former speaker.
“They singled out Larry, him alone,” he said. “No one else has been charged, no other politician — period.”
Legal expert Steve Gooden, partner at Porter Wright Morris & Arthur, said this could be a sympathetic argument for a pardon.
“It obviously strikes very close to home for Donald Trump who has been the subject of these kinds of inquiries and cases in the past,” Gooden said.
In an interview in February, Attorney General Dave Yost refuted this allegation.
“He was indicted by President Trump’s United States Attorney, David DeVillers, who, I believe, is the same political party,” Yost said. “I don’t think that dog hunts.”
And Yost said he was against Householder getting out. Householder is also facing Ohio charges. He has pleaded not guilty to 10 felony counts in Cuyahoga County.
“I oppose,” Yost said in February. Asked why, he said, “Because I’ve seen the evidence and he committed multiple crimes. Even if his appeal is successful in the federal case, there is additional evidence of criminal acts that are included in the state’s indictment.”
If convicted on state charges and appeals fail, it would take an act of the governor to clear him of that.
Previously, Pullins told us in an interview that the team is hoping to leverage Householder’s close relationship with Trump to get him out.
Asked about the appearance that Householder could be using his connections in order to get out of prison, Pullins responded, “Well, yeah. He is. Hopefully, he has some friends left that can help.”
After our exclusive, in-depth interview in 2023, we’ve kept in touch with the head juror, Jerrod Haines, who convicted Householder in federal court.
He said that Householder was, once again, using power to get what he wanted.
“I definitely feel like he is using his connections to skip his sentence,” he said. “I would feel that the justice system failed if he would be pardoned. I would feel that my time as a juror was wasted, even though I think it was a very valuable experience for me, my life was interrupted for seven weeks.”
Haines told us in 2023 that he was left disillusioned with state government, hoping political leaders would finally learn not to undercut their citizens in exchange for power and money.

(Getty Images)More West Virginia students are completing the college financial aid application, known as the FAFSA, following pandemic interruptions and nationwide issues with the form over the last year. 
According to data tracked by the National College Attainment Network, the state’s Free Application for Federal Student Aid completion rate stands at 49.8%.
The state now ranks 15th in the nation for students completing the FAFSA, which is up from 19th last year, according to a news release from the West Virginia Higher Education Policy Commission.
Brian Weingart, senior director of financial aid at the commission, said the HEPC has worked side-by-side with schools, counselors and communities to make sure students had “a clever path to financial aid.” HEPC credits the success to statewide partnerships. 
“Whether it’s through hands-on FAFSA events, real-time data tools, or text message nudges, we’re meeting students where they are and helping them take that critical next step toward college. Behind every completed FAFSA is a student who’s one step closer to their future,” he said.
The federal government’s 2024 botched rollout of the new FAFSA form prompted former Gov. Jim Justice to declare a state of emergency and suspended a requirement that college-bound high school seniors fill out the FAFSA in order to receive state financial aid, including the state’s Promise Scholarship.
Unlike some other states, West Virginia didn’t have a statewide FAFSA mandate. Instead, the HEPC said it focused on strategic outreach and community engagement. 
A WV FAFSA day in February brought together more than 50 high schools and colleges. The organization also used “TXT 4 Success,” a text message program that provides personalized guidance and nudges to help students stay on track with financial aid deadlines.
“West Virginia’s success, and approach, offer a lot for other communities and states to learn from,” said Bill DeBaun, senior director at the National College Attainment Network in Washington. “Thoughtful, coordinated efforts like these that support practitioners in districts and schools make a big difference.”
West Virginia’s Chancellor of Higher Education Dr. Sarah Armstrong Tucker added, “We built momentum through strong partnerships with our schools and counselors, innovative tools and a shared commitment to our students’ futures. I am deeply proud of our team and the many school counselors, educators, and families who have rallied around this cause. Together, we’re showing what’s possible when we put students first.”

Department of Corrections)COLUMBIA — An inmate slated for execution on one of his two death sentences chose to die by lethal injection soon after the state Supreme Court declined to require more information about execution methods.
The execution of 57-year-old Stephen Stanko is set to take place at 6 p.m. June 13. His would be the sixth execution in the state since the process resumed in September, following a state Supreme Court ruling that firing squad and electrocution were constitutional.
Two of those inmates selected firing squad as the way they wished to die. Three died by lethal injection. Inmates also have the option of electrocution, which none have chosen since 2008.
  Stephen Stanko, 57, is scheduled to be executed June 13. (Provided by the SC Department of Corrections)
Attorneys for Stanko, who was sentenced to death in two separate cases for crimes committed within two days of each other, asked for more information about the state’s protocols for firing squad and lethal injection, arguing the most recent firing squad execution in April didn’t go the way prison officials planned.
The state Supreme Court turned down that request Wednesday, writing that attorneys failed to prove anything went wrong during that execution or previous ones carried out using lethal injection.
Two bullets struck Mahdi in the same spot in his chest, causing the two wounds instead of the three defense attorneys expected, prison officials and attorneys for the state have said. Those bullets then took the same route through Mahdi’s body, including striking part of his heart.
A pathologist hired by defense attorneys for both Mahdi and Stanko compared Mahdi’s autopsy report to a previous one in which inmate Brad Sigmon’s heart was completely destroyed, unlike in Mahdi’s case, where most of the damage seemed limited to other organs.
If that was the case, it doesn’t seem to be because the Department of Corrections failed to follow protocols, justices wrote in the Wednesday order. Various factors, including whether Mahdi shifted in the chair to which he was strapped, could have moved the target and caused the marksmen to not strike his heart precisely.
The justices also turned down attorneys’ arguments that the state failed to follow its own protocols during previous lethal injection executions by administering a second dose of the sedative pentobarbital after 10 minutes. That second dose is written into the state’s protocol, which is not released publicly, justices wrote.
Stanko’s crime spree started April 7, 2005, when he strangled his girlfriend, Laura Ling, to death at her home in Murrell’s Inlet while beating and raping her 15-year-old daughter, according to court documents. Stanko slit the daughter’s throat and left her for dead before stealing jewelry and credit cards and fleeing.
He went to his friend’s house in Conway. After having breakfast with his friend Henry Turner, Stanko shot the 74-year-old in the back while he shaved in the bathroom mirror, using a pillow as a silencer for his gun, according to court documents.
Stanko then hit Turner in the head and fatally shot him in the chest.
Driving Turner’s truck, Stanko went to Columbia, where he spent an evening buying people drinks at bars before traveling to Augusta, Georgia. There, Stanko convinced a woman he was a businessman in town for the Masters golf tournament and went home with her, according to court records.
Stanko stayed with the woman, including attending church with her, until April 12, when he left abruptly in the middle of the night. Soon after he left, the woman recognized his photo in the newspaper alongside a headline about Turner’s death and called the police, who captured Stanko before he left the city, according to court records.
During Stanko’s trials, defense attorneys argued to no avail that he was insane at the time of the killings, with decreased brain functioning making him unable to understand right and wrong.
A jury convicted Stanko in 2006 of killing Ling and beating and raping her daughter. A separate jury convicted him in 2009 of killing Turner. Both juries recommended death sentences, which multiple courts have affirmed.
Turner’s killing is the crime for which Stanko is set to be put to death in June.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/execution.jpg,,,2025-05-30 15:17:46.191207

Now a formal notification of its 'noncompliance' with federal immigration policy is forthcoming, says the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. (Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Exactly what court order the Trump administration is using to base its declaration that Rhode Island is defying federal immigration policy remains a mystery. But the head of the state’s chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has a theory.
The state as well as Providence and Central Falls are on a list of 500 “sanctuary jurisdictions” that may lose federal funding released Thursday night by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. The list was compiled based on factors like noncompliance with federal law enforcement, information-sharing restrictions, and giving legal protections to undocumented immigrants, the department’s website stated.
The website also states that Rhode Island made the list because of a “Court Order Requiring State Sanctuary Requirements.” Rhode Island Current reached out to Homeland Security for specific details and received a statement reiterating the designation factors on the department’s website. 
Steven Brown, executive director of the ACLU of Rhode Island, hypothesized that the federal government may be citing a 2014 federal court order that ruled police officers in Rhode Island cannot hold a person in custody based upon an U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainer alone for more than 48 hours.
“It’s a very basic Fourth Amendment law,” Brown said in an interview. “And it appears the Trump administration is upset that the Constitution prevents them from doing what they want to do.”
The Department of Homeland Security’s list was published as part of an executive order issued by President Donald Trump April 28 mandating federal officials identify and publicly highlight jurisdictions that “refuse to cooperate with federal immigration authorities.”
“These sanctuary city politicians are endangering Americans and our law enforcement in order to protect violent criminal illegal aliens,” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a statement Thursday. “We are exposing these sanctuary politicians who harbor criminal illegal aliens and defy federal law.”
The announcement from the Department of Homeland Security states each jurisdiction on the list will receive a formal notification of its “noncompliance” with federal policy and must immediately review and revise its policies to align with the Trump administration.
No notices received yet
Gov. Dan McKee’s office has not received any notification as of Friday, said spokesperson Olivia DaRocha. Officials in Central Falls and Providence said their cities have not received any notice either.
“As we have always stated, Rhode Island cooperates with ICE on the lawful detention of criminals in accordance with a binding federal court ruling,” DaRocha said in an emailed statement, referring to the 2014 court order.
Providence Mayor Brett Smiley said in a statement that he has no plans to change the city’s existing policy regarding immigration. Police officers are prohibited from asking about someone’s immigration status and from holding a subject “based exclusively” on an administrative detainer, nor are they allowed to arrest suspected undocumented individuals unless federal immigration officers provide a criminal warrant signed by a judge.
“The Providence Police are not and will not be immigration officers and are better able to keep our community safe with this policy,” Smiley said. “Providence remains committed to being a safe and welcoming city for all.”
  Central Falls Mayor Maria Rivera says her city stands by its laws and its community. (Screenshot from centralfallsri.gov/)
Central Falls in 2019 enacted its own ordinance that prohibits local police officers from questioning people about their immigration status without probable cause, bar any compliance with detainer requests made without a warrant, and ensure municipal services are available to all residents regardless of their citizenship.
Central Falls Mayor Maria Rivera in a statement said her city stands by its values and community. 
“Our ordinance is legal and makes our city safer –– building a stronger foundation for public trust in our local police department,” Rivera said. “Together with the city of Providence, we won this fight before during the first Trump Administration.”
Rivera was referring to a 2018 lawsuit against the U.S. Justice Department over requirements that recipients of a federal criminal-justice grant, known as the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant, cooperate with authorities in the enforcement of federal immigration law.
U.S. District Court Judge Judge John J. McConnell Jr. ruled in favor of the cities in 2019, which was upheld by a federal appeals court in Boston in 2020.
But the chairman of Rhode Island’s Republican Party said the state’s placement on the list was the result of “deliberate, reckless choices” by the governor and city officials.
“Let’s be clear, this isn’t compassion, it’s capitulation,” party chairman Joe Powers said in a statement. “McKee is harboring those who break federal law while turning his back on those who enforce it.” 
“President Trump is standing up to this nonsense,” he continued.
Brown, however, maintains that there’s not legitimate basis from the federal government that Rhode Island or any municipalities are violating federal law. 
“They’re not, they’re upholding the law,” he said.

House Bill 1217, signed into law this month by Gov. Bob Ferguson, restricts annual residential rent increases to 7% plus inflation, or 10%, whichever is lower.
The state Department of Commerce calculated the former option as 10.8%. Since that’s above the threshold, rent increases are capped at 10% through the end of 2025.
The maximum allowable increase for 2026 is expected to be published in July, based on inflation data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.
The highly divisive legislation went into effect immediately after Ferguson’s signature. 
Democrats hope the new cap provides greater predictability to tenants whose lives can be turned upside down by major rent increases. Progressives had initially pushed for a hard 7% limit, but raised it to win over moderate Democrats in the Legislature.
Republicans termed the bill “rent control” and argued it would chill development and price out small landlords. After the governor signed the new law, the Rental Housing Association of Washington said it was exploring a legal challenge.
Rent hikes are no longer allowed in the first year of a tenancy under the law either.
Not all rental properties are subject to the cap. 
New construction is not covered for its first 12 years. Public housing authorities, low-income developments, and duplexes, triplexes and fourplexes in which the owner lives in one of the units are also exempt.
Notices of rent increases are now required 90 days before they go into effect, up from 60 days under previous law.
Increases are capped at 5% for manufactured homes.
If a landlord raises rent above the caps without an exemption, the renter must give the landlord a chance to fix the error or can terminate their lease with 20 days’ notice. A tenant or the state attorney general can bring litigation to enforce compliance. The attorney general can recover up to $7,500 per violation.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/apartments-tacoma-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-30 15:17:46.191207

The department released the list as part of an executive order signed by President Donald Trump requiring that sanctuary jurisdictions across the country be listed. 
“Sanctuary jurisdictions including cities, counties, and states that are deliberately and shamefully obstructing the enforcement of federal immigration laws endangering American communities,” the DHS announcement states. “Sanctuary cities protect dangerous criminal aliens from facing consequences and put law enforcement in peril.” 
Dane County, Madison and Milwaukee have enacted policies that limit local law enforcement agencies’ collaboration with federal immigration authorities. Earlier this year, Dane County Sheriff Kalvin Barrett announced that the county would no longer participate in a program that provides funding in exchange for telling federal agencies when an immigrant without legal status is in custody in the local jail. Milwaukee also refuses to share such information. 
“DHS demands that these jurisdictions immediately review and revise their policies to align with Federal immigration laws and renew their obligation to protect American citizens, not dangerous illegal aliens,” DHS stated.
But Shawano County, which Trump won with 67% of its vote last year, is a Republican Party stronghold that appears out of place on the list. The DHS announcement states that “no one should act on this information without conducting their own evaluation of the information.” 
In 2021, the Shawano County board voted to declare the county a “Second Amendment sanctuary county,” which declared the county sheriff would not enforce any laws which “unconstitutionally impedes our fundamental Second Amendment right to Keep and Bear Arms.” 
The Shawano County administrator and sheriff did not respond to requests for comment.

(Getty Images)Granite Staters continue to overwhelmingly cite the scarcity of affordable housing as the most pressing concern, a new poll from the University of New Hampshire suggests.
Faced with a range of options that included taxes, education, jobs, and cost of living, 36% of respondents to the poll said housing is “the most important problem facing New Hampshire” — far and away the biggest share. The next highest category was taxes; 10% of respondents chose that as the most important issue.
But when it comes to the most likely legislative approach to address the housing shortfall this year, residents are more divided.
The poll, released Thursday, asked respondents whether they support legislation that would require cities and towns to relax their zoning policies to make it easier to build a home. Thirty-eight percent supported that legislation — 15% strongly — but 40% opposed it. Of those that were against it, 18% were strongly opposed.
The response comes as the Republican-led Legislature has passed a pair of bills that would bar municipalities from making certain zoning restrictions; both bills are making their way to Gov. Kelly Ayotte’s desk.
House Bill 631 would require municipalities to allow multi-family developments in commercial zones, such as shopping areas. And House Bill 577 would allow homeowners to build a detached accessory dwelling unit by right and expand the size limitations to do so.
The issue of housing scarcity dominated both Democratic and Republican campaign platforms in 2024, and lawmakers in both parties have found common ground in legislation that would forcibly remove local zoning barriers to housing. 
Some groups, such as the New Hampshire Municipal Association, are opposed to those bills, arguing that cities and towns should be able to craft their own zoning codes and should react to the housing shortage with approaches supported by their residents. 
Republican lawmakers have shown less support this year for devoting state resources to encourage more development; the House-passed budget would eliminate the Housing Champion Program, a 2023 effort to give special grants and state support to towns that voluntarily changed their zoning codes to be more friendly to housing. House and Senate lawmakers have also blocked efforts to increase the amount of money going to the state’s affordable housing fund, which is currently allocated $5 million of state tax revenues per year. 
The May 29 UNH poll was released three months after a poll conducted by YouGov on behalf of Housing Action New Hampshire, a housing advocacy group, appeared to show more support for zoning changes. 
In that poll, conducted March 3 to 10, more than 75% of respondents supported policies to “allow more homes near business and shopping districts,” allow “flexibility for paved parking areas,” “allow homes on slightly smaller lots,” and “make it easier to build accessory dwelling units.” The Housing Action poll also found that 54% of respondents said building more homes is more important for New Hampshire than protecting the character of neighborhoods from change, compared to 35% who said the opposite and 11% who were not sure. 
The Housing Action poll worded its questions differently than the UNH poll; the former poll asked about legislation that would “allow” homeowners to build certain structures, while the latter poll asked about legislation that would “require” cities and towns to change their zoning codes to achieve that.

,Mississippi Today,2025-05-30 18:57:50+00:00,Mississippi Today,Lexington residents urge court to scrutinize police abuse claims,Mina Corpuz,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/05/30/lexington-residents-urge-court-to-scrutinize-police-abuse-claims/,Lexington residents ask federal appeals court to hear oral arguments on police abuse claims.,"Lexington community members joined attorneys and the National Police Accountability Project to urge a federal appeals court to consider evidence in a civil rights lawsuit against the police department alleging a pattern of violent, racist and unconstitutional policing practices. 
A Wednesday filing asks the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals to hold oral arguments to consider evidence presented at a 2022 hearing and legal arguments that the U.S. District Court overlooked the evidence in dismissing the plaintiffs’ claims. 
Attorneys for the Black Lexington residents who claim they have been stopped at checkpoints, falsely arrested and retaliated against by members of the police department say the plaintiffs had proper standing, their claims were proper and some claims were dismissed without properly analyzing evidence. 
“For those reasons, Malcolm Stewart, Darious Harris, and Robert Harris respectfully request that the judgment of the district court be reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings,” the May 28 appellant’s brief states. 
The original lawsuit, filed in August 2022 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Missisisppi, documented conduct by the former white police chief, Sam Dobbins, who was fired in 2022 after bragging on a recording about killing 13 people while working as a law enforcement officer and using racial and homophobic slurs. 
That complaint also shows the conduct of his successor, Chief Charles Henderson, who is Black and has overseen a department that allegedly is violent against residents and has used roadblocks to exclusively target Black neighborhoods. 
Lexington, located in one of the state’s poorest counties, has a population of less than 2,000 people and is 86% Black. The city’s mayor is white and its aldermen are Black. 
The original lawsuit plaintiffs are brothers Robert and Darius Harris, Malcolm Stewart, Eric Redmond and Peter Reeves. Dobbins, Henderson, the police department and the city were named as defendants in the lawsuit. Later, four police officers were added as defendants. 
“This case is about more than a few rogue officers — it’s about a police department functioning as a tool of racial control and abuse,” Lauren Bonds, executive director of the National Police Accountability Project, said in a statement.
Attorneys from the organization, along with attorney Jill Collen Jefferson of JULIAN and others are representing the appellants.
Bonds said the violations have persisted and escalated, which underscores why the organization’s clients are continuing with the case and why it remains critical.  
In 2022, plaintiffs sought a temporary restraining order against the Lexington Police Department to prevent them from violating Black residents’ civil rights and prevent violence against them, but a federal judge denied it.
Over the next two years the district court dismissed a majority of the plaintiffs claims, and two plaintiffs remained with claims against the officers, Dobbins and Henderson. 
In January, U.S. District Judge Tom Lee approved an agreed judgment between plaintiff Redmond and the defendants and dismissed all claims brought by the remaining plaintiffs. This is the decision being appealed with the 5th Circuit Court. 
Since 2022, there have been other federal lawsuits brought by Lexington residents against Dobbins, Henderson, the city and the police department. Most of those remain active in the district court or the 5th Circuit. 
In a Wednesday statement, the National Police Accountability Project said the Lexington lawsuit by the five men is an example of an urgent need for local and federal action to stop law enforcement abuse in the South and across the country. 
Last week, the Trump administration rolled back federal oversight of police departments by ending consent decrees and halting investigations. 
The Justice Department under the Biden administration opened a civil rights investigation into the Lexington police, but it did not result in a consent decree. 
The New Orleans Police Department had a consent decree that lasted from 2011 to 2024.
Bonds said the Trump administration’s move is a “deliberate slap in the face to the memory of George Floyd” close to the 5-year anniversary of his death at the hands of Minneapolis police officers. 
She also said the move is an attempt to disempower Black communities, shut down paths to accountability and silence resistance. 
“But let us be clear: We are not backing down. We are doubling down,” Bonds said.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/06150937/AP_22228581950173-scaled.jpg,,,2025-05-30 15:17:46.191207

(Photo by Aristide Economopoulos/NJ Monitor)Maine lawmakers will wait to take action on proposed legislation regarding the state’s 72-hour waiting period for firearm purchases.
The Legislature’s Judiciary Committee unanimously voted to carry over LD 208, a proposal from House Minority Leader Billy Bob Faulkingham (R-Winter Harbor) to repeal the law passed just last year that requires someone who sells a firearm to wait three days before delivering it to the buyer. 
However, the committee was divided on whether to carry over an identical bill, LD 1230, with Democrats voting in support and Republicans opposed. The votes taken Friday were not an absolute, but rather a request of the presiding officers who have the final say on what will be carried over.
After the waiting period took effect in August, opponents filed a lawsuit in November claiming it violates the Second Amendment rights of people who have passed background checks. 
Earlier this year, a U.S. District Court judge sided with the gun rights advocates and temporarily paused the waiting period. Maine Attorney General Aaron Frey appealed the decision, but a federal appeals court last week refused to reinstate the waiting period while the lawsuit unfolds. 
Over the past few weeks, Senate co-chair Anne Carney (D-Cumberland) encouraged the committee to carry over Faulkingham’s bill and kill the other proposal to streamline the committee’s work and allow time for the legal process to play out before making any changes. 
However, multiple Republicans on the committee said they did not want their names on the record as voting against the bill. 
“I’m not going to have my name on that report and follow me forever,” said Rep. Jennifer Poirier (R-Skowhegan), though she agreed it’s important to carry over one of the bills in case changes need to be made.
Stuck at a stalemate, Carney suggested Friday that the committee vote to carry over both bills, but Republicans also raised concerns with this approach. 
Committees are only allowed to carry over a limited number of bills from the first to second session, so some Republicans were concerned carrying over identical proposals would waste one of those slots and lead to Senate president and speaker of the House of Representatives killing one of the bills. 
“Why can’t we have a conversation on the floor?” asked Rep. Rachel Henderson (R-Rumford), encouraging the committee to advance LD 1230 this session 
Rep. Adam Lee (D-Auburn), who voted to carry over both proposals, said his understanding was that the committee decided to not work on either bill while the lawsuit is ongoing. Since the committee hasn’t fully workshopped the bills, Lee said sending one to the chamber floors wouldn’t make sense.

(Quentin Young/Colorado Newsline) Colorado Democratic lawmakers criticized Gov. Jared Polis after he vetoed a bill on Thursday afternoon that would have banned the use of computer algorithms to set rent in the state, calling the decision a failure of the state’s values.
“Gov. Polis had the opportunity to save Coloradans money, but he instead aligned himself with tech companies that are engaged in practices so questionable that they’re currently facing litigation from the federal government,” Sen. Julie Gonzales, a Denver Democrat and bill sponsor, said during a virtual press conference on Friday morning.
House Bill 25-1004 was written as a consumer protection bill to ban software that uses private market data to suggest profit-maximizing rents to landlords.
The Biden administration released a report last year that found software from companies like RealPage cost Denver renters an extra $136 per month, one of the highest monthly cost increases in the country, and is used in over 45% of multifamily rental units in the city.
Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser last year also targeted the practice when he joined an antitrust lawsuit against RealPage.
In his veto letter, Polis wrote that he prefers to allow “current state and federal investigations to run their course — including those Colorado is a party to.”
He wrote that he agrees with the intent of the bill, and that collusion to artificially constrain rental supply is already illegal, but he worried about its effect on the state’s housing market.
“We should not inadvertently take a tool off the table that could identify vacancies and provide consumers with meaningful data to help efficiently manage residential real estate to ensure people can access housing,” he wrote. “If signed today, this bill may have unintended consequences of creating a hostile environment for providers of rental housing and could result in further diminished supply of rental housing based on inadequate data.”
A RealPage spokesperson lauded Polis’ veto.
“This is the right outcome for all of us who desire a healthy housing ecosystem that benefits Colorado renters and housing providers alike,” Jennifer Bowcock of RealPage said in a statement.
The bill was sponsored by Gonzales, Sen. Nick Hinrichsen of Pueblo, Rep. Steven Woodrow of Denver and Rep. Javier Mabrey of Denver, all Democrats. A similar bill died last year, but this year’s version passed on party-line votes in both legislative chambers.
“During my time at the Legislature, we’ve been tasked by the governor to save people money,” Woodrow said. “During special sessions, we’ve been called down to cut property taxes to save homeowners an average of $80. Why we couldn’t find the means to save renters 200 times that with a stroke of a pen is simply beyond unfortunate. The governor has punted this to the courts.”
Groups that supported the bill included the Community Economic Defense Project, The Bell Policy Center, the Colorado Fiscal Institute and United for a New Economy. Supporters hoped the Biden White House report and pending litigation would help usher it into law this year.
“Unfortunately, the veto sends this devastating message that corporate landlords can keep using secret price-fixing algorithms to take extra rent from the people who have the least,” CEDP co-founder Sam Gilman said.
The veto is Polis’ 11th this year. He has until June 6 to sign or veto bills passed during this year’s legislative session, which concluded earlier this month.

(Photo by Janelle Stecklein/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – The legislative session, which ended Friday, was a mixed bag for Gov. Kevin Stitt.
He got his income tax cut, business courts and ban on cellphones in schools, prompting him to say Wednesday it was probably the best session in his seven years in office.
“Look. The governor should be very happy,” House Speaker Kyle Hilbert, R-Bristow, said early Friday. “He got everything he wanted this session.”
But then came Thursday, effectively the final day of the legislative session. 
Lawmakers removed his embattled mental health commissioner and spent hours overriding dozens of his vetoes, including House Bill 1389, which expands insurance coverage for diagnostic mammograms.
Stitt panned both the veto overrides and Friesen’s firing.
State Superintendent Ryan Walters didn’t fare well, watching lawmakers and Stitt halt his efforts to require citizenship status checks for students and the completion of the  naturalization test for teachers. They also balked at his $3 million request to purchase Bibles for public school classrooms.
But lawmakers stopped short of putting the kibosh on his controversial social studies standards, dictating what must be taught in school, and which have already drawn a court challenge. 
The standards include language requiring students be taught about unfounded 2020 election “discrepancies,” the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic and Bible stories.
Democrats said they were largely left out of the budget process.
While Stitt championed it, Senate Minority Leader Julia Kirt, D-Oklahoma City, said the .25% income tax reduction was the worst bill of the session. It cuts the top bracket from 4.75% to 4.5% and contains a pathway toward eliminating the tax entirely.
“It is going to undermine our options as a state,” Kirt said.
Stitt let the general appropriations bill, outlining the state’s nearly $12.6 billion budget, take effect without his signature.
The budget gives most agencies a flat budget, but provides $250 million for the Oklahoma State University veterinary school and $200 million for a University of Oklahoma pediatric heart hospital.
Perhaps one of the most controversial measures passed and signed into law was a bill putting more restrictions on the process voters use to get things on the ballot.
Senate Bill 1027, which among other things implements restrictions on the number of people who can sign initiative petitions, is expected to draw a legal challenge.
Sports betting failed to get across the finish line for yet another year.
A bill that would have barred synthetic dyes and over a dozen other ingredients from food got left on the cutting room floor, as did a measure requiring a Ten Commandments display at the Capitol.
A bill that would add items to Oklahoma’s back-to-school sales tax holiday didn’t muster the support needed for passage nor did a measure that would have made Nov. 5 President Donald J. Trump Day in Oklahoma.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Gov. Kim Reynolds has just two weeks to either sign or veto a controversial bill that would impact carbon dioxide pipelines in Iowa. 
On a Friday press call, landowners urged Reynolds to uphold Iowa and GOP values around property rights by signing the bill into law. 
House File 639 advanced from the Senate May 13, following four years of effort from a group of landowners and House lawmakers. The bill would do a number of things including require carbon sequestration projects prove they are a common carrier, in order to use eminent domain. 
The legislation, and landowner support, comes largely in response to a proposed carbon sequestration pipeline project, the Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline, that would connect to nearly 60 ethanol plants and pipe the sequestered carbon dioxide through Iowa and surrounding states to underground storage in North Dakota.

Those opposed to the project say a private company should not be given the right to condemn agricultural land. South Dakotans recently codified that opinion with a law that specifically bans CO2 pipelines from the right of eminent domain, which has caused Summit to reevaluate its path through the state. 
Marty Maher, an affected landowner from Montgomery County, urged Reynolds to uphold the Iowa Republican platform, which opposes the use of eminent domain by the use of a private party or for-profit entity. 
“Do party platforms mean anything to the elected Republican officials, or are platforms just feel-good projects for the party faithful?” Maher asked. 
Maher said the bill “levels the playing field” between landowners, neighbors and the utilities commission.
“I am sure that you want to be remembered as the governor that supported common sense property rights in Iowa and leveled the playing field for all residents in the state for many years to come,” Maher said, addressing his comments to the governor. 
Mary Powell, a Shelby County landowner, shared a similar sentiment and recalled times the governor quoted Iowa’s motto, “Our liberties we prize, and our rights we will maintain.” 
“Like many Iowans, I appreciate Gov. Reynolds stating the Iowa motto is a belief and not empty words, but Iowans need action,” Powell said. “We need Gov. Reynolds to sign 639 into law.” 
Reynolds said last week on Iowa Press she was meeting with stakeholders on both sides to determine her stance on the bill.
Another Shelby County landowner, Cindy Hansen, said on the Friday call that she and other landowners met with the governor and her advisory team Thursday evening to share their point of view. 
Hansen said the governor did not ask any questions or give an indication as to how she would act, but did listen to the landowners’ perspective.
The bill would also increase the insurance requirements for CO2 pipeline operators to cover any accidental or intentional discharges and any insurance rate increases landowners face because of the pipeline. The bill additionally requires Iowa Utilities Commissioners to be present at all hearings and expands the scope of who may intervene in IUC proceedings.
Meghan Sloma, said on Friday’s call that as a neighbor to the pipeline, she was not allowed to testify in the IUC hearings because it didn’t go through her property, even though she would be “very much affected” by the pipeline. 
“I think that’s very important, that the right that I have for my voice to be heard regarding what happens to my land, that it be protected,” Sloma said. “To me, it is just basic fairness and equality.” 
Sloma said while the pipeline project brought up the need for this legislation, the bill is not “anti pipeline” or “anti progress.” 
Opponents of the bill include farming organizations like Iowa Corn Growers Association and the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association, who argue the legislation would stop Iowa from entering the ultra-low carbon ethanol market. 
This loss of market, they argue, would in turn hurt Iowa farmers and the state’s economy. IRFA also argued in a press conference last week, that the bill has a slew of “unintended negative consequences.”

Ingham County Judge Molly Hennessey Greenwalt heard arguments from the defense for Lee and Stephanie Chatfield and the Michigan Attorney General’s Office in February, determining this week that there was probable cause for the charges and the case should proceed to trial.
The Michigan Attorney General’s Office contends that through investigatory efforts by authorities beginning in 2021, it was discovered that the Chatfields had for years used nonprofit money to reimburse themselves for purchases at souvenir shops at Universal Studios during a family trip, transactions at retail stores like Coach and expenses at a strip club, amongst other expenditures.
The Chatfields’ attorney Mary Chartier has asserted that the charges brought against the former House Speaker, a prominent Republican in Michigan who raised millions of dollars while he was Speaker, are rooted in the political agenda for Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, a Democrat.

The investigation into Lee Chatfield began back in December 2021, when his sister-in-law, Rebekah Chatfield, reported to police in Lansing that he had sexually assaulted her for years, starting  when she was 14 or 15 years old. Michigan State Police opened an investigation into the report, also looking into financial behavior, which was later taken over by Nessel’s office which did not find sufficient evidence to pursue charges for criminal sexual conduct.
Lee Chatfield faces 13 felony counts of crimes related to conducting a criminal enterprise, conspiracy and embezzlement, while his wife faces two felony counts.
Nessel released a news statement Friday expressing gratitude that the efforts of her office led to the case moving forward to trial after a long investigation period and legal process.
“Our investigation uncovered extensive evidence of elaborate schemes to embezzle and misappropriate private and public funds to bankroll Lee Chatfield’s lifestyle during his time as Speaker of the House,” Nessel said in the statement. “My office will continue to pursue public corruption with every tool at our disposal and push for stronger transparency and good governance in our state.”

According to the board, Dr. Joshwa Tromblee “exchanged inappropriate messages” with a female patient he first saw at MercyOne’s Centerville Medical Center on Sept. 24, 2021. Tromblee was a family-medicine physician at that time.
Tromblee saw the patient again on Aug. 8, 2022, and April 3, 2023. The patient subsequently sent Tromblee a Facebook friend request, after which the two exchanged messages on Facebook and Snapchat. The exchanges included “sexually inappropriate messages and sexually explicit pictures,” the board alleges.
Tromblee also sent the patient money on one occasion, according to the board. At some point, MercyOne reviewed Tromblee’s social media exchanges with the patient and determined he had violated the standard of conduct and crossed a line by engaging in an inappropriate patient-physician relationship. He was placed on paid administrative leave on April 12, 2023, and was fired nine days later, according to the board.
Twenty-three months later – one week after Tromblee’s license expired — the Board of Medicine charged Tromblee with sexual misconduct and, at the same time, agreed to a settlement to resolve the case.
The settlement entails an indefinite suspension of Tromblee’s license. He is required to schedule a multidisciplinary fitness-for-duty assessment within 30 days, and to comply with any and all recommendations stemming from the evaluation.
He also is required to complete a course on professional ethics. Once reinstated, his license will be placed on probation for three years.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/BOARD-OF-MEDICINE.jpg,,,2025-05-30 15:17:46.191207

(Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)It was a marathon week of voting. Debates were had, gavels were broken, and senators took a break from policy to discuss what sort of vehicle they would be if given the choice (Sen. Craig Hickman, a train; Sen. Mark Lawrence, a submarine; Sen. Joe Baldacci, a “big red firetruck,” etc.) 
In many cases, the Maine Senate and House of Representatives split over whether to support legislation. Often this would kick off a series of votes and if neither backed down from their position (“recede and concur”) the bill would ultimately die.
Here’s a look at what passed, what didn’t, and what’s still in limbo.
Bills that passed:
Following the Senate last week, the House voted 108-33 to back LD 1219, which provides the University of Maine System a 6% funding increase for the next two fiscal years. 
House and Senate members voted in favor of a bill (LD 60) that would allow employees to request a flexible work schedule. Rep. Gary Drinkwater (R-Milford), who voted against the measure, said it could be devastating for farmers and isn’t necessary since current law doesn’t prohibit someone from making such a request but Rep. Amy Roeder (D-Bangor) said there are many situations where an employer can deny a request but the bill is mostly about ensuring employees aren’t retaliated against for asking.
The chambers also passed a bill (LD 61) regulating employer surveillance of employees.
The House and Senate voted in favor of legislation (LD 1462) that prevents municipalities from adopting ordinances that prohibit vendors of expressive material, like books, writings, visual art, though it allows for the adoption of restrictions on time, place and manner of vending.
Both chambers backed LD 1017, which would reimburse shelters for the cost of providing food served at emergency shelters. The system currently reimburses shelters for the cost of issuing food vouchers but not providing meals themselves. (Read more about the issue here).
The House voted 78-62 to back an amended proposal (LD 784) to establish a “rebuttal presumption” — a legal assumption — in the event that a health insurance company denies coverage for specialized risk screening for a first responder whose provider has determined the screening is medically appropriate. An earlier version of the bill required health coverage of the screening, which would have carried a fiscal note. The Senate placed the measure on the appropriations table.
Both chambers unanimously backed a provision (LD 1234) that requires school boards to adopt a policy related to use of personal electronic devices during the school day.
Lawmakers backed legislation (LD 946) that would require the Efficiency Maine Trust to ensure that at least half of all available funding for electric vehicle rebates and incentives for weatherization and heat pumps is distributed to low-and moderate-income residents.
LD 1420, which would establish the Commission to Ensure a Just and Equitable Energy Transition for Maine’s Workforce, passed both the House and Senate.
Both chambers ultimately passed a bill (LD 301) that would allow the Public Utilities Commission to establish performance-based metrics and rate-adjustment mechanisms for a public utility. The Senate voted to pass an amended version of the bill after it was first rejected by the House last week. (Read about a similar proposal last session).
Another bill that had split the chambers but now passed is LD 1159, An Act to Prohibit Governmental Entities That Charge a Fee for In-person Credit Card Purchases from Refusing to Accept Cash.
Both chambers voted under the hammer to back legislation (LD 1425) to provide additional funding for two years to the Maine Resiliency Center in Lewiston to support the continuation and expansion of services for residents of the State affected by trauma.
Lawmakers also unanimously approved a bill (LD 1445) that would authorize an accredited financial institution to report suspected financial exploitation of a senior to the Office of the Attorney General. 
Rejected legislation:
House members voted 75-66 and senators voted 19-15 to reject a resolution (LD 1437) proposing an amendment to the state constitution to specify that only U.S. citizens can vote in state or local elections. While supporters pointed to a past effort in Portland to expand the vote in municipal elections to all residents regardless of citizenship, Rep. Laura Supica (D-Bangor) reiterated to her colleagues that “only citizens can vote in Maine elections. That is not disputed, that is not unclear, that is not ambiguous.” She added, “Let us not spend our time chasing ghosts or entertaining conspiracy theories that seek to erode public trust in our democratic institutions.”
Lawmakers also rejected a bill (LD 1329) that would include U.S. citizenship status on driver’s licenses and nondrive ID cards. Debate over the measure turned into a back and forth over whether noncitizens are voting in Maine elections, something Supica said is a myth. 
A majority of both chambers rejected a Republican proposal (LD 1331) to amend the state constitution so that if the Legislature adjourns “sine die,” or finally, the governor can’t reconvene the body for 90 days. (Read more about the bill here).
Both the House and Senate​​ rejected LD 160, which would eliminate REAL ID requirements in Maine. (Read more about the issue here).
Lawmakers voted against a bill (LD 112) to allow employers to pay high school students 50% of the state’s minimum wage for up to two years or until they graduate, which critics said would create a subclass of workers. (Read more about the proposal here).
Both chambers also opted against a bill (LD 853) that would divide the state’s counties into three regions and replace the statewide minimum hourly wage with a wage based on the cost of living in those regions. (Read more about the proposal here).
Following passage in both chambers, less than two-thirds of the House voted to enact LD 197, an emergency resolve directing the Governor’s Energy Office to Conduct a study regarding the future of electric transmission infrastructure in the state.
Both the House and Senates voted against legislation (LD 1288) that would amend certain provisions of Maine’s drug laws to expand the definition and possession amounts for what constitutes trafficking of heroin, fentanyl and cocaine.
After bouncing between chambers for weeks, a provision (LD 771) to amend the Maine Criminal Code to define “amphetamine” and “methamphetamine” to mean any compound, mixture or preparation containing any quantity of those substances failed after chambers failed to agree on the matter, with the Senate opposed and the House in support of the bill. Supporters said the change addressed a gap in drug laws but Sen. Chip Curry (D-Waldo) argued the bill would lower the standard for what it means to be a trafficker because it’s common for people to cut drugs with other substances. 
The majority of lawmakers voted against a measure (LD 1024) that would expand the list of crimes that do not qualify for immunity under Maine’s Good Samaritan law, which concerns drug-related medical assistance. Sen. Rachel Talbot Ross (D-Cumberland) said the bill would weaken provisions passed in 2022 and inject confusion, hesitation and fear. Every overdose is a tragedy, she said, but the decline from 2022 to 2024 offers hope. 
Another bill that died after the chambers failed to agree is LD 16, which would have established separate prosecutorial districts in Downeast Maine. 
Legislation (LD 639) that would remove the Maine Criminal Justice Academy’s law enforcement training program’s residential requirement ultimately died after the chambers split with the Senate in support and House opposed to the bill. 
Lawmakers voted with the committee recommendation to reject a proposal (LD 724) to recognize the two main festivals in Islam, Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha, as state holidays.
LD 53, which would have established the November General Election Day as a school holiday for school buildings used as voting places, also failed after the chambers were unable to agree on the measure. 
House and Senate lawmakers voted to kill a bill (LD 775) to require voter approval of legislative and gubernatorial pay increases.
Lawmakers voted under the hammer to reject a bill (LD 1214), which would designate the Second Congressional District “Acadia.”
House lawmakers voted 76-65 and the Senate 20-15 to reject a bill (LD 1395) that would require that digital resources offered by schools must prevent a user from accessing obscene material. Though sponsor Rep. Reagan Paul (R-Winterport) said the bill would protect children from obscene content and the growing threat of human trafficking, Rep. Kelly Noonan Murphy (D-Scarborough) said that after hearing testimony from school information specialists and others, that this is already happening, filters are in place, and “school employees, staff, and administrators are looking out for kids when they are online.”
Both chambers rejected legislation (LD 885) that would allow those with a concealed carry permit to possess or discharge a firearm on school property. During debate, proponents noted this would only apply to those who completed the background check and adequate training. However, Rep. Kelly Noonan Murphy (D-Scarborough) said that if the bill passed and there was a situation on a school campus, there could be confusion about who should respond. 
The majority of the House and Senate voted against a bill (LD 1586) that would require the dollar amount of a school budget to be included on a budget validation referendum.
Both chambers rejected an effort (LD 1536) to roll back changes made to the state bail code in 2021.
Lawmakers voted in favor of the committee recommendation against LD 855, which would limit eligibility under the Maine Clean Election Act. Bill sponsor Rep. Davis Boyer (R-Poland) argued that the program should be available to candidates who need it most, not millionaires. 
With a 85-57 vote in the House and 21-13 vote in the Senate, lawmakers rejected legislation (LD 671) that would abolish the Maine income tax and establish a zero-based budget. 
A bill (LD 309) that would allow a political party to determine how its nominee is selected in a primary failed. Sponsor Rep. David Boyer (R-Poland) explained this would allow members of a party to decide if they want to use ranked-choice voting, a plurality, or “cornhole” to elect its nominee. 
Both the House and Senate overrode the majority of the committee by voting against a measure (LD 551) that would reign in some of the emergency powers of the executive branch. (Read about a similar bill here, which also died).
The Legislature voted against a bill (LD 1405) that would eliminate some of the authority granted to the Public Utilities Commission concerning participant funding.
Both chambers also rejected a bill (LD 732) that would prohibit the use of copyright protection for any work of the state except for merchandise sold by a department or agency.
Two bills that sought to restart a conversation around universal health care in Maine (LD 1269 and LD 1883) were unanimously opposed by the financial services committee and killed under the hammer in the chambers. (Read more about the bills here)
Limbo:
Legislation (LD 1022) to increase funding for the civil legal services fund, which supports the provision of free legal services to low-income defendants, passed both chambers but during the House enactment vote did not garner two-thirds support needed for the emergency bill to take effect. It has been placed on the appropriations table.
LD 525 is in limbo after the Senate split (17-17) and then tabled the measure, after the House narrowly rejected the proposal, which would clarify that someone has the right to discharge a firearm within 500 feet of school property if acting in self defense of their property.
The chambers are also split over a bill (LD 1063), with the Senate opposed and House in support, that would require the Public Utilities Commission to direct utilities to enter into contracts with generators fueled by municipal solid waste. Rep. Steven Foster (R-Dexter) said the state is in a conundrum because folks don’t like burning trash to produce energy, but that trash is being landfilled, which people don’t like either. Critics argued the bill is poorly written and shifts the cost of these facilities from taxpayers to ratepayers. 
The chambers are at odds over a provision (LD 218) that would make student transfer agreements renew automatically, except in certain circumstances related to attendance or behavior, with the Senate in support and the House opposed.
These emergency bills have been enacted by more than two-thirds of both chambers and will take effect immediately upon the governor’s signature:

LD 23 – An Act to Extend the Period of Time a Dentist May Operate the Practice of a Deceased or Incapacitated Dentist 
LD 228 -An Act to Allow Coastal Seawalls to Be Raised by up to 2 Feet in Order to Accommodate Predicted Sea Level Rise
LD 860 – An Act to Allow the Public Advocate to Obtain Information from Public Utilities, Competitive Electricity Providers and Standard-offer Service Providers
LD 1128 – An Act to Modernize the Formulary for Naturopathic Doctors
LD 1306 – An Act to Continue the Exemption for Polystyrene Foam Disposable Food Service Containers Prepackaged at Wholesale
LD 1581 – An Act Regarding the Motor Vehicle Excise Tax and Registration Fees Exemption for Certain Veterans
LD 1836 – An Act to Implement the Recommendations of the Sex Offender Management and Risk Assessment Advisory Commission Regarding Tier II Offenses
LD 1198 – Resolve, Directing the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry to Assess Its Current Meat and Poultry Inspection Programs
LD 1243 – An Act Regarding the Licensing of Assisted Living Facilities 

*See below for a more complete list of bills that passed the Legislature this week.
Senate action
After initially bucking the committee recommendation and supporting legislation (LD 115) to assess impact fees on megayachts over 150 feet long, the Senate reconsidered the measure and ultimately voted 16-19 against passage. During debate, bill sponsor Sen. Rick Bennett (R-Oxford) said he didn’t think of the proposal as a tax but rather “a user fee that is being assessed for the potential damage that these mega yachts have inflicted upon our coastlines.”
After initially rejecting LD 893, senators voted to reconsider the bill and backed it. The proposal would exempt statewide nonprofit agricultural membership organizations that provide health care benefits and that meet certain requirements from the definition of “health insurance” under the Maine Insurance Code. According to proponents, this would provide a more affordable health care option for farmers.
Senators voted to pass LD 3, which would require Maine to adopt eastern daylight time year-round if approved by the federal government and also adopted by other states in the eastern time zone. Another bill (LD 4) that would outright establish year-round eastern daylight time for the state was tabled by the chamber.
Senators voted 10-25 to reject the committee recommendation against LD 681, and instead passed the proposal to gradually increase the percentage of the state appropriation for Maine Maritime Academy until it reaches relative parity with the University of Maine and the Maine Community College systems. Bill sponsor Sen. Nicole Grohowski (D-Hancock) said that although the state only provides 23% of funding for the school, it is “the highest return on investment for low income students among all public four year institutions.”
House action
Despite passionate debate, the House narrowly rejected (70-66 vote) legislation (LD 331) directing the Department of Health and Human Services to amend its rules to require the department to reimburse hospitals at least 75% of filed MaineCare costs within 90 days of receipt. Numerous lawmakers talked about rural hospital closures and proponents of the measure emphasized that the bill is about ensuring the state reimburses hospitals on time. 
Rep. Michele Meyer (D-Eliot) said the bill, which relies on existing resources, isn’t feasible and if lawmakers want to ensure hospitals get paid, they should have supported the failed supplemental budget proposal that would have made MaineCare funding immediately available for Medicaid providers like hospitals. The bill was then tabled in the Senate.
House lawmakers bucked the committee recommendation and voted against legislation (LD 339) that would pilot a Wabanaki-centered curriculum for Wabanaki children attending public schools. (Read more about the proposal here). 
A bill (LD 818) that would let a candidate use Clean Election Act funding to pay for the care of their dependents narrowly passed the House, with a 67-66 vote. It was tabled in the Senate.
The House narrowly rejected a bill (LD 1255) that would have limited free community college to students who meet the voting residency requirements and that resided in Maine for at least one year prior to enrollment. While proponents expressed concern Maine taxpayers were paying for out-of-staters to go to college for free, critics highlighted that the Maine Community College System has said it’s important to bring workers to the state.
House lawmakers voted 77-68 to reject legislation (LD 1881) that would mandate that parents are entitled to access all information regarding the school activities of their child, including reviewing available school services, teaching and instructional materials, and the child’s health care and education records, with the ability to refuse the child’s participation in any assignment or activity.
House lawmakers voted 93-51 in favor of a constitutional amendment (LD 820) to establish the right to hunt and fish. For it to pass, the bill will need the support of two-thirds of the Legislature. (More on this proposal here).

(Photo by Kathie Obradovich/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Memorial Day 2025 kicked off what the Iowa State Patrol calls the “100 deadliest days of summer,” a period of time marked by an increase in teen driver crashes and fatalities. 
This time of year, from Memorial Day to Labor Day, is when many younger drivers are hitting the roads for the first time and others may be indulging in the holiday season.  Law enforcement agencies, including the Iowa State Patrol, increased their presence on the roadways over the holiday weekend and noticed a continued pattern of decreasing fatal crashes over the past three years.
“Our focus is to make the roadways a safe and enjoyable experience,” said Sgt. Alex Dinkla, public information officer for Iowa State Patrol. “This is one of those periods where that extra enforcement, we know, did pay off.” 
The state patrol arrested 21 individuals for operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated and covered over 47 crashes across the state. The Iowa Department of Transportation reported two fatal accidents in the days leading up to Memorial Day. 










Buckle that seatbelt, put the phone down and always remember, if you’re gonna go out and have some alcohol, to get that sober driver.


– Sgt. Alex Dinkla, public information officer for Iowa State Patrol


Many of the crashes occurred at intersections around the state. Dinkla noted that drivers often forget the blind spot on both sides of their car, between their windshield and door window. These blind spots can obscure entire vehicles from the driver’s view. Dinkla recommends drivers check two or three times before crossing an intersection to ensure they spot any threats.
In 2023, the DOT reported four fatal crashes in the days before the holiday, one of which was attributed to alcohol. In 2024, there were three fatal crashes. This year, the number dropped to two. Dinkla said that while the patrol doesn’t “want to call that a success because that’s still two fatalities,” it’s evident the extra presence and effort to educate the public is making a difference.
Going forward, Dinkla said, the ISP plans to utilize their Air Wing Unit, a unit of five pilots and aircrafts primarily used for traffic enforcement, more during other holidays and times of peak travel. Founded in 1956, the unit currently consists of three Cessna 182 aircraft, one Cessna 206 and one SR-22 CIRUSS. Two of the aircraft have thermal imaging equipment to aid in missing-person cases, fugitive location and specialized surveillance. 
“None of us know when we may or may not be involved in a fatal crash,” he said. “Buckle that seatbelt, put the phone down and always remember, if you’re gonna go out and have some alcohol, to get that sober driver.”",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/state-patrol-car-2.jpg,,,2025-05-30 15:17:46.191207

Gorman Foundation.(Photo by Getty Images)As the state continues to grapple with its record of not providing adequate behavioral health support for young people, a proposal to make funds available for schools to hire licensed behavioral and mental health experts has received initial backing from the Maine Legislature.
The Maine House of Representatives passed LD 858 on Wednesday with 79 members voting in favor and 68 opposed. The Senate passed it without a roll call vote. The bill, sponsored by Rep. Lori Gramlich (D-Old Orchard Beach), will go back to both chambers for final enactment votes.
The bill establishes a program within the Maine Department of Education to provide grants to districts that contract licensed professionals for behavioral and mental health services. The funds can only be used to cover those not otherwise covered or reimbursable through MaineCare, the state’s Medicaid program. 
Proponents of the bill — including educators, administrators and medical professionals — say the grant program is much needed as Maine educators are not adequately trained to manage worsening student behavior issues, according to a 2025 Maine Education Policy Research Institute report. 
Critics of the proposal said it infringes on a parent’s rights when their child seeks counseling at school, and raised concern about the limited information about what kind of services would be covered under the grants. 
Gramlich said one in six Maine children have been diagnosed with anxiety, and 7% are struggling with depression. Further, 20% of Maine children have experienced two or more Adverse Childhood Experiences — higher than the national average of 17%. ACEs include experiences like violence or abuse, and the stress and trauma that accompanies them can have a lasting negative impact on a child’s wellbeing, according to data from the John T. Gorman Foundation that she cited during the floor discussion Wednesday. 
“Some school districts do offer these types of services in a school-based setting, but the current availability of school-based services is nowhere near adequate. Even when these school-based services are currently available, the funding of these services is so lean and precarious that the future of these programs is constantly in question,” she said, of the proposal that will cost $1.3 million in state funding. 
“These kids need help now. LD 858 would be an important step toward ensuring Maine students have the mental and behavioral health services they need,” she said.
Rep. Sheila Lyman (R-Livermore Falls) raised concern about what she said was a lack of clarity around the scope of services provided. “What specific behavioral and mental health interventions are we funding? Who decides what is appropriate for each child, and how will parents be informed or asked for consent?” she asked. 
“This bill does not sufficiently protect a parent’s right to know and direct the mental and behavioral care their child receives in a school setting,” Lyman said.
The Legislature passed a similar bill last year that died on the special appropriations table, where bills that pass but aren’t otherwise provided for in the state budget compete for remaining funds. Those that are not explicitly funded by the budget committee ultimately die.
Maine has a record of not providing adequate youth mental health support. Last year, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a lawsuit against the state under the Americans with Disabilities Act for unnecessarily segregating children with behavioral health needs and failing to ensure they could thrive in a community-based setting. The state settled last November, with Gov. Janet Mills saying her administration and the Legislature will continue to invest in mental and behavioral health resources. 
“We all strongly agree that in-community behavioral health services are critical, and we are committed to continuing to strengthen the delivery of those services for Maine children who need them,” Mills said in a statement at the time. While the settlement agreement required Maine to expand the availability of community-based behavioral health services for children, it did not specifically add any of these services to schools.
The bill, if funded, “would provide Maine school-aged children with support they need by meeting them where they are most often, and that is their school,” Gramlich said.

For a few minutes on Friday, Gov. Josh Stein joined them.
North Carolina’s Department for Motor Vehicles is facing a months-long backlog of appointments — with a typically busy summer season ramped up further by demand for REAL I.D. Stein has tapped a new commissioner for the department, who’s outlining both a series of quicker fixes and a longer-term “overhaul.” He and top transportation officials visited one of the offices as they delivered remarks on the plans.
“Know that we’re working,” said Paul Tine, who was named DMV commissioner at the end of April. “Know that these folks have not been empowered in the way that they need to, and that’s my job to do that.”
  From left: North Carolina DMV Commissioner Paul Tine, Gov. Josh Stein and Secretary of Transportation Joey Hopkins speak to reporters about the DMV on Friday, May 30, 2025. (Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)
Tine’s first order of business, he says, is improving working conditions and morale in the understaffed offices. The department is moving to increase pay for examiners. They’re beginning to upgrade some long-outdated equipment, and issue new uniforms “for the first time in five years.” And they’re shuffling employees around to reinforce frontline desks — assigning both volunteering central staff and summer interns into high-demand offices.
Motorists visiting DMV offices in the coming months can also expect to see some changes, Tine said. Staff are beginning to “triage” walk-in customers — meeting them as they walk up and making sure they have correct documents so they don’t waste time in line. Four additional offices, and 20 total, are now open for some hours on Saturdays.
And the DMV has been aiming to streamline its website, making it easier to navigate options and clearly identify if you need a REAL I.D. — and if so, what documents you need to bring.
Tine says a longer-term strategic plan to transform the department is in the works. But part of that plan depends on the General Assembly — and whether lawmakers choose to invest more money into hiring additional examiners and bolstering DMV resources.
House Republicans’ proposed budget largely follows the governor’s lead, allocating money to fund dozens of new examiner positions. That budget also green-lights efforts to modernize the DMV’s technology and proposes a study to determine whether the DMV could be privatized.
The Senate budget does not include such additions, with Senate leader Phil Berger expressing skepticism that the department deserves more tax dollars. State Auditor Dave Boliek’s office is currently conducting an audit of the department, with results expected in the coming months.
Tine, who currently owns Midgett Insurance Agency, is a former state representative. He was elected as a Democrat but left the party later, calling himself an independent and choosing to caucus with Republicans. He co-chaired the transportation appropriations committee while in the General Assembly.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_1908-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-30 15:17:46.191207

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)University of Florida President-elect Santa Ono could receive $3 million per year if the State University System’s Board of Governors confirms him next week. 
The proposed contract between UF and Ono includes a $1.5 million base salary for serving as president, $500,000 for serving as UF Health chair, more than $400,000 in annual performance bonuses, and another half-a-million in retirement contributions and retention payments. 
Despite unanimous approval by UF trustees, Ono’s presidency is being protested by some Republicans, while Gov. Ron DeSantis says he is leaving it up to the board he appointed to make the right decision. 
Tuesday, the 17-member Board of Governors will vote on Ono, who received unanimous approval from UF trustees this week. He is the sole finalist for the position. 
“I appointed all those folks, so they’ll make the judgement,” DeSantis said of the Board of Governors’ final vote. 
Former Gov. Rick Scott, U.S. Rep. Greg Steube, and U.S. Rep. and GOP gubernatorial candidate Byron Donalds have publicly questioned Ono’s candidacy, as has Donald Trump Jr., who took to X to express his feelings on the candidate. 
“WTF! Have the decision makers at @UF lost their minds!??? This woke psycho might be a perfect fit for a Communist school in California, but how is he even being considered for this role in Florida?” Trump Jr. posted Wednesday. “Every single member of the Florida Board of Governors should vote against him!!!”

Ono supported diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives in his previous job as president of the University of Michigan, guiding its “DEI 2.0” initiative and touting benefits of such programs but ultimately closed DEI offices earlier this year. Some Republicans question the legitimacy of Ono’s new-found anti-DEI convictions. 
“Now people have pointed out a lot of statements that he has made that are not exactly what we’re looking for in a state where woke goes to die and I cringe at some of these statements,” DeSantis said Thursday, during a news conference in Fort Myers about medical negligence. 
“But basically, I think the folks that were involved in the search, after having interviewed him, spent time with him, it’s their judgement that he’s really kind of reached the limit on the campus leftism and he would want to leave Michigan where that’s prevalent to Florida where it’s frowned upon,” DeSantis said. 
Ono told trustees this week that he developed his new stance on DEI in the last year and a half after talking with students and other members of the university community. Before, he wasn’t an expert on the topic, which had been universal in higher education, he said. 
Florida Republicans and President Donald Trump’s administration have focused heavily on removing diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives from higher education, including banning state expenditures on such initiatives.
“He will lose his job” if he promotes “a fountain of activism or leftist indoctrination,” DeSantis said.

WILMINGTON — Mayor John Carney has signed the City of Wilmington’s Fiscal Year 2026 budget ordinance, finalizing a spending plan that channels significant funding toward public safety, affordable housing, and neighborhood development. 
READ: Wilmington Council approves budget despite concerns over spending, utility costs
The budget includes targeted investments in several priority areas:

Affordable Housing: $2 million in capital funds will go toward building and rehabilitating housing units.
Neighborhood Development: A $2.5 million allocation will support the Neighborhood Stabilization Fund, including $500,000 for the Wilmington Neighborhood Conservancy Land Bank. The rest will fund home repair programs, alleyway cleanups, and tree removal efforts, with a focus on engaging minority contractors.
Support for Small and Minority-Owned Businesses: An additional $350,000 will be added to the Economic Development Strategic Fund.
Public Safety: The city will invest $4 million to launch a municipally operated ambulance service and support evidence-based policing practices.
Infrastructure: Capital funds will support street and sidewalk repairs, stormwater system upgrades, and park improvements.
Senior Tax Relief: The budget expands the city’s property tax exemption for residents age 65 and older living at or below the federal poverty level.


“This budget is about putting our values into action,” Carney said. “We’re building a stronger, safer, and more inclusive Wilmington—one that delivers for every resident.”
At the signing, Carney said the budget reflects shared priorities and invests in the areas that matter to residents. 
“We’re focusing on neighborhood revitalization, public safety, and essential services, while keeping taxes stable and supporting seniors,” he said. “Together, we’re building a Wilmington that works for everyone.”
Councilwoman Michelle Harlee, who chairs the Finance Committee, praised the collaborative process between Council and the administration.
“I’m excited for a number of reasons over this particular budget,” Harlee said. “It is a very much shared vision between the mayor, the administration, and the members of City Council. I’m very, very excited about the investments that are going to take place in our communities and around the city of Wilmington.”

Ellison explained the turnabout in a filing in which he said the arrested people had been found in an area his office thought was part of the new National Defense Area. It wasn’t. As a result, three people arrested in recent weeks won’t face newly created criminal charges for trespassing on a military base, punishable by up to a year in jail.
The dropped charges point to the ongoing confusion the new 400-square-mile military zone has created across branches of government and the courts since the U.S. Interior Department transferred the land to the Army in April.
“It is concerning that even the Acting United States Attorney is confused by the boundaries of this new National Defense Area,” a spokesperson for U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-NM) said in an emailed statement Thursday after Source New Mexico alerted his office to the dismissals. Heinrich has criticized the new NDA and called on the Defense Department to explain what it means for recreators and others.
On April 15, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum announced the transfer of land from the Bureau of Land Management to the military, effectively making the 180-mile border New Mexico shares with Mexico into an extended military base tied to Fort Huachuca in Arizona. 
Along with increasing Army patrols and empowering the “military [to] take a more direct role in securing our southern border,” as President Donald Trump said, creating the zone also enabled federal prosecutors to impose misdemeanor charges on those caught in the new National Defense Area. 
Confusion about where that area falls exists not just among federal agencies tasked with enforcing the NDA, but also among residents who live, work and attend school along the border, including ranchers with BLM cattle leases and dual citizens who cross the border daily.
Source NM spent the weekend in the area and talked with residents who described whiplash from a transfer, seemingly overnight, of federal public lands into an extended military base.
The land includes parcels of private property surrounded by federal lands; the Diocese of El Paso, which owns nearby pilgrimage site Mount Cristo Rey; and the State of New Mexico, which has miles of trust land.

The land also traverses the Continental Divide Trail, and hosts both hikers on multi-state sojourns and hunters hoping to nab a rare Mearns quail, among heartier fare that hide among the creosote dotting the borderlands separating New Mexico from Mexico. 
Recently, the Defense Department issued a statement telling hikers and hunters they were prohibited from entering the NDA. That incensed Angel Peña, director of Nuestra Tierra Conservation Project, a Las Cruces-based nonprofit that tries to help marginalized communities experience and conserve public lands. 
“You’re really now affecting livelihoods,” Peña told Source New Mexico during a drive Memorial Day Weekend along the northern edge of the NDA. “You’re affecting dinner on the table. You’re affecting recreation. You’re affecting the traditional uses of this land that help families make memories and tell stories and grow ever closer.”
No man’s land 
Between April 15 and May 29, the federal government charged more than 550 people with unauthorized entry into the new National Defense Area, according to a review of federal records. 
Federal prosecutors dropped charges for three of them based on the errant arrests dropped May 22, per Ellison’s filings. According to court records, Ellison’s office learned “on or about May 15” that portions of the border area “previously understood as encompassed” by the newly created New Mexico National Defense Area “were not, in fact, transferred to the jurisdiction of the Army.”
The dismissed cases come amid ongoing legal challenges, with federal public defenders contesting the charges on a variety of fronts. Two weeks ago, a federal judge dismissed more than 100 charges against the defendants, largely because he was not convinced those arrested knew they were entering a restricted area. 
The circumstances of the recent dismissals regarding errant arrests are not clear. AUSA spokesperson Tessa Duberry declined to comment on where the defendants were arrested, saying the office can’t comment beyond what was filed publicly. 
She also declined to say how many total cases the office has dismissed on those grounds or would dismiss, saying compiling that information would impose a “significant burden” on staff.
Duberry referred comment about arrests to the Army, which told Source in a statement Friday morning that it would not speculate on charges that are awaiting adjudication,” said Joint Task Force Southern Border spokesperson Jordan Beagle. Beagle also noted that only the Border Patrol makes arrests, though the Army will temporarily detain people to hand over to the Border Patrol.

“The Joint Task Force Southern Border remains laser focused on our mission to achieve 100% operational control of the border, in this case maintaining security within the National Defense Areas,” he said, “which includes detection, temporary detainment, and apprehension of those who trespass within the National Defense Areas.”
The Border Patrol did not respond to a request for comment from Source on Thursday. 
According to court filings, two of the three people feds dropped charges againt were arrested April 26 about “four miles east of the Santa Teresa Port of Entry.” Outside of the 60-foot buffer zone along the border, that’s roughly a mile from Mount Cristo Rey and other privately owned land. Source’s calls to the Diocese this week were not returned.
The third arrest occurred April 27, according to court filings, “about eight miles west of the Santa Teresa Port of Entry.” 
Federal judge dismisses trespass charges against migrants caught in NM military zone

All three criminal complaints note, as part of the justification for charges, that signs were posted in English and Spanish that “this is a restricted area and that unauthorized entry is prohibited.”
The impact of those dismissals on prosecutors’ cases remains unclear. Even though prosecutors dismissed the trio’s charges for unauthorized NDA entry, each appears to still be held in detention on related misdemeanors, including charges like “illegal entry by an alien” into the United States, “illegal entry without inspection” or entering military property, according to court records. 
Amanda Skinner, assistant federal public defender, declined to comment on how many of her office’s clients might have been affected by the dismissals, or whether she is expecting there to be any more. 
Heinrich, through his spokesperson, said he remains concerned about what the military takeover of the New Mexico border will mean for due process, for citizens and non-citizens alike. 
“The Trump Administration is bypassing due process for individuals who either intentionally or unintentionally enter this newly restricted area, including U.S. citizens who may be stopped and detained by U.S. Army soldiers for trespassing on an unmarked military base,” his spokesperson said. 
Back at the ranch
One group affected by the NDA — ranchers — has apparently reached a slightly uneasy, informal arrangement with the Army, according to ranchers along the border and the New Mexico Cattlegrowers Association.
In the last two weeks, Army and Border Patrol officials have collected the names, photographs, phone numbers, license plates and other details of ranchers who enter the NDA to round up their livestock or check on water tanks, ranchers told Source New Mexico. 
The collection is an effort, they said, to make sure  the Army does not mistake ranchers, who often carry firearms, for those who might be trespassing on a military base.

“Everybody around here in this part of the country is armed,” said Nancy Clopton, a longtime Hachita rancher with 80 square miles of leased pasture in and around the NDA. “I don’t want to be drug out of my pickup and then, you know, ‘Oh, she’s armed.’”
The agreement allows ranchers to drive along access roads and county roads criss-crossing the NDA. Each time, they drive over cattleguards with new signs on either side that begin with, in English and Spanish: “Restricted Area: This Department of Defense Property has been declared a restricted area by authority of the commander.” 
About a dozen such signs are posted on cattleguards off Highway 9 between Sunland Park and Hachita, according to Source’s count Sunday. Those are the same signs prosecutors use to justify criminal charges against the 550 defendants facing the unauthorized entry charges so far.

In response to questions from Source, Luis Soriano, Heinrich’s spokesperson, noted that Ellison and Hegseth have both publicly said there will be “no exceptions” for criminal trespassing in the area, and so Heinrich doesn’t consider an “informal, handshake deal sufficient to ensure the safety” of ranchers, sportsmen, hikers or others.
“For decades, ranchers and hunters alike have been accustomed to carrying firearms on what were their public lands until the transfer to the Department of Defense on April 15th,” Soriano said in a statement. “That history, combined with the complete lack of clarity from the Administration, is a recipe for a very dangerous situation for our local residents, Army soldiers and Border Patrol agents.”
Beagle, with the Army, told Source in a statement to Friday that the army is continuing to work on a formal “memorandum of understanding” with various groups to “support the interests of the local community and the military mission within the New Mexico National Defense Area (NDA).”

“The MOU process for commercial and recreational activities, such as hunting, mining, and ranching, is complex,” he said “and necessitates careful coordination with multiple organizations to ensure that proposed activities do not compromise public safety and border security operations.”
Beagle also said the Army would release more information to the community as it becomes available. He also noted the land order that enabled the transfer was “subject to valid existing rights,” so he said the private “property owners” with land adjacent to the NDA would not be affected. But he did not immediately respond to a request for comment about how that applies to ranchers who lease, not own, land in the area. 
Bronson Corn, president of the NM Cattlegrowers Association, defended the arrangement in an interview with Source on Thursday. 
He disagrees with the idea that ranchers might be skirting the law, saying, albeit informal, the agreement allows ranchers to keep their cattle alive and maintain their leases with the BLM, while also allowing the Army to harden the border. 
“They have not had any conflicts with the military when it comes to being able to continue on with their day-to-day operations,” he said. “There is some concern, there’s no doubt about it, that they can’t get to certain areas of their ranch due to the fact of that militarized zone.”
In addition to concerns about firearms, Clopton said she is concerned an influx of army personnel, potentially from out-of-state, won’t be careful to close cattle gates behind them, which is a long-standing gripe she and other ranchers have with the Border Patrol. But she is withholding judgment, for now. 
“We’ll see how it works out,” she said. “It depends on the individuals on the ground, those individual soldiers, how they treat us, how we see them. It’s an experiment.”

(Karen Kasmauski | Getty Images)President Donald Trump’s administration has reversed course on a plan to close more than 30 mine safety offices, something union leaders and advocates said would compromise inspectors’ ability to protect coal miner’s lives.
Leases of the office, which employ coal mine inspectors, were set to end this summer along with several other federal offices under a plan by the Department of Government Efficiency.
A spokesperson for the Department of Labor confirmed Thursday that 34 Mine Safety and Health Adminsitration offices will be retained. They said the agency “has been working closely with [the General Services Administration] to ensure our MSHA inspectors have the resources they need to carry out their core mission to prevent death, illness, and injury from mining and promote safe and healthy workplaces for American miners.”
The reversal comes amid a push back from the Black Lung Association, the United Mine Workers of America, and others on what advocates called the Trump administration’s “attacks on coal miner safety.” In April, workers at the National Institute for Occupational Health and Safety were put on administrative leave due to “reorganizations” at the federal level. 
According to an analysis from the Appalachian Citizens’ Law Center, the MSHA offices that were slated to close performed more than 16,600 safety and health inspections — with more than 230 of those done in West Virginia — between February 2024 and 2025.
Earlier this month, a federal judge ordered workers from NIOSH’s Respiratory Health Division back to work, ending a reduction in force that prevented coal miners with black lung disease from having the option to transfer to less dusty areas of the mine to prevent further illness and injury.
MSHA had delayed the implementation of a new silica rule aimed at protecting coal miners from the dust that causes black lung disease. The rule was set to be effective in April but will now be effective in August. 
“I’m happy they’re going to keep these MSHA offices open,” Gary Hairston, president of the National Black Lung Association, said in a news release. “We need these offices that are close to the mines so that MSHA can conduct safety inspections and respond to accidents in a timely way. Now we need MSHA to enforce the new silica rule, and we need Congress to give MSHA enough funding to do its job.”
In a statement Friday, the United Mine Workers of America, a labor union representing coal miners, said the organization is relieved by the decision but called on the Department of Labor to be transparent about which offices remain are still at risk, and to stop remaining efforts to reduce the government’s mine safety infrastructure.
“The idea that anyone would even consider shuttering dozens of MSHA field offices, most of which are located in remote mining communities, shows a fundamental misunderstanding of what it takes to keep miners safe,” UMWA International President Cecil E. Roberts said in the statement. “We’ve said from day one that cutting these offices would compromise inspectors’ ability to respond quickly to accidents, enforce safety regulations, and protect the lives of our members and their coworkers.”
In a statement Friday, Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-West Virginia, and chair of the Senate Labor-HHS Appropriations Subcommittee, said she was glad to hear that many of West Virginia’s MSHA offices will remain open. 
“I have raised this issue directly with [Department of Labor] Secretary [Lori] Chavez-DeRemer because I was concerned about the impact these closures could have on mine safety and workers’ access to support,” Capito said. “Keeping these offices open is the right decision — and a win for miners, inspectors, and the communities they serve.”

DemasEnbridge Energy’s controversial Line 5 tunnel project will move forward to a 30-day public comment period after the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers on Friday released a draft environmental impact statement, which did not clear the project of all and potentially significant environmental concerns raised by activists and lawmakers opposed to the pipeline and its proposed tunnel.
The proposed plan is to construct a 3.6 mile tunnel under the lakebed of the Straits of Mackinac that would house a replacement segment of Line 5. The pipeline consists of two 20-inch diameter pipes that are buried in sediment near the shore and rest on, or are anchored to, the lakebed of the Stratis, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said.
Enbridge’s aim is to have that tunnel approved for permitting by the federal government through the Army Corp’s review process. It is their preferred alternative to no action from the Corps, which the company has said could result in less environmental security and certainty. Other alternatives include bolstering the tunnel with protective materials or the decommissioning of the pipeline altogether, which is what Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and Attorney General Dana Nessel set out to do shortly after they entered office in 2018.
Enbridge called the release of the impact statement and opening the public comment period a significant milestone for the project.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“It is the result of more than five years of rigorous and comprehensive permit review and stakeholder engagement including input from Tribes and is a critical step forward in planning a project that will modernize energy infrastructure, protect the Great Lakes, and ensure long-term energy reliability for Michigan and the broader region,” said Enbridge spokesperson Ryan Duffy. “We appreciate the extensive technical work that went into this document and the opportunity to contribute detailed responses to numerous data and information requests – demonstrating our commitment to transparency and environmental, social and cultural responsibility.”
Duffy added that it was Enbridge’s goal for the proposed tunnel and the existing line to have “the smallest possible environmental footprint.”
“The tunnel design already reflects that intent, and we will use the USACE’s findings from the [impact statement] to further refine the project,” he said.











Some activists who have fought against the continued operation of the line said this week that more work was needed to prevent the project from moving forward, while others said were disappointed in the state’s efforts to shut down Line 5.











Andrea Pierce, founder of the Michigan Anishinaabek caucus and policy director at the Michigan Environmental Justice Coalition, said Michigan needed to have good, clean, safe water for them to drink, to fish, to hunt, to gather. Those were also the hallmarks of the treaty rights granted to Tribes in Michigan.
Pierce was critical of Whitmer’s actions thus far.
“Governor Whitmer has done some things. She has [attempted to] shut them down. She revoked their easement. But that’s it,” Pierce said. “What else is being done? It’s operating illegally. That pipeline for years now [has been] operating illegally. They’re still making a profit off of us, off of Michigan citizens. They are making a profit, these Canadian companies, that needs to stop.”
Enbridge initially filed to apply for permits to build the tunnel in April 2020. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has been working on the draft economic statement since then. In April, the Corps said its evaluation would move forward on a shortened timeline following an executive order from President Donald Trump.

Meanwhile, the existence of Line 5 and its continued operation has been fought out in a winding legal battle that remains active even as the project hit a milestone of forward progress on Friday.
Public comment on the project will end on June 30. Virtual public meetings are scheduled for June 18 and June 25, and comments will be collected online or through written submissions, which can be mailed to 6501 Shady Grove Road, P.O. Box 10178, Gaithersburg, MD 20898.
The impact statement released Friday factored in many rounds of previous public comment and input from Tribal organizations, as well as analysis of the project plans and potential alternatives.
The upshot: Enbridge’s tunnel project could have numerous consequences for land ownership and land use, land and water-based recreation, water resources, area aesthetics and air quality, as well as biological, cultural and soil resources.
As to the cultural resources affected, construction and operation of the tunnel would have adverse effects on archaeological sites and an existing archaeological district. Each of the activities associated with construction were listed as events that would destroy archaeological resources within the project footprint.
Impacts to Tribal treaty rights were not noted in the report, but the Corps said those issues would be determined in its decision materials following the new round of public comment.
A change of land ownership might be necessary at certain laydown areas as Enbridge would have to purchase land within the sites or acquire temporary or permanent easements. 
Direct, long-term and permanent detrimental impacts were associated with the project, the Corps said, as it related to undeveloped forest land that would need to be transformed into industrial sites, permanently altering the geology along the proposed tunnel site.
Direct and detrimental effects to nearby recreational sites were noted due to the noise and aesthetic impacts of construction. Those impacts would likely end when construction was completed, however.
Groundwater could be affected, but aquifer testing along the tunnel alignment site showed the surrounding aquifer would recover in a matter of days following construction. There is, however, concern for the potential release of drilling fluids and other contaminants associated with onshore material storage and the use of heavy equipment.
That said, the Corps noted that those impacts would also end once construction ceased – but with a heavy caveat that the construction contractor would have to adhere to a spill plan and monitor onsite and nearby well water for up to two years following completion.
To that end, surface water could be greatly affected by the project, as it would disturb the Straits during the installation of a water intake pipe. Approximately 20,000 gallons of drilling fluid – consisting of water and bentonite – would be released. The features would be removed following construction.

The turbidity and sedimentation in the area would be affected on a limited basis in the work area, but direct and detrimental impacts were noted to surface water adjacent to the construction site due to erosion and sedimentation.
An adherence to mitigation measures as a part of any approved permits would alleviate some of those concerns, and any long-term increases in stormwater would be managed by a permanent stormwater system.
Again, the Corps noted detrimental impacts associated with the unintended release of contaminants like equipment fuel.
Vegetation and wildlife disturbances in the area were also listed as factors, the latter of which would come from blasting activities during site preparation and the presence of workers in wildlife areas. The loss of approximately eight acres of habitat for protected species was noted, which would require ongoing coordination with the federal government and the Michigan Department of Natural Resources.
Air quality would also be disturbed during construction, and proposed ventilation fans would add to noise nuisance, but only on an intermittent basis. The possibility of harmful emissions were noted to be significantly higher with Enbridge’s proposed version of the tunnel project compared to an alternative that includes a gravel and protective rock cover.
The reliability of the tunnel and its safety assurances were also analyzed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, but the report noted that the possibility of a catastrophic anchor strike, which could potentially release oil into the Great Lakes, would be eliminated with the presence of a tunnel.
Decommissioning the line also carried some potential localized and short-term consequences, the Army Corps said.
Reactions to the project’s forward progress were mixed, at best.
Great Lakes Michigan Jobs – a business coalition composed of the Detroit Regional Chamber, the Grand Rapids Chamber, economic development organization InvestUP and the Upper Peninsula Construction Council – said in a joint statement issued Friday that they were ready to support the tunnel project as the public comment period commenced.
The group also said that it was time to grant the project its permits to build the tunnel.
“Line 5 is an important piece of energy infrastructure for the continent, providing Michiganders with critical light crude and propane extracted from Canada,” Brian Shoaf, vice president of Public Policy and Business Advocacy with the Detroit Regional Chamber, said in a statement. 
Josh Lunger, vice president of government affairs with the Grand Rapids Chamber, said the tunnel wasn’t just an energy project, it was a strategic infrastructure investment.
“Across the entire state, we count on Line 5. It powers our businesses, our job sites, and even our homes,” Lunger said in a statement. “The Army Corps has been reviewing permit applications for more than five years. It’s time to grant the permits.”

Those who have been opposed to the project have said for years that the pipeline is a danger to the Great Lakes and the Straits of Mackinac. The tunnel project, in their view, would not alleviate the environmental concerns, but only stands to exacerbate them.
As lawmakers and business leaders met for the Detroit Regional Chamber Mackinac Policy Conference this week on Mackinac Island, including Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who gave a speech to the conference Thursday night, so too did activists gather to express concerns over Line 5.
Ahead of the governor’s annual speech, protesters marched through downtown Mackinac Island, where they planned to rally outside the Grand Hotel for a press conference denouncing the tunnel project. 
The protesters, however, were turned away at the bottom of the hill approaching the hotel by a person who said he was there on behalf of the hotel. The man informed the protesters that the sidewalks and roads leading to the hill were private property owned by the Grand Hotel. 
That did not deter the protesters from being heard, even as they were diverted away from the hotel.
“Governor Whitmer has stood up for the Great Lakes and all of us before, by revoking Line 5’s illegal easement, but her work isn’t done,” said Beth Wallace, the Great Lakes climate and energy director at the National Wildlife Federation. “Now, Enbridge wants to blast and drill through the Great Lakes for years just to extend [the] life of a pipeline that will soon reach 80 years old and has already spilled at least 35 times. Meanwhile, the Great Lakes business network and regional experts confirm the project is absolutely not needed,”
Wallace added that decommissioning Line 5 was “the only honorable path forward, and means we’re honoring treaties and public trust, supporting domestic energy supplies and alternatives, creating more jobs in decommissioning, avoiding noticeable price increases, and it’s important to notice we are paying for the tunnel.”
“Those price increases are going to happen in the rates that Enbridge is already setting,” Wallace said. “The proposed tunnel isn’t about safety or providing our communities with energy, it’s about Enbridge’s profits.”

As of Friday morning, the individuals were being held at Northwest State Correctional Facility in St. Albans, according to a Friday press release from the Burlington-based migrant advocacy group the Vermont Asylum Assistance Project. “Five or so” of the individuals were carrying proof of their immigration status at the time of the incident and are being scheduled for release, the press release stated. The immigration status of the other detainees was not immediately clear. ICE did not immediately respond to VTDigger’s requests for comment. The episode marks the second mass-detainment incident in Vermont in as many months as federal immigration officials ramp up enforcement efforts across the country to carry out the policies of President Donald Trump. Last month, eight migrant workers were detained at a dairy farm in Berkshire after Customs and Border Protection agents responded to a call alleging that suspicious looking men had crossed onto the farm property. Four of those arrested have already been deported to Mexico, while others remain in ICE custody.The arrests correspond with what advocacy groups have said is an alarming increase of ICE’s use of commercial flights to transfer detainees out of the state. On Friday, in the latest such incident, ICE transferred seven women on a United Airlines flight from Patrick Leahy Burlington International Airport to Chicago, according to the release from the Vermont Asylum Assistance Project. The women, who had been detained at the Chittenden Regional Correctional Facility in South Burlington, were observed on the flight among commercial passengers with a plainclothes federal escort, the release stated. Legal observers awaiting the arrival of the flight said the ICE detainees did not get off the plane in Chicago and the plane subsequently reboarded for a flight to Washington, D.C., according to the release.Former state Rep. Kiah Morris, who was apparently on the same flight, posted a video to social media in which she drew attention to the incident. “I have great concerns about the fact that this is happening and not certain on what we should be able to do as a public to really be able to really help support folks right now,” Morris said in the video. “(These are) some terrifying things to see happening right in front of our faces.”This story will be updatedRead the story on VTDigger here:  Immigration officials detain 10 construction workers in Newport.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AP17044803991198-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-05-30 14:14:39.009948

(Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)Colorado immigrant rights advocates expressed outrage over the Thursday arrest of a family of three outside a federal immigration court in Denver, calling the tactic an escalation by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers that will punish immigrants who comply with the law by attending their scheduled court hearings.
Emily Brock, an attorney with the Rocky Mountain Immigrant Advocacy Network, witnessed the arrest of the family, including a 1-year-old child, shortly after they attended their hearing at the Department of Justice’s Denver Immigration Court at 1961 Stout St. Six unidentified plainclothes officers surrounded the family, according to the Colorado Rapid Response Network, a coalition of immigrant advocacy groups. The officers refused to let Brock speak with the family about their rights before they were taken away.
“As a parent, I cannot imagine the terror these parents experienced as the officers surrounded them with their child in their arms and told them they were to go with them,” she said.

“As the officers got closer, the little boy’s arms clung tighter around his father’s neck,” Brock added. “To take enforcement action against a family following the rules, attending their proceedings, is an attack on due process and serves only to instigate increased levels of fear in the community.”
The arrest at a federal courthouse in Denver appears to be part of a nationwide policy shift by ICE as President Donald Trump’s administration moves to carry out unprecedented mass deportations of as many as 12 million immigrants in the U.S. who lack permanent legal status. Federal immigration agents have long avoided such arrests so as not to deter immigrants from going through lawful court proceedings.
But over the last week, an “aggressive new initiative” by ICE has abruptly reversed that policy, according to internal documents obtained by The New York Times.
Christina Brown, an immigration attorney and founder of the Colorado Asylum Center, said that such a policy will force immigrant families to make an “impossible choice” — whether to “attend court and face possible arbitrary mandatory months-long detention, family separation and the prospect of arguing your case from inside detention, or not appear in court and face certain targeting for deportation by ICE.”
Denver’s ICE field office did not immediately respond to questions Friday about the arrest and where the family was being held. Colorado’s only immigrant detention center, in Aurora, is an adults-only facility. Under Trump, multiple ICE facilities across the country have been reopened for family detention, a practice that had largely ended under former President Joe Biden.
“Detaining an entire family — including a baby — after they did exactly what was asked of them shows how far ICE will go to punish people simply for trying to stay together and follow the law,” said Raquel Lane-Arellano, communications manager for the Colorado Immigrant Rights Coalition. “This is a deliberate attempt to scare our communities out of the courtroom and into the shadows. But we won’t back down — we will keep showing up for each other, demanding justice, and holding those in power accountable.”

(Getty Images)The U.S. Department of Homeland Security on Thursday released a list of “sanctuary jurisdictions” it says “are deliberately and shamefully obstructing the enforcement of federal immigration laws endangering American communities. Sanctuary cities protect dangerous criminal aliens from facing consequences and put law enforcement in peril.”
DHS includes 23 of New Mexico’s 33 counties on its list, along with the cities of Albuquerque and Santa Fe.
The list follows President Donald Trump’s executive order in April requiring such a list. Following that executive order, City of Santa Fe Mayor Alan Webber told Source the City of Santa Fe does not specifically identify itself as a sanctuary city and he did not think the order applied to the city. The City of Santa Fe passed a resolution in 1999, which was reaffirmed in 2017, declaring itself a welcoming city for immigrants and refugees.
“We treat everyone in our city the same: with respect and a welcoming attitude, regardless of a variety of factors including whether they’re here with documentation,” Webber said. “That continues to be our city policy.”
In a written statement provided to Source last month, Albuquerque Mayor Tim Keller last month emphasized that Trump’s executive order is counterproductive to addressing crime.”We remember when Trump tried to extort immigrant-friendly cities like ours before, but threatening to defund the police is the exact opposite of what Albuquerque needs to be safe,” Keller said. “Our communities are stronger when people of all backgrounds feel safe reporting crimes and working with police, and our officers will keep arresting anyone who breaks the law, regardless of their immigration status.”

“Each jurisdiction listed will receive formal notification of its non-compliance with Federal statutes,” the DHS stated in posting the list. “DHS demands that these jurisdictions immediately review and revise their policies to align with Federal immigration laws and renew their obligation to protect American citizens, not dangerous illegal aliens.”
In response to the list, leaders from several civil rights and immigration organizations issued statements decrying its publication.
“New Mexico has a proud tradition of welcoming immigrants,” Lena Weber, interim policy director with the American Civil Liberties Union of New Mexico, said in a statement. “Immigrants and mixed-status families are integral to our communities. We talk a lot about public safety in this state—and we know that we are all safer when our families can go to school, work, and health centers without fear of being torn away from their loved ones.”
Sanctuary studies

Fabiola Landeros from El CENTRO de Igualdad y Derechos said in a statement that, “We are proud of the legacy we’ve built in New Mexico, including the passage of policies that promote public safety, safeguard civil rights, promote immigrant integration, and recognize the vast contributions of our immigrant communities. The Trump administration’s terrifying vision of mass deportation and family separation and their willingness to trample on constitutional rights and utilize illegal tactics is not only against New Mexican values, but it will also have a devastating impact on our communities and economy.”
Jessica Inez Martínez, director of policy and coalition building at New Mexico Immigrant Law Center, described “labeling sanctuary policies as ‘lawless insurrection’ is not only inflammatory—it is legally baseless and a reckless distortion of the rule of law.  At the New Mexico Immigrant Law Center, we see every day how immigrant families are building lives rooted in care, resilience, and hope. They are our neighbors, coworkers, and caregivers—essential to the cultural and economic life of New Mexico.”

More Republican-led states are giving paid parental leave to public school teachers and other state employees, signaling a broader acceptance of family-friendly workplace policies once championed primarily by Democrats.
“All of these red states, I think we’re late to the party,” said South Carolina state Rep. Beth Bernstein, a Democrat who sponsored a bill this year to increase state employees’ paid parental leave from six to 12 weeks. It passed the majority-Republican South Carolina House in April with strong bipartisan support.
This year, Alabama, Iowa and Mississippi joined 37 other states in granting paid parental leave to thousands of state workers.

The trend has gathered steam in recent years. Some experts link it to the cascade of state abortion bans that followed the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2022 Dobbs decision, which dismantled the federal right to abortion. Under fire from critics to do more to care for babies once they’re born, at least a dozen conservative-led states with abortion bans have since granted or expanded paid parental leave for their state employees.
But others say the increasing bipartisan support for measures that help working parents is also a reaction to economic realities.
“What we’ve seen, especially in more conservative states, is the public sector has experienced a lot of turnover,” said Kameron Dawson, legal director of the Southern Office of A Better Balance, a legal organization focused on workplace rights. “They’re looking for tools to recruit younger employees.”
Paid parental leave is the time off granted to workers for the birth or adoption of a baby, to care for a child, or to recover from a stillbirth or miscarriage. Without it, employees are left to cobble together their sick leave and vacation leave — or go unpaid — to stay home with a child and heal.










We’re trying to attract and retain state employees and teachers, and we’re in competition with everyone around us, and the private sector as well.


– Alabama Republican state Rep. Ginny Shaver


Alabama Republican state Rep. Ginny Shaver watched her daughter, a public school teacher, struggle to get the leave she needed after the births of her children in recent years.
“With her second, she had complications in her pregnancy and used up her [paid vacation and sick] leave before she even had the baby,” Shaver told Stateline. Her daughter contracted COVID-19, and the baby had to spend time in neonatal intensive care. “It was a very difficult time, and she had to take unpaid leave.”

Last year, Shaver and Democratic state Sen. Vivian Figures worked to win approval of a paid parental leave bill for state employees. It failed.
But they tried again this year. With the support of Republican Gov. Kay Ivey, the state legislature — which has a Republican supermajority — passed it nearly unanimously. The new law gives female state employees, including teachers, eight weeks of paid parental leave in connection with birth, stillbirth or miscarriage, and gives male employees two weeks. Adoptive parents get eight weeks for one parent and two for the other.
Shaver said she thinks the law passed thanks to vocal support from the governor and increased awareness of the issue due to the work she and Figures did in previous sessions.
“And the fact that all of the southeast states around us offered it,” Shaver said. “We’re trying to attract and retain state employees and teachers, and we’re in competition with everyone around us, and the private sector as well.”

Keeping talent

For many Republicans, the workforce development argument for paid leave is a persuasive one. For states such as Alabama and South Carolina that have some of the lowest workforce participation rates in the nation, paid leave can be a tool to keep more people — particularly women — working. And it can be a way to retain educators as many states struggle with teacher shortages in K-12 schools.
“For several years we’ve seen state legislatures acknowledging the importance of child care to businesses and the economy,” said Feroza Freeland, policy director at the Southern Office of A Better Balance. “But in the last few years, we’ve seen a growing recognition that paid leave is another piece of that puzzle.”

States have taken up the issue because the federal government has not. The United States is a global outlier; among 38 peer nations, it’s the only one that doesn’t mandate paid parental leave, according to the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development. The group comprises 38 democracies with market-based economies.
The federal Family and Medical Leave Act, passed in 1993 and extended in 2020, only requires public agencies and companies with at least 50 employees to give up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for parents of newborns or newly adopted children, or caregivers of sick family members.

GOP support

During his first term, President Donald Trump publicly supported some forms of paid family leave and signed a defense bill that gives 12 weeks of paid parental leave to most federal employees.
Paid family leave was a signature issue for his daughter Ivanka Trump, at the time a senior adviser to the president. She even held a paid leave and child care summit at the White House in late 2019.
That set the stage for other Republicans to take up the issue more publicly. And after the Dobbs decision, family-friendly policies have increasingly become conservative talking points in states with restrictive abortion laws.
After the Mississippi House unanimously passed a paid parental leave bill earlier this year, Republican House Speaker Jason White celebrated the bill as a reflection of Mississippi’s status as a “pro-life state.”
In a post on X this week announcing her signing of a new paid parental leave law, Iowa Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds called Iowa “a pro-family state.”
North Carolina was one of the first Southern states to grant paid parental leave to state workers in 2019 when then-Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, signed an executive order. In 2023, several months after the Dobbs decision, the state’s majority-Republican legislature extended paid parental leave to public school employees by tacking it onto a law banning most abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy.
Meanwhile, Indiana Republican Gov. Mike Braun signed an executive order in March to add up to eight additional weeks of paid leave for “childbirth recovery” to the state’s existing four weeks of paid parental leave.

Running the gamut

The new laws won’t apply to most residents, because they only cover state employees. But they could have a downstream effect.
Shaver, the Alabama lawmaker, said she hopes her state’s new law will not only help the state be competitive with the private sector, but also set a precedent for other employers to follow.
“I hope they will see it’s in their benefit to offer what they can,” she said. “It may not be eight or 12 weeks, but even offering a reduced or flexible work schedule can help families.”
Just over a quarter of private-sector workers have access to paid family leave through their employer as of March 2023, according the most recent data from the U.S. Department of Labor.
Among the lowest-wage earners, that share drops to 6%.

State paid leave programs run the gamut in terms of what they offer. While Alabama’s new law offers up to eight weeks of leave for all state employees, including teachers, Mississippi’s offers six and does not require public schools to offer paid parental leave to their employees.
Iowa’s new law grants four weeks of paid leave for the birth or adoption of a child and one week of paid paternity leave. Tennessee’s law, passed in 2023, only offers paid leave to workers in the state’s executive and judicial branches.
But a few states are already expanding their offerings: Last year, Georgia legislators voted to double paid parental leave from three to six weeks.
And some states have gone further than just state employees: 13 states and the District of Columbia have mandated paid family leave for all workers, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center. Most of those states are located in New England or on the West Coast and all are Democratic-led. Ten more offer voluntary paid family leave statewide that’s provided through private insurance.

Sandwich generation

Experts say the shift in attitude toward family-friendly policies can also be attributed to a generational shift.
“A lot of younger lawmakers are more willing to champion the issue of paid leave,” said Freeland, of A Better Balance. “They’re understanding it because they’re seeing it in their own lives, or seeing friends and family members going through this.”
In South Carolina, Bernstein’s bill faced some opposition from members of the state’s ultra-conservative Freedom Caucus and Family Caucus. Some lawmakers questioned the potential costs of the bill, or criticized it as government overreach.
South Carolina Republican state Rep. Josiah Magnuson, a member of the Freedom Caucus, said he believed the bill would be a financial burden on public school districts that could lead to raised taxes.
“You’re saying, let’s tax the people of South Carolina, most of whom don’t get paid parental leave, and give them to state employees who already have six weeks’ paid parental leave,” Magnuson told lawmakers in April before the House voted to pass the bill.
He also said he doesn’t like that the increased paid leave “puts the foot in the door a little more for the government to be involved in the home.”
The opposition frustrated Bernstein, who pointed out that the state’s 2022 law that granted six weeks of paid parental leave passed the legislature almost unanimously. This year’s bill expanding that leave passed the House but hasn’t seen movement in the Senate. It can be picked up again when the legislature returns in January.
Other South Carolina Republicans backed the bill, citing their own families’ experiences following the birth of their children, reported the South Carolina Daily Gazette.
More conservative states are also responding to the needs of “sandwich generation” employees who may be caring for aging parents as well as children, Freeland said.
Earlier this year, Tennessee became the first Southern state to expand its state paid leave policy beyond just parental leave. The state legislature voted almost unanimously to extend its six-week paid leave policy to cover state workers providing end-of-life care to a family member.
“We’re seeing a growing recognition that people need support for these types of family or caregiving needs,” said Freeland, “and that it strengthens the workforce and economy to be able to provide that.”

Joni Ernst held a town hall at Aplington-Parkersburg High School in Parkersburg May 30, 2025. (Screenshot via C-SPAN)PARKERSBURG — At a sometime raucous town hall meeting Friday morning, U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst faced vocal opposition on her support for spending cuts to programs such as Medicaid and SNAP.
Like many other Republican lawmakers holding events with constituents throughout the country, Ernst faced a crowd at the Aplington-Parkersburg High School who were upset with decisions made by President Donald Trump and the GOP-controlled Congress — particularly as they relate to funding for health care and food assistance programs included in the “big, beautiful” budget reconciliation bill that narrowly passed the U.S. House earlier in May.
Though Ernst said the Senate would make changes to the measure and advance their own version of the legislation, she defended reductions in spending for Medicaid at the town hall, saying the changes will not impact people in need but will remove from the program “illegals that are receiving Medicaid benefits” and able-bodied adults who are not working.
“People will die,” a woman shouted at the stage as Ernst answered one of several questions about the cuts.
“People are not — well, we all are going to die, so for heaven’s sake,” Ernst said in a response that was met by further shouts and jeering from the crowd.
Ernst said she agrees with most of the provisions on Medicaid included in the House version of the budget reconciliation bill, saying that it was targeted at changes to the public health care program that “made it much easier to get onto Medicaid, but much tougher to take people off of Medicaid.” Ernst said many people on Medicaid currently are working full-time and have access to other benefits.
“What we have to do is make sure that those that are not eligible by the federal standard for Medicaid are not receiving Medicaid,” Ernst said. “What we do need to do is make sure that those that are part of a vulnerable population have access to Medicaid and receive those full benefits. So what we’re trying to do is strengthen Medicaid by directing the dollars to the people that actually meet the requirements of the program.”
It its House form, the bill includes a $625 billion reduction in federal spending for Medicaid over 10 years, according to estimates from the Congressional Budget Office. It also includes 80-hour-per-month work requirements for people between ages 19 and 65 to continue receiving Medicaid health coverage, with several exceptions for people with disabilities and complex medical conditions, pregnant people, tribal community members and parents of dependent children.
Elizabeth Kehret, who works for Lutheran Services in Iowa, said she was troubled by the potential impact of Medicaid cuts for pregnant woman, saying that she was previously enrolled on Medicaid during her four pregnancies before the state revuised eligibility for postpartum coverage, changing it from families with incomes of 375% of the federal poverty line to those at 215% of the federal poverty line.
Kehret said she was concerned the federal Medicaid spending cuts would cause similar cuts for care in states across the country, meaning pregnant people, who may also have private health coverage, will struggle to pay for the medical care required both before and after their child is born.
“I heard you say earlier about people who work full time but still get Medicaid — yeah,” Kehret said. “I meet with dozens of women who have dual enrollment, where they have private insurance as well as Medicaid, and it helps cover the things that their private insurance doesn’t, or that high deductible. … Medicaid is extremely important to the smallest and most vulnerable population in Iowa.”
Ernst said there were provisions to allow continued Medicaid coverage for pregnant people in the House bill.
“Because you are part of that vulnerable population, we want to make sure that you have access to Medicaid,” Ernst said. “So you will hear examples of those like the able-bodied, 30-year-old man who is taking advantage of the program, not working. What we’re asking is that please engage in work activities, engage in volunteer activities, be enrolled in a training program, and then that makes you Medicaid eligible.”
Similar concerns were brought up about the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, that provides food assistance to low-income individuals. Under the House budget plan, some costs of SNAP would be moved to the states, in addition to adding other work requirements. Ernst said the House bill is correcting “overpayments” from states on SNAP, in addition to removing “people that have not been eligible for these programs by law as it is currently written” from public assistance.
Several veterans also spoke at the event, criticizing Republicans and Elon Musk’s DOGE Service for cuts to veterans’ assistance programs and cuts to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. In response, Ernst said, “We’re not cutting veterans benefits.”
Several veterans have been outspoken about changes made by DOGE to the VA, including the cut of roughly 2,400 VA jobs in early March.
Ernst has been a major supporter of DOGE and efforts to make government more “efficient,” saying Republicans and Musk are focused on removing areas of unnecessary spending and “streamlining” existing programs and services. Ernst highlighted the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) as an entity that can be made more efficient through DOGE efforts in response to a question on federal support following natural disasters.
“Department of Government Efficiency … the E is not about elimination, it is about efficiency,” Ernst said. “So how can we do better as a federal government to respond to the people on the ground?”",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-30-at-11.27.38 AM-1024x592.png,,,2025-05-30 13:16:33.529064

The suit was filed Thursday in Douglas County District Court. (Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Two physicians and three women are plaintiffs in a Kansas lawsuit challenging constitutionality of a state law invalidating advance medical directives outlining end-of-life treatment for pregnant patients.
The group’s lawsuit seeks to prohibit enforcement of a Kansas statute interfering with health care decisions outlined in living wills based exclusively on an individual’s pregnancy status. Kansas is among states permitting state interference in advance directives for pregnant patients, regardless of the gestational age of a fetus, when a person was incapacitated or terminally ill.
Issues surrounding end-of-life state law recently took on urgency as a brain-dead pregnant Georgia woman was placed on life support in deference to that state’s abortion ban.
Kansas patient plaintiffs Emma Vernon, Abigail Ottaway and Laura Stratton as well as Kansas physician plaintiffs Michele Bennett and Lynley Holman argued in the Douglas County District Court complaint filed Thursday the Kansas law violated rights of personal autonomy, privacy, equal treatment and freedom of speech under the Kansas Constitution’s Bill of Rights by disregarding clearly articulated end-of-life choices of pregnant people.
“Because I’m currently pregnant, I don’t get the peace of mind a living will is meant to provide,” said Vernon, a Lawrence resident who is pregnant. “I shouldn’t have to fear that my pregnancy could cost me my dignity and autonomy.”
Vernon said she outlined in a living will the medical care she would want if faced with a life-threatening condition, but Kansas’ law meant she wouldn’t have control over her end-of-life care while pregnant.
“I am no less capable of planning my medical care simply because I am pregnant. I know what is best for me,” she said.
Many states established a boundary for medical directives of pregnant individuals no longer capable of participating in end-of-life care in terms of the viability of a fetus. Kansas’ statute invalidated decision-making authority of pregnant women regardless of gestational development of a fetus.
Holman, a Lawrence physician specializing in obstetrics and gynecology, said responsibilities of health care professionals should be centered on honoring patients’ autonomy and privacy.
“When a law compels me to act against my patients’ clearly expressed decisions, it not only undermines the trust at the heart of the patient-provider relationship, but also threatens the ethical foundation of medical care,” Holman said.
Defendants in the Kansas lawsuit are Kris Kobach, the state attorney general; Richard Bradbury, president of the Kansas State Board of Healing Arts; and Dakota Loomis, district attorney in Douglas County. The lawsuit seeks to prevent Kobach and Bradbury from enforcing state law nullifying directives of pregnant women.
The case was filed by attorneys with Compassion & Choices, a Colorado nonprofit working to improve patient autonomy at the end of life; If/When/How, a California reproductive rights legal nonprofit; and the Topeka law firm of Irigonegaray & Revenaugh.
Attorney Pedro Irigonegaray said Kansans valued individual rights and personal freedoms, but the state’s pregnancy exclusion “betrays those values by denying pregnant people the right to control their own medical decisions.”
“Our plaintiffs are simply asking for the same fundamental rights the Kansas Constitution guarantees to all Kansans,” said Jess Pezley, senior staff attorney at Compassion & Choices. “Categorically stripping individuals of their right to make deeply personal end-of-life decisions because they are pregnant is not only offensive, it’s fundamentally at odds with the values enshrined in the Kansas Constitution.”
The lawsuit says Kansas law “unjustly, discriminatorily and categorically disregards” the clearly expressed end-of-life decisions of pregnant women.
The women plaintiffs asked the district court to “affirm that the protections guaranteed by the Kansas Constitution apply equally to them and ensure that their most personal end-of-life decisions will be respected regardless of their pregnancy status.”
In addition, the petition says the physician plaintiffs were “deeply committed to the foundational medical principle that patients have a fundamental right to determine what treatment they receive, and that providing treatment without a patient’s informed consent violates both medical ethics and the law.”
“Yet, Kansas law compels them to disregard their patients’ clearly expressed end-of-life decisions, forcing them to provide their pregnant patients with a lower standard of care than any of their other patients receive,” the petition said. “It demands this diminished care without offering any clarity on what end-of-life treatment they are required to provide — leaving them to guess at what the law expects while exposing them to civil, criminal and professional consequences for getting it wrong.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/pregnancy-end-of-life-lawsuit-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-30 13:16:33.529064

SPRINGFIELD — A bill that seeks to control the rising cost of prescription drugs while also offering financial help for many small, independent pharmacies in Illinois cleared the state Senate on Thursday and awaits action in the House.

The bill, known as the Prescription Drug Affordability Act, contained in House Bill 1697, would put new regulations and impose new fees on a large but little understood segment of the prescription drug industry — pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs.

“This really restricts the ability of PBMs to extract large amounts of money out of the prescription drug system,” Sen. Dave Koehler, D-Peoria, the bill’s chief Senate sponsor, said in an interview.

PBMs act as a kind of third-party intermediary in the insurance industry who manage prescription drug benefits on behalf of insurance plans. They do that by negotiating prices with drug manufacturers, setting reimbursement rates paid to pharmacies, developing formularies, or “preferred drug lists,” and maintaining pharmacy networks where insured individuals get their prescriptions filled.

But they have also come under criticism in recent years for being too closely integrated with some of the nation’s largest retail pharmacy chains and for helping drive up the cost of prescription drugs, often at the expense of smaller, independent community pharmacies.

“They extract extra profit from patients through opaque and often predatory tactics,” Gov. JB Pritzker said in calling for the legislation during his State of the State address in February. “Not only are they driving up health care costs for Illinois families by hundreds of millions of dollars per year, but they are also putting small, local, independent pharmacies out of business.”

Many large PBMs, such as CVS Caremark, a subsidiary of CVS Health, also either own or are affiliated with large retail chain pharmacies. Critics of their practices argue they use their position to steer patients to their own pharmacies, often to the detriment of smaller, independent pharmacies. That has resulted in what some people call “pharmacy deserts” in many small towns, rural areas and low-income urban communities.

“PBMs routinely reimburse my pharmacy below cost for brand name prescriptions, medications where they're already pocketing massive rebates from drug manufacturers,” David Bagot, an independent pharmacist from Petersburg who is also president of the Illinois Pharmacists Association, told a Senate committee Wednesday. “Meanwhile, they pay their own affiliated pharmacies – including PBM-owned community, mail-order and specialty pharmacies – much higher rates for the same medications.”

The bill would prohibit PBMs from “steering” insured patients to their own affiliated pharmacies, either by requiring them to use a particular pharmacy or by forcing the patient to pay more for their medications if they use a different outlet.

It would also prohibit the practice of “spread pricing,” or charging an insurance plan one price for a given drug while reimbursing pharmacies at a lower rate for that same drug and pocketing the difference.

In addition, the bill calls for levying a fee on PBMs based on the number of patients they insure. Money from that fee would go into a fund for the Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity to award up to $25 million a year in grants to independent pharmacies and pharmacies located in rural counties, medically underserved areas, low-income communities and pharmacies that serve high concentrations of Medicaid patients.

It also would require PBMs to remit all the money they receive in the form of rebates from drug manufacturers to the insurance plan sponsors. And it would require them to disclose to state regulators how much they receive in rebates each year.

Pharmaceutical industry lobbyists argued many provisions of the bill, including the fee levied on PBMs, will actually end up being passed on to insurance plans and consumers, thus resulting in higher prescription drug prices.

“This is not a prescription drug affordability bill,” said Lori Reimers, lobbyist for the Pharmaceutical Care Management Association. “Costs will rise. When you give more money to pharmacies, when you restrict tools that lower cost, the cost of insurance and health plans are going to go up on your constituents.”

Reimers noted that since 2016, Illinois lawmakers have enacted 20 new laws pertaining to PBMs including laws granting the state Department of Insurance regulatory powers over PBMs, all with the intent of bringing down drug prices.

“And I don't think anybody's here saying that drug prices have gotten lower yet,” she said. “But here we are with a much bigger bill.”

The bill passed the Senate with bipartisan support, 56-1. Sen. Dave Syverson, R-Cherry Valley, cast the only no vote.

The language the Senate passed was an amendment to a House bill that originally dealt with training for 911 dispatchers. The bill now goes back to the House for concurrence with the Sente amendments.

Reimers noted that since 2016, Illinois lawmakers have enacted 20 new laws pertaining to PBMs including laws granting the state Department of Insurance regulatory powers over PBMs, all with the intent of bringing down drug prices.

“And I don't think anybody's here saying that drug prices have gotten lower yet,” she said. “But here we are with a much bigger bill.”

The bill passed the Senate with bipartisan support, 56-1. Sen. Dave Syverson, R-Cherry Valley, cast the only no vote.

The language the Senate passed was an amendment to a House bill that originally dealt with training for 911 dispatchers. The bill now goes back to the House for concurrence with the Sente amendments.

In many communities, these initiatives have been credited with saving lives and reducing violence.
But the Trump administration last month abruptly terminated at least 373 public safety grants from the U.S. Department of Justice’s Office of Justice Programs, pulling roughly $500 million in remaining funds across a range of programs, according to a new report by the Council on Criminal Justice, a nonprofit think tank. The cuts come just as summer is approaching — a season when violence consistently peaks.
The grants were initially valued at $820 million, but many were multiyear awards at different stages of rollout, which means some of the money has already been spent.
At least 554 organizations across 48 states are affected by the cuts, many of them small, community-based nonprofits that rely on this money. The rescinded grants supported everything from violence prevention and policing to victim advocacy, reentry services, research, and mental health and substance use treatment. Some of the grants also were cut from state and local government agencies.
Another new report from the Council on Criminal Justice dug deeper into local effects: It found that the Trump administration’s cuts also eliminated 473 minigrants — known as “subawards” — passed from primary recipients to smaller groups that often face challenges accessing federal dollars directly, such as rural government agencies and grassroots nonprofits.
About $5 million of those subawards was intended for state, local and tribal law enforcement agencies working to reduce violence in rural areas, according to the report.
Experts warn the timing couldn’t be worse. The summer months — historically linked to higher rates of violent crimes — are approaching, and the safety net in many cities is fraying. A growing body of research has found a correlation between spikes in temperature and violent crime, with studies suggesting that heat waves and sudden weather swings can inflame tensions and increase aggression.
“These programs are having to cut staff and cut services, and that will be felt in communities in states all over the country at exactly the time when they’re most needed,” said Amy Solomon, a senior fellow at the Council on Criminal Justice and the lead author of the report.
Solomon also previously served as assistant U.S. attorney general in the Biden administration, where she led the Office of Justice Programs — the Justice Department’s largest grantmaking agency.
Many of the primary grants that were terminated contained no references to race, gender or diversity-related language, according to the report — despite claims from federal officials that such criteria were driving the cuts. Primary grant recipients received their funding from the feds directly.
 ‘Wasteful grants’

U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi defended the cuts in a late April post on X, stating that the department has cut “millions of dollars in wasteful grants.” She also signaled that additional cuts may be on the way. In her post, she specifically cited grants that supported LGBTQ+ liaison services in police departments and programs providing gender-affirming care and housing for incarcerated transgender people.
The Department of Justice’s cuts come amid a broader push by the Trump administration and the newly created Department of Government Efficiency to pull funding from a range of federal programs — a move they say is aimed at reducing spending and saving taxpayer dollars.
For some groups, the sudden withdrawal of funds has meant scaling back crime victim services or pulling out of some neighborhoods altogether.
Community violence prevention groups aim to stop shootings and other forms of violence before they happen by working directly with those most at risk. Staff — often with experience in the justice system — mediate conflicts, respond to crises, and connect people to support such as counseling or job training. In some cities, they’re dispatched to high-risk areas to deescalate tensions, often before police arrive.
And research shows that community-level violence prevention programs can contribute to drops in crime.
After a historic surge in homicides in 2020, violent crime in the United States dropped in 2024 to pre-pandemic levels — or even lower — in many cities. Preliminary 2025 data suggests that the downward trend is continuing in major cities, including Baltimore, Houston, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C.
But the progress hasn’t reached every community. Some neighborhoods are still grappling with high rates of gun violence and car theft.
Organizations that faced the toughest financial cuts had been funded through the U.S. Department of Justice’s Community Based Violence Intervention and Prevention Initiative — the federal government’s primary mechanism for supporting this work.
Since the program’s launch in 2022, the federal Office of Justice Programs has invested about $300 million in community violence intervention efforts and related research. But nearly half of that funding has now been wiped out, according to the Council on Criminal Justice report.
“It’s really unprecedented to see these kinds of grants cut midstream,” Solomon told Stateline. “This was an effort that had bipartisan support [in Congress] and in the field all across the country.”
 Impact on communities nationwide

In late April, Aqeela Sherrills received a letter from the federal Justice Department terminating a $3.5 million grant that supported the Community-Based Public Safety Collective. Sherrills is the co-founder and executive director of the national organization, which focuses on community-led approaches to preventing violence, including mediating conflicts, building relationships in high-risk neighborhoods and connecting people to resources such as housing, mental health care and job training.
The letter said the organization’s efforts no longer aligned with the federal Justice Department’s priorities, which include supporting “certain law enforcement operations, combatting violent crime, protecting American children, and supporting American victims of trafficking and sexual assault.”
Until the end of April, the collective had an agreement with the Justice Department to provide training and technical assistance to 95 local groups — including community groups, police departments, city and county governments, and state agencies — that had each been awarded $2 million over three years to run community violence intervention programs.
But after the department cut $3.5 million, the Community-Based Public Safety Collective was forced to lay off 20 staff members.
“Without the significant funding … it destabilizes the organizations. People’s ability to be able to provide for themselves and their family is at risk,” Sherrills said in an interview. “We’re bracing for what could potentially be a high-violence summer.”
The deepest funding cuts hit states led by both Republican and Democratic governors, including California, Florida, Illinois, Kentucky, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Virginia and Washington.
About $145 million in violence intervention funding was rescinded overall, along with an additional $8.6 million for related research and evaluation efforts, according to the Council on Criminal Justice report.
Some of the canceled grants funded studies and research on forensics, policing, corrections issues and behavioral health. Now, those projects may be left unfinished.
Some of the largest losses hit intermediary organizations, such as the Community-Based Public Safety Collective, that support smaller programs by providing microgrants, training and technical assistance.
For organizations such as the Newark Community Street Team in New Jersey, the loss of federal funding has left some areas of the city without coverage.
The funding had allowed staff to monitor neighborhoods and engage directly with community members to prevent violence. That included weekly community walks, where team members connected with victims of crime and people who may have witnessed violence, linking them to resources such as counseling or legal aid. The team also operates a hotline where residents can report crimes or alert staff to tensions that might escalate — allowing the team to step in before violence occurred.
Some of the lost funding also supported school-based initiatives, where mediators helped students resolve conflicts before they escalated into fights or other forms of violence.
Of the 15 Newark positions affected by the cuts, four employees were reassigned to other departments; the others were let go. Some of the team’s staff members are formerly incarcerated, a vital trait that helps them connect with residents and build trust in communities that are often wary of traditional law enforcement.
“We just have to continue working and serving our community the best we can,” said Rey Chavis, the executive director of the street team.
That work appears to be contributing to a decrease in the community’s crime rates.
City crime data from Jan. 1 to April 30, 2025, shows a significant drop in violent crime in Newark compared with the same period in 2024. The total number of violent crimes reported to police fell by 49%, driven largely by a 68% decrease in robberies, according to Stateline’s analysis of the data. Homicides dropped by 53%, while aggravated assaults declined by 43%. Rapes dropped slightly by 3%.

When that same energy is directed toward policy and people, toward justice and equity, history can be made.","Editor’s note: This essay is part of Mississippi Today Ideas, a platform for thoughtful Mississippians to share fact-based ideas about our state’s past, present and future. You can read more about the section here. 

When Mississippi’s own Jamal Roberts captured the crown as American Idol’s newest star, it wasn’t just a personal victory. It was a collective affirmation.
Roberts won with the largest vote total in the show’s history, fueled by millions of votes from fans who believed in his voice. People voted from their phones, laptops and tablets, some casting multiple votes in one night. The results were immediate, visible and powerful.
It was a vivid demonstration of the power of participation. But it also highlighted a profound contrast: in civic life, particularly in Mississippi, voter turnout remains inconsistent — and for many, impossible.
Mississippi still has some of the harshest felony disenfranchisement laws in the nation. People who have served their time remain barred from the ballot box unless they obtain a pardon or have their rights restored through an arduous legislative process that rarely grants relief. According to the Brennan Center for Justice, over 200,000 Mississippians are disenfranchised, and many of them are Black — a legacy of Jim Crow that continues to define who gets to fully participate in democracy.

Roberts’ win demonstrates what’s possible when people are moved to act. Imagine that same energy channeled into local, state and federal elections. Imagine Mississippians casting ballots not only for a singer but for their children’s schools, their community hospitals, their roads, water systems and criminal justice policies.
But unlike reality television, the results of voting in a democracy aren’t immediate. Votes cast in August may not change policies by September. Ballots mailed in November may not yield results until months later. Democracy is not designed for instant gratification. It is designed for lasting transformation. That requires patience, persistence and most importantly, participation.
History is rich with examples of what sustained, organized civic action can accomplish.
Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) began with a single mother whose daughter was killed by a drunk driver. She organized. She lobbied, and she galvanized others into action. Today, thanks to their advocacy, all 50 states have laws that criminalize drunk driving with legal blood alcohol limits, and thousands of lives are saved each year. Change didn’t happen overnight. It happened because people voted, lobbied and stayed engaged.
The Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids launched a decades-long effort to reduce youth smoking. They mobilized parents, teachers, doctors and young people themselves. Through a combination of public education, local ordinances and federal action, youth smoking has declined dramatically in the U.S.
The Fight for $15 movement, led by low-wage workers demanding a livable wage, began with walkouts and was once considered a political longshot. Today, it has reshaped local economies across the country, resulting in minimum wage increases in cities, counties and states, and is influencing federal policy discussions.
These examples all underscore a key truth: showing up to the polls may not produce the kind of instant results seen in a televised competition, but it is a necessary step toward durable change. Policy requires organizing, coalition-building and a long-game mindset. It involves “We the People” and that includes returning citizens, low-income families, rural voters, young people and everyone in between.
Mississippi has a storied history of both voter suppression and voter courage. From Fannie Lou Hamer to the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, the fight to vote has always been met with resistance but also with resilience. Today, that fight continues, especially for those silenced by a criminal legal system designed to exclude.
The good news is that the blueprint is clear. Vote like Jamal Roberts is counting on it. But also vote like your child’s school lunch depends on it. Like your access to clean water depends on it. Like your loved one’s right to return home from prison and fully participate in society depends on it — because it does.
Whether in-person or absentee, whether at the courthouse or by mail, casting a ballot is a statement of presence. Even when the results aren’t immediate, the act itself is cumulative. It builds pressure. It signals demand. It creates momentum.
Let Jamal Roberts’ victory be more than a moment of celebration — let it be a mirror. Mississippians have already proven the ability to mobilize in historic numbers, helping drive more than 26 million votes to secure Roberts’ win. That level of engagement doesn’t belong solely to the world of entertainment. It belongs to democracy. When that same energy is directed toward policy and people, toward justice and equity, history is not just watched — it’s made.
As Mississippi approaches Election Day on Tuesday, the opportunity to act is here. Let this be a fresh start. The same spirit that voted for Jamal Roberts can show up at the ballot box — whether early, absentee or in-person. Let Mississippi once again show up and show out — not just for a voice on stage, but for the voices in our communities who deserve to be heard, counted and valued.

(Photo provided by Volvo Cars)Volvo Cars has halted production at its Lowcountry plant because of a parts shortage, highlighting the growing supply chain issues automakers nationwide are experiencing in the wake of President Donald Trump’s on-again, off-again tariffs.
Volvo, which builds the all-electric EX90 sport-utility vehicle at its $1.2 billion plant in Ridgeville, did not immediately specify the parts involved or say how long the shutdown announced Thursday is expected to last.
The carmaker is working with suppliers to resolve the problem and get the factory off Interstate 26 up and running again, according to news reports.
The shutdown comes on the heels of Volvo announcing layoffs affecting 5% of the plant’s workers, or roughly 100 people, and a global workforce reduction of 3,000 employees, most of them at the automaker’s Sweden headquarters.
The layoffs are part of nearly $2 billion in cost reductions Volvo is undertaking as tariffs have roiled global trade.
The EX90, with a list price of $79,995, is the only vehicle Volvo builds at its South Carolina factory.
The company has said it may add production of other vehicles at the Lowcountry site to offset tariffs on imported vehicles, which make up most of Volvo’s most popular sellers in the United States.
The EX90 is the flagship model in Volvo’s pledge to build an all-electric lineup, but its sales have lagged far behind the brand’s other gas-powered and hybrid models.
Through April, Volvo sold 4,051 EX90s worldwide compared with sales topping 80,293 for its most popular XC60 mid-sized SUV.
All told, EX90 sales have made up about 1.8% of Volvo’s 231,100 global sales through April.

(Photo by Austin Fisher / Source NM)Members of the Legislative Education Study Committee voiced concerns this week about the tight deadline the New Mexico Public Education Department has to meet new court orders in the longstanding lawsuit concerning equitable public education.
The LESC met for the first time during the interim Thursday and received an update on the Yazzie/Martinez lawsuit. Parties in the case returned to court last month to consider a motion of non-compliance filed by the plaintiffs in September 2024. First Judicial District Court Judge Matthew Wilson agreed with the plaintiffs that the PED has not complied with previous court orders and ruled the state needs to produce a plan for providing equitable education for at-risk students and tracking progress.
According to court documents, the PED must identify an outside expert to assist with the development of the plan and file a status report by July 1. A draft plan must be filed with the court by Oct. 1 and a final plan must be available for review by the court by Nov. 3. 
Lawmakers questioned PED representatives about the court order and whether the department will be able to meet Wilson’s timeline.
“We are going to do whatever it takes to meet these deadlines,” PED Sec. Mariana Padilla told committee members. “We are not starting from scratch…we have so much ready to build upon, which is why I feel that this is doable. Is it going to be difficult? Absolutely.”
PED Assistant Secretary of Policy and Technology Greg Frostad told lawmakers that the department is currently working to identify an outside expert “as quickly as possible.”
Rep. Patricia Roybal Caballero (D-Albuquerque) encouraged Padilla to take into consideration the voices of stakeholders from outside the PED, including advocacy organizations and the plaintiffs in the suit. She also asked Padilla to use the plaintiff’s motion as a guide when implementing the plan because it outlined nine primary goals for creating a multicultural and multilingual educational framework; an education workforce; increasing technology access; developing methods of accountability; and strengthening the capacity of the PED.
“We’re too programmed,” Roybal Caballero said during the meeting. “It takes a great deal of resolve…and commitment to say, ‘I’m going to take that bold leap and step outside of what I’m familiar with.’ Trust the experts that come from our state of New Mexico, the experts that have been delivering this core education to our students, despite or in spite of PED, and trust that what they said and stated and presented in the plaintiff’s motion is valuable.”
President Pro Tempore Sen. Mimi Stewart (D-Albuquerque) said she agreed with her colleague’s sentiments, but added that she believes the PED “has stepped up in a huge way” to address the court’s original findings in the suit: that the state was not providing Native students, English language learners, low-income students and students with disabilities equitable education they constitutionally have a right to. 
“I’ll say that I think part of our issue is that we lost our first judge. [The late] Judge [Sarah] Singleton listened to this for years and ruled, and I believe that she kind of understood where the problems were. But she’s no longer with us, and that has, I think, produced all of this lack of focus for all of us,” Stewart said. “I think this is a much bigger picture and I like the idea of an outside expert that will come in and look at everything we’ve done…Because we’ve not been doing nothing; we’ve been doing a lot.”

A Georgia Public Service Commission candidate will remain on the Democratic primary ballot after appealing a decision this week disqualifying him from the race for failing to meet residency requirements.
A Fulton County Superior Court hearing is scheduled for June 10 when Chief Judge Ural Glanville will hear arguments on PSC candidate Daniel Blackman’s appeal. Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger had affirmed a state court judge’s ruling that Blackman was unable to provide evidence that a Fulton County property is his primary domicile.
Blackman is a candidate for District 3, which includes Clayton, DeKalb, and Fulton counties. Commissioners are elected statewide but must be residents of a given district for at least 12 months.
Blackman served as the Environmental Protection Agency’s Southeast regional administrator under the Biden administration, and he’s a former PSC candidate who came close to winning a seat on the commission back in 2020.
Blackman’s lawyer, Matthew Wilson, said Blackman’s name will remain on ballots after Glanville granted an injunction Thursday.
“Once we’re given the opportunity for a fair hearing, I’m confident that Daniel will prevail because all of the facts and all of the law are on his side,” Wilson said Friday.
The complaint against Blackman was filed by Atlanta resident Rodney Stephens, who currently resides in a home previously owned by another Democratic candidate, Keisha Waites, according to online county property records.
Stephens and Waites declined to comment about the residency challenge.
The residency dispute involves a one-bedroom dwelling in Atlanta that Blackman leased on Oct. 4, 2024. Blackman testified that he purchased the property to live closer to work while his wife and children continued to reside in their Forsyth County home north of Atlanta, according to the 12-page ruling.
The state court judge wrote that Blackman failed to provide evidence that he actually lived in the home, such as utility bills or mail being delivered to the Atlanta address.
Early voting for two PSC seats began Tuesday with Blackman’s name on ballots statewide. If Blackman’s ban is permanent, notices will be placed in polling places advising voters of his disqualification and votes cast for him will not be counted, Raffensperger’s office said. Election Day is June 17.
Three other Democrats appear on the District 3 PSC ballot: Waites, a former Atlanta City Council member and ex-state representative; Peter Hubbard, founder of the clean nonprofit Center for Energy Solutions, and Robert Jones, a former utility executive. The winner will face GOP incumbent Fitz Johnson in the Nov. 4 general election. Johnson was appointed to the seat by Gov. Brian Kemp in 2021.
Jones said Friday he would like to see an expedited final decision in the Blackman case so candidates can focus solely on their own campaigns without having to deal with the distraction.
“The appeal filed Wednesday was another surprise in a race that has had too many,” Jones said.

(Photo courtesy of the Thrasher family)Former House Speaker and Florida State University President John Thrasher died Friday, a month after announcing a cancer diagnosis. 
Thrasher was president of FSU from 2014 through 2021, the culmination of a lengthy legislative career that began with him lobbying for the Florida Medical Association and eventually led him to serve in both chambers of the Florida Legislature. 
He served in the Florida Senate, starting in 2009 and leaving in 2014, and in the Florida House for eight years, starting in 1992 and terming out in 2000. Thrasher was speaker of the chamber for his last two years. 
On Aug. 19, FSU’s campus will host Thrasher’s celebration of life in the Ruby Diamond Concert Hall. The family plans a private burial in Orange Park for Thrasher.
“John lived a remarkable life — and he made a big difference in the lives of so many in our state,” Gov. Ron DeSantis posted to X. 
Thrasher was an alumnus of the school he led, earning his bachelor’s and law degrees from FSU. In between the two degrees, he served in the U.S. Army and received two Bronze Stars for his service in Vietnam and the Army Commendation Medal in Germany. 
Florida Board of Governors Vice Chair Alan Levine, who served on the board during Thrasher’s presidency, spoke to Thrasher’s legacy in a text message to the Phoenix.
“Florida lost a giant, today. From his leadership and support of his beloved FSU to every issue important to Florida, John led with integrity,” Levine wrote. “My prayers are with my friends in Tallahassee and with those who’ve known John, because this one hurts, and a lot of good people are in pain today. Rest Peacefully, John. Your work here may be done, but your legacy will never be forgotten.”

The Southern Group, the lobbying firm Thrasher co-founded, announced on April 22 that the former president was receiving treatment for cancer at Tallahassee Memorial Healthcare. 
After retiring as FSU president, Thrasher returned to The Southern Group in 2021 and served on the faculty of the FSU College of Law. 
Thrasher was chair of the Republican Party of Florida for a year in 2010 and 2011. 
“John Thrasher was a mentor, a patriot, and a man of integrity. His faith never wavered, his principles never faltered, and his love for this state was unmatched,” RPOF Chairman Evan Power said in a news release, adding that Thrasher “unified and stabilized” the party during his stint as chairman. 
Thrasher also served on the Clay County School Board and as the first chair of the FSU Board of Trustees. 
“From the battlefields of Vietnam where he returned as a highly decorated officer, to years of honorable service as Speaker of the House, Rules Chair of the Senate, and President of Florida State University, John was regarded by all as a strong, fair leader with unquestionable judgment, timeless principles of honor, and a gentleman all the way through,” Senate President Ben Albritton wrote in a letter Friday to sitting senators, announcing Thrasher’s death.
‘Student success’
FSU credits Thrasher for “substantial investments in student success initiatives,” increased graduate enrollment, and milestones in faculty hiring and research funding. 
Thrasher’s successor at FSU, President Richard McCullough, said he and his wife will “always remember the kindness” Thrasher and his wife, Jean, extended when he became president. “They made it their mission to help us feel at home in Tallahassee,” McCullough wrote in a statement posted to social media.
“John had a remarkable ability to bring people together with his warmth, humor, and unmistakable charm,” McCullough wrote.
Florida Democratic Party Chair Nikki Fried joined the outpouring of condolences on social media. 
“While we cheered for different teams, politically and collegially, he never let that impact our friendship. He was a great leader, true public servant and a terrific human being. RIP,” Fried posted to X. 
Florida Sen. Shevrin Jones called Thrasher “a good one” and “a true statesman, and a good man.”
FSU football alum and Florida Sen. Corey Simon said he is “deeply saddened,” also calling Thrasher “a true statesman.”
“John was a champion for FSU and served Florida and his country with honor. His legacy of service and commitment to education will live on for generations,” U.S. Rep. Jimmy Patronis posted to X. 
“The Lion of the Senate has passed. John Thrasher was a great mentor and friend. He fought the good fight. His legacy will continue on for generations,” Thrasher’s former Senate colleague, Agriculture Commissioner Wilton Simpson, posted to X.

(Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansas House Democrats opened their “fight back” tour Thursday night in the capital city, drawing more than 220 people to sit through rain showers and talk about the importance of strengthening their party’s voice in upcoming elections.
“There’s a lot to lose, so we have a lot to fight for,” said Carla Gardner, of Lawrence, as she waited in line to get into the event. “It’s sad that in 2025 we feel we have to fight back. But a lot of, well, women, potentially, could lose, the LGBTQ+ community, health care, veterans — there are just so many groups, people of color, just all the marginalized groups, that stand to lose a lot more. We have to fight back.”
Linda Manley and Sarah Ruiz, both of Topeka, said they attended the rally because they feel the need to get involved more at the local level after watching national news.
Why did they come listen to Democrats in the rain?
“The chaos in the world and trying to find out what we can do,” Ruiz said.
“Loss of our Constitution, loss of our courts, checks and balances — I know it needs to start locally,” Manley added.
Their words were echoed by many of the House Democrats in attendance, as well as Gov. Laura Kelly, who spoke briefly at the event.
“This was exactly the right response to what happened in November of 2024, in this last legislative session,” she said. “We need to be out there now and forever, leading up to the August 2026 primary when, in addition to electing candidates, we also have to make sure that we defeat that amendment to elect our Supreme Court justices.”
Kelly referred to a proposed constitutional amendment that would put Kansas Supreme Court justices on the ballot, instead of the governor appointing one of three finalists selected by a nonpartisan review panel.
“I don’t know about you, but I have no interest in being like Wisconsin on this where there are millions and millions of dollars coming into that state to sway the one group that is supposed to be impartial and not motivated by political leanings,” the governor said.
Kelly encouraged everyone in attendance to “learn to speak Republican” and talk to people throughout the state.
“Talk about the issues that matter to people, and talk about electing a person, not a party,” she said.

Rep. Susan Ruiz, before the event started, emphasized that same message. The Shawnee Democrat said anyone paying attention to what happened in the Legislature during the recent session should be concerned.
A more collaborative relationship is needed in the Statehouse to push forward things Kansans care about, she said.
“I want to see more Democrats running and winning so that we can have a fighting chance,” she said, referring to the Republicans’ supermajority. “But it would be nice to see some moderate Republicans also win because we can band together. There’s a lot of things that we can do together that would be good for the majority of the people in the state, and not the Koch brothers of the world.”
Rep. Kirk Haskins, a Topeka Democrat, said before speaking at the event that the fight back tour, which will go to at least 11 more stops throughout the state, is important to get messaging out for the Democrats.
“There’s a lot of Kansans that have had their opinion not heard,” he said. “For example, 80% of Kansans want us to see some sort of expansion of Medicaid, but yet it doesn’t come up. We also feel like it’s time for the House Democrats to lead the opportunity for them to be heard, and so we’re traveling across with an agenda purpose to share what’s happening, but also to learn, not just from Democrats, but from all Kansans.”
Haskins said he’s been concerned about how business is being conducted at the Statehouse, and also what is happening at the federal level. Important items are buried in details, for instance. 
“We saw this during the past session many times over,” he said. “Property tax relief started off as something they campaigned on, but then when it came out, they’re making sure that luxury jets get property tax relief.”
The gathering drew former elected officials like Joan Wagnon, who served in the House and as Topeka mayor, along with 13 current representatives and senators, Kansas Board of Education members, Topeka Mayor Michael Padilla and others.
After Kelly spoke, a panel made up of House Minority Leader Brandon Woodard, of Lenexa, and Topeka Reps. Alexis Simmons, John Alcala, and Haskins answered questions from the audience.
Those questions focused primarily on what actions people could take to make a difference, as well as concerns about Medicaid cuts and mental health services.
The panel encouraged people to contact their legislators, to go to their offices and be heard. 
“I’m on my soapbox. Settle in,” Simmons said, drawing laughs. “Y’all know how many races in the state of Kansas, in the state Legislature, are won or lost by only double digits? It’s crazy. There are so many. We just lost a state senator in Leavenworth — he lost by 31 votes.”
Simmons encouraged people to talk to everyone and tell them to vote all the way down the ballot.
“Do not vote only for president. Don’t vote only for Congress. Vote all the way down,” she said.
The next fight back tour events will be in Wichita on June 5 and Newton on June 6. Details are on the House Democrats Facebook page.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/sarah-ruiz-manley-1024x706.jpg,,,2025-05-30 12:18:09.408093

The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found the variant in a sample collected May 15 at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, according to the state Department of Health. As of Thursday morning, that’s been the only case confirmed in Washington, and it’s unclear whether the May 15 case was in a state resident or a visitor.
The case was found through the CDC’s Traveler-based Genomic Surveillance that detects COVID through voluntary nasal swabs and wastewater samples at a number of American airports.
Washington is one of a handful of states where a case has been reported.
As its prevalence has grown quickly around the world, the World Health Organization has designated the new variant, NB.1.8.1, as one “under monitoring.” NB.1.8.1 is fueling a spike in infections and hospitalizations in China, for example.
But the organization believes the variant doesn’t lead to more severe illness than current versions of the virus. Local health officials agree.
“In general, I think that there’s low concern,” said Dr. Herbert Duber, regional medical officer with the state Department of Health. “But I think with any new variants, we really do need to monitor them.”
Current vaccines are expected to remain effective against NB.1.8.1.
But the new variant comes as the Trump administration has shifted vaccination guidelines.
U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced this week that the CDC would no longer recommend the COVID vaccine for healthy children or pregnant women. The Trump administration has also limited eligibility for the vaccine, holding it should only be given to people over 65 or those with risk factors from other medical conditions.
Last week, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said it would require new testing to prove the shots are effective for younger people.
Critics see these moves as unnecessary and dangerous.
Less than one in five Washingtonians received a COVID vaccine booster this season, according to state data.

(Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)When it comes to the Family and Social Services Administration — which oversees Medicaid alongside other state programs like child care subsidies — Gov. Mike Braun “inherited a mess,” FSSA Secretary Mitch Roob said Friday. 
Roob is taking his second turn leading the agency, which has the single largest budget due to its federal funding. Previously, he led FSSA under former Gov. Mitch Daniels. 
Donning his now-standard “Make Medicaid Boring Again” hat, Roob said the state had “no other choice” than to make the program more sustainable and fiscally sound. He spoke at the Indiana Fiscal Policy Institute’s 2025 Policy Summit in Indianapolis. 
“Very few people wear — other than (President) Donald Trump — wear their job description on their hat, but I do,” said Roob. “That is our task for the next four years.”
House GOP overwhelmingly votes to impose Medicaid work requirements

Under Daniels, Roob launched the earliest version of the Healthy Indiana Plan, which covers moderate-to-low-income Hoosiers but has grown since its first iteration. HIP 3.0, on the other hand, would return to its roots and “inject personal responsibility for able-bodied adults again,” Roob said, putting it into alignment with federal discussions on work requirements for the Medicaid program.
Also in his first term, Roob said the agency conducted monthly finance reporting and other fiscal checks to tamp down on spending. He said departing from that norm in subsequent administrations is when the program went awry, pointing specifically to cost growth for applied behavior analysis therapy and attendant care.
The former is a treatment sought by some parents with autistic children while the latter is a program that previously allowed parents to be paid as caregivers for their children with complex medical needs. 
“… that lack of accountability, that lack of paying attention to the dollars is why we had ABA therapy growing at a pace that we did. It’s why we had attendant care growing at the pace that it did,” said Roob. “It’s very difficult to put that genie back in the bottle here because, in both of those cases, we had created, inadvertently, a dependency.” 
He never specifically named former Gov. Eric Holcomb in his criticism.
 Details on health programs

In 2019, Indiana’s Medicaid program spent $120 million on ABA therapy, but the program ballooned to $639 million by 2023. In response, Braun established a panel to consider cost controls earlier this month. 
“If you think this is sustainable, you’re budgeting at the federal level,” quipped Roob. “Because this will bankrupt Indiana.” 
Similarly, attendant care costs for parents of disabled children grew rapidly during that time span. Roob said the agency spent $11 million monthly in July 2020 but the number soared to $84 million each month by May 2024, when the agency diverted parents to a structured family caregiving program that paid at a lower rate. 
Combined, Roob said those numbers contributed to a December 2023 state forecast determining Indiana was $1 billion short in its Medicaid budget. 
Providers, seniors continue to experience challenges under PathWays program

“Many folks look at the Medicaid program and they go, ‘How did you get in debt a billion dollars?’ Well, it’s because you have so many more people receiving care and help. Because we are paying so much more for very discrete parts of the agency,” Roob said. 
Another program that transitioned care for elderly Hoosiers from state oversight to a contract with insurers — known as managed care entities — would “never” be something he would pursue, said Roob. 
“I have been quite clear this program … I never would implement (it),” said Roob. “Because it’s very difficult for managed care companies to manage the care of individuals who are in nursing homes. What is the value?”
Early pitches said the PathWays to Aging program would deliver savings because the state would pay a flat fee for Hoosiers and private companies would manage their care, rather than Indiana paying piecemeal for every cost. However, the transition to get there “is very difficult,” Roob said.
“We have not, today, seen the results that we are hoping for,” said Roob, adding that the state will pay $300 million extra to the companies in cost overruns this year. “… it’s been painful for everybody involved so far and that pain shows signs of easing — but only signs.”
 Other comments

Roob didn’t limit his criticisms of previous administrations solely to health care programs, also saying there was “a lack of planning” when it came to the state’s child care options. Roughly 75,000 children currently receive some form of child care through the agency, an increase initially funded by federal pandemic dollars, Roob said. 
“Their plan was in April of this year simply to take children off of the child care program with no particular warning,” asserted Roob. “Gov. Braun and the legislature felt that was probably not the best answer, so they have allowed us to create a slope to slowly dr0p people from the child care program. 
“That doesn’t minimize the fact that we’re losing over 20,000 daycare slots for the children of men and women who make below 127% of the poverty level,” continued Roob.

Additionally, the “lack of planning and forethought by our predecessors” meant that there would be even fewer options for parents seeking child care for infants or one year olds. 
Part of the problem with Indiana’s Medicaid spending can be attributed to the state’s high health care costs, an explicit priority for Braun. Since his tenure under Daniels, Roob said the disparity between what Hoosiers pay and what they receive has worsened. 
“When Gov. Daniels was in office, I used to tell people that Indiana residents were buying a Cadillac and getting a Chevrolet,” Roob said. “Unfortunately, today, we’re no longer driving Chevrolet. We are driving a used Kia.”

COOK COUNTY — The day before Christmas eve in 2023, Andrew Ciaccio was up all night trying to soothe his stomach pains.

When he woke, he could barely sit up. Something was wrong.

“It was pretty intense,” he recalled. “I was vomiting and really sweating and really feverish and just really in rough shape. [I] couldn’t even put shoes on.”

Panicked, his partner looked up the nearest hospital: Advocate Masonic Hospital.

Once Ciaccio  got to the hospital, a new panic set in. What should he expect to pay for the surgery? Would the medical care be covered by his insurance? He and his partner didn’t get any answers as forms were thrust upon him to sign to get him into an emergency appendectomy, a surgery that removes an inflamed appendix.

He asked multiple people for a good faith estimate but none could provide one.

Months later, he’d become one of hundreds of thousands of Cook County residents buried under medical debt. Ciaccio who earns between 60,000 and 70,000 a year  is slowly paying off the more than $10,000 in medical bills that the hospital has moved to collections. It will take Ciaccio two to three years to pay it off, delaying his goals of saving for retirement and threatening his ability to rent an apartment and buy a car.



[caption id=""attachment_69103"" align=""alignnone"" width=""1024""] After a health care emergency in 2023, Andrew Ciaccio ended up with $10,000 dollars in medical bills. The debt, he says, is impacting his future. (Akilah Townsend for Illinois Answers Project)[/caption]



His debt was not part of Cook County’s medical debt buy program. But with his income level and the amount of his debt, he possibly could have qualified.

Since 2022, Cook County has spent more than $4 million to forgive nearly $500 million worth of medical debt for some 278,000 residents, becoming a pioneer among local governments and garnering waves of positive publicity for their efforts.

But an analysis of Cook County’s debt relief accounts show that many people like Ciaccio saddled with debt should have qualified for free care, a sign that local hospitals are failing to screen for some of the region’s poorest patients even as some use aggressive tactics to collect debt. And commercial insurance companies are shifting more and more costs onto patients, sinking them into debt.

The data from the Cook County Medical Debt Relief Initiative revealed that a significant number of people whose debts were forgiven through the program made less than 200% of the federal poverty level, a threshold that nearly every major hospital system in Cook County accepts for providing free care. Researchers say this indicates a common problem: patients are not getting the charity care they qualify for at hospitals, and health care policy efforts need to shift to make sure financial help is provided much earlier in the billing process.

Undue Medical Debt, the nonprofit contracted with Cook County to negotiate debt buys with health systems and collections agencies, said there are several reasons the majority of accounts forgiven are from people making below 200% of the federal poverty level. Some of it could be inadequate charity care assessment by providers and reluctance by patients to ask for help or fill out paperwork with their financial information, said Eva Stahl, the Vice President of Public Policy and Program Management at Undue Medical Debt.

Patient income data is collected when the debt is bought. That could be years after a health crisis, and the health crisis itself may have sunk some people into a lower income bracket, according to Undue Medical Debt.

Data from three years of the county’s debt relief program also reveals that insurance holders, like Ciaccio, make up the biggest share of debts forgiven, a sign that insurance coverage is often too thin to handle major medical needs.

Daniel Lempert, a spokesperson for Undue, said Medicaid makes up a small portion of the county’s overall debt because the insurance requires little copayment. Medicare requires higher copayment, but not comparable to those required by commercial insurance and plans on the Affordable Care Act marketplace.

One accounting firm analyzed debt from nearly 1,500 hospitals across the country and found that debt from commercial insured accounts increased from 11.1% of total debt in 2018 to 57.6% in 2021.

“Patients are the collateral damage”

Commercial insurance plans have been shifting costs to patients for decades by increasing monthly premiums and making patients pay increasingly bigger shares of hospital bills. That means that more people making middle-class salaries need help paying for medical care.

The hospital and insurance industries have been pointing fingers at each other for years, blaming the other for saddling patients with crippling debt. Hospitals say insurance companies are covering less to pad profit margins and insurance companies say hospitals’ massive bills forced them to shift costs to patients.

“There is this unsustainable lobby in this war back and forth between these two massive entities that make up a double digit chunk of the US economy. These are Goliaths and patients are the collateral damage,” said Eli Rushbank, the director of policy advocacy at Dollar For, a nonprofit helping patients access charity care.

Sarah Panahi, for example, made about $70,000 a year as a grant writer in Chicago when she was hospitalized in 2023, which would disqualify her from almost every financial aid and charity care program.

But she was already under massive debt, from helping her family with rent, groceries and utility bills and after a drunk driver hit her car so badly she needed to buy a new one.

In an unfortunate twist, the stress of her debts triggered a mental health crisis that required a five day stay at the psychiatric wing of a hospital in December of 2023 that she could not afford.

“My insurance, BlueCross BlueShield PPO, I feel like that’s one of the best you can get,” she said. “I just didn’t know the deductible would be so insane,” she said, referring to the nearly $3,000 she owed for the five day stay. Insurance paid about $10,400, but she owed some $2,000 for the deductible, a $200 copay and another $700 in coinsurance, the billing split between patient and insurer.

“I just have anxiety now, like, even more anxiety than before,” she said. “Am I gonna be able to pay this month? Are they gonna come after me?”


EXPLAINER: What is a deductible? Copay? Coinsurance?
▶︎ Deductible is the amount the patient has to pay before insurance pays anything for hospital stays, tests and procedures.

▶︎ Copay is what the patient has to pay each time they go to the doctor and sometimes emergency room.

▶︎ Coinsurance, which is a somewhat more recent development, is the split between what the insurance pays and the patient pays. So if a patient has a 20% coinsurance, they’d have to pay $2,000 of a $10,000 bill in addition to the deductible.

▶︎ Premium is the monthly cost of having insurance.



Panahi recently called the hospital pleading with them, but the most help they could offer was a payment plan, a couple hundred dollars a month for the next few years.

That means she doesn’t go out to eat, can’t go on dates or other social events.

“I can’t remember the last time I bought a latte,” she said.

The whole experience, including a hospital stay that she found unpleasant and traumatic, has made her scared of going back to an emergency room for care.

“I do not want to step foot in the hospital for as long as I can,” she said.

“I’m trying to take as good care of myself as I possibly can. If I have to go to the hospital for any reason, I literally don’t know what I would do.”

The county’s debt relief program, managed by the nonprofit Undue Medical Debt, buys up debt that’s anywhere from 18 months to 7 or more years old. At that point, patients have likely suffered through aggressive collections tactics, experts say.

 “I just have anxiety now, like, even more anxiety than before… Am I gonna be able to pay this month? Are they gonna come after me?” - Sarah Panahi

An Illinois Answers Project analysis of some of Cook County’s largest hospital systems show that many of them use harmful tactics to force payment out of residents, some of whom are among the poorest in the county. Hospitals might deny medically necessary care, put a lien on homes, garnish wages or hire collections agencies that call and text threatening messages regularly.

Since the early 2000s, hospitals, especially nonprofit hospitals that have financial obligations to serve community needs, have come under pressure to reform collections policies as frustrated patients and advocate groups demand change.

Advocate Masonic Hospital where Ciaccio and Panahi were admitted is in the middle of a multi-year effort to scale back harmful collections policy. Last year, Advocate announced it would cancel liens placed on homes and real estate as part of previous efforts to collect on debt. And in 2022, Advocate Health said it would stop reporting debts to credit agencies, make more people eligible for charity care and stop filing lawsuits and seeking liens as part of its collection efforts.

But that’s not what happened for Ciaccio after his health crisis in 2023.

A few months after his procedure, once his bills were overdue, debt collectors threatened to send his bill to the credit agencies, which would have tanked his credit score. He was able to set up a monthly installment plan, but the process took a toll.

“Every time I’d get a letter from them, I’d get this shock or adrenaline or cortisol or just feel fear,” he said. “It’s a scary interaction to have with them because they have all the cards and you’re talking about a lot of money.”

A representative for the hospital did not address the discrepancy but stressed that the hospital is “among the most generous in the country, offering full charity care to patients earning up to 300% of the federal poverty level and significant discounts for many others.”

Relief, but too late

Medical debt relief is still a relatively new concept. Does it work?

That’s what a group of researchers wanted to find out.

Of course, for individuals stressed over debt, the cancellation can be a huge relief.

But one of the first efforts to study the effectiveness of medical debt relief in 2024 revealed that its effectiveness is limited.

Researchers working with Undue Medical Debt found that relief programs are often too late to make a difference.

“We were studying debts forgiven at least a year and a half and sometimes up to seven years after the precipitating event. The debt has already been picked over by debt collectors,” said Neale Mahoney, a Stanford University economics professor and co-author of the study. “People may have already been hardened to the debt collection process. If they get used to ignoring phone calls and letters, they’re outside of the window for follow-up care.”

That’s why charitable organizations and nonprofits can buy older medical debt for a tiny fraction of the original bill: hospitals have largely given up on collecting older debts and efforts to get payments have already done their harm to the patients.

“It’s the result of bad luck, not bad financial behavior, right… You choose to max out your credit card. You choose to buy a car. Most people don’t choose to go to the ER.” - Neale Mahoney, economics professor, Stanford University

“The advice I’ve given to policy makers, local and federal level, is that the research is starting to tell us that we want to pair downstream debt relief with intervention with medical debt closer to the source,” he said.

Undue Medical Debt responded to the study’s conclusions by noting that the organization has made a number of changes since 2018 to 2020, the years researchers examined the group’s impact through buying up debt. Those changes include shifting eligibility to buy debt from higher-income families, erasing debt sooner and supporting financial counseling and insurance coverage navigation to prevent debt.

That could look like improving financial aid provided by hospitals at the front end so that patients won’t have a medical debt burden or other policies aiming to curb harmful collections practices. In the last few years, Undue Medical Debt has been developing a policy advocacy operation to expand its debt relief platform beyond buying up debt.

“They faced some criticism, including from me, saying, focusing entirely on forgiving old medical debt might not really be the solution we think it is,” said Dr. Luke Messac, a doctor and medical debt relief advocate. “It’s really just bailing out debt collectors and hospitals that are particularly unforgiving and doing not as much as we’d hope for the patients.”

One concrete benefit of debt relief, even in the late stages, is that credit scores can go up to allow people to rent better apartments and get better rates for big purchases.

But legislators have also been making changes. In January, an Illinois law went into effect forbidding credit bureaus from factoring in medical debt in credit reports and scores.

That follows a policy shift among three major credit bureaus that erased medical debt under $500 from its reports in 2023.

Medical debt shouldn’t be a measure of a person’s ability to pay back loans because people often don’t choose to need medical care, said Mahoney.

“It’s the result of bad luck, not bad financial behavior, right?” he  said. “You choose to max out your credit card. You choose to buy a car. Most people don’t choose to go to the ER.”

“People are falling through the cracks”

Shepard Searl took a job at Starbucks because they heard the company offered good health insurance.

But as their health deteriorated and monthly health insurance costs went up, it was harder to work the hours needed to cover the cost of managing multiple chronic illnesses.

After a few health emergencies, they went into debt.

“All of these things culminating went from [making debt] something that was manageable to a thing that was suffocating and really dictating every aspect of my life,” they said. “A big chunk of my paycheck was immediately going to paying recurring fees.”

Eventually, Searl had to take a leave of absence from work and their friends set up a GoFundMe to help them pay off medical expenses. Searl now qualifies for Medicaid.

Medicaid is only available to the people making some of the lowest incomes — about $26,650 for a family of three and about $15,650 for an individual. Those who make more, but still qualify for charity care, often slip through the cracks. About 2 in 3 people whose debts were forgiven were making less than 200% of the federal poverty level, or $31,000 a year, the level that would qualify them for these programs and help them avoid medical debt from the outset.

﻿﻿﻿


One study estimates that there’s some $14 billion in undistributed charity care that ends up as debt, according to Dollar For, a nonprofit that helps people claim financial aid and charity care from hospitals.

“One thing to realize is that the system itself is broken,” said Stahl.

“We are going to capture people that have gotten lost and fall through the cracks.”

Dollar For found through a survey that more than half of the people eligible for financial assistance never apply, said Rushbanks. That’s because the majority of those people didn’t know they could get financial help and some were confused by the process.

By 2014, Illinois required every hospital to develop a policy that fast tracks certain groups of vulnerable and low-income patients for charity care without requiring them to apply for aid, including several mandatory categories like homelessness and those eligible for medicaid but uninsured when receiving care.

Hospitals in urban areas are also required to automatically provide aid for people whose incomes are below 200% of the federal poverty level or who are eligible for government assistance.

These policies are meant to prevent people who qualify for charity care from getting saddled with debt because they struggle to navigate the financial help application process. But the policies don’t always work, Rushbanks said.

There’s not always an enforcement mechanism. Sometimes patients are required to provide paperwork and documentation that they don’t end up submitting. Other times hospitals may not have a good system for catching people who fit these categories.

And patients, like Searl and Ciaccio, say hospital staff didn’t talk about financial aid until they explicitly asked them about it.

Prevention, not just relief

Once the debt goes into collections, the repeated texts and calls begin.

For Searl, the debt collector with Evanston Hospital was Harris and Harris.

“They would call multiple times a week, send texts multiple times a week, and email multiple times a week,” Searl recalled. “If I answered, they’d try to get me to pay everything upfront. I would explain that I was on a payment plan but couldn’t keep up with larger bills, and then it would be a back and forth until I got them off the line.”

Endeavor Health, the parent company of Evanston Hospital, said they send statements over the course of 120 days before sending the debt to a collection agency and “ensure interactions are respectful and aligns with our values.”

An Endeavor spokesperson also wrote in an email that the health system “proactively” screens patients for charity care eligibility and provides “free care based on a patient’s income in relation to the federal poverty level.”

Decades ago, hospitals would keep debt records without trying to collect them, said Messac. But several big changes at the federal level, after the creation of Medicaid and Medicare programs in 1965, heavily impacted the industry.

For one, hospitals pulled back on charity care, arguing that the most vulnerable people now have government insurance, he said.

The IRS then changed the standard for nonprofit hospitals – from a model of providing as much charity care as financially possible to a more vague standard of benefiting the community, said Messac.

“But it’s kind of nebulous, and hospitals don’t really lose tax exemption if they don’t do enough,” he said.

And as hospitals grow into billion-dollar regional health systems that compete for market dominance, many turned to aggressively pursuing debt to make up for Medicaid and Medicare, which typically reimburses less than private insurers.

Despite its limitations, Cook County’s debt relief program has multiplied in other parts of the country: more than 20 government medical debt relief programs to be exact, according to Rachel Ruttenberg, deputy chief of staff for the Office of the Cook County Council President.

“We started a bit of a movement,” said Ruttenberg.

But the program alone won’t solve medical debt, she said. The ultimate goal is to have accessible and affordable health care for everyone.

“And it honestly allows us to continue talking about medical debt. We understand that this is not a strategy for solving medical debt, but instead, we want to eliminate as much medical debt as possible while continuing to bring attention to the serious issue of medical debt and just showcase how much of a financial burden it is on people,” said Ruttenberg. “The real fix is to have universal health care coverage in this country.”

There have been pockets of success throughout the country when it comes to debt collection reform.

Los Angeles County followed suit with its own medical debt relief program a few years after Cook County. But they don’t just buy up debt.

The county also requires hospitals to disclose key data regarding financial assistance provided and debt collections efforts, including placing a lien on patient’s property, seizing bank accounts, suing patients, garnishing wages or denying care due to debt.

Messac, a longtime advocate for regulating medical debt, also points to North Carolina as an example of successful government intervention.

There, Gov. Roy Cooper leveraged federal funding in exchange for nearly 100 hospitals wiping out billions of dollars of debt and adopting standards that allow more patients to get financial aid. 

For Cook County, the lesson is likely the need for medical debt prevention in addition to debt relief, which she said is also critical, said Mara Heneghan, the former director of policy at the office of the Cook County president. She was part of the team that worked on the launch of the medical debt relief program.

“Ultimately, it’s unsurprising that it’s more helpful to cancel debt earlier on,” she said.

“We need to think about prevention of medical debt, so we’re not putting people in that position.”

You would immediately pull your children out of daycare and report the whole business to the state. 
Why then, are we allowing firearms to be stored in family childcare homes, which are very similar to in-home daycares, without notice to the caregivers so they can make an informed decision on whether to place their child in this home? This is why I am writing in support of Committee Bill 6180.  

Cassidy Irwin
Firearms in the home are a documented danger to children. Children younger than 5 years old are the second most likely age group to accidentally shoot themselves. Children are naturally curious and do not understand the gravity of playing with firearms. This risk is compounded when children are grouped together in an informal setting like a family childcare home. 
Around half of all accidental firearm deaths of children between 2001 and 2021 occurred in their home, whether by playing with the gun or showing it off to other children. Guns can also accidentally fire when stored improperly, potentially injuring those in the area. Research shows that, while children may be safer when unloaded guns are securely stored with ammunition sheltered separately, children are safest when all firearms are stored outside of the home.  
Dissenters may argue that these regulations encroach upon the homeowner’s privacy and their Second Amendment rights. These concerns have merit but, in policy, a balance must be negotiated between the homeowner’s individual rights and the children’s rights to a safe and secure place of education. I support this law because it ensures that caregivers are not unknowingly placing their children into a dangerous situation that could end their life. Caregivers have a right to know that the safety of their child is prioritized. I also support the subsection that allows the Office of Early Childhood to revoke the license of any business found in violation of this requirement. 
However, my only recommendation would be that firearms should not be stored in a residence that is licensed by the state as a family child care home. I think that the license revocation should also apply if the homeowners do not remove the firearms from the residence. If this cannot be achieved, the caregivers should be given more information as to the state of the firearm storage in the home, rather than simply whether or not firearms are present. Parents would not tolerate the presence of guns in a school or a commercial daycare. The same protections should be extended to licensed family child care homes so that parents can send their children to daycare knowing their safety is ensured.

(Photo by Erik Gunn/Wisconsin Examiner)Roughly 150 nurses and their allies gathered at dusk Thursday for a vigil to show support for the strike underway at Meriter hospital in Madison.
The crowd was smaller than the throngs that have gathered outside the hospital during daily picketing and rallies, but the feelings they conveyed were no less intense.
“We’re holding this vigil because beneath the charts, beneath the chants, beneath the signs and beneath the daily strength that it takes to strike is something deeply serious,” said emergency room nurse Shelby Davis. “We’re not just here for better contracts. We’re here for safety, for dignity, for the basic right to care for our patients without risking their lives or our own.”
With the vigil, organized with the involvement of two church pastors, the nurses and their union sought to cast the issues that led to the five-day walkout as a matter of moral principle.
“You are doing holy work,” said Pastor Justin Dittrich of Lake Edge Lutheran Church, opening the vigil at Brittingham Park on Madison’s near South Side, a block from the hospital grounds.
“The strike is not the end, but the beginning of a more just health care system for all people, workers and participants,”  Dittrich added. “We stand with the nurses of Meriter because they are healers, truth tellers, and agents of faith and justice.”
UnityPoint Health-Meriter and Service Employees International Union (SEIU) Wisconsin are in the midst of negotiations for a new labor agreement for about 1,000 nurses who work at the hospital. The nurses union began a five-day strike Tuesday after a bargaining session May 19 ended without a new agreement, and after the union’s bargaining team said management negotiators were not responding adequately to their concerns about staffing levels, hospital security and compensation.
Negotiations resumed Thursday, during which union bargaining team members reported some progress, and continued on Friday.
Among the union’s primary issues in negotiations has been a demand for specific ratios of nurses to patients.
“Even though I work in the ER and not on the floor, I see how staffing levels affect every part of the hospital,” said Davis. “I’ll never forget the one moment during my nurse residency, a new grad was recognized for taking care of seven patients on their own. Seven. That wasn’t a badge of honor, that was a red flag.”
The hospital management has said dictating ratios would interfere with its need for flexibility to respond to changing conditions.
Speakers said the demand is not just in the interest of nurses, but a matter of concern for patients as well.
“Ratios are for us — yeah, absolutely,” said nurse Dara Pierce. “But they’re also for everybody else and I think sometimes that goes unnoticed.”
The fear of violence in the workplace has driven nurses to demand a stronger role in formulating security policy, speakers said, along with measures such as metal detectors.
“We’ve had violent or unpredictable situations come through our doors with just one security guard assigned to ER and no metal detectors,” said Davis. “No one should have to feel unsafe when they’re coming to a hospital and no nurse should be expected to risk their life just to do their job.”
The lingering impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which began five years ago, continues to weigh on health care workers, nurse Annette Bernas told vigil participants.
“We were considered essential, but let’s be honest, we were expendable,” she said. “We didn’t complain. We showed up. We held hands when family members couldn’t.”
As the pandemic laid bare the importance of health care and health care workers, “we were hopeful that everything we gave would open the eyes of the world to the importance of nurses and support staff,” Bernas said. “But here we find ourselves in a deeper crisis. The burnout is real. Nurses are leaving in waves. PTSD from those years is something we still carry, and yet we’re being asked to do more with less.”
After the speeches the crowd walked behind a large yellow banner, carrying flickering candles from the park to the hospital entrance on Brooks Street.
There Pastor Raymond Monk of Milwaukee offered a benediction. 
“This new course has caused many of you all to make a decision to make sure that your voices are heard and the voices of those who are hurting, their voices are heard also,” said Monk. “I want to encourage you at this pivotal moment in history to continue to defy the norms and to make known to the world that things must change and that things must change right now.”
Faith upholds their cause, he suggested, adding that God “is always on the side of the oppressed.”

Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerThis story, by Report for America corps member Carly Berlin, was produced through a partnership between VTDigger and Vermont Public.A bill that would overhaul Vermont’s response to homelessness is headed to Republican Gov. Phil Scott’s desk, after a largely party-line vote in the House on Thursday evening. Scott and members of his administration have remained mum about whether they support its final iteration. If Scott vetoes the bill, he could effectively kill it. Without a Democratic supermajority, lawmakers are unlikely to have the votes to override.Asked at his weekly press conference whether he would greenlight the legislation, Scott said that he had not yet read the final version of the bill, but indicated that lawmakers “would have had to move a long ways” before gaining his signature. In a separate interview, Department for Children and Families Commissioner Chris Winters said administration officials were still combing through the details.“We’ve started our deep dive to make sure that we understand the full impacts of this bill, and whether it’s possible to make transformational change this year,” Winters said on Thursday afternoon.The bill, H.91, would shift Vermont’s homelessness response system from one centered on state government to one administered by private nonprofit organizations. The change would mark a fundamental pivot in how the state approaches homelessness, which has skyrocketed in Vermont in recent years amid a crushing housing shortage and rising housing costs. The bill dissolves the statewide motel voucher system next July, and hands over funding and decision-making power for emergency shelter to five regional anti-poverty nonprofits and the statewide domestic violence organization. It also gives those groups authority over funds the state currently doles out to build and operate local shelters and run homelessness prevention programs. The state would retain an oversight role.The new regionalized system would be dubbed the Vermont Homeless Emergency Assistance and Responsive Transition to Housing Program, or VHEARTH. Its supporters argue that it would create a more efficient and integrated support system for Vermont’s growing homeless population — and allow the state to stop relying on motel and hotel rooms to shelter the bulk of unhoused Vermonters, an issue that has become a perennial political football at the Statehouse.“I think that this puts Vermont on a path forward that is going to be more focused on prevention, [and] reducing and hopefully eventually eliminating the use of the hotels in favor of shelter and more supportive services,” said Rep. Theresa Wood, D-Waterbury, the bill’s chief architect.Angling for Phil Scott’s signatureScott has long called for the motel voucher program’s pandemic-era expansion to end, and administration officials this year have expressed general support for restructuring the state’s homelessness response system. But they have sparred with lawmakers over key details of the proposed transition. Officials have raised concerns around the ongoing costs of the new initiative, and expressed a desire to speed up the shift of the motel voucher program to the new, localized system.As House and Senate members hashed out their differences over the bill this week, gaining approval from Scott arose as a key concern around the negotiating table. In a bid for his support, lawmakers cut down on a $10 million allocation meant to aid the transition to the regional system by axing $3 million earmarked for shelter development. They also struck provisions that expressed an intent to tie future emergency housing spending to recent years’ budgets, and included language requiring the use of motel rooms to decrease as shelter capacity increases and homelessness numbers drop.Lawmakers also added a provision that “specific elements” of VHEARTH can take effect sooner than planned if state officials and community action agency directors come to an agreement before July of 2026. Some of those directors have balked at the prospect of a faster transition.Winters pointed to some of these changes as positive steps, but did not indicate whether they would be enough to earn Scott’s signature. The administration had wanted lawmakers to add more vetting criteria for people entering the motel program in the coming fiscal year, including verifying their residency in Vermont, their income, and their lack of alternate housing options. Officials also hoped lawmakers would add language allowing them to prioritize the “most vulnerable” clients, rather than relying on a first-come, first-served system.The purpose of those provisions would be to allow the state “to wrangle the [motel voucher program] down to a more manageable size,” Winters said. How quick of a change?The administration had also favored a phased transition to the new regional system, where the motel voucher system would get shifted first, and the funding for local shelter operations would transition in fiscal year 2028. But in a committee of conference, lawmakers aligned the timelines for both transitions to fiscal year 2027, which begins next July.Some directors of local shelters have vehemently opposed transitioning the funding for their work in H.91 at all, arguing that the change could create conflicts of interest in spending decisions, and would destabilize the state’s shelter system at the exact moment federal funding for housing and homelessness programs could disappear.Other critics of the regionalization effort have argued it amounts to an abdication of responsibility by state leaders for Vermont’s worsening homelessness problem.When the Legislature and the administration have placed restrictions on the motel voucher program in recent years — resulting in wave after wave of evictions — “all of our emails light up,” Sen. Ann Cummings, D-Washington, told her colleagues on the floor last week. Her concern, Cummings said, was that by shifting responsibility for emergency housing over to the regional nonprofits, pressure on state officials would wane – and people experiencing homelessness would disappear from public view.“We won’t be the bad guys anymore. The administration won’t be the bad guys,” she said. “It will be very easy for these people to slip under the radar.” (Cummings ultimately voted in favor of the bill).Read the story on VTDigger here:  Phil Scott remains silent on session’s biggest homelessness bill as it heads to his desk.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/housing-conference-1-20250528-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-05-30 12:18:09.408093

John Sauer argued that the Immigration Nationality Act bars judicial review of discretionary decisions, such as what is called humanitarian parole, for the CHNV program.He added that Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem terminated the program because it does not align with the interests of the Trump administration.Liberal justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented.“The Court has plainly botched this assessment today,” Jackson wrote in her dissent. “It undervalues the devastating consequences of allowing the Government to precipitously upend the lives and livelihoods of nearly half a million noncitizens while their legal claims are pending.”She argued that the Trump administration did not prove it would be harmed by the preliminary injunction. An appeals court previously rejected the government’s request to put the lower court’s order on hold.“While it is apparent that the Government seeks a stay to enable it to inflict maximum predecision damage, court-ordered stays exist to minimize—not maximize—harm to litigating parties,” Jackson wrote.President Joe Biden created the CHNV program in 2023. It temporarily granted work permits and allowed thousands of nationals from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela to remain in the country if they were sponsored by someone in the United States and passed a background check.",,,,2025-05-30 12:18:09.408093

AG Tong is pushing back,Associated Press,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/30/ct-sanctuary-jurisdiction-william-tong/,The Trump administration put more than 500 'sanctuary jurisdictions' on notice that it views them as obstructing immigration enforcement.,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Department of Homeland Security is putting more than 500 “sanctuary jurisdictions” across the country on notice that the Trump administration views them as obstructing immigration enforcement as it attempts to increase pressure on communities it believes are standing in the way of the president’s mass deportations agenda.
The department on Thursday published a list of the jurisdictions and said each one will receive formal notification that the government has deemed them noncompliant and if they’re believed to be in violation of any federal criminal statutes. The list was published on the department’s website.
“These sanctuary city politicians are endangering Americans and our law enforcement in order to protect violent criminal illegal aliens,” DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said in a press release.
The Trump administration has repeatedly targeted communities, states and jurisdictions that it says aren’t doing enough to help Immigration and Customs Enforcement as it seeks to make good on President Donald Trump’s campaign promises to remove millions of people in the country illegally.
The list was compiled using a number of factors, including whether the cities or localities identified themselves as sanctuary jurisdictions, how much they complied already with federal officials enforcing immigration laws, if they had restrictions on sharing information with immigration enforcement or had any legal protections for people in the country illegally, according to the department.
Trump signed an executive order on April 28 requiring the secretary of Homeland Security and the attorney general to publish a list of states and local jurisdictions that they considered to be obstructing federal immigration laws. The list is to be regularly updated.
Federal departments and agencies, working with the Office of Management and Budget, would then be tasked with identifying federal grants or contracts with those states or local jurisdictions that the federal government identified as “sanctuary jurisdictions” and suspending or terminating the money, according to the executive order.
If “sanctuary jurisdictions” are notified and the Trump administration determines that they “remain in defiance,” the attorney general and the secretary of Homeland Security are then empowered to pursue whatever “legal remedies and enforcement measures” they consider necessary to make them comply.
There’s no specific or legal definition of what constitutes a “sanctuary jurisdiction.” The term is often used to refer to law enforcement agencies, states or communities that don’t cooperate with immigration enforcement.
Connecticut Attorney General William Tong pushed back after the state was included on the list. He said the label was inaccurate.
“There is nothing in our laws or statutes that says Connecticut is a ‘sanctuary’ state. We are not. That is a meaningless term,” Tong said in a statement Friday. 
“It is the policy of the State of Connecticut to respect, honor and protect immigrants and immigrant families in compliance with the law. Trump’s own administration certified Connecticut’s compliance with 8 U.S.C. § 1373 in 2017. Nothing has changed to alter that certification, other than Trump’s unhinged fixation on defunding and commandeering our police,” Tong said.
ICE enforces immigration laws nationwide, but often seeks state and local help in alerting federal authorities of immigrants wanted for deportation and holding that person until federal officers take custody.
One way that the administration seeks to enlist state and local support is through 287(g) agreements with local law enforcement agencies. Those agreements allow local law enforcement agencies to assume some immigration enforcement duties and greatly expand ICE’s capabilities. The number of those agreements has skyrocketed in just a matter of months under the Trump administration.
ICE has about 6,000 law enforcement officers — a number that has remained largely static for years — who are able to find, arrest and remove immigrants it is targeting. By relying on local law enforcement, it can quickly scale up the number of staff available to help carry out Trump’s mass deportations agenda.
Communities that don’t cooperate with ICE often say they do so because immigrants then feel safer coming forward if they’re a witness to or victim of a crime. And they argue that immigration enforcement is a federal task, and they need to focus their limited dollars on fighting crime.
“Sanctuary policies are legal and make us all safer,” said a coalition of local officials from across the country and a nonprofit called Public Rights Project in a statement Thursday. They said the list was a fear tactic designed to bully local governments into cooperating with ICE.
The Trump administration has already taken a number of steps targeting states and communities that don’t cooperate with ICE — and has met with pushback in the courts. One executive order issued by Trump directs the Attorney General and Homeland Security Secretary to withhold federal money from sanctuary jurisdictions. Another directs federal agencies to ensure that payments to state and local governments do not “abet so-called ‘sanctuary’ policies that seek to shield illegal aliens from deportation.”

Building trades push for data center tax incentives
With Democrats and Republicans at an impasse over an infrastructure spending package, building trade unions are banking on lawmakers extending tax breaks for data centers to spur investment in high-paying construction jobs.
The push comes as President Trump’s federal funding cuts and ongoing trade war, compounded by high interest rates, have soured the economic outlook for construction jobs.
“There’s not a surplus of work right now,” said Richard Kolodziejski, government affairs director for the North Central States Regional Council of Carpenters.
Building one large data center can cost upwards of $1 billion, dwarfing the roughly $700 million bonding bill Minnesota lawmakers could authorize this year to pay for water treatment plants, roads and other infrastructure.
The building trades unions warn that Minnesota will lose jobs to neighboring states if it doesn’t compete on tax breaks to entice tech giants like Amazon and Meta to build data centers. The tax incentives also help justify prevailing wage requirements, which ensures much of the construction will be done by union workers.
But some progressive lawmakers chafe at the idea of giving tax breaks to some of the richest companies in the world while the state stares down a looming budget deficit. They aren’t convinced these projects wouldn’t be built anyways given the state’s cold climate and strong economy.
“I understand not wanting to give tax breaks to the wealthy, but those are the folks creating the jobs,” said Tom Dicklich, executive director of the Minnesota State Building & Construction Trades Council.
One hyperscale data center costing $750 million creates upwards of 1,800 construction jobs and 300 ongoing operational jobs, according to a 2022 report on Wisconsin by Mangum Economics, which has produced similar reports sponsored by tech and energy companies for Virginia and Illinois.
A coalition of building trades unions, energy companies and other businesses cited that report in a letter to lawmakers urging them to extend the sales tax exemption on software, servers and other equipment used to power the data centers.

The growing cost of tax breaks for data centers has vexed public sector unions, who see the lost revenue cutting into funding for the schools, nursing homes and state agencies where their members work.
The public sector unions — SEIU, Education Minnesota, AFSCME, MAPE and Inter Faculty Organization — signed onto a letter opposing an early version of the bill (HF1277) backed by the building trade unions, pointing out that the cost of the sales tax exemption has increased by more than 20-fold since 2018. That cost is expected to continue to rise, reaching $219 million in forgone sales tax revenue on servers, software and other equipment in fiscal year 2029.
It was a rare instance of discord among unions who are typically disciplined about being unified in public, despite their many differences across industries. Member unions of the Minnesota AFL-CIO had signed onto a resolution in support of sales tax exemptions for constructing data centers, but the bill that was introduced in February went further. It extended sales tax exemptions on electricity and allowed data centers to claim the sales tax exemption up front rather than through a rebate, which creates a public record of how much sales tax was lost.
“It would be one thing, if the unions were upfront, that this bill is good for their members … Unfortunately, they want the rest of the Labor Movement to support their lobbying efforts and to call tax cuts for billionaires a ‘pro-labor’ bill. This we cannot do,” SEIU Healthcare Minnesota & Iowa President Jamie Gulley wrote in a post to his members in April, explaining his opposition.
The debate was so contentious, Gulley wrote, that one unnamed trade union to threaten to leave the AFL-CIO.
The building trades counter that data centers add to state coffers through other taxes, including income taxes paid by their members.
“We don’t have line items in the state budget that goes directly to the building trades,” Dicklich said. “Where we can get work, we have to go after that.”
Amazon announced amid the ongoing negotiations at the Legislature that the company is suspending plans for a big data center in Becker, the Star Tribune reported.
Head of violence intervention non-profit charged with wage theft
Bishop Harding Smith, the head of the violence intervention nonprofit Minnesota Acts Now, was charged with felony wage theft and theft by swindle in Hennepin County on Thursday for allegedly shorting workers $150,000 from a county contract.
While wage theft is common, charges are still relatively rare even since Minnesota made it a felony in 2019. The first felony wage theft conviction was handed down just last month to a painting contractor for stealing more than $35,000 in wages from workers on an affordable housing project in Minneapolis.
“Bishop Harding Smith failed to pay his employees what he agreed to as part of the contract with Hennepin County and then lied about it when seeking payroll expense reimbursements,” Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty said in a statement announcing the charges. “As I said when our office secured the state’s first wage theft conviction, this behavior will not be tolerated.”
According to the charging document, Harding signed a contract with Hennepin County in 2021 in which he would be an unpaid volunteer and would pay all other workers $35 an hour. The contract was later updated to increase the contract amount to more than $550,000 and provide Harding with a $35 an hour wage. Investigators found most employees were paid $20 an hour even though he billed the county as if they were paid $35 an hour.
Harding admitted to investigators that he did not pay workers what they were entitled to but denied fraudulent intent, according to the complaint.
Trump flips on Nippon deal with U.S. Steel
In a rare instance of unanimity on the campaign trail last year, both Kamala Harris and Donald Trump opposed Japanese-owned Nippon’s $14.1 billion bid to purchase U.S. Steel.
The politics were simple: The United Steelworkers, representing tens of thousands of workers in purple states like Pennsylvania, fiercely opposed the deal. And in a campaign fought over blue collar workers, supporting a foreign company taking over an icon of American industry would have been unthinkable.
Now back in the Oval Office, President Trump has seemingly flipped on his opposition to the deal, writing on his social media platform last Friday that there will be a “planned partnership” between the two steel giants
Trump said U.S. Steel would remain in America with its headquarters in Pittsburgh, and the deal would create 70,000 jobs. It’s unclear how a “planned partnership” would be different than a buyout, and as The American Prospect noted, the U.S. Steel website describes the deal as a merger.
United Steelworkers President Dave McCall sent a letter to members, which include 3,500 workers in Minnesota, reiterating his concerns.
“Throughout recent months, as the public conversation has turned to Nippon ‘investing’ in U.S. Steel or ‘partnering with’ U.S. Steel, Nippon has maintained consistently that it would only invest in U.S. Steel’s facilities if it owned the company outright. We’ve seen nothing in the reporting over the past few days suggesting that Nippon has walked back from this position,” he wrote.
Planned Parenthood lays off 66 across Minnesota and Iowa

Federal funding cuts are forcing Planned Parenthood North Central States to close eight clinics across Minnesota and Iowa this summer, laying off 66 workers and reassigning three dozen more.
The health system, which is the main abortion provider in Minnesota, announced the closures last week, blaming a $2.8 million freeze in Title X funding in Minnesota that supports sexual and reproductive health. The organization also cited the near total abortion ban in Iowa following the Supreme Court’s overturning of Roe v. Wade and House Republicans’ “big beautiful bill,” which defunds Planned Parenthood and makes cuts to Medicaid, which subsidizes care for more than 30% of its patients.
More than 400 workers at the Planned Parenthood affiliate, which covers Minnesota, Iowa, Nebraska and the Dakotas, unionized with SEIU Healthcare Minnesota & Iowa in 2022 and ratified their first labor contract last year.
Megan Amato, a longtime licensed practical nurse in Iowa and Nebraska, said she was devastated by the news in a statement shared by the union.
“When I started 18 years ago, we had 17 clinics in Iowa. After these closures we will be down to two,” Amato said. “I am the only person who does my job in the whole state and I worry about what that means for the future of abortion care in Iowa.”
None of the clinics slated to close in Minnesota provide abortion care, but do provide birth control, education and other health care services. PPNCS said it will continue investing in telemedicine to serve patients, which includes medication abortion for patients with a Minnesota address.
Lawsuit challenging nursing home holiday pay dismissed
In a victory for Minnesota’s new Nursing Home Workforce Standards Board, a federal judge dismissed a lawsuit brought by two industry groups challenging the board’s authority to mandate that nursing homes pay workers time-and-a-half on 11 holidays.
The lawsuit was the first legal challenge to the board since the Legislature created it in 2023 to set minimum pay and working standards for nursing home workers across the state.
Trade war shakes global jobs outlook
The International Labour Organization cut its global employment forecast by 7 million jobs as President Trump’s trade war roils the world economy. The United Nations agency previously projected the world would add 60 million jobs in 2025, revising it down to 53 million jobs this week.
According to the report, nearly 84 million jobs across 71 countries are directly or indirectly tied to consumer demand in the United States, which is being throttled by uncertainty and higher prices from Trump’s tariffs. A federal appeals court on Thursday reinstated Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs after the U.S. Court of International Trade paused them on Wednesday.
The International Labour Organization also reported that the share of the world’s gross domestic product going to workers globally ticked down over the past decade from 53% to 52.4%. In other words, less of the world’s income is going to the workers generating that income by creating goods and providing services. While the decline is slight, the International Labour Organization estimates it works out to about $290 less per worker in 2024 purchasing power.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/MG_1065-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-30 12:18:09.408093

But that punishment doesn’t mean those involved with Robertsville-manufacturer Delta Extraction are out of the Missouri marijuana industry. 
In fact, long after the state initially stripped Delta Extraction of its license in November 2023, regulators approved one of the company’s co-owners — AJO LLC — to take over a cultivation and manufacturing facility in Waynesville in May 2024. It’s a far bigger operation than Delta Extraction, and it also involves several dispensaries as well.
AJO LLC says it was only a passive investor in Delta Extraction, where it owns 50%. The company claims it bought 50% of the Waynesville facility in 2022 and has been running it while awaiting approval of the license transfer last year.
But now Delta’s license revocation is the center of a lawsuit playing out in St. Louis courts between a complex web of shareholders seeking to snatch back ownership of the Waynesville facility from AJO.
They argue the state shouldn’t have given its final approval for the ownership change because of AJO’s involvement in a company that had a marijuana license revoked. 
Lisa Cox, spokeswoman for the department that oversees the Missouri Division of Cannabis Regulation, said the constitution does allow regulators “to deny approval for ownership changes if approval is not ‘unreasonably withheld.’” 
However, in May 2024, Cox said Delta’s appeal of its license revocation was still pending. The final verdict didn’t come down until nine months later. 
“The totality of the circumstances at the time, including the nature of the ownership change, was not sufficient cause to deny the change,” Cox said.
Cox also said the state’s administrative rules – which the division drafts to interpret the constitution’s intent and that take months to pass – currently do not prohibit individuals who have had a license revoked from acquiring another license. 
The division, Cox said, is “reviewing its rules to add further detail to this authority.” 
 Agent ID revocations

 (Rebecca Rivas/Missouri Independent).
A scathing 137-page decision issued in February by the Administrative Hearing Commission denying Delta’s appeal of its revoked license concluded the company had a “corporate culture of lax compliance with regulatory requirements.”
Regulators are permitted to revoke agent ID cards for individuals who violate the rules. No one without an agent ID can access a marijuana facility without supervision of someone with a card, though you don’t need one to own or run facilities. 
Within weeks of the Administrative Hearing Commission’s February decision, Cox said the state “revoked several agent IDs for involvement in rule violations associated with Delta Extraction.” 
In March, cannabis regulators issued AJO principal Josh Corson a notice of pending revocation of his agent ID card, according to documents The Independent obtained through Missouri’s Sunshine Law. 
The notice stated that as an owner and manager of Delta Extraction, he was responsible for 17 cited rule violations, including “manufacturing and selling bulk distillate in a false or misleading manner due to the failure to disclose that the distillate contained large quantities of unregulated cannabis.” 
Corson surrendered his agent ID license shortly after receiving the notice, and the other two AJO owners — Ryan Rich and Josh Ferguson — have let their agent IDs expire, Cox said. 
Cannabis regulators revoked the agent ID cards of four of Delta’s contractors as well. 
AJO has been helping run the Waynesville operation since 2022 with Hi-Rise LLC, which is the other 50% owner. Hi-Rise has no ownership interest in Delta Extraction. 
Peter Barden, a spokesman for AJO and Hi-Rise, said the companies “provided complete information” about the owners to the state for the license transfer.
In response to Corson’s agent ID revocation, Barden said AJO “was not managing the Delta Extraction facility. It was a passive investor, and no action of AJO has ever been the basis of any revocation.”
Yet pages of evidence in the Delta Extraction case – including emails, depositions and testimonies from high-level employees – appear to demonstrate AJO was fully involved in Delta’s operations and even initiated the arrangement that led to their revocation.
Barden said AJO “certainly monitors its investments but has not actively managed any manufacturing or cultivation license.” 
 AJO’s lawsuit

 Carnahan Courthouse in downtown St. Louis (Clara Bates/Missouri Independent).
Charles Pullium stood before a St. Louis judge in February in an emergency hearing, anxious to share what he believed would be a smoking-gun update in his lawsuit.
It was just days after Delta Extraction had lost its appeal seeking to get its license to manufacture marijuana products reinstated. 
Pullium is an attorney representing a group hoping to wrestle the Waynesville manufacturing and cultivation license away from AJO and Hi-Rise. 
If Delta Extraction violated state law to the point where its license was revoked, Pullium argued, its leadership shouldn’t have won state approval to operate a different cannabis facility.
“It’s a huge case because it involves the revocation of a license,” Pullium told St. Louis Judge Joan Moriarty at the February hearing. “And why it’s important in this case is because when people apply for a new change of ownership… they have to answer, ‘Have any of you or your owners or anyone had a license revoked or suspended?’”
Pullium argued the Delta revocation was key to settling a three-year legal ownership battle, which ended up in St. Louis court in 2023 when AJO and Hi-Rise filed a lawsuit. 
On one side of the legal battle are AJO and Hi-Rise.
On the other side are 19 named individuals and marijuana companies connected to the deal, including St. Louis-based marijuana company Heya, former Missouri House Speaker Carl Bearden and Delphi Management LLC. They argue the 2022 sale to AJO and Hi-Rise was invalid.
Moriarty disagreed the new information was worth holding an emergency hearing for and made Pullium’s client pay $3,037.50 in attorney fees for AJO and Hi-Rise, which are represented by Dowd Bennett law firm. 
The lawsuit is ongoing.
In January, Scott Sterling, who is involved in the tangled ownership web, filed two complaints with the Division of Cannabis Regulation, alleging that AJO did not provide all the information necessary for the transfer. 
One crucial detail left out, Sterling contends, is that he never signed off on any sale as a 40% owner.
The division has opened an investigation into Sterling’s complaint, Cox said, and it is ongoing. 
Barden said the Waynesville location is legally owned by AJO and Hi-Rise and “current ownership has never had a license revoked.” 
 ‘…a made for T.V. drama’

One of Pullium’s motions in January returned the spotlight to Jason Sparks, one of Delta Extraction’s contractors.
“The facts underlying the Delta scandal read like a made for T.V. drama,” the motion states, “a prior felon… buys out-of-state products from a nameless and unknown ‘network’… which he then illegally turns into uncertified product which he then sells to a complicit Delta, who then illegally sells to unsuspecting dispensaries…”
Sparks was among the four contractors that had their agent IDs revoked in March, and he has a disqualifying felony on his record that was overlooked by the state when he obtained that ID. However, Sparks directs the blame largely at Corson in legal filings in his company SND Leasing’s lawsuit against Delta Extraction. 
In the spring of 2023, the supply for marijuana distillate was low across the state and Delta hired Sparks to make large amounts of distillate that Delta sold to about 100 other Missouri manufacturers. Those manufacturers went on to produce gummies and vapes for their brands, which is why the product recall was so widespread.
At issue was what’s in the distillate. 
Sparks extracted a small amount of THC from Missouri-grown marijuana, which the state heavily regulates. Then he added a large amount of THC oil that was extracted from hemp, a product that is completely unregulated.
Regulators pulled 60,000 products off the shelves in August 2023, arguing the use of out-of-state, unregulated THC oil violated state law and posed a public health risk. 
Corson was “the person who found the supply for the distillate,” a January motion in Sparks’ lawsuit states, and he was the one who signed the contracts. 
In his lawsuit, Sparks points to the testimony from Delta’s COO Rachel Herndon Dunn during an Administrative Hearing Commission hearing in March 2024. Dunn testified that Corson reached out to a large cannabinoid-producing facility in Florida to obtain the hemp-derived THC oil needed to make their recalled distillate.
“Corson went down to tour their labs in Ft. Lauderdale…” Dunn said during the hearing. 
Sparks claims Delta leadership reassured him that cannabis regulators signed off on the extraction process. 
“The reality is that (the state) never gave assurances of regulatory compliance,” the suit states. 
Delta argued hemp is not a federally controlled substance and the state has no authority to regulate hemp-derived THC products — an argument they lost in their appeal. Also, the products went through a final round of testing before they hit the shelves, Delta noted, so they didn’t pose a health risk.
Despite the ownership connection to Delta, state regulators told The Independent they’ve found no evidence of similar practices taking place at the Waynesville facility.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_5927-4-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-30 11:09:26.607447

Lundegan, who will formally unveil the plans June 3, wants to replicate the Garden of Gethsemane near Jerusalem where the New Testament says Jesus prayed the night before his crucifixion.
Lundergan has commissioned a sculptor in Italy to create life-size bronze statues of Christ and the main characters in the 14 Stations of the Cross, representations of events in the Passion of Jesus Christ, from his condemnation to burial.
A 70-foot cross, equivalent to a seven-story building, will tower nearby. It will be positioned to reflect sun rays during the Easter season onto Station 12, depicting Jesus dying on the cross.
Excavations are underway for the spectacular religious display in front of the Saint Patrick Cemetery in Washington on U.S. 68 about five miles south of the Ohio River. It will include a visitor’s center.

Asked how much the project will cost, Lundergan said it is privately funded by the Lundergan family and receives no tax dollars. “This is a way for my family to do something to show our love for the church and community that mean so much to us.”
Lundergan said that the price of admission will be minimal if any —  in contrast to other religious attractions —  the Creation Museum and Ark Encounter — in Northern Kentucky. Visitors may leave donations, which will be used to maintain the garden and support St. Patrick Church and school in Maysville, Lundergan said.
Family venture
Lundergan grew up, was baptized and married in St. Patrick Church. He attended St. Patrick School. He will be buried someday at St. Patrick Cemetery along with his wife, Charlotte Lundergan. 
Actress and singer Rosemary Clooney, who was born on Front Street in Maysville in 1928 and died in 2002, is buried there. She was the aunt of international movie star George Clooney.

The historic cemetery includes the tombstones of early immigrants from Ireland. 
The bishop of Covington, the Rev. John Curtis Iffert, has leased land to Lundergan, who will give the entire garden to St. Patrick Church once it is completed.
Lundergan, 78, owns several companies in Lexington in the food services and  hospitality industry and emergency disaster services. 
Lundy’s Catering provided food services at the Woodstock revival, the Kentucky Derby, Indianapolis 500, Pope John Paul II’s celebration of mass with 350,000 in San Antonio in 1987, and presidential inaugurations for Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama. The Lundergans are close friends to former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
President Joe Biden pardoned Lundergan earlier this year for his conviction on federal campaign finance charges involving unreported donations to the 2014 U.S. Senate campaign of his daughter, Alison Lundergan Grimes. Lundergan served time in prison and a halfway house.
Lundergan emphasizes that the garden project is a family venture. Charlotte and he have five daughters and 10 grandchildren.  
To launch planning for the garden project, Lundergan contacted Betty Vento of Mentor, Ohio, an expert on religious statues. She and her husband run Mosack’s, a Christian gifts and book store.
Capturing the ‘spirit of Gethsemane’
“I think this is a fabulous project, nothing like it, I believe, in the United States with bronze statues,” said Vento.  “I understand there is a Stations of the Cross garden in Puerto Rico but it is circular. This one will be on a pathway.”
She said Lundergan called her almost five years ago to pursue the project. “We have moved forward with it and are very excited about it.”

Lundergan commissioned bronze statues by sculptor Reto Demetz. His family business, the Demetz Art Studio, is one of the world’s leaders in producing ecclesiastical art. The studio is located in Ortisei, a small village in Val Gardena, nestled in the Dolomites, the famous mountain range in the heart of the Italian Alps. The studio was founded in 1872.
During the last decades, it has reached worldwide fame for its modern religious sculptures as well as its traditional artworks.
Lexington landscape architect John Carman, of the firm CARMAN, said that when Lundergan first called he was not sure he would have the time to devote to designing the garden. “But it is such a wonderful project, quite unique, I am Catholic, so I was all in,” he said. He worked a year on the design.
Carman said the garden will be a replica of Gethsemane. “The real garden is in a different part of the world, with olive trees. Olive trees do not grow well here.” But visitors “will see a beautiful garden with a lot of flowers and shrubs, some trees, that will capture the spirit of Gethsemane.”
A public groundbreaking ceremony for the project is scheduled for 11 a.m. Tuesday, June 3, at the site. Christian ministers in Mason County have been invited to attend.
The target date for completion of the project is Easter Sunday, April 5, 2026.
A celebration Mass will be held at the church the Thursday before Easter. A Good Friday program will be held at the stations and an Easter sunrise service will offer praise at the garden.

The special screening of the blockbuster horror film included an appearance by Director Ryan Coogler and was made possible by a community petition.
“I have family from Mississippi — my uncle, my grandfather — and I had never been until working on this script,” Coogler said, addressing the crowd. “It really changed me, just to come here.”
The movie, starring Michael B. Jordan as twins, is about two brothers coming home to Mississippi to launch a juke joint. It’s also a supernatural vampire flick that blends elements of drama, action and music.
“Sinners” composer Ludwig Göransson, actor Miles Canton and others who worked on the film also attended the screening.
“Anytime that filmmakers take the time out to pay homage to the Delta, especially, because we’re the root of music, the blues culture, that means a lot,” said Brandice Brown Williams, a theater teacher who brought two of her students to the screening.
The film is set in 1930s Clarksdale, Mississippi, but current day Clarksdale doesn’t have a movie theater, making it difficult for people to see the film about their hometown. Community organizers decided to change that, starting a petition to invite the cast and crew to Clarksdale and to collaborate on hosting a public screening.
“The love you have for Southern folk, Mississippians and Clarksdale came to life through your commitment to writing us right,” community organizer Tyler Yarbrough said. “We are ready. We are waiting. And we would be proud to welcome you back to where it all began.”
During the screening, the crowd was expressive — in response to various scenes, they gasped, laughed and cheered. Afterward, Coogler and others stayed for a Q&A.
One attendee, Cindy Hurst, praised the film, calling it a “really good visual representation of the beauty of the Black culture.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/30095441/AP25149760873214.jpg,,,2025-05-30 11:09:26.607447

(Kentucky Lantern photo by McKenna Horsley)A long time Eastern Kentucky Democrat has announced she is joining the Republican Party. 
Sen. Robin Webb, a Carter County state lawmaker who has served in the state legislature since 1999, was one of two Democrats left in the statehouse representing parts of Eastern Kentucky. The region was once a Democratic stronghold, turning to a Republican area over the last couple of decades. 
She and other Republicans said it was a sign that the Democratic Party isn’t what it once was. 
In a press release from the Republican Party of Kentucky, Webb said that she didn’t leave the Democratic Party, but “the party left me.” She added that her core values have not changed, just “the letter next to my name” and she will continue to focus on issues in rural Kentucky. 
“The Kentucky Democratic Party has increasingly alienated lifelong rural Democrats like myself by failing to support the issues that matter most to rural Kentuckians,” Webb said. “First and foremost, I’m a mother, a rancher, and a lawyer with deep personal and  professional roots in Kentucky’s coal country. As the Democratic party continues its  lurch to the left and its hyperfocus on policies that hurt workforce and economic development in my region, I no longer feel it represents my values. It has become untenable and counterproductive to the best interests of my constituents for me to remain a Democrat.”
Webb thanked Republican Senate President Robert Stivers, other colleagues in the General Assembly and RPK for “the warm welcome.” She said she looks “forward to continuing to focus on sound policy with rural Kentucky’s best interests in mind.”
Webb was elected to the state Senate in 2009 after serving in the House for a decade, making her one of the current longest serving members of the General Assembly. Her district includes the northeastern Kentucky counties of Boyd, Carter, Greenup and Lewis. 
With Webb’s switch, Democrats’ superminority in the Senate dwindles to six members. Republicans now have 32 seats in the chamber. She was often seen as the caucus’ more conservative member, sometimes voting with Republicans on culture war issues, like this year’s bill to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives in public Kentucky universities. 
Webb was also recently appointed by Stivers as the Senate co-chair of the Disaster Prevention and Resiliency Task Force, which will meet during the interim session. She sponsored a resolution to establish the panel. 
Webb also often worked across the aisle to get legislation she supported past, particularly on agriculture and rural policies. Earlier this year, one of her bills gained passage in both the Republican-controlled Senate and House. Signed into law by Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear, the bill established new allied animal health professional licenses for equine dentistry and animal chiropractic practice.
Rep. Patrick Flannery, an Olive Hill Republican who represents Webb’s home county in the House, said in the press release that the party switch makes sense for Webb and her constituents. 
“Robin and I have always had an excellent working relationship,” Flannery said. “She has served as a mentor to me and many others. We represent the same constituency, and she’s making the same decision that many of our people have already made by changing her registration.
Other Kentucky Republican leaders praised Webb for joining the party. RPK Chairman Robert J. Benvenuti III said in a statement that he met Webb when he was a state representative. 
“I always respected that she approached issues in a very thoughtful and commonsense manner, and that she never failed to keenly focus on what was best for her constituents. It is my pleasure to welcome Sen. Robin Webb to the Republican Party,” he said. “Like countless other Kentuckians, she has recognized that the policies and objectives of today’s Democratic Party are simply not what they once were, and do not align with the vast majority of Kentuckians.” 
Kentucky’s Republican National Committeeman John McCarthy and RNC Co-chair KC Crobsie, of Kentucky, also welcome Webb to the party’s ranks. 
In the statehouse, the lone Democrat in the mountains left is Rep. Ashley Tackett Laferty, of Martin.
Webb can seek election again in 2026. She had no opponents in the 2022 election.

On any given night, its rooms are filled with artists, dancers and creatives who have come to build community and hone their crafts. 
This is the home of the Briarwood Arts Center, the creation of Stephen Brown, also known as the hip-hop artist, producer and DJ 5th Child.
“During the pandemic, there was this unhoused population that had an encampment in front of the building, and the gas station next door had become a dumping site. There were huge piles of trash and tires and all sorts of stuff,” Brown said. “It was really frustrating seeing that as I pulled into my neighborhood after a long day of work.”
The building had been abandoned since he moved into the neighborhood in 2017. It was the remnants of an abortion clinic, turned daycare center, turned 3,500 square feet of deserted possibility. A property management company with property close by eventually bought and leased the building in the summer of 2022.
“When this opportunity presented itself, I knew that it had to be comprehensive,” Brown said. “It wasn’t gonna be just like one type of art. It’s not Stephen Brown Art Center or 5th Child Art Center. This is Briarwood Arts Center. It’s not about one person, but it’s about the community.”
Brown aimed to fill a void in the local arts scene. Popular hangouts like The Flamingo, a collective space and venue in Fondren, had closed, and there weren’t many places around for people who were into the alternative arts and music culture.
“I wanted to create something where we own it, within the artist community, that nobody could just take from us or remove us from or anything like that,” he said. “I didn’t know how that was going to happen, I just knew that it needed to happen even if I wasn’t the person to do it.”
He secured the keys later that fall, and soon after hosted an open-house, gathering ideas for what community members wanted to see. That culminated into stacked programming, with a calendar flush with events such as line dancing classes, Kuumba (Swahili for creativity) Youth Night, GoodEDvice ACT Prep Club and Crochet Circle. Most of the events at the Briarwood Arts Center are free.
“The work that we’re doing here, we can find other ways to make money, but I don’t wanna make money on the backs of the community members,” he said. “I don’t wanna price them out of these enriching experiences, so that’s why the stuff that we do is free.”

Each room at the center is designed with the artist in mind. There’s the Craft Kitchen, where visitors can develop their crafting skills, practice using a Cricut machine and learn how to sew their own projects. In the Ubuntu room, dancers learn movement through music, and community members can brush up on their self-defense skills. There’s also Cole’s House II, a music lab, and The Branding Lab is complete with a green screen and backdrops for photography practice.
“The space is really designed for folks who are still trying to figure it out, who have the genuine curiosity about something that they’re like, ‘What if I don’t get it right? What if it’s not perfect?’ Well, come here and screw up,” he said. “Come here and make all your mistakes so that you can fine tune it and take it to a bigger, nicer, fancier venue down the line.”
Brown hopes that his persistence and dedication to creating safe spaces inspires others in Jackson to imagine what’s possible for their neighborhoods.
“What I want is for someone in Shady Oaks to be like, ‘Oh man, we got an abandoned building right here in our neighborhood too. Let’s put our money together and start the Shady Oaks Art Center.’ Or somebody in Alta Woods or in Virden Addition to say, ‘Hey man, we got this abandoned building. How about we start the Alta Woods Art Center?’”
Briarwood Arts Center will hold events for 601 JXN Day, which is an annual weekend long celebration of the city coordinated by Visit Jackson. Residents can participate in the Briarwood Unity 2K, as well as a community clean-up. The center will also host the Siegel Select Block Party, a service program where volunteers will collect donations and supplies for residents who stay in the hotel, which is right next to the arts center’s parking lot. 
“There’s no fee to register, but this is more about a demonstration of establishing that camaraderie and dignity for the Briarwood neighborhood,” he said. “Before Fondren was Fondren, somebody had to care enough. Before Belhaven was Belhaven, somebody had to be the squeaky wheel.”
Brown sees the space he cultivated as one that reaches across generations. He said he’s seen visitors at Briarwood Arts Center from ages 6 to 94.
“It’s not just about the technical skill of sewing a stitch, but they’re talking about history. They’re talking about legacy. They’re talking about family tradition and all that stuff is being passed down through the arts,” he said. “The arts are a vehicle to bring these people together. Arts have always been, not only a time capsule, but also a means of resistance. They’ve been a blueprint for resistance.”

More legislatures in Republican-led states are passing paid parental leave for public employees. (Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images)More Republican-led states are giving paid parental leave to public school teachers and other state employees, signaling a broader acceptance of family-friendly workplace policies once championed primarily by Democrats.
“All of these red states, I think we’re late to the party,” said South Carolina state Rep. Beth Bernstein, a Democrat who sponsored a bill this year to increase state employees’ paid parental leave from six to 12 weeks. It passed the majority-Republican South Carolina House in April with strong bipartisan support.
This year, Alabama, Iowa and Mississippi joined 37 other states in granting paid parental leave to thousands of state workers.
The trend has gathered steam in recent years. Some experts link it to the cascade of state abortion bans that followed the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2022 Dobbs decision, which dismantled the federal right to abortion. Under fire from critics to do more to care for babies once they’re born, at least a dozen conservative-led states with abortion bans have since granted or expanded paid parental leave for their state employees.
But others say the increasing bipartisan support for measures that help working parents is also a reaction to economic realities.
“What we’ve seen, especially in more conservative states, is the public sector has experienced a lot of turnover,” said Kameron Dawson, legal director of the Southern Office of A Better Balance, a legal organization focused on workplace rights. “They’re looking for tools to recruit younger employees.”
Paid parental leave is the time off granted to workers for the birth or adoption of a baby, to care for a child, or to recover from a stillbirth or miscarriage. Without it, employees are left to cobble together their sick leave and vacation leave — or go unpaid — to stay home with a child and heal.










We’re trying to attract and retain state employees and teachers, and we’re in competition with everyone around us, and the private sector as well.


– Alabama Republican state Rep. Ginny Shaver


Alabama Republican state Rep. Ginny Shaver watched her daughter, a public school teacher, struggle to get the leave she needed after the births of her children in recent years.
“With her second, she had complications in her pregnancy and used up her [paid vacation and sick] leave before she even had the baby,” Shaver told Stateline. Her daughter contracted COVID-19, and the baby had to spend time in neonatal intensive care. “It was a very difficult time, and she had to take unpaid leave.”
Last year, Shaver and Democratic state Sen. Vivian Figures worked to win approval of a paid parental leave bill for state employees. It failed.
But they tried again this year. With the support of Republican Gov. Kay Ivey, the state legislature — which has a Republican supermajority — passed it nearly unanimously. The new law gives female state employees, including teachers, eight weeks of paid parental leave in connection with birth, stillbirth or miscarriage, and gives male employees two weeks. Adoptive parents get eight weeks for one parent and two for the other.
Shaver said she thinks the law passed thanks to vocal support from the governor and increased awareness of the issue due to the work she and Figures did in previous sessions.
“And the fact that all of the southeast states around us offered it,” Shaver said. “We’re trying to attract and retain state employees and teachers, and we’re in competition with everyone around us, and the private sector as well.”
Keeping talent
For many Republicans, the workforce development argument for paid leave is a persuasive one. For states such as Alabama and South Carolina that have some of the lowest workforce participation rates in the nation, paid leave can be a tool to keep more people — particularly women — working. And it can be a way to retain educators as many states struggle with teacher shortages in K-12 schools.
“For several years we’ve seen state legislatures acknowledging the importance of child care to businesses and the economy,” said Feroza Freeland, policy director at the Southern Office of A Better Balance. “But in the last few years, we’ve seen a growing recognition that paid leave is another piece of that puzzle.”

States have taken up the issue because the federal government has not. The United States is a global outlier; among 38 peer nations, it’s the only one that doesn’t mandate paid parental leave, according to the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development. The group comprises 38 democracies with market-based economies.
The federal Family and Medical Leave Act, passed in 1993 and extended in 2020, only requires public agencies and companies with at least 50 employees to give up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for parents of newborns or newly adopted children, or caregivers of sick family members.
GOP support
During his first term, President Donald Trump publicly supported some forms of paid family leave and signed a defense bill that gives 12 weeks of paid parental leave to most federal employees.
Paid family leave was a signature issue for his daughter Ivanka Trump, at the time a senior adviser to the president. She even held a paid leave and child care summit at the White House in late 2019.
That set the stage for other Republicans to take up the issue more publicly. And after the Dobbs decision, family-friendly policies have increasingly become conservative talking points in states with restrictive abortion laws.
After the Mississippi House unanimously passed a paid parental leave bill earlier this year, Republican House Speaker Jason White celebrated the bill as a reflection of Mississippi’s status as a “pro-life state.”
In a post on X this week announcing her signing of a new paid parental leave law, Iowa Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds called Iowa “a pro-family state.”
North Carolina was one of the first Southern states to grant paid parental leave to state workers in 2019 when then-Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, signed an executive order. In 2023, several months after the Dobbs decision, the state’s majority-Republican legislature extended paid parental leave to public school employees by tacking it onto a law banning most abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy.
Meanwhile, Indiana Republican Gov. Mike Braun signed an executive order in March to add up to eight additional weeks of paid leave for “childbirth recovery” to the state’s existing four weeks of paid parental leave.
Running the gamut
The new laws won’t apply to most residents, because they only cover state employees. But they could have a downstream effect.
Shaver, the Alabama lawmaker, said she hopes her state’s new law will not only help the state be competitive with the private sector, but also set a precedent for other employers to follow.
“I hope they will see it’s in their benefit to offer what they can,” she said. “It may not be eight or 12 weeks, but even offering a reduced or flexible work schedule can help families.”
Just over a quarter of private-sector workers have access to paid family leave through their employer as of March 2023, according the most recent data from the U.S. Department of Labor.
Among the lowest-wage earners, that share drops to 6%.

State paid leave programs run the gamut in terms of what they offer. While Alabama’s new law offers up to eight weeks of leave for all state employees, including teachers, Mississippi’s offers six and does not require public schools to offer paid parental leave to their employees.
Iowa’s new law grants four weeks of paid leave for the birth or adoption of a child and one week of paid paternity leave. Tennessee’s law, passed in 2023, only offers paid leave to workers in the state’s executive and judicial branches.
But a few states are already expanding their offerings: Last year, Georgia legislators voted to double paid parental leave from three to six weeks.
And some states have gone further than just state employees: 13 states and the District of Columbia have mandated paid family leave for all workers, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center. Most of those states are located in New England or on the West Coast and all are Democratic-led. Ten more offer voluntary paid family leave statewide that’s provided through private insurance.
Sandwich generation
Experts say the shift in attitude toward family-friendly policies can also be attributed to a generational shift.
“A lot of younger lawmakers are more willing to champion the issue of paid leave,” said Freeland, of A Better Balance. “They’re understanding it because they’re seeing it in their own lives, or seeing friends and family members going through this.”
In South Carolina, Bernstein’s bill faced some opposition from members of the state’s ultra-conservative Freedom Caucus and Family Caucus. Some lawmakers questioned the potential costs of the bill, or criticized it as government overreach.
South Carolina Republican state Rep. Josiah Magnuson, a member of the Freedom Caucus, said he believed the bill would be a financial burden on public school districts that could lead to raised taxes.
“You’re saying, let’s tax the people of South Carolina, most of whom don’t get paid parental leave, and give them to state employees who already have six weeks’ paid parental leave,” Magnuson told lawmakers in April before the House voted to pass the bill.
He also said he doesn’t like that the increased paid leave “puts the foot in the door a little more for the government to be involved in the home.”
The opposition frustrated Bernstein, who pointed out that the state’s 2022 law that granted six weeks of paid parental leave passed the legislature almost unanimously. This year’s bill expanding that leave passed the House but hasn’t seen movement in the Senate. It can be picked up again when the legislature returns in January.
Other South Carolina Republicans backed the bill, citing their own families’ experiences following the birth of their children, reported the South Carolina Daily Gazette.
More conservative states are also responding to the needs of “sandwich generation” employees who may be caring for aging parents as well as children, Freeland said.
Earlier this year, Tennessee became the first Southern state to expand its state paid leave policy beyond just parental leave. The state legislature voted almost unanimously to extend its six-week paid leave policy to cover state workers providing end-of-life care to a family member.
“We’re seeing a growing recognition that people need support for these types of family or caregiving needs,” said Freeland, “and that it strengthens the workforce and economy to be able to provide that.”

John Horhn far in the lead with nearly $200,000 in campaign expenditures since the beginning of the year.
The Democratic nominee for mayor reported raising $350,000 this year and holding less than $25,000 in cash-on-hand, according to campaign finance reports due Tuesday. 
Note: View a full list of reported contributions and expenditures from mayoral and council candidates and links to individual reports at the bottom of this story.
Second in spending in the mayor’s race was independent candidate and businessman Rodney DePriest with just over $72,000 in expenditures. He raised nearly $90,000 and had about $17,000 in cash-on-hand this week.
Horhn and DePriest face two other independents and a Republican, who combined have raised less than $5,000. Independent candidates Zach Servis and Lillie Stewart-Robinson reported spending about $1,600 and $1,300, respectively, while Republican candidate Kenny Gee did not file a report on time, but told Mississippi Today he’s spent $700 out-of-pocket.
A sixth mayoral candidate, conservative talk radio host and local businessman Kim Wade, who ran as an independent, recently announced he was dropping out of the race, though the city clerk told Mississippi Today that Wade did not file termination paperwork so his name will appear as normal on the ballot. He endorsed DePriest and did not file a campaign finance report on the deadline.
Another high-dollar race is the election for the Ward 1 council seat between incumbent Councilman Ashby Foote, who is running as an independent for the first time after being elected as a Republican, Democratic nominee Jasmine Barnes and independent candidate Grace Greene. The three have collectively spent nearly $90,000. 
Ward 7 Democratic candidate Kevin Parkinson far out-raised his independent opponent, Ron Aldridge, $45,000 compared to about $14,000, and Republican candidate Taylor Turcotte did not file a report, though the ad agency owner told Mississippi Today she has conducted her own advertising without donors and would file a report soon.
Two political action committees also filed reports outlining their participation in Jackson elections this year: MS PAC and Capitol Resources PAC, which contributed to incumbent Ward 4 Councilman Brian Grizzell ($1,000) and Horhn ($2,500), respectively. 
Both Horhn and DePriest reported that some of their largest donations, ranging from $5,000 to $10,000, came from LLCs. While Mississippi law limits donations from corporations at $1,000, LLCs that are taxed as sole proprietorships are not included in that cap. There are no limits on contributions from individuals or political committees.
Horhn’s largest donations include $12,500 from former Netscape CEO Jim Barksdale and $5,000 each from a law firm located in Tippah County, Hern Law Firm PLLC, two Madison-based professionals, insurance executive Brian Johnson and physician Billy Wayne Long, and Jackson architecture firm M3A Architecture PLLC.
DePriest’s largest donation was $10,000 from Clinton-based equipment rental company HIJACK LLC. He also received $5,000 donations from Barksdale and several Jackson-based professionals including real estate agents John Dinkins and Warren Speed, lawyer Cody Bailey, surgeon Matt Jones, physician James Clay Hayes, and an executive’s spouse Mollie Van Devender. He also received $6,000 from Raymond-based property management firm MDMW Investments and $5,000 from Texas resident Matt Wiggins.
As is common in local elections, several candidates did not submit reports by the deadline, including incumbent Ward 3 Councilman Kenneth Stokes, who told Mississippi Today he would file shortly, and his opponent Marques Jackson, who said he would file Thursday after checking his bank statements to ensure accurate reporting.

(Photo by Bill Oxford/ Getty Images)The legislative committee tasked with wading through the many proposals brought forward this session to address the problems with the state’s clean energy credit program is advancing a bill that critics say doesn’t go far enough. 
On Thursday night, the Maine Legislature’s Energy, Utilities and Technology Committee voted along party lines with the majority in favor of an amended version of LD 1777. The bill Democrats advanced to the full Legislature asks the Governor’s Energy Office to develop a successor program for front-of-the-meter net energy billing projects sometime next year. The Public Utilities Commission would need to approve the plan, but only if the benefits to ratepayers outweighs the costs.
Net energy billing is a utility program designed to encourage customers to install or participate in small-scale renewable energy projects like solar panels by offering credits to offset their electricity bills. It was expanded in 2019 so customers can use renewable energy generators located outside of their property but within the same utility service territory, such as a community solar project. 
Front-of-the-meter projects include community solar projects and those included in the state’s current tariff rate program, which is used by nonresidential customers. If LD 1777 is enacted, front-of-the-meter projects would no longer be eligible to participate in net energy billing once the successor program is in place. 
“I hope that it will lead to the survival in a sustainable way and, perhaps, in a more economically just way for this really important set of programs and for the value that it has produced, as it certainly has,” said Rep. Sophie Warren (D-Scarborough), the bill’s sponsor. 
While the committee rejected other proposals, including those to repeal net energy billing entirely, it carried over some legislation such as LD 1936 that could serve as vehicles for further tweaks to the program in the next legislative session. 
As LD 1777 advances to the full Maine House of Representatives and Senate, proponents of solar energy fear these changes could harm the future of the industry.
Projected savings for ratepayers
During the committee discussion Thursday, Public Advocate Heather Sanborn said if passed the annual savings for ratepayers statewide over the next 16 years are estimated to be an average of $47 million from proposed changes to the tariff rate program and $20 million from changes to the kilowatt hour program. 
Currently, the kilowatt hour program is open to all customers and provides kilowatt hour credits on participating customers’ bills if they install renewable energy generators such as solar panels or join a community solar project, where customers receive a portion of a solar farm’s credits. The credits expire after 12 months. This program, in particular, has come under fire for providing generous incentives to solar farm developers that utility customers are helping pay for. 
LD 1777 creates a monthly charge for kilowatt hour projects starting January 2026 to offset the associated costs  currently passed on to ratepayers. 
There are 1,000 kilowatts in a megawatt and most community solar projects run between one and five megawatts. As of May 20, Maine has 300 community solar projects with a total capacity of just over 1,000 megawatts, according to the Governor’s Energy Office’s solar dashboard. 
The proposal outlines a charge of $4.10 per kilowatt of capacity for projects between three and five megawatts and $1.20 per kilowatt of capacity for projects between one and three megawatts. However, Warren said those may be adjusted to whatever number is necessary to achieve $20 million in ratepayer savings in the first year. 
The tariff rate program for nonresidential customers provides dollar credits for those who use their own projects or share in someone else’s. The Public Utilities Commission sets an annual rate for the credits, which also expire after 12 months, depending on the customer’s size and utility provider. 
However, Warren’s legislation establishes new, tiered tariff rates for certain projects starting January 2026. The new rates would vary depending on the project’s capacity. 
Republicans on the energy committee opposed the bill, with multiple of them saying it doesn’t go far enough to fix the problems net energy billing has created in the state. 
Sen. Nicole Grohoski (D-Hancock) agreed, but voted in favor because “doing nothing would be completely irresponsible,” she said. However, she said that if more needs to be done to modify net energy billing in the future to support Maine people who are struggling to keep up with electricity bills, she vowed to “be loud” about it — whether she’s still in office or not. 
Similarly, Rep. Chris Kessler (D-South Portland) said he was voting in favor “with a heavy heart.” 
Admitting it may make him a “unicorn,” committee co-chair Sen. Mark Lawrence (D-York) said he has been pleased with net energy billing.
Though she was disappointed the committee couldn’t come to a unanimous vote, Rep. Valli Geiger (D-Rockland) said her fear would be that the legislation goes too far in potentially deterring solar.  She said climate change is an existential threat and renewable energy is the only path forward.
Maine’s clean energy sector has admitted net energy billing can be improved, but has cautioned lawmakers against retroactive changes to the program that could undermine investor confidence. Many of them were disappointed in the committee’s decision to advance LD 1777, which they feel includes “drastic” concessions for the solar industry, according to a news release after the vote. 
“The Legislature today chose to both harm participants retroactively and threaten the future of the industry,” said Eliza Donoghue, executive director of the Maine Renewable Energy Association. “While the program can certainly be improved, it should not occur at the expense of the people and businesses that invested in good faith for our clean energy future.”

Limited access to surgical care and rising insurance costs in Vermont led Dr. Christopher Bartels to open Green Mountain Hernia Specialists, and to offer health care in a different way.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Retired surgeon called to return to practice.","After a successful career as a clinical Professor of Surgery at the University of Pittsburgh and more recently as a general surgeon in St. Albans, Vermont, Dr. Christopher Bartels decided to retire. Dr. Christopher Bartels of Green Mountain Hernia Specialists in Colchester, VermontRetirement didn’t last long. In addition to realizing winters can feel quite long and dark, Dr. Bartels couldn’t help thinking about the long waits for health care and the rising costs of health insurance in the state, where 41% of Vermonters have insurance deductibles over $4,000 and fewer than 20% ever meet the deductible. He also knew from experience the high administrative costs to medical providers that came from managing submissions, denials and reimbursements.He was called to practice again, but he knew he wanted to do it differently.Welcome to Green Mountain Hernia Specialists and the Direct Care ModelWith a goal to make routine surgical care accessible and affordable, Dr. Bartels opened Green  Mountain Hernia Specialists in Colchester, Vermont. He offers minimally invasive hernia surgery, gallbladder removal, and hemorrhoidal banding in the office or a hemorrhoidectomy in the operating  room. He can also perform biopsies of skin lesions very quickly in the office and excise  skin lesions there too.  What is the Direct Care Model Direct Care surgical practice means that the patient pays for the surgeon’s fee, but  the facility fee and anesthesia fee can be paid out of their existing health insurance.
