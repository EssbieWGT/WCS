A small, private family celebration of Harriet’s life will be held this fall.



Harriet Middlebrook Luck, 87, of Burlington, Vermont, passed away peacefully on July 9, 2025. Her loved ones were by her side in her final days. Harriet was born on April 7, 1938, to Charles and Anne (Perkins) Middlebrook in Burlington, VT. After graduating from Burlington High School and The Mary A. Burnham School in 1956, she attended the Mary Fletcher Hospital and Jeanne Mance School of Nursing, where she earned a Bachelor of Science in Nursing in 1961 and became a Registered Nurse. She later received her Master of Science in Nursing from Norwich University. When Harriet was 14, she met Jack Luck (15) at Camp Kiniya. They dated until August 13, 1960, when Harriet married Jack, the love of her life. They remained happily married for 63 years until Jack passed in 2023. Jack and Harriet had three children: Jeffrey, Jennifer, and Elizabeth. Harriet worked as an RN for many years in both Vermont and Arizona. In 1974, Harriet and Jack opened Ebenezer Allen, a gift shop in South Hero, VT. This venture expanded to include several gift shops and numerous other clothing stores throughout Vermont before they moved to Arizona. Harriet loved to travel, especially to the Caribbean. She is survived by her daughters, Jennifer Luck-Hill (Dennis Hill) and Elizabeth Sheeran (Dave Sheeran), as well as her grandchildren, Emily O’Brien, Lauren Clemons, Joseph Canales, Lyndsay Sheeran, Rebecca Newsome, Cynthia Sheeran, and her great-grandchildren, Peter O’Brien, Roderick O’Brien, Anne Clemons, Cassidy LaBombard, and Tyler Newsome. Harriet was predeceased by her husband, John F.. Luck (Jack), son Jeffrey Luck, her parents Charles and Anne Middlebrook, and her siblings Mary Ann Feely and Barbara Sauer Sandage. Harriet will be missed tremendously by her family. A small, private family celebration of Harriet’s life will be held this fall.

A Wilmington tax preparer was sentenced Monday to more than six years in federal prison for orchestrating a nationwide fraud scheme that siphoned off more than $9 million in COVID-19 relief funds.
Jady Solano, 43, was sentenced to 80 months behind bars after prosecutors said he led a wide-ranging effort to defraud the federal Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), which was created to help small businesses retain employees during the pandemic. None of the loans tied to the scheme were repaid, authorities said.
According to court documents, Solano used his position as a tax preparer to file 62 fraudulent PPP loan applications on behalf of shell companies that had no actual business operations or employees.
The applications falsely claimed the businesses had payrolls exceeding $1 million in some cases. Solano also submitted fake tax documents and bank statements to support the applications.

The scheme resulted in more than $9.1 million in pandemic relief funds being disbursed. Solano personally pocketed nearly $1.4 million, which he has been ordered to repay as part of a federal restitution order.
“The American taxpayers work hard for their money,” said U.S. Attorney for the District of Delaware Julianne Murray. “And we will work hard to ensure that, when taxpayer money is misused—through waste, fraud, or abuse—the wrongdoers are brought to justice.  Jady Solano led a nationwide scheme to steal more than $9 million from the federal government.”
And, she said, the funds he stole were meant for an especially important purpose: helping American workers keep their jobs during a deadly pandemic.
“Solano’s egregious misconduct warranted the substantial prison sentence the Court handed down today,” she said. “We hope that sentence sends a message to other potential white-collar criminals: in this District, financial crimes simply will not pay.”
Seven others connected to the fraud operation have also been charged, authorities said.
The case was prosecuted by First Assistant U.S. Attorney Benjamin L. Wallace. It was investigated by agents from the IRS Criminal Investigation division and the FBI’s Wilmington office.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-29-at-8.41.52-AM.png,,,2025-07-29 08:56:44.789860

Is it time for California to give him a second chance?,Joe Garcia,,,,,https://calmatters.org/justice/2025/07/life-without-parole/,"California made it easier for young people convicted of serious crimes to get a second chance, except for those sentenced to life without parole. New legislation could change that.","In summary
California made it easier for young people convicted of serious crimes to get a second chance, except for those sentenced to life without parole. New legislation could change that.


Nathan Gould wakes up in a California state prison cell every morning at 6 a.m. He stirs a cup of instant coffee, prays with his Bible and reflects on the day in 1994 when he killed a man in Bakersfield.
Homeless and drifting from one drug score to the next, Gould and his wife holed up with another transient in an abandoned warehouse. Gould attacked him with a knife, beat and tied him up, and proceeded to rifle through his belongings for a wad of cash he’d flashed earlier. When the man began yelling, Gould stuffed a sock in his mouth. 
“I hate having to relive this sometimes,” Gould said before describing how he heard the man’s muffled grunts and failed to realize he was suffocating. “I didn’t know I broke his nose.”
The wad of cash turned out to be $68 — a lone $20 bill wrapped around dozens of smaller bills.
Two weeks later, and racked by guilt and remorse, the 21-year-old Gould hightailed it back to his mom’s house in Kansas and confessed what he’d done. “She told me just to be honest and tell the truth, so I called the police and turned myself in.” 
Today, he’s among more than 5,000 people in California prisons serving life without parole sentences that all but guarantee they’ll die incarcerated. And more than half — roughly 2,800, including Gould — committed their life crimes while they were under age 25, according to an advocacy group called The Sentencing Project.
Over the last two decades, California adopted laws that defined people who committed their crimes before they were 25 as “youth offenders” and softened parole criteria for them. Laws now require that youth offenders with so-called indeterminate sentences, meaning those that include a possibility of parole, be allowed to appear before the Board of Parole Hearings after 25 years of incarceration. That holds regardless of the sentence length — whether it’s 40 years to life, 80 years to life or beyond.
But for individuals like Gould whose original sentence mandates zero chance of parole, youth offender considerations still do not apply. Last year, the California Supreme Court ruled explicitly that life without parole sentences are excluded from youth offender parole reforms.
That could change. In April, state Sen. Susan Rubio of West Covina introduced a bill that could soon offer Gould and hundreds of others a chance at parole. She characterized her proposal as an “opportunity (for incarcerated people) to demonstrate their growth and rehabilitation.”
“This is not a guarantee of release — so let’s be clear about that. Not a guaranteed release,” she said in June just before the Senate passed the bill 24-11, with all of the chamber’s 10 Republicans and one Democrat, Sen. Melissa Hurtado, voting against it.
The bill won’t pass this year. Democratic lawmakers agreed to hold it in the Assembly until 2026, giving them time to refine the proposal.
Supporters hope the bill will help address what they see as disparities in who receives the most stringent sentences. Local prosecutors hold great discretion to pursue so-called special circumstance murder convictions. From county to county and courtroom to courtroom, any first degree murder allegation could be defined as special circumstance — and therefore lead to mandatory life without the possibility of parole.
That’s reflected in California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation data that shows a wide range in how county prosecutors pursue life without parole. Lassen, Sacramento and Los Angeles counties sentence people to life without parole at some of the highest rates. Of currently incarcerated people, 7.2% sentenced in Lassen County are serving life without parole, compared to 5.6% statewide.
How parole works
For anyone serving a life sentence — even with the possibility of parole, there is never a guarantee of release. California’s parole board prides itself on setting arduous and stringent layers of review that prioritize public safety.
Every aspect of an offender’s criminal footprint is documented and scrutinized through the parole process — their childhood history and trauma, prior convictions, prison record, disciplinary infractions, social achievements, educational milestones, relapse prevention plans, vocational training and realistic career prospects.
In usually a two to three hour hearing, a person must discuss all fluidly and clearly with parole board commissioners trained to observe and root out inconsistencies. Specific insight into the crime and how the person’s outlook on criminality has changed over time must be fully articulated.
The slightest semblance of a red flag might result in a parole denial.
“Without reservation, in California we have the most thorough process with the most checks and balances than anyone, anywhere,” said Jennifer Schaffer, former executive officer of the Board of Parole Hearings for the last 13 years. She cited Canada as having, perhaps, the only system of parole more rigorous.
Schaffer said the board’s deep reliance on quantifiable science in every parole decision includes comprehensive risk assessments by a specialized team of forensic psychologists and peer review of all reports to ensure accuracy and lack of bias.
“And for the last 10 years, they’ve looked at every single person who’s been released as a result of a grant,” she said. “Only two to 4% have gone on to commit any new crime, misdemeanor or felony — and less than 1% have gone on to commit any new felony involving harm to another human being.
“It’s like 99.5% go on to never harm another human being, within three years of release, which is extraordinary.”
Su Kim, senior policy manager for nonprofit justice reform organization UnCommon Law, has helped see over 300 clients — many of them youth offenders — successfully earn parole. 
“I think it’s safe to say that anyone who has been granted parole through this process has done tremendous work to transform their lives to reflect deeply on their crimes and their past mistakes, and to demonstrate accountability and remorse,” said Kim. “The board doesn’t really take chances on people.”

Is Nathan Gould a different person today?
After his first 15 years immersed in a prison culture fueled by bootleg alcohol and narcotics, Gould said he began to embrace sobriety. 
“My cellie and I had been high for a good few days straight. We looked around at our shelf. We got nothing. All we were living for was getting high each day. But I had this dusty old Bible.”
While elements of his story are documented in court records and prison files, CalMatters was unable to independently verify every detail.
Gould took to the scripture, renewed his faith and found fellowship within the Christian community. “I started going to church and hanging around with people who had a positive vibe,” he said. “You can feel all alone in here doing your time, so I saw the camaraderie and felt wanted by guys who were choosing to live right.”
At the time, his only rehabilitative options outside the church were through mail correspondence. But eventually, he transferred to a prison with more opportunities in 2015. He discovered Celebrate Recovery, a Christian-based 12-step program, and he started to join self-help groups and take college courses.
“I was in special education as a kid and ended up graduating from high school while I was in juvenile detention,” he said. “I never really felt I was good enough for college even though I saw others doing it here.”
Tackling one class at a time, Gould methodically plodded through his coursework, earned his first “A” and began to look at himself a bit differently. He completed two separate associate of arts programs, and is one course away from completing a third — all with nearly a 4.0 grade point average.
He also learned to seek help to battle the depression that overwhelms him at times. “I see a mental health specialist once a month — by choice,” he said. “I don’t have to, but I do.”
Gould spoke about completing self-help groups that focus on anger management, alternatives to violence, conflict resolution and positive psychology. His current group discusses Greek philosophy, self-mastery and learning to accept external circumstances beyond one’s control.
“The only groups I take are the ones that I feel I’m gonna get something out of,” he said. “I know they’re good for me and they help me to dive into myself and understand the root causes of why I acted the way I did.”
According to Gould, the self-help groups and rehabilitative programs helped him address the childhood trauma and shame of having an abusive alcoholic father. His first stint in juvenile detention came at age 14, after he broke his father’s leg with a baseball bat to stop him from beating his mother.
“I got locked up for aggravated assault. Nothing happened to him.” When Gould returned home after serving 14 months, he said his father chased him out of the house with a shotgun and shot him in the back as he ran away. 
“Police asked if I wanted to file charges, but I couldn’t. He told me if I ever got him locked up, he’d kill me as soon as he got out.”
But Gould said he doesn’t blame his father for anything. Instead, he looks at his father’s behavior through the same lens he views his own. “He was a Korean War vet. He ran off to join the military when he was 15, so I’m sure something bad was going on at home for him to want to leave.”
Giving life without parole a second look
Schaffer, the former parole board executive officer, supports Rubio’s bill. While cognizant of the trauma that parole hearings bear upon victims of crime, her years of experience in the criminal justice landscape inform her opinion.
“Human beings who have no opportunity for review, it’s really hard to maintain hope,” she said. “I think hope can be really powerful — and the absence of hope can be very dangerous. So even for staff and volunteers and people who work in the prisons, I think people having a meaningful opportunity for review and having hope for that can actually make our prisons safer. I truly believe that.
“I also think that giving people an opportunity to show that they’ve truly transformed is a very meaningful thing. I just think it’s something important for humanity in general.”

Through her position at UnCommon Law, Kim has seen the real-life impact of youth offender parole opportunities.
“We now have a decade of evidence showing that youth parole works,” said Kim. “It promotes public safety and fiscal responsibility, and offers a fair second chance to those who’ve grown and changed. Recidivism rates for people released after life sentences have dropped since youth parole was implemented.”
Sen. Kelly Seyarto is not convinced. He spoke in opposition to Rubio’s bill on the Senate floor before the vote in June.
“Let’s let the system work the way it’s been working,” said Seyarto, a Republican from Murrieta. “Now ultimately everybody has the option to have the governor commute their sentence and they can be freed and they can be rehabilitated. Once they’re rehabilitated, they can get back out there in society.”
Governors hold executive power to absolve or alter a person’s sentence, but it’s generally considered a rare act of mercy — a mercurial process without clear layers of objective review. In the last 30 years, fewer than 200 offenders serving life without parole sentences have been offered clemency or commutation.
Former Gov. Jerry Brown commuted no sentences from 2011 to 2015, then 282 from 2016 to 2018 — about half which were life without parole sentences. Gov. Gavin Newsom has commuted the sentences of 141 people since the beginning of his term in 2019, including 49 serving life without parole. Of those, 33 committed their crimes when they were 25 or younger, according to an analysis of executive clemency reports.
Rubio’s bill would offer a more equitable mechanism for second chance opportunities. 
Gould knows legislation is out there that could radically change his life overnight. “It’s definitely giving me a light,” he said. “There’s hope. I’d have a purpose now. I’d have a goal. There’s an ending.”
But for now he said he remains pessimistically optimistic. “I always kinda think, ‘Here we go again,’ because they wiggled carrots in front of my face so many times, and then they just kick your feet out from underneath you.
“I try to wake up with a good attitude and focus on positivity — just let the day come to me.”

The post Bar advocates dispute Beacon Hill’s forecast for labor crisis[...]","BAR ADVOCATES said Monday they have not been involved in any conversations with legislative leadership about a resolution to the labor crisis that’s resulted in more than 100 court cases being dismissed, even though top House and Senate Democrats suggested the situation could be fixed “soon.”
House Speaker Ron Mariano and Senate President Karen Spilka told reporters their teams continue to work on a solution to the pay dispute that has led bar advocates to stop accepting new cases representing indigent defendants. Spilka called on the attorneys to reverse course in the meantime, contending that “people are being hurt” as a result of their stance.
“We hope to get it resolved soon, but in the meantime, they should be working,” Spilka told reporters Monday afternoon following a private leadership meeting with Gov. Maura Healey, Lt. Gov. Kim Driscoll and Mariano.
But Sean Delaney, a veteran attorney who has been heavily involved in organizing the labor action, said he was surprised by Spilka’s assessment of where things stand.
“No information to that effect has made its way to the bar advocates as of, what is it? 4:49 p.m.?” Delaney said in a late-afternoon interview.
Delaney said he and fellow bar advocate Jennifer O’Brien began speaking in “mid- to late winter” about their concerns with comparably low pay and the effects on cases. The private attorneys appointed to represent those who cannot afford counsel earn $65 per hour in District Court and $85 per hour in Superior Court, in both cases lower than in neighboring states. 
In late May, hundreds of bar advocates decided to stop taking new cases to protest pay rates. The attorneys handle about 80% of the overall public defense caseload in Massachusetts.
“And I just want to add that I strongly urge the bar advocates to get back to work,” Spilka said. “They are being paid. They continue to be paid.”
Asked to provide more details about negotiations and a potential legislative vehicle, Spilka responded, “Nope.” 
Pressed about her reticence, Spilka said, “Because discussions are happening right now, and we’re trying to work it out.”
Delaney stressed that bar advocates continue to work on cases they accepted before late May, and disputed use of the phrase “work stoppage.”
“I’m in court representing and defending, to the best of my ability, the poor in the commonwealth, as all my fellow bar advocates are,” Delaney said. “All we’ve done is said, ‘Listen, enough is enough. We’re not taking on any new cases.’ So for the governor, the speaker, the Senate president, to say we must go back to work — we have not stopped working. It shows me they don’t have any regard for us, the work we do, or the clients that we represent.”
Top legislative Democrats have called the situation a “$100 million issue,” as the state continues to assess the economic and federal funding outlooks in Massachusetts. 
Healey has maintained that bar advocates did not raise the issue with her before she filed her proposed fiscal 2026 budget in January. Spilka on Monday reiterated that point. 
“The governor came out with her budget — there were no discussions prior to that, nothing was in the governor’s budget. The House came out with their budget in April, nobody raised anything about the need for more funding, or the concern about the funding,” Spilka said. “The Senate came out with some increase that was rejected. So we are now trying to resolve the issue and work it out.”
Keith Alpern, an attorney who has worked as a bar advocate since the mid-1980s, said he finds the tone elected officials have taken to be “totally disingenuous.” He pointed to a Boston Globe report that attorneys asked lawmakers for a raise as early as February and continued those requests during the spring, before bar advocates stopped taking new cases in late May.
“The idea that this was some shock is just nonsense,” Alpern said.
Delaney added, “If there’s a legislator, especially leadership, who is saying they were blindsided, they must have been under a rock for not only months but for years.”
Delaney said he and O’Brien had a meeting with Spilka or her top aides tentatively scheduled for Monday, July 21. But a few days beforehand, he said, “word got back to us and said, ‘Unless we tell our colleagues to go back to work, there will be no meeting.'”
A spokesperson for Spilka said in response, “Our office has no record of a meeting or understanding of a meeting like this being planned or scheduled with our office.”
Mariano said the chairs of the Ways and Means committees are “trying to work on a solution that is fair and equitable for everybody.”
Bob McGovern, communications director at the Committee for Public Counsel Services, was in the House lobby speaking with reporters as the private meeting was underway, though he exited before the Beacon Hill leaders emerged. 
“We have been in frequent communication with leadership in both the House and Senate as they work toward a resolution,” McGovern said in a statement to the News Service. “We remain hopeful that an agreement will be reached that prioritizes and benefits our clients.”
The House and Senate have formal sessions slated for this week, before the branches transition into their August recess that will still feature biweekly informal sessions. A supplemental budget remains unfinished and has been eyed as a potential venue to bump bar advocates’ pay.
Asked if that looming break is putting more urgency on the work stoppage, or whether the issue could be put on the backburner without a solution reached this week, Spilka reiterated, “I expect it to be resolved soon.”
Healey said she wants the stoppage resolved “immediately,” but also refrained from offering specific details about a potential resolution. 
“I am hopeful that we will see one very soon, and that will be announced at the appropriate time,” the governor said. 
Healey has repeatedly called the issue a “matter of public safety” and said last week that she’ll “leave it up to the Legislature” to determine a dollar figure associated with a resolution.
Some bar advocates said they are unlikely to accept new cases until they secure a satisfactory raise, arguing that doing so would relinquish leverage.
“The bar advocates certainly are not happy about what’s happening in the courts right now, but the reality is that until we stopped taking cases, nobody cared. The Legislature ignored us for years,” Alpern said. “The notion that we should go back to taking cases based on some promise that in the future, they’re going to take us seriously — why would we think that when we haven’t been taken seriously for decades?”
Mariano acknowledged the thorny discussions at play. The Quincy Democrat said it is not a “traditional” negotiation due to individual contracts involved.
“So it’s hard to foresee where a middle ground might be, one that works for everybody because each one of these folks is an individual contractor. So you may be talking to someone who only represents five people – you don’t know,” Mariano told reporters. “So you make an agreement with five people, and then you gotta do it 55 more times. We’re trying to get a consensus of where these folks would come back to work, and how much it would take to get them to come back to work.”
Mariano later clarified the negotiations are not unfolding across every individual contract, though he said some bar advocates may have stiffer requests than others. 
“It may be some aggressive and adamant folks who are holding out for the full amount of X, and then you have other folks who will settle for X minus five,” Mariano said. “So you have a whole range of acceptances in this area, and we’re trying to find out something that works in our budget, because as you heard from the Senate president, they came to us after we were done. So now we have to go in and look for the money, and we have to start cutting things. So it’s a long, involved process.” 
Budget-writers gave themselves a $800 million cushion in their fiscal 2026 compromise budget amid federal funding uncertainty. 
Neither Healey nor legislative leaders have taken a stance on whether they believe attorneys’ pay should be raised, and have not dictated a specific figure they think attorneys should be paid. 
The work stoppage “has pushed our justice system to the brink,” according to Boston Bar Association President Matt McTyge. “What began as a crisis of compensation has escalated into a full-blown emergency, one that threatens the safety of our communities and the public’s faith in the justice system,” he said in a statement Friday. 
The attorneys are not accepting new cases at the same time that Republic Services sanitation workers and Fenway Park hospitality workers are on strike. Asked why she thinks unions are “being more active” this year, Healey said she “can’t offer an explanation on that.”
“What you see here happening in Massachusetts is no different from what is happening around the country,” Healey said. “With respect to Republic, these are private contracts, and so the state doesn’t have an active role in this, other than for me to continue to ask that parties resolve this.”
Pressed about the tension in Massachusetts between labor and management, the governor said, “I don’t know enough to be able to opine on that.”

(Danielle Prokop / Source NM)A new study from Los Alamos National Laboratory shows that New Mexico’s beloved piñon pine trees may be more flexible in how they handle extreme drought than scientists once thought.
Generally, all plants have a built-in drought alarm system called a “stomatal closure point.”
When soil gets too dry, the plant hits a tipping point where it closes up to avoid dehydration. While this can help the plant survive drought, it also pauses growth and energy production.
“There are lots of trade-offs in how plants manage their water use and how they optimize water use versus photosynthesis,” said Turin Dickman, one of the LANL scientists that published the study. “They can’t have their cake and eat it too.”
Dickman and her team studied piñon pine — an “isohydric” plant that constantly works to keep its internal water levels steady, even if it means shutting down photosynthesis during extreme drought.
Scientists once thought these plants stuck to this rigid water-control strategy, come torrential rain or abundant sunshine.
But, when given more water just before prolonged drought, Dickman’s team discovered that piñon started to change, mimicking the behavior of an “anisohydric” plant – where the plant will let its water levels match the environment around it.
“It suggests that our pine forests here might be more resilient to those hot dry periods if they’ve experienced some wetter times just before those come along,” Dickman said.
As climate change accelerates – prolonging droughts, increasing heat waves, and sparking more frequent and intense wildfires – Dickman said the discovery could have broad implications for land managers, offering a tool to predict how ecosystems might respond to drought.
That includes thinning dense forests to reduce wildfire risk.
“Available soil water is like a bucket,” Dickman said. “When it’s super dense, if you’ve got a lot of straws in that bucket, there’s less water for each individual straw, right? If you can do some thinning, you can make more water available for those that are remaining.”

A groundbreaking workforce development initiative marked a major milestone Monday as 24 participants became the first graduates of the BioConnect DE Biomanufacturing Training Program, an intensive, tuition-free course aimed at preparing Delawareans for careers in the state’s rapidly expanding life sciences sector.
The graduation ceremony, held Monday at EastSide Charter School’s Chemours STEM Hub, celebrated the achievements of the program’s inaugural class—96% of whom completed the rigorous eight-week curriculum.
The initiative is spearheaded by the Delaware Center for Life Science Education and Training and the Delaware BioScience Association (Delaware Bio), with funding from a federal Congressionally Directed Spending grant and support from industry partners.
“This graduation marks a critical step in addressing workforce gaps in the life sciences while creating new opportunities for individuals across our community,” said Katie Lakofsky, executive director of BioConnect DE. “We’re thrilled to celebrate our first group of graduates and excited to connect them with employers who are ready to invest in talent.”
The BioConnect DE training program was launched to respond to both state economic priorities and national security concerns around the biomanufacturing workforce.
A recent report by the National Security Commission on Emerging Biotechnology emphasized the urgent need to build a competitive U.S. workforce in this strategically vital industry.

Michael Fleming, president and CEO of Delaware Bio and founding chair of the training center, praised the collaboration that brought the program to life, calling it  the result of years of planning and focused, effective collaboration with partners across industry, government, and community organizations.
“But most importantly, it recognizes a remarkable group of individuals who – with many obligations and sacrifices – courageously raised their hands to serve patients and secure our state’s economic future,” he said.
A new talent pipeline for biomanufacturing
The $3 million, three-year pilot program trains individuals in foundational lab and manufacturing skills, including Quality Management Systems, current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP), and Clean Room Procedures.
The program places special emphasis on accessibility—no college degree is required—and actively recruits candidates from diverse professional backgrounds, including retail, hospitality, and healthcare.
Guest lecturers from major employers such as Agilent, AstraZeneca, Tru Global, and the University of Delaware provided insight into industry practices.
Participants also completed a capstone project, designing and delivering training modules to their peers—an exercise that emphasized communication and collaboration.
Job placement efforts already underway
With graduation complete, BioConnect DE is now working to place graduates into entry-level roles with life sciences employers across Delaware.
Participating companies have already received student profiles, taken part in mock interviews, and attended site tours. Employer roundtables are planned in the coming months to accelerate job placements.
The 2025 graduating class includes:

The Delaware Emergency Management Agency (DEMA) has launched the Delaware School Safety Center (DSSC), a new initiative aimed at bolstering school safety across the state.
The DSSC includes a newly launched website designed to serve as a centralized hub for training, resources, and best practices for educators, parents, and emergency responders.
Located here, the user-friendly site offers guidance and tools for crisis response planning, threat assessment, and safety coordination.
The move marks a significant expansion of Delaware’s long-standing Comprehensive School Safety Program (CSSP), originally established in 2012.

“Ensuring a safe learning environment for every Delaware student is a shared priority of the highest importance,” said Joshua Bushweller, secretary of Safety and Homeland Security. “This critical collaboration between first responders, school officials, parents, and students – supported by the integration of technology and emergency management expertise – will serve to strengthen our ongoing commitment to school safety.”
The DSSC is designed not only to support schools during emergencies, but also to help prevent incidents before they occur.
The Center offers a range of services including Behavioral Threat Assessment (BTA) training for school-based teams, secure case management software for consistent documentation and follow-up, and onsite physical safety assessments.
“The DSSC represents a collaborative effort to support educators and first responders, and to engage students and parents in building safe and resilient school communities,” said DEMA Director A.J. Schall.
Delaware has been a national leader in school safety.
It was the first state to create standardized digital maps and blueprints of all public and charter schools, streamlining emergency response.
In 2023, the state also launched Safe DE, a 24/7 anonymous reporting system that allows students and families to report safety concerns and access mental health and crisis resources.
“The Delaware School Safety Center is designed to prevent school-based incidents by preparing the education community to work with community partners to effectively mitigate and manage crises,” added DSSC Executive Director Joey Melvin.
In addition to safety planning tools, the DSSC offers specialized training for school resource officers, guidance on managing after-school events, and recommendations for improving physical school security.
State Education Secretary Cindy Marten emphasized the importance of a proactive approach to school safety.
“Nothing is more important than student safety, because students learn, and teachers are able to teach when they feel safe,” she said. “Safety doesn’t happen by accident; it happens by design. That’s why the launch of the Delaware School Safety Center matters so much.”",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-29-at-8.03.42-AM.png,,,2025-07-29 08:56:44.789860

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Members of a network of 83 after-school programs in Utah were relieved to hear this month that the Trump administration would release frozen funds essential to run their programs. But, weeks of financial uncertainty have already resulted in cuts.
Past the middle of July, amid a bipartisan push to release the funds, the Trump administration decided to release part of the $6.8 billion allocated for before- and after-school programs, as well as summer programs. 
Now, after-school organizations in the state are preparing for change aligning with Trump policies. And, while the Utah State Board of Education has secured the funding, questions about the future of the program that serves about 10,000 children in the state remain unanswered.

The board is currently reviewing any additional requirements that may be attached to the funding, said Ben Trentelman, executive director at Utah Afterschool Network. Then, the state will be able to reimburse summer and after-school programs for their operational costs.
“​​It was referred to by the administration as guardrails to ensure that the programs were not implementing programming or activities that are counter to the focus of the administration,” Trentelman said. “And so I think that that does pertain to some things like diversity, equity and inclusion and similar areas.”
Utah after-school and summer programs blindsided by federal funding freeze

Utah already has a law restricting DEI initiatives in public institutions, which has led programs overseen by the board of education to pivot to ensure compliance with state code.

Before the administration change and the freeze, the programs followed requirements to qualify for the federal 21st Century Community Learning Centers Grants — maintaining an average daily attendance, serving a certain minimum number of students, and ensuring the programs aren’t used for political activities, among others, Trentelman said. Now, word from other states is that there may be additional anti-DEI and U.S. citizenship requirements.
The after-school program network hasn’t seen any official guidance from the board, Trentelman said. The board didn’t reply to an interview request from Utah News Dispatch. 
“We still have a lot of questions about how programs are able to operate moving into the future,” Trentelman said. “We know that the funding is available, but we’re unsure about what guardrails may exist and how these programs are allowed to move forward.”
The programs don’t currently ask for students’ citizenship status, aside from demographic surveys which include a question on refugee status. The citizenship question hasn’t come up in Utah programs, but other states are already looking into the requirement’s legality.
“Something that I think is important is that when we think about inclusion, we’re really looking at ensuring that youth of all abilities have a place to go, that youth are able to participate in an after-school program,” he said, “regardless of their background, or ethnicity, or income, or any of those things.”
A challenging time
After-school and summer programs have been alternatives for families looking for safe spaces for their children while they are busy with work or other responsibilities. 
Trentelman has watched how the stability and routine of the programs allow children to thrive in their educational paths. However, that stability was called into question with the funding unpredictability.



Let us know what you think...


 


“A number of organizations were thrown into a bit of disarray as they were trying to navigate exactly how they could best move forward,” he said. “We did see some programs that did elect to reduce their staff size, or move staff to more limited hours. We did see some organizations that did shut down for the summer prematurely because they did not have the savings established to be able to support their operation without consistent payments on funds that they had been promised.”
The uncertainty is extending beyond this year, even if the funding has been released. It was already difficult to keep a full staff with typically low-paying, entry-level positions. Wages for after-school staff start between $13 to $15 an hour, and the work week is usually 20 to 30 hours.
“(Providers) are faced with the additional challenge of the uncertainty of the field, knowing that funds may have come out for this year, but we still don’t know what’s happening in the next year,” Trentelman said. “People are going to be questioning the stability of entering this work.”
In an informal survey of the programs, Trentelman heard about four organizations, which manage about 15 programs, planning to reduce staff and program hours. That may hit rural communities the hardest, where there are fewer child care or after-school options.

(Ralph Chapoco/Alabama Reflector)The Alabama Justice Information Commission established a policy on Thursday to require law enforcement to report when someone dies while in custody.
But the Commission left it up to the individual agencies to make the information available to the public.
The policy was one of two that members of the commission unanimously voted to approve during its quarterly meeting to create a platform that allows law enforcement agencies to report incidents of people dying in their custody. It also establishes the process for reporting deaths and the information that must be included.
The policy was adapted to fit the needs of the Alabama Department of Economic and Community Affairs, another state agency in Alabama, to report those statistics to the U.S. Department of Justice so it can continue to distribute grants from the U.S. DOJ to law enforcement organizations throughout the state.
Currently, the Alabama Department of Economic Affairs cannot require law enforcement agencies to report incidents in which people have died in their custody. The updated policy allows it to partner with the Commission to obtain the information.
“Basically, we are depending on the goodwill of any entity that can hold individuals to give us that information.” said Bill Babington, chief of the Law Enforcement and Traffic Division of the agency.
The recently updated policy applies to all agencies in Alabama and must be reported each quarter. The updated policy defines those in the custody of law enforcement as people who are detained or arrested, as well as incarcerated in a jail or prison.
Law enforcement agencies must report when and where people died while in their custody, as well as how people died along with information pertaining to any investigation into the death of the individuals.
Agencies must also report the name, date of birth and race of the individuals who died, as well as data related to the individual reporting the death, such as the name and title, as well as the name of the agency.
The policy states that the Alabama Justice Information Commission will outline the procedures to collect and distribute the information about those who died while in custody. The Commission will also provide a uniform method for collecting the information.
The data will then be given to the authorized people at ADECA. However, that information within that database will be kept secret. Anyone from the public who wants access to the information must contact the reporting agency.
Members of the commission also ratified a policy that requires law enforcement agencies to report people who are wanted in custody for a crime, stolen vehicles and stolen property within 12 hours of the incident.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/20250724_101529-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-07-29 08:56:44.789860

This story was originally reported by Jennifer Gerson of The 19th.  Meet Jennifer and read more of her reporting on gender, politics and policy.
Content warning: This story contains graphic depictions of domestic violence.
Rep. Debbie Dingell doesn’t want to talk about this, but I’m here in her office because she says she needs to.
Dingell grew up in Michigan and had what she describes as a “comfortable childhood.” Her father owned a business. Her mother was a member of Michigan’s famous Fisher family, whose company became part of what is now General Motors.
But her father also was addicted to prescription drugs and suffered from mental illness.
“He was paranoid. You just never knew what his mood was going to be and so he would just — trigger.”
It all came to a head on what Dingell described as “the night that I just really was convinced we were all going to die.”
Dingell’s father had a gun, and her mother had bought one of her own to protect herself. A fight broke out between the two “and I got in the middle of them,” Dingell recalled.
“I tried to keep them from killing each other. My mother ran out of the house. He took the door knobs off of every door, so that we kids couldn’t get out. I tried to call the police. He ripped the phone out of the wall — not that anybody would have come anyway, the way they do today. So we hid in a closet and we didn’t know if we were going to live or die.”
At the time, Dingell was in middle school. Her baby sister was set to start first grade in the morning. Dingell walked her to school that next day, both pretending nothing had ever happened. Her younger sister, Dingell said, was forever traumatized. “She was never OK. This all was happening from the time she was born.”
She died of an overdose years later, something Dingell continues to connect to the impact of that night, and of years of experiences like it.
Which is why, though she doesn’t like to talk about it, she will when she thinks it’s important, when she thinks her story might have the opportunity to change things, to shine a light, to ensure that another family can get the resources they need to reclaim their future. It’s why she’s talking to me today, even if she doesn’t really want to. She’s talking to me because I wanted to hear more after we spoke in early June about a letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi critical of the administration’s actions to roll back resources and protections for survivors of domestic violence — and because she thinks it will help.










For many reasons, you just didn’t talk about it. You didn’t want your family stigmatized, you didn’t want yourself stigmatized.


“There’s always been a stigma associated with domestic violence,” Dingell tells me. “People think it doesn’t happen in ‘good homes’ — I don’t know what’s a ‘good home,’ by the way — or happen in certain families or in certain places, but it happens anywhere. For many reasons, you just didn’t talk about it. You didn’t want your family stigmatized, you didn’t want yourself stigmatized. But at some point — for me, for a long time, I always tried to figure out, how do you keep this down inside when there are guns getting into people’s hands in times when that shouldn’t happen?”
Dingell has served in the U.S. House of Representatives since 2015, after she ran for and won the seat vacated by the retirement of her husband — Rep. John Dingell, the longest-serving member of Congress in U.S. history, who died in 2019. She’s a former executive as well as an experienced Democratic operative, a connector and convener of people. Dingell is also widely known for her frank, direct speech — see her public spats with President Donald Trump. Since joining Congress, she has become one of the clearest, most consistent voices speaking out about the need to support survivors of domestic violence.
She’s been talking about her childhood experiences with domestic violence since 2016, when her longtime friend John Lewis, the civil rights legend and new colleague in the U.S. House, took her by the hand during the 26-hour sit-in Democrats had staged at the Capitol to push for a vote on new gun safety legislation.
“John Lewis knew my story and said, ‘Tell it.’ It wasn’t planned. It wasn’t rehearsed. It was in the middle of the night. And I got up and told the story. I never know what I’m going to say. I never pre-planned. I just talked about it in the minute there,” Dingell told me on a Monday afternoon in July as we sat opposite each other in arm chairs  in the Cannon House Office Building, surrounded by paraphernalia from her home-state and photos with political power players through the years.










My sister was like, ‘If we could prevent anybody from going through what we went through, then we have a moral responsibility.'


It wasn’t until that House speech that she had ever even used the term “domestic abuse” to describe her own experiences, Dingell said. When she did, she was “shaking like a leaf,” she recalled. But she understood why speaking up was important.
“My sister was like, ‘If we could prevent anybody from going through what we went through, then we have a moral responsibility.’”
They were words that have helped empower her to talk about her experience multiple times on the House floor in her 10-year tenure. But still, Dingell said, she and her surviving siblings don’t really ever discuss what happened to them. Dingell’s mother is alive, as are her brother and one sister, and she feels discomfort talking about a story that she says isn’t wholly hers.
“When you grow up in this kind of situation, you learn to cope. You want to go on with your life. You don’t want to be demonized, or have that happen to your sister or your brother,” Dingell said. “That’s why I feel this probably isn’t my story to tell, nor should I really be talking about it. You just want to make a difference in people’s lives — and you want to move on. You don’t want to remember.”










Domestic violence is real. Domestic violence happens in every kind of family.


The making a difference part means speaking honestly and frankly about domestic violence with the microphone she has in Congress.
“Domestic violence is real. Domestic violence happens in every kind of family.”
She worries people will ask why her mother didn’t leave and wants to protect her.
I did not ask, but Dingell went ahead and answered the question: “You know, in those days, people said, ‘Stay together.’ The Catholic Church told you to stay together. So kids stay in situations where they shouldn’t stay.”
She hopes her story can provide a kind of reference point for anyone navigating a similar situation.
“Parents have to understand that when a child is in that kind of unstable, dangerous situation, it is not the best for the child. That would be one message I would have. And the other message is that when someone is unstable, when they have mood swings, when it can all just change in an instant, being armed in that situation is a dangerous situation.”
It’s these two things that have driven so much of Dingell’s legislative work in the area.
Dingell established the Bipartisan Working Group to End Domestic Violence, bringing together a group of House members to identify ways to strengthen resources and protections for survivors. There was the letter to Bondi urging the Trump administration to reinstate funding opportunities through the Department of Justice’s Office of Violence Against Women (OVW) that provide critical resources and support to domestic violence survivors. (This funding was ultimately revived, though with new restrictions.) Another letter, to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., expressed deep concern about staff and budget cuts to programs that support survivors of domestic and sexual violence and their families.










Half of this is just awareness and we need to go for that. That’s what I’m doing right now.


She was a key voice in helping the House pass the 2019 updates to the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), which included two provisions she authored. One was the bipartisan Zero Tolerance for Domestic Abusers Act, which closed loopholes that made it possible for perpetrators of dating violence and those convicted of misdemeanor stalking to legally access guns. The other strengthened the health care system’s identification, assessment and response to domestic violence, sexual assault and dating violence survivors, helping them better access behavioral health and safety resources.
Dingell is particularly concerned about the way the Trump administration has delayed and restricted funding for the kinds of community-centered groups that provide services to women and children. She pointed to what’s happened in Detroit, where nonprofit support organizations worked for years to raise funds to build a shelter with 85 beds for domestic violence survivors. Now the future of the federal funding the shelter was relying on is unclear, putting its ability to operate in question. It’s just one example of why she’s once again choosing to talk about her personal experience with domestic violence now.
“I’m working with the groups. We’ve had bipartisan conversations. You’re going to write an article. Half of this is just awareness and we need to go for that. That’s what I’m doing right now.”
These community-based resources, she said, are essential to helping children in particular.
“I thought I needed to call the police because I thought we were going to die. But I don’t think many children, especially younger children, understand that there are other resources there,” she said. “This is why you educate teachers and people who work in emergency rooms, in case a child’s had a bone that’s been broken. That’s what you have to do — you have to raise community awareness.”
Though Dingell doesn’t care to talk about her personal experience with domestic violence, she does care about action and change — especially in the form of practical resources for other survivors.
“I don’t spend a lot of time thinking about it. For me, it’s just about trying to keep other people from having to go through what we did and for mothers and fathers — there are men that are victims too — to know that there are resources. I want to make sure that there still are places that people can go so that we don’t make it so that people have to stay in those kinds of situations.”










We have to raise our voices, collectively, across the country, and say, ‘We have to get this fixed.'


The other thing that Dingell wants to talk about is hope. “If we give up and we don’t have hope, then — then it’s all gone. So I’m gonna give up? No. … When we come together, when we know that there’s something that’s not right, we have to raise our voices, collectively, across the country, and say, ‘We have to get this fixed.’”
Her model for practicing this kind of hope paired with deep conviction and action were the nuns who taught her at the Academy of the Sacred Heart in Grosse Pointe Farms, Michigan. They are the women who continue to inspire her today, she said.
“The nuns taught me to be who I am, that I can be anything I want. They taught me the values that I have, that I have a responsibility to my community. They taught me to be tough.”
So Dingell talks, even about things she doesn’t want to remember, even in situations like this — sitting with a reporter, a stranger — to make sure her voice is heard.
“I want somebody to know there are people there to help them. I want someone to recognize that they’re in a bad situation and that they need support and their family needs support — and that there need to be programs for them to get that support,” Dingell said. “I can remember talking to my priest when I was a kid in grade school, but nobody would do anything about it then because my parents were very generous contributors to the church and people didn’t want to upset anybody. We have to be willing to tell the truth. We have to be willing to intervene. And we have to be willing to get people the help and resources they need.”










You can have a life. You can. And we have to help get you the resources so you can.


She is introducing bills. She’s giving speeches. She’s doing whatever she can to call attention to the way the entire domestic violence safety net is at risk as a result of actions of the Trump administration. All of these things, though, are also ways for her to not dwell on her past and what she has survived.
“I’m focused on living and helping people and helping people learn how to live through what we lived through,” she said. “Every person has strengths within themselves. Nobody has to put up with someone beating them or mentally abusing them or abusing them in any way. But we have to give people community places that people can go to get the help they need to escape it. We have to do the training in the community to identify where the problem is occurring, so that you can help get people out.”
She looked me squarely in the eye as she asserted what she wanted me to most know that day: “I’m not a victim. As my sister said, if we can help anybody escape what we went through, we should and that’s why I talk about it. But why bring up memories that only will make me not sleep tonight?”
She was emphatic about the crux of her message: “You can have a life. You can. And we have to help get you the resources so you can.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/AMR_0190-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-29 08:56:44.789860

Reno City Council last week gave city staff the green light to review its existing child care ordinances and offer amendments, which will have to go through a public feedback process before being considered by the city’s zoning commission and then city council. There is no set timeline for when any future ordinance might be considered.
The review was requested by Councilmember Kathleen Taylor, who said a constituent came to her and said the city needs more child care. Taylor said her initial reaction was “we don’t really do child care at the City of Reno,” but after speaking to the city manager she recognized there are some things that can be done “within the confines of what the city does.”
Grace Mackedon, a senior management analyst with the city, told council members that her staff does not have specific changes in mind but will review best practices in other cities and collect feedback to see what barriers can be reduced for existing or prospective child care providers.
“We’re going to look at: Can we streamline that (permitting) process?” Mackedon said. “Is there anything else we can do to make it easier?”
In-home providers and businesses that offer on-site child care for their employees pay the city around $4,300 when applying for a minor use permit, and there is no guarantee of approval. The city’s review process takes about 30 days.
Standalone child care facilities pay around $5,000 for a conditional use permit when in residential zones, and the review processing time is 65 days.
“That’s a risk for the child care providers because they’re investing that time, investing that money, not knowing if they’ll get approval,” said Mackedon. “Can we put standards in code so they know that, if we follow these standards, we know we’ll get approval?”
Seven organizations, including The Children’s Cabinet, United Way of Northern Nevada and the Sierra, and Children’s Advocacy Alliance, expressed support for Reno revisiting the local zoning ordinances.
“Child care is an everybody problem,” Tara Raines, deputy director of Children’s Advocacy Alliance, told the Nevada Current.
Child advocates often focus on federal and state policies that they believe will have the greatest impact on families, like the federal child tax credit, which was temporarily expanded under the Biden administration but whose accessibility will constrict under the Trump administration. But efforts at every level of government are helpful, say advocates.
The 2025 legislative session saw some efforts to expand the availability of child care, but most proposals failed. One bill that would have prevented home owners associations from prohibiting licensed home-based child care providers was vetoed by Gov. Joe Lombardo. A proposal to adopt universal pre-K was proposed by Senate Majority Leader Nicole Cannizzaro but was scaled back to become dependent on available funding after the state’s economic outlook deteriorated.
Raines notes that cities are heavily involved in recruiting businesses and often offer incentives in the name of spurring development. They could incentivize companies that offer workplace-based child care options.
“We’re seeing more people make the business case for child care,” she added.
A 2023 business survey conducted by the Nevada Governor’s Office of Workforce Innovation found that half of businesses said employees and potential hires have expressed child care as a barrier to work. Nearly all – 94.5% – of respondents believed greater access to child care could improve their business by improving workforce retention.
Raines recalled seeing a recent social media post from a Las Vegas parent saying they had no child care for an elementary-aged child. The parent wanted to know what people thought the best option was: quitting, getting fired, or leaving a 7-year-old home alone for a full shift. The child was enrolled in a summer program but the parent wrote they didn’t have enough money to pay for the upcoming week.
Having to make these sorts of mental calculations in your head isn’t an anomaly for families across the state.
“It happens all the time,” said Raines. “If you want to be able to check out your groceries at the store, have someone make sure your utilities are working, get your oil changed, get your food served… child care is a community issue.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1385208719-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-29 08:56:44.789860

A U.S. District Court judge ruled that the U.S. Department of Labor violated the law when it terminated contracts with organizations that managed 99 JOb Corps centers throughout the country, including two in Alabama. (Official Department of Labor photograph)A federal judge on Friday prohibited the U.S. Department of Labor from terminating management contracts for 99 of 124 Jobs Corps Centers in the country, keeping the centers in Gadsden and Montgomery open in Alabama for the time being.
U.S. District Judge Dabney L. Friedrich of the District of Columbia wrote that the department violated the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) in closing the centers down.
“The WIOA requires DOL to engage in certain procedures — including a period of notice and comment — before closing any Job Corps center,” Friedrich said in her ruling. “The Department failed to comply with these statutory requirements.”
According to the accompanying news release, a federal district court in New York issued a ruling to halt the closures at the end of June but then narrowed the application of the preliminary injunction to prevent the closing of only 31 job centers while allowing the rest to close in light of the decision by the U.S. Supreme Court in Trump v. CASA Inc. that limits the use of preliminary injunctions by lower courts.
Job Corps was established in 1964 by President Lyndon Johnson to provide not only education and job training, but also a place to live for low income individuals.
This ruling halts the closures once more and allows students who are lower income to continue receiving benefits and education.
“This program has consistently reduced unemployment and homelessness, empowered underserved communities — especially for Black and Brown youth—and breaks the cycle of poverty through education, training, and opportunity,” said Scott McCoy, deputy legal director of Southern Poverty Law Center, which sued to block the closures.  “Now is the time to double down: Job Corps is a direct investment in our nation’s future which must be protected, expanded, and fully funded to deliver on its promise of equity and upward mobility.”
In a statement Monday Montgomery Mayor Steven Reed called the ruling “a big win for Montgomery and all of Alabama.”
“Job Corps isn’t just a program — it’s a lifeline,” the statement said. “It creates opportunity, reduces unemployment, and gives hope to those who need it most.”
A message was left with the national and regional office of the Department of Labor on Friday seeking comment. 
The lawsuit is one among many challenging the Trump administration’s attempt to eliminate federal education and training initiatives.
Russell T. Vought, director of the Office of Management and Budget, wrote in a May letter to Congress that the administration was eliminating the Job Corps program.
The lawsuit states that the Department of Labor did not follow a prescribed process to eliminate the Job Corps program.
Students enrolled in the program, including Anaria Cabrera, one of the named plaintiffs, would be able to continue with their education. Cabrera is currently studying to obtain a certified nursing assistance degree and was told that she must leave the center.
The department argued that  it was only pausing the operations at the centers and not eliminating them and claimed the plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge them.
Montgomery Mayor Steve Reed said the ruling is a win for the city and will ensure that more young people will have access to training and education.
“Job Corps isn’t just a program — it’s a lifeline,” Reed said. “It creates opportunity, reduces unemployment, and gives hope to those who need it most. We’re thankful for this decision, but the fight isn’t over. We need permanent support to protect these vital centers for the future.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Frances-Perkins-building-for-Aug-20-2024-story-1024x680.jpg,,,2025-07-29 08:56:44.789860

The subject? Democrats.
After disappointing results in November, Kansas state House Democrats are touring the Republican-leaning state, trying to improve relationships and set the stage for a comeback. Pittsburg, a college town of 20,500 in the southeastern corner of the state, elected a Democratic state representative as recently as 2018 before choosing a Republican in the past three elections.
“Your guys’s messaging sucks,” local resident Justin Mcelwain told a panel of state Democratic lawmakers during the Q&A portion of the town hall-style event last Thursday, adding that when it comes to getting their points across, Democrats “are not even in the same sphere as the right wing.”
Earlier, Mcelwain had raised his hand along with a handful of others to indicate he had never before attended a political event.
During a brief interview, he described his political views as “so far to the left that guns are cool again.” What Democrats need to do, he said, is repeatedly emphasize the effects of President Donald Trump’s and Republicans’ policies.
“They need to drive it home and hold on to that forever — that your life, over the next five, 10 years or whatever, all the decline in your quality of life is a direct result of the Republican Party,” Mcelwain said.
Some state-level Democrats believe Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act provides a perfect opening.
Trump signed the massive tax cuts and spending legislation into law on Independence Day. The sweeping measure cuts more than $1 trillion from Medicaid, the safety net insurance program funded jointly by the federal government and states. It slashes spending on food assistance and green energy programs and cuts taxes in a way that overwhelmingly benefits the wealthiest earners.
In Kansas and a majority of states, Republicans dominate the legislature, with many increasingly tying themselves to the Make America Great Again movement. As Democrats search for a path back to power, both at the federal and state levels, they are seizing on Trump’s signature legislation six months into his second term as a major rallying cry.
“Let’s not even get started about the one big beautiful awful bill,” Kansas state House Minority Leader Brandon Woodard told the Pittsburg crowd.
A few audience members groaned in agreement.
Trump’s sweeping law is an opportunity, Kansas Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly, who chairs the Democratic Governors Association, said in an interview with Stateline. Portions of it “are so obviously cruel and detrimental to so many people,” she said. Reductions to Medicaid and food assistance, for example, will cut across party lines.
Kelly said Republicans already appear worried about the political consequences: She pointed to efforts by U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, to repeal some of the federal cuts to the safety net health program.
“I do think that they’re very concerned, as they should be,” Kelly said. “And I hope that the public stays engaged, stays informed, continues to protest as they have been, and that those of us in positions to educate and inform take that role very seriously.”
 ‘Not a bumper sticker bill’

The law’s enactment comes as Democrats have been searching for a compelling message. They’re trying to connect with disaffected voters after Trump and Republicans attacked the party last year as elitist and out of touch, and they’re highlighting Trump’s actions since his inauguration.
But amid a daily barrage of Trump developments, the party has been pulled in a multitude of directions — spotlighting everything from violent immigration raids to Trump’s connections to convicted child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
Earlier this month, the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, which works to elect Democrats at the state level, launched ads in several states with upcoming competitive legislative races slamming Republicans “for selling us out” with Trump’s tax and spending law.
The group is focusing heavily on New Jersey and Virginia, the two states with legislative and gubernatorial races in the fall. In 2026, it will target swing states including Michigan and Wisconsin, but also divided states, such as Kansas, North Carolina and Pennsylvania, that have Democratic governors but Republican control of one or both legislative chambers.
Nevada Assembly Speaker Steve Yeager, a board member of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, said Republicans have failed to live up to the rhetoric of the 2024 race that focused largely on lowering costs, presenting a “big opportunity” for his party.
In his state, Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo is expected to face one of the nation’s most competitive gubernatorial races next year.
Yeager said Nevada Democrats will tell voters about the “complicity” of Republicans at the state level — and share a positive vision of Democratic priorities.
“I think Democrats in Nevada and nationwide are a little more clear-eyed in terms of what our objective is and should be, and that’s just to help people with the day-to-day issues that they face,” he said.
State Democrats may also look to a GOP strategy from 15 years ago.
Chris Cooper, a professor of political science and public affairs at Western Carolina University, wondered whether Democrats would employ Trump’s “big, beautiful” law against Republicans the way the GOP used President Barack Obama’s signature health care law against his allies.
“Is this going to become the Republican version of Obamacare?” Cooper asked. Despite proving popular over time, the passage of the Affordable Care Act was initially a political albatross for Democrats, who lost hundreds of seats in statehouses in 2010, Cooper said.
But at hundreds of pages long, Trump’s federal legislation will require lots of education for voters to fully appreciate the implications to taxes, social services and immigration. And many of the deepest cuts won’t be felt for months or years, with Republicans setting up the cuts to go into effect after the midterm elections.
“It’s not a bumper sticker bill,” Cooper said.
“The Democratic strategy can’t just be, ‘Remember what happened,’” he said. “First they have to teach people what happened, and then they have to work to assign blame, and then they have to work to mobilize that blame to their benefit.”
In Pennsylvania, officials expect more than 300,000 residents to lose health coverage through Medicaid cuts and over 140,000 to lose food assistance. Pennsylvania Democratic state Sen. Vincent Hughes said Republicans will be held accountable for that devastation in next year’s state races.
“The very loud silence coming from Republican elected officials, MAGA elected officials, Trump-loving elected officials all across the country, that will be spoken about, that will be talked about, because their silence screamed volumes,” Hughes said. “They chose to look the other way, knowing the kind of damage this would do.”
For their part, national Republicans have sought to frame the law as a major win because of its deep tax cuts and huge influx of spending on immigration enforcement. At the state level, the messaging has so far been more mixed. In May, 20 of the nation’s 27 GOP governors signed a letter in support of the bill.
The Republican Legislative Campaign Committee, the party’s state committee, did not respond to Stateline’s requests for comment.
Michigan state Sen. Aric Nesbitt, former chair of the committee, said that Democrats “will feel the consequences next year” of opposing Trump’s bill. The minority leader of Michigan’s state Senate, Nesbitt is running to be the GOP’s nominee for governor.
“Democrats walked the political plank by voting for a $2,000 tax increase on working families, for allowing illegal immigrants to continue collecting Medicaid, against eliminating taxes on tips, overtime & Social security benefits, for [former President Joe] Biden’s war on American energy & against enforcing our immigration laws,” he wrote in a statement to Stateline.
 Democrats ‘fight back’

This summer, Kansas House Democrats have embarked on a “Fight Back” tour across the state, visiting communities where the party has struggled in recent years.
“We’re going to places that unless there’s someone representing them as a Democrat, we’re being defined by cable news as to what a Democrat is,” Woodard, the Kansas House minority leader, told Stateline.
In Pittsburg, some Democrats said they are unsure whether the federal tax and spending law will help shake loose Republicans’ grip locally.
Janice Arthur, a lifelong Democrat who retired after working in the customer service industry, refused to say Trump’s name as she spoke about the legislation, declaring there’s “nothing about the current occupant of the White House that I agree with or I appreciate.”
When asked whether the law would cause her Republican friends and neighbors to vote for Democrats, she voiced uncertainty. “I don’t know,” she said.
Pittsburg was historically a Democratic stronghold in Republican-leaning Kansas. The party lost substantial ground locally over the past two decades, until the last Democratic state representative failed to win reelection in 2020. Last year, the city’s Democratic candidate for the state House received just 40% of the vote.
But these are the kinds of races Kansas Democrats will have to win if they want to break the Republican supermajority in the state legislature and, one day, take control of a chamber — something that hasn’t happened since the 1990s. Democrats need to flip five seats in 2026 to end the Republicans’ veto-proof majority in the House.
Emily Walters, who chairs the Crawford County Democratic Party, which includes Pittsburg, said many voters locally cast ballots for the first time last year, enthusiastic about what she called “the image” they have of Trump. They voted Republican down the ballot, she said.
“My suspicion is … they are being quickly disillusioned by the reality of Donald Trump,” Walters said. “And without that artificial buoyancy, I think that Crawford County has a very good shot of reverting to its blue self.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/SteveYeager-3-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-07-29 08:56:44.789860

Research suggests police officers experience about three traumatic events every six months — roughly 180 over a 30-year career — compared with just one over a lifetime for about half of U.S. adults. (Photo by Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images)Police officers may face hundreds of traumatic incidents over the course of their careers, but many still hesitate to seek mental health support when they need it.
Despite growing investments in wellness programs by law enforcement agencies across the country, a recent study of just over 100 surveyed officers from the Fargo Police Department in North Dakota found that stigma remains a major barrier to mental health care for officers.
The study found that 60% of surveyed officers said most of their peers wouldn’t disclose a mental health condition to a colleague, and nearly three-quarters believed officers wouldn’t tell a supervisor. Slightly more than half agreed that most officers would expect to face discrimination at work if they disclosed they were experiencing mental illness.
Carol Archbold, the study’s author and a criminal justice professor at North Dakota State University, said officers may avoid disclosing mental health struggles because doing so also conflicts with societal expectations that they remain strong and unemotional.
“The nature of [police officers’] work really, really makes it difficult and important for them to have services available and for them to actually utilize them,” Archbold told  Stateline, adding that departments also need to foster a culture in which officers feel comfortable using the support available to them.
Departments across the country have expanded access to services like counseling, peer support, therapy, substance use programs, and on-site gyms in response to growing concerns about post-traumatic stress disorder or PTSD, depression, and suicide among officers.  The Fargo Police Department, for example, hired its first-ever health and wellness coordinator last year.
While the department offers a wide range of mental health-related services and programs, the study found that relatively few officers are using them.
Eighty-four percent of surveyed officers were aware of the department’s new health and wellness coordinator, but only 22 had interacted with them, and 19 found the interaction helpful. About 68% knew about the Employee Assistance Program; 20 had used it, with 17 reporting it was helpful. Awareness of the peer support program was higher at 93%, yet only 42 officers had used it, and 36 said it was helpful.
Still, stigma and fears about career repercussions may discourage some officers from using such services.
About half of all U.S. adults will experience at least one traumatic event in their lifetimes, although most will not develop PTSD, according to the National Institute of Mental Health. For police officers, the rate of exposure is significantly higher. Research suggests police officers may experience about three traumatic events every six months, or roughly 180 over a 30-year career.
Repeated exposure to traumatic events has been linked to a wide range of health problems in first responders, including poor sleep quality, depression, alcohol misuse, and a heightened risk of PTSD.
In the Fargo survey, 53% of officers agreed that most police officers view being treated for a mental illness as a sign of personal weakness and would not seek professional help if they were experiencing mental health problems.
Forty percent believed that having a history of mental illness would harm an officer’s chances for promotion. Many officers disagreed with the idea that mental illness would lead to mistrust or social exclusion among peers. Sixty-four percent of officers disagreed with statements suggesting that most officers would avoid partnering with or think less of a colleague who had experienced a mental illness.
While agencies have expanded mental health resources in recent years, the study’s findings suggest that organizational culture remains a key factor in whether officers feel comfortable using those services.
The U.S. law enforcement system includes more than 17,000 federal, state, county, and local agencies. While smaller and rural departments may be less likely to offer robust mental health services, Archbold said that does not reflect a lack of interest from leadership. Many departments — regardless of size — struggle to meet officer wellness needs within existing budgets and often must seek additional funding to support mental health programs.
“It’s likely that police chiefs would like to have these services available, but they just don’t have the money to be able to do that – to provide those services,” Archbold said.

With due respect to Julie Wasserman, the Green Mountain Care Board using its legal authority to regulate what has become a de facto public utility is not a bold solution. It is what the board was created to do and should be supported in doing year in and year out.  
I believe the University of Vermont Health Network chose to pursue monopoly market power and has used that to force the highest payor reimbursement rates in the country (the “rescues” of smaller practices and hospitals were purely driven by revenue side economies of scale — there were no savings on the cost side). 
Now there is no choice but to regulate them as such. This is authority given by the Legislature to a board charged with such regulation. That is not a bold solution.

A bold solution? Force the hospital into receivership and bring in competent operational leadership to lower costs across the network. Publicly guarantee the University of Vermont Medical Center debt rating to eliminate the need for cash reserves to hold that debt rating. Sell the hospital to a private group with ownership split between private equity, hospital employees, and the state and community.  
Regulating the University of Vermont Medical Center is not a bold solution and should not be messaged that way.
But yes — this tragedy needs bold solutions and we need to start making some bold changes.

During her 2022 trip to Israel, Rep. Victoria Spartz, R-5th, and her husband stayed in the five-star David Citadel Hotel in Jerusalem and spent an average of $485 per day on meals alone.
Indiana’s representatives saw little expense spared during international trips paid for with special interest groups’ money.
Members of Indiana’s U.S. House of Representatives delegation and their staffers have accepted roughly $640,000 in privately sponsored international travel since 2020, an Arnolt Center for Investigative Journalism analysis of travel disclosures found. 
Six current and former representatives took 26 international trips in those five years, according to congressional travel disclosures, and sent staff members on nine global getaways. Representatives and their staffers took over 138 domestic and international trips sponsored by private organizations for a total cost of over $760,000.
 The Arnolt Center’s review of travel disclosures found:


Baird traveled the most internationally among Indiana’s representatives, taking 10 trips in five years to Israel, United Kingdom, Kenya, Japan, Australia, South Africa, Colombia, Ireland, Spain and Italy, costing $201,133.
Bucshon’s weeklong $35,000 trip to Japan in 2024, was the most expensive. Bucshon and his wife stayed at the Okura Tokyo, a five-star hotel, and ate at fine dining restaurants like NOBU Tokyo on the trip, according to travel disclosures. 
Spousal travel for Baird, Houchin, Spartz, Yakym, Bucshon and Rep. Marlin Stutzman, R-3rd, accounted for more than $274,000 worth of privately sponsored travel.
Rep. Andre Carson, D-7th and Rep. Jefferson Shreve, R-6th; plus former Reps. Jim Banks, R-3rd, and Jackie Walorski, R-2nd, did not travel internationally during the last five years, but sent staffers to Somaliland, Gambia, Mexico, Japan and Israel.
Reps. Frank Mrvan, D-1st, and Mark Messmer, R-8th, did not take or send staffers on international trips.

A 2024 investigation by The Howard Center for Investigative Journalism at the University of Maryland and Boston University found lobbyists use loopholes to fund international and domestic trips for representatives, their families and congressional staffers.
House rules prohibit representatives from knowingly accepting privately funded travel or gifts from registered lobbyists or foreign agents, but interest groups commonly create charitable nonprofit arms to continue sponsoring congressional travel.
Senators are subject to similar regulations for accepting gift travel, but the Senate Ethics Committee does not make the travel filings available. 

This story was written by journalists at the Arnolt Center for Investigative Journalism at Indiana University. Zoe Benson, tanka dhakal, Jon Eckert, Edith Morales, Ethan Roberts and Taylor Satoski are students with the Arnolt Center.

Don Fox, former acting director and general counsel of the U.S. Office of Government Ethics, said privately sponsored travel for representatives, especially to luxurious destinations with their spouses, is designed to buy access. 
“(Sponsors) get access to lawmakers that you would not otherwise get if you had to schedule an appointment in Washington, D.C.,” he said.
He said that the interests of trip sponsors may impact future votes cast by the representatives. 
“(If) you’re there as a lawmaker, sitting in a committee. It may be a lot harder to cast a vote that is against the wishes of somebody that’s just hosted you and your spouse at an all-inclusive resort than it is somebody with whom you’ve not developed any sort of relationship,” Fox said.  
While lawmakers and their spouses enjoy comfortable accommodations on international trips, experts say these trips may still serve a key function for their official duties. 
Michael Leppert, a former lobbyist and current professor at Indiana University, said congressional travel can offer unique insights into issues that only reading about them may not provide. 
“Actually seeing the issue with your own eyes, touching with your own hands, actually has a big impact,” Leppert said. “Oftentimes, multiple sides of an issue will argue about the reality, and it’s always going to be better if the policymaker can see it and form their own opinion.”
Lawmakers meet with officials, sponsors get access
Zachary McGee, a political science professor at Kenyon College, said congressional travel started for the purpose of being a check on the executive branch. While the executive branch represents the country internationally, the legislative branch plays a crucial role in the country’s foreign relations.
“I do think there’s a legitimate reason for us as Americans to support our members of Congress gathering information on their own in the face of the executive branch no matter who’s in it,” McGee said. “Do they need to stay in the Four Seasons when they do it? No. But in my mind, those are separate questions.”
Discussions during the trips regularly focus on economic relations, national security and U.S. foreign policy by having meetings with government, business and cultural leaders, according to travel itineraries.

Spartz met with Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, as well as diplomatic and economic representatives, and received a tour of the Al-Rayyan World Cup Stadium during her 2021 trip to Qatar. The United States Qatar Business Council paid nearly $13,000 for the transportation, food and five nights at the Four Seasons Doha. 
“The Congresswoman periodically participates in official CODELs as part of her work in the House to address foreign policy and conduct oversight, which are part of her congressional duties and responsibilities to the people she represents,” Spartz’s office said in a written statement.
CODELs are congressional delegations that travel internationally and are funded by the government — not privately sponsored trips like Spartz’s trips to Qatar and Israel. Her office did not comment on privately sponsored travel. 
No other representatives agreed to comment for this story.
Steve Dorsey, head of communications and public affairs at the International Committee of the Red Cross acknowledged, in a written statement, that the group organizes trips for staff members of representatives. The organization funded a 2023 trip to Azerbaijan, Georgia and Armenia for Baird’s legislative director. 
“They enable offices to gain a firsthand understanding of ICRC’s unique role as a neutral and independent humanitarian organization providing protection and assistance to vulnerable populations in conflict settings,” Dorsey said.
Travel disclosures listed 22 sponsor organizations, and only the International Committee of the Red Cross and the Rockefeller Foundation responded to a request for comment. The Rockefeller Foundation provides facilities during trips organized by the Aspen Institute.
While the purpose of these trips is expressly educational, Beth Rosenson, a political science professor at the University of Florida, said that parts of the excursions only seem loosely related to their stated purposes.
“I’m sure some learning goes on, but certainly they build in a lot of time to do things that are not primarily educational,” Rosenson said. 
Craig Holman, a public-interest lobbyist at Public Citizen, said organizations want to peddle influence, so they send representatives on trips to nice places. He said providing travel is far more influential than a lobbyist showing up at the office.
“Privately sponsored travel is usually designed to try and influence the opinions of lawmakers,” Holman said. “It’s most effective when it can be done at a very pleasant resort under nice conditions with your spouse.” 
Luxurious outings are ‘pure influence peddling’
Some international trips are not tailored exclusively to meetings with ambassadors or representatives. 
In November 2024, the Franklin Center for Global Policy Exchange and the Ripon Society hosted Houchin, Yakym, Bucshon, and their spouses in Vienna. Indiana representatives engaged in panels and roundtable discussions on U.S. foreign relations. 
Representatives and their spouses also attended events loosely justified by the educational purpose of the trip. The second day of the Austria trip included a two-hour visit to the Spanish Riding School, where they watched a demonstration of the world-famous Lipizzaner horses in an 18th Century baroque palace.
State agencies spend $5 million on travel in 2024 fiscal year 

“I see it as pure expense and pure influence peddling,” Leppert said. “And coming from someone who used to pedal influence, that’s clearly what some of these trips are.”
The Aspen Institute and Rockefeller Foundation sponsored a five-day trip to a Lake Como retreat in Bellagio, Italy for Baird and his wife in April of 2023. Travel disclosure documents referenced security as a key factor in choosing the location. On the trip, Baird met with executives of the organizations and attended a roundtable discussion that highlighted philanthropic efforts made by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
The Republican Main Street Partnership in 2024 paid $22,722 per representative for Houchin and Bucshon to travel to Florence and Rome, Italy. Attendees received 13 hours of privately guided tours, with stops at the Ferrari factory, the Colosseum and the Vatican, according to travel disclosures. 
Seven hours of the trip were designated for official meetings and “stakeholder presentations,” according to travel disclosures.
Bucshon and his wife received more than $600 a day on food alone in Italy according to his travel disclosure.
The American Israel Education Foundation sponsored separate trips to Israel for Spartz, Baird and Yakym, which included stays at five-star hotels costing an average of $396 per night. The trips all included tours of the Western Wall, The Church of the Holy Sepulchre and Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial and Museum. Congressional delegates met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant, as well as the director of Mossad, Israel’s intelligence agency.
Baird and his wife stayed at two separate five-star hotels during an August 2024 trip to Ireland. Their stay at the Westbury Hotel in Dublin cost $449 per night and the Merchant Hotel in Belfast cost $315 per night, according to travel disclosures.
Little impact at home with representatives away
Indiana representatives rarely issued press releases or public statements explaining the benefit of the sponsored international trips. The Arnolt Center reviewed representatives’ websites looking for connections to international destinations for mentions of the countries they visited.
“Travel provides the members of Congress with the opportunity to get to know their constituents and vice versa,” Holman said. “When we talk about foreign travel, it usually doesn’t provide constituents with much benefit.” 
One exception was Baird and Bucshon’s meetings with the Congressional Study Group on Japan’s Business Advisory Council with executives from Honda and Toyota. Both companies operate assembly plants in Indiana.
After Carson’s staff trip to Somaliland, he signed a letter to then-Secretary of State Antony Blinken urging the State Department to establish an embassy in the region as a part of his role on the Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).

Following Baird, Yakym and Spartz’s trips to Israel, the representatives all posted on social media about their continued support for an American-Israeli alliance. The three representatives have no references to any other international travel they took sponsored by private organizations, the Arnolt Center found.
Rosenson said representatives in competitive electoral districts tend to travel less to avoid electoral blowback.
“Constituents don’t think highly of this,” Rosenson said. “The average constituent thinks this is some trip that I’m not going to go on, this is bad news, this is unsavory. And that might be one reason they vote against the legislators.”
Expert: Reform efforts lacking
In 2007, Congress passed the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act, which Holman helped write, to restrict lobbying groups’ ability to fund congressional travel. 
“We saw a radical decrease in privately sponsored travel after 2008, by about two-thirds,” Holman said. “They’ve increased in time, but they’re not at the level they used to be prior to 2008.” 
The House Clerk’s Office is only required to publish travel data for the last six years.
The attempt at reform created a new loophole and allowed 501(c)(4) political action organizations to make charitable arms to continue paying for trips. The American Israel Public Affairs Committee, for example, created a 501(c)(3) charity arm that allowed it to fund congressional travel while keeping lobbyists involved, which Holman called the “AIPAC loophole.” 
Restrictions on privately funded travel still exist, but Holman said he expects congressional travel rules to weaken as special interest groups and Congress try to loosen them. 
Holman said he’s concerned about Congress’ self-policing of travel rules and the lack of an independent body to oversee ethics concerns outside of the House Committee on Ethics. 
“It’s up to watchdog groups to catch the abuses,” Holman said. “The Congressional Ethics Committee are members of Congress themselves overseeing their fellow colleagues. So, they are not great ethics cops.”
McGee said while there is significant oversight in the details of planned travel itineraries, there is no legitimate oversight about whether the itineraries are followed.
“We’ve got to figure out where to draw the line between allowing members of Congress to accept some travel and trying to eliminate the role of lobbyists and influence peddling out of these types of free trips,” Holman said. “It’s a difficult line to draw.”

The money is part of multistate settlements with Purdue Pharma, Alvogen, Amneal, Apotex, Hikma, Indivior, Mylan, Sun, and Zydus. 
The Purdue Pharma settlement was announced on June 16. The other eight settlements were announced July 10. 
Signups for local governments to get in on the settlements opened Monday. While there is no deadline to join the $16.7 million settlement with the eight generic opioid manufacturers, the deadline to join the $105.5 million settlement with Purdue Pharma is Sept. 30. 
The attorney general’s office encourages local governments to sign up for all nine settlements and complete other related paperwork at the same time.
These settlements will be paid out over 15 years, with much of the funding distributed in the first three years. 
If all eligible city and county governments join the settlements, it would raise the total amount of money the attorney general’s office has won from opioid manufacturers to $1.3 billion. 
This money is designated for programs that combat the opioid epidemic, support first responders, build treatment clinics, and provide overdose reversal kits.
In 2024, fatal overdoses in Washington totaled 3,137, according to preliminary data released in June by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That marked an 11% decline from the prior year, but the deaths were still 14% higher than in 2022.
The powerful synthetic opioid fentanyl has driven increases in fatal overdoses in recent years.
“Companies made millions while our communities were harmed because of the opioid epidemic,” Attorney General Nick Brown said in a statement on Monday. “These funds can help save lives and support community projects across the state.”
Under the terms of an agreement, city and county governments will collectively receive 50% of Washington’s share of the settlement, and the state government will receive the other 50%. 
Of the state’s $61.1 million share, 20% will go to Washington’s tribal communities. 
Cities and counties split the money based on a formula developed through the One Washington Memorandum of Understanding, according to the attorney general’s office. Cities are eligible for funds based on their size from 2019 U.S. Census Bureau estimates. 
A total of 129 local governments in Washington are eligible for settlement funding. If all of them sign up for the nine settlements, each local government would receive between $18,300 and $840,000. 
As with the prior opioid settlements, the new amounts are contingent on eligible cities and counties in Washington state joining. If not enough cities and counties join, the settlement is void, according to the Brown’s office. 
“For every other prior opioid settlement, 100% of eligible counties and cities in Washington have joined, and we’re hopeful the same thing will happen this time,” said Ashley Goss, spokesperson for the attorney general’s Office. 
Lower participation by local governments reduces the portion the state receives, according to Goss.  
The Attorney General’s Office is maintaining a tracker showing the status of eligible governments’ signup forms. The tracker will be updated every few weeks initially and then more often as the Sept. 30 deadline nears.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/opioids-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-29 07:56:17.739876
,Mississippi Today,2025-07-29 11:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,"Saving for a future, paying for a funeral: Why are many families of young crime victims shut out of state compensation?",Leonardo Bevilacqua,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/07/29/many-families-of-crime-victims-shut-out-of-state-compensation/,Mississippi has one of the highest denial rates in the country for crime victim compensation attributed to “contributory misconduct.”,"Lucinda Wade-Robinson watched her 22-year-old son, Zachary, hit the pavement feet from her front door on April 28, 2014. She saw the shooter and his friends hightail it to the highway. She helped her son into a neighbor’s car as he bled out. After he was pronounced dead at a hospital and investigators processed the crime scene in her front yard, she says she waited weeks for the fire department to bleach his blood from her bullet-strewn driveway.
Wade-Robinson, worried she wouldn’t be able to cover the $8,000 funeral bill, applied in Hinds County for help from Mississippi’s victim compensation program, a fund that each state has to reimburse victims of crime and their families for funeral expenses, medical costs, crime scene clean-up, execution travel and counseling, among other disbursements. 
A funeral home director told Wade-Robinson about it and suggested she apply. But the state attorney general’s office, which administers the program, denied her claim, alleging her son was responsible for his death, a type of denial known as contributory misconduct. 
“It was a nightmare,” said Wade-Robinson.
Mississippi’s definition of what kind of conduct contributes to one’s death is broader than most states, and a Mississippi Today investigation found that Wade-Robinson’s denial is not unusual. Mississippi has one of the highest rates of denials attributed to “contributory misconduct” when compared to other states, with about 6% of all applicants getting denied for this reason.
Mississippi’s overall denial rate is 42%, for years 2021 to 2024. From 2021 to 2023, roughly 2% of claims were reduced.
Arkansas, West Virginia and South Dakota have similar outcomes, with all four states rejecting for contributory misconduct at roughly three times the national average, according to federal data collected between 2017 and 2023.
It’s the language of the law that makes Mississippi unique, according to Jeremy Levine, a professor of sociology at the University of Michigan who’s published research on victim compensation. If the victim makes “threatening and obscene gestures,” uses “fighting words,” even if the behavior was not directly connected to the circumstances of the person’s death, they would be ruled ineligible for compensation. The law also asks administrators of the fund to consider the victim’s behavior in the weeks leading up to their death.
The law is broad and open to interpretation, particularly when it comes to blaming victims for inciting their own killing.
“The provocation point is really fuzzy,” said Levine, and Mississippi “is on the top end of vagueness and discretionary openness.”
More than a third of compensation applicants in Hinds County were denied reimbursement from 2021 through 2024, according to records obtained by Mississippi Today. The attorney general’s office rejected 169 claims because of administrative rules like contributory misconduct. It approved 291 claims with a payment.
Mississippi’s victim compensation records are secret, according to a law enacted in 2000, meaning there is no way to assess racial and geographic bias in verdicts. And while these types of denials are falling nationwide, according to federal records, they are increasing in Mississippi, the poorest state with the highest homicide rate per capita.

“A lot of these exceptions make assumptions about communities and blame victims for their own deaths,” said Rep. John Hines, a Democrat from Greenville, a city with one of the highest gun homicide rates in the state.
The attorney general’s office chose not to provide comment. A spokesperson from the Office of Justice Programs in the U.S. Department of Justice wrote that eligibility requirements are at the discretion of states.
The attorney general paid victims an average of $1,877 less in 2024. The average claim was $2,459.
Contributory misconduct rejections can present an arbitrary barrier to financial help for victims of crime, said Tina Rogers, a victim assistance coordinator in Columbus, Mississippi.
“It is subjective and can be skewed depending on the type of crime,” wrote Rogers.
Not innocent enough

Wade-Robinson didn’t leave her house after her son’s death. Zachary Robinson had still been living in the family home; his sudden absence was painful. She was spending more quiet afternoons replaying the killing she watched take place from behind her front door.
Wade-Robinson appealed the contributory misconduct denial. As she waited for an answer, the prosecutor informed her that charges would not be pursued against her son’s alleged shooter and the six men who accompanied him. The Jackson Police Department determined Robinson’s murder was a self-defense killing. The victim compensation director swiftly issued a second denial letter, citing the department’s finding.
“It was like being victimized again,” Wade-Robinson said. 
Wade-Robinson was hurt. Seven men had come to their house with weapons, she said. After one man came to their door to threaten his mother, Robinson carried a concealed weapon outside and yelled at the men to leave their house, Wade-Robinson remembers. In return, they shot him. And as the seven men sped off, her son’s friend, Lamont Ford, returned fire.
Mississippi has a castle doctrine or “stand your ground” law. But the attorney general’s hearing officer felt it didn’t apply.
“Although the Hearing Officer certainly recognizes Victim’s Second Amendment right to bear arms, Victim was clearly the initial aggressor and his display of a firearm in this circumstance caused another individual to fear imminent death,” the hearing officer said.
Local law enforcement must typically summarize the victim’s involvement in the crime and fill out a document that asks if the victim’s behavior in any way contributed to the person’s death because of drugs and alcohol or fighting words. When it comes to how law enforcement officers interpret how and if a victim’s conduct led to the individual’s death, rationale varies by department and agency.
Law enforcement initially charged Ford, Robinson’s friend, with murder in Robinson’s death, but an assistant district attorney in that office couldn’t explain why. The charge was downgraded to shooting into a dwelling. Ford’s shots missed, entering a nearby home and a delivery driver’s car.
Wade-Robinson didn’t miss a day of the trial. And when the jury found Ford not guilty, Wade-Robinson requested that the victim compensation division reconsider its denial of her claim.
On March 31, 2016, at a private hearing held at the attorney general’s office in Jackson, Wade-Robinson’s claim was denied for the second and final time. The hearing officer cited her son’s “displaying of his weapon” and his refusal to call the police. They also cited his decision to drive to his home where two cars of potential adversaries were parked. 
“He was acting in a provoking manner that was greater than that of the offender,” testified Amy King, director of Crime Victim Compensation. “Robinson had used fighting words and obscene and threatening gestures based on the information that we received. And whether or not there was a causal relationship between his actions and the incident, I determined that there were.”
“So, I did find some level of responsibility on his part,” she added.
Being under the influence and taking risks isn’t behavior that would lead to outright denials by victim compensation programs in most other states.
The director also mentioned Robinson’s gun possession. 
Mississippi has the most relaxed gun laws in the country. During the pandemic, then-Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba tried to temporarily ban open carry of firearms in the wake of increased violence only to have Attorney General Lynn Fitch ask him to rescind it because it was in violation of the state’s open carry law.
During the trial of Lamont Ford, witnesses were grilled about their gun possession too. 
“I fear for my life when I come to Jackson,” said one of the witnesses. “I always keep a gun in my car.”

‘A national disgrace’
Some advocates, academics and victims argue Mississippi’s crime victim compensation division has failed to live up to the vision set forth by its chief architect, President Ronald Reagan.
In 1982, Reagan assembled a task force that looked into how national, local and state policies treat crime victims. The task force found treatment of crime victims to be a “national disgrace.” 
Reagan signed the Victims of Crime Act into law two years later, which established a fund for each state to disperse to “innocent” victims of crime. In 1991, Mississippi established its division responsible for dispersing money. 
Since establishment of the fund, many states have narrowed their definitions of “contributory misconduct” or removed it as a criterion for eligibility because of disproportionately high rejection rates for minorities and advocacy efforts from victim rights’ groups.
In a 2005 Kansas Supreme Court ruling, judges found that “contributory misconduct” must be directly contributory, ruling against the state’s Crime Victim Compensation Board. A couple had victim compensation diminished for their son who had died in a car wreck that was no fault of his own. The board had found that their underage son had drunk alcohol the night before and therefore had a blood alcohol content level that was illegal for someone his age at the time of his death. The board wrongfully reasoned, the court found, that this crime had contributed to his death.
Ohio in 2021 put a stop to rejections due to mere drug possession and allegations made about victims’ behavior leading up to their death. Pennsylvania prohibited the denial of claims for funeral reimbursements based on “contributory misconduct” in 2022. New Jersey, Delaware, and New Hampshire have made similar changes.
The Justice Department announced it would look into how subjective metrics like “contributory misconduct” can disproportionately discriminate against Black applicants. The DOJ’s announcement came on the heels of a 2024 Associated Press investigation, analyzing data in 23 states, which found that Black applicants for victim compensation were disproportionately denied at a higher rate for subjective reasons “rooted in implicit bias” like contributory misconduct.
On April 5, a group of 18 attorneys general, including Mississippi’s, joined Alabama’s attorney general and objected to what they perceived as the DOJ’s overreach. They found the updated guidelines “exceeded the agency’s authority” and “could result in the States losing vital funding for their victim compensation programs.”
“State resources available to compensate crime victims are not limitless,” argued Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall. “States thus have always had to make choices about how to justly allocate these funds,” he wrote, and this includes considering “whether an applicant was partially responsible for the crime that harmed him rather than being a purely innocent bystander.”
Scant resources for innocent crime victims is a common argument made by proponents of using the “contributory misconduct” stipulation to assess victim compensation claims. Applicants in Mississippi can also be denied if the victim or applicant has a prior felony conviction, didn’t cooperate with law enforcement or prosecutors and applied for ineligible reimbursement categories like property damage, to name a few.
At the end of Financial Year 2024 after all the reimbursements were paid, Mississippi’s crime victim compensation fund had at least $2 million unspent.
By the end of 2021’s reporting period, with 81 more homicides reported in Mississippi, rejections on the basis of contributory misconduct nearly doubled despite a slight increase in applications.
Crime victim compensation programs are mostly funded by court fines and fees, not taxpayer money. Traffic tickets, felony murder convictions and federal judgments all generate money for the fund. State legislatures and the federal government appropriate money, too.
Even Mississippi crime victims who are approved for victim compensation can wait months to over a year for reimbursement. Neighboring Louisiana offers $500 in emergency funds to victims to help cover immediate costs like medical expenses, crime scene clean-up and lost wages.
In 2023, reimbursements for funerals accounted for more than half of funds paid out. Funeral home directors can fill out forms for crime victim compensation, too, applying on behalf of the victim.
Scotty Meredith runs Meredith-Nowell Funeral Home in Clarksdale on top of serving as coroner for Coahoma County. The small Mississippi Delta city experienced a 250% increase in homicides from 2023 to 2024, with four in 2023 and 14 in 2024. Meredith’s funeral home has gained a reputation in the county as a place to seek help filling out applications for crime victim compensation. But when it comes to the contributory aspect, he finds it hard to anticipate who the division will reject.
“It helps the family at a tough time,” he said, sitting in a room dedicated to grief counseling and funeral planning. The Delta is the state’s poorest region and has the highest number of gun homicides per capita. “It takes a big burden off a family that is already grieving.” 
In Mississippi Today’s discussions with 17 funeral homes across the state, 10 confirmed they no longer handle services for families who depend on victim compensation funds to pay for the funeral. It’s too much of a gamble for some, given how subjective the criteria can be.
Funeral home director William Jefferson Jr. of W.H. Jefferson Funeral Home in Vicksburg helped out a young apprentice’s family with a discounted rate after their claim for their son’s funeral was rejected. 
The director had cited marijuana found in his toxicology report, Jefferson said.

Marijuana was cited in 15-year-old Kayden Mohon’s toxicology report – and in the denial letter sent to his mother Angel Mohon.
Angel Mohon found out about the killing through a social media post circulated by the teenagers she believes responsible for his death. For her, it was a nightmare come true. On a day when she should’ve been celebrating his 16th birthday, Mohon was burying her son.
During Memorial Day Weekend, he was driving his friend home after a pool party in Brookhaven. As he braked near the stop sign on Ozark Lane, shots rang out from the field beside him. His car was riddled with bullets in seconds.
A home security camera captured the shooting: Kayden Mohon opened the driver’s side door as bullets continued to hit the car and the gravel road in front of him. He was driven home to the friend’s house down the street where he succumbed to his injuries and police were called.
Brookhaven Police Department communicated to the attorney general’s office that his death was the result of his own negligence. They labeled it a shootout – and made no arrests. Allegations made in the crime victim letter of Mohon’s firearm usage are not supported by the incident report, which doesn’t identify him with a gun.
Angel Mohon reached out to Brookhaven PD to share the home security camera footage that might exonerate her dead son. But they wouldn’t watch. 
So, she took off work as a home health care aide and decided to investigate.
She first tracked down the Toyota Corolla in which her son was killed. She traveled to an Enterprise Rent-A-Car lot in Natchez where the vehicle was towed. She interviewed neighbors who lived on the street where the shooting took place, one shared home security camera footage that cast the incident in a new light. She interviewed a witness to the killing, her son’s friends and knocked on the doors of local parents.
In the weeks after Kayden’s death, Kenny Collins, Brookhaven’s longtime police chief, stepped down. Under his leadership, the department was criticized for incompetence and shoddy police work. The county’s grand jury that considered more than 60 criminal cases found that the “complacent” Brookhaven Police Department “shows a lack of professionalism,” “has a habit of witness blaming” and is prone to “poorly investigating their cases.”
Under new leadership, the police department is reinvestigating several cases and is hiring a new investigator. When Mississippi Today brought Mohon’s case to the new chief’s attention, he confirmed that the case will undergo new scrutiny.
Mohon is still afraid to leave her home. The boys responsible for her son’s murder have threatened to target her next. They have driven by her home and harassed the family from their vehicles, she says. One wears a sweatshirt bearing an image of her son’s dead body.
“It hurts,” she said. “Every time I sit still for too long or I close my eyes, all I see is my baby’s body lying on the ground.”
Kayden was taking classes in welding at the time of his death. His mom was picking up extra shifts as a home health care aide to help pay for the costs of his training. Angel Mohon had also recently taught him to drive.

“Why kill my child? Because he had a life, he had a future. He had hopes and dreams that he was fulfilling.”
Mohon doesn’t know how she will come up with the $7,000 to pay for the funeral. She is three months behind on her car payments and was told she would lose her only source of transportation next month if she couldn’t come up with $500.
The victim’s voice
When it comes to assessing a victim’s hand in their death, law enforcement officers are the first arbiters. In Mississippi, officers must file their assessment of victim involvement in a crime within 30 days of the victim’s survivors applying.
A law enforcement officer in Sunflower County, who wished to remain anonymous for fear of losing his job, said he checks the contributory box only if the victim “brought the fight to somebody else.”
Funding for local law enforcement agencies prevented officer salaries from keeping pace with inflation – and many Mississippi departments operate on small budgets with less staff than they require. Three police chiefs interviewed complain that witnesses are often reluctant to share information, and the department lacks the budget to retain talent.

Greenville Police Chief Marcus Turner recently mandated that all officers provide crime victim compensation applications to families regardless of what responding officers make of the crime scene at first. Even the family of victims responsible for their deaths need our support, Turner said. He also brings sympathy cards to the victim’s home before any interviews take place.
“It’s our responsibility to speak for the victim,” Turner said. “When there’s a murder, you have a suspect and a victim. The victim can’t say anything.”
Mississippi has few nonprofits or charities dedicated to helping crime victims cover even basic burial costs and that provide counseling to immediate relatives of homicide victims. Churches occasionally step in to cover burial costs for longtime parishioners who were the victims of crime. Stewpot, a homeless shelter in Jackson, will occasionally help pay for burial costs of low-income crime victims.
“The survivors of homicide are forgotten on every level,” said Felecia Marshall, founder and CEO of Grant Me Justice, a nonprofit that helps crime victim families navigate the criminal justice system, cover the costs of counseling and pay for burials. “Many parents are not prepared. There are so many layers that the family has to deal with while they are grieving.”
Legally, counties must have a plan in place for burial of paupers, or those who die without a place for their body. State law does not mandate that a pauper burial be marked, though many counties do.
Unmarked
No tombstone marks Chris Magsby’s grave. Jean Tenner, Magsby’s mother and a longtime employee at the Horseshoe Casino in Tunica, had a hard enough time covering the costs of his funeral before her claim was denied.
“I shouldn’t have to do this all by myself,” said Tenner, a single mother with another son in the armed services.
In 2023, Magsby was driving his youngest son when his cousin Decedron Johnson began to threaten him over the phone, trailing him in his car. The two pulled their cars off the road and when Magsby stepped out of his, Johnson started shooting. Johnson was later arrested in Clarksdale, and Magsby was pronounced dead at a hospital.
At the funeral, Magsby was laid to rest in a scarlet casket. Tenner still didn’t know how she’d pay for it. She neglected to make her car payments so she could save to give her son a proper sendoff. But she never saved enough.
While Johnson was out on bail pending a trial, the victim compensation division was still investigating Tenner’s claim for victim compensation. 
On July 22, 2023, over a month after the funeral, Tenner got her response: The Mississippi Attorney General’s Office had rejected her claim on the grounds her son had been on probation for a felony conviction. Magsby was never convicted of a felony.
On Aug. 18, 2023, her claim was rejected for a second time, this time on a posthumous accusation that he committed a felony at the time of his death. Police allegedly found a bag of cocaine in his car, which indicated to the attorney general’s office that he was not an innocent victim at the time of his death, and therefore, his mother would be ineligible for compensation. 
Also, his posthumous commission of a felony broke his non-adjudication agreement, meaning he was back under the supervision of the Mississippi Department of Corrections – another disqualifier. The initial charge was for “trespassing” into a local business when he was a teenager.
Tenner’s denial is hardly unique in the Mississippi suburbs of Memphis, Tennessee, where a tough-on-crime approach by law enforcement often puts victims under suspicion. The AG’s office denied over half of DeSoto County victims’ compensation claims from 2021 through 2023, records show.
Tenner struggled to make sense of the division’s decision in light of what she knew about her son. In the years before his death, Magsby had received his high school equivalency diploma, moved from the Delta to Horn Lake with his burgeoning family and secured a job at a nearby factory. 
Tenner thinks of her son every day, especially how he used to love to take his kids on trips to Disney World and to water parks in nearby Arkansas. She hopes her grandkids will get to go on another trip soon – but they haven’t since Magsby’s passing. Her grandson, who witnessed his father’s death, needs therapy, said Tenner, but with her debts from her son’s death, she feels that counseling is a long way off for the toddler.
As crime increases, more parents are finding themselves struggling with the financial aftermath of their child’s murder, said Turner, Greenville’s police chief. 
“Now, we’re living in a time where young people are losing their lives every day, and the parents are not in the position to have them covered under any type of burial or life insurance,” he said. 
Every witness or person present when Robinson, Magbsby and Mohon were killed, including the victim, were younger than 30. Since 2013, the number of young crime victims has more than tripled; 338 Mississippians younger than 34 were gun homicide victims in 2023.
Acceptance
Every year, Wade-Robinson attends the Christmas tree decorating party for crime victims hosted by the attorney general’s office. The office usually hires musicians to sing hymns and holiday songs. The families of crime victims hang ornaments on branches while the staff greet grieving families. Last year, she cried, touched by a rendition of “How Great Thou Art.”
Scott Colom, a district attorney in Columbus, organizes a similar event for each family at the end of trials. He plants a tree with the victim’s family in an intimate ceremony outside the courthouse. Victim coordinator Tina Rogers sings hymns and popular music.

“Grief is going to be long, but this tree’s going to be here longer,” Colom said, explaining the ceremony. “The victim’s going to be here, too. They can survive it. They can withstand it. They’ve got a reason to live on.”
He has also appealed crime victim compensation denials, in one case because the applicant was a few days from meeting the five-year threshold from a felony conviction. His appeal was ignored. The division upheld all 54 denials that were appealed on paper or in a hearing in 2021, 2022 and 2023, according to records obtained.
“The only way we’re going to be able to successfully prosecute violent crime is cooperation from victims and survivors,” Colom said. “And if victims and survivors and witnesses have a negative impression of the criminal justice system, that decreases the chances that they’re going to cooperate, which decreases our chances of being able to prosecute crime.”
Restitution is the only other type of compensation available to crime victims. Their families can request that a judge order the offender to pay them for counseling and property damage, among other expenses. But restitution isn’t possible until a person has been successfully prosecuted – an obstacle for mothers of murdered sons in counties with low clearance rates.

Robinson was involved in his community, Wade-Robinson remembers. He used to love to ride his grandfather’s horse at his farm in Terry and hunt deer. Robinson was recruited to play the tuba in high school, where he also excelled on the football field. He won an academic honor in his senior year and graduated with honors from his automotive course. 
“It’s hard to forget someone who gave you so much to remember,” began a resolution honoring Robinson, issued by his high school a week after his death. “We recognize that this temporary loss is Heaven’s ultimate gain.”
The city of Jackson did finally settle a wrongful death suit with Wade-Robinson’s family for an undisclosed sum on Dec. 13, 2017.
But grieving and seeking justice for her son still keeps her up at night. 
“I just can’t understand how you treat victims like this,” she said.

But I also know the long, painful history of how systemic racism, redlining, and disinvestment have shaped their lives — and too often robbed them of the opportunities they deserve.
We are at a pivotal moment.
Under Mayor Brandon Scott’s leadership and through the significant investments of the Baltimore Children & Youth Fund (BCYF), we’re beginning to witness serious efforts to address some of these historical injustices. However, if we genuinely want to create a better future for our young people, we must dig deeper.
That means making real investments in grassroots, Black- and brown-led organizations that have been holding up our youth for decades. It also means our city must shift from gatekeeping to genuine partnership with community leaders and young people.
The disinvestment in Baltimore’s youth programs isn’t new. We’ve experienced it through shuttered rec centers, aging school buildings, and neighborhoods lacking safe places for kids to grow and thrive.
Despite the odds, Baltimore is lucky to have incredible grassroots organizations that have never stopped showing up for our young people.
Groups like Let’s Thrive Baltimore, in Sandtown, provide mentorship and violence interruption led by individuals who have lived the same struggles, while in Cherry Hill, the Restoring Inner-City Hope Program (RICH) offers job readiness training, mental health support and violence prevention workshops. Other programs have creative approaches, like For My Kidz, in West Baltimore, which creates spaces where young people can express themselves through the arts and build leadership skills, or Aziza Peace, a citywide program offering healing-centered programs that help youth process trauma and build resilience.

These are just some of the many groups helping Baltimore’s youth see a pathway forward. And yet, they’re underfunded while larger, often white-led organizations — sometimes with only loose ties to the communities they serve — receive the bulk of the resources.
Thankfully, that’s starting to change. BCYF’s recent $9.55 million investment in summer programming and the creation of the Youth Athletics Fund — a partnership between the Mayor’s Office, Baltimore City Public Schools, and BCYF — are giant steps forward. These investments are not just about money. They signal that Baltimore is serious about changing the game for our youth.
Mayor Scott’s administration has shown a real commitment to listening to communities and prioritizing equity. But we need to keep pushing. While large organizations have their place, the work that changes lives happens closest to the ground — by trusted, community-rooted groups. They deserve not just our thanks but sustained, meaningful investment.
This is where the City Council comes in. Our councilmembers can move away from top-down, politically driven decisions and instead build true partnerships with grassroots leaders. That means showing up in neighborhoods regularly, listening to young people and all community members and making decisions based on what they hear and know, not just what looks good on paper.
One young person who participated in the Nobody Asked Me Campaign’s Elevating Youth Voice study summed it up perfectly when asked about Baltimore’s politicians: “It’s like we’re invited to the party, but never asked to dance.” We have to do better than that.
We also need a long-term strategy to keep this work moving forward, and can look to other cities facing similar challenges for ideas.
In New Orleans, for example, young people and grassroots organizations collaborated with city leaders in 2020 to develop a Youth Masterplan, outlining long-term strategies that align services, funding and accountability across various agencies. It’s working — and we can do the same here.
In Baltimore, a longer-term strategy should prioritize funding for grassroots, Black- and brown-led organizations, while centering youth leadership and voice at every stage.
All of this will require coordinated efforts across city agencies, nonprofits, schools and businesses to maximize impact. To ensure transparency and accountability, regular public reporting can keep the community informed and involved.
A plan like this would provide Baltimore with a roadmap — a bold, shared vision that ensures every young person has access to opportunities, support, and joy, regardless of their ZIP code.

Donors and their contribution amounts were available July 2, 2024, when The Independent accessed the information and published a report three days later showing the largest donors to the program at the time were a Fortune 500 health care corporation, a cable company and the founding family of the Kansas City Chiefs.
When the article was released, the State Treasurer’s Office called The Independent to ask how the information was accessed. The office didn’t seem to be aware that the list was available on a state-run website detailing state spending.
According to Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine, donor information was wiped by the end of the month.
Jackson Bailey, chief of staff to Missouri Treasurer Vivek Malek, chalked the situation up to a “clerical error,” saying the office never intended the information to be posted in the first place.
The office declined to answer further questions on the removal, including whether or not the information is available upon request. 
In 2022, Missouri lawmakers passed a law to shield nonprofits from being forced to disclose donor information. And it was quickly used to conceal public records, such as then-Gov. Mike Parson redacting the names of donors and attendees of his holiday gala.
A year later, lawmakers approved a fix to the law clarifying how it should be implemented.  
Missouri’s tax-credit scholarship program, called MOScholars, is set up using state-approved nonprofits. Donors apply for a tax credit through the State Treasurer’s Office and donate to the nonprofits, which are called educational assistance organizations. At tax time, they are able to deduct the donation amount from their state tax obligations, so long as it’s less than half of their total bill.

Because the program is set up using private nonprofit organizations as an intermediary, the state might be barred, or at least exempt, from disclosing the donation information, according to Dave Roland, director of litigation at the Freedom Center of Missouri.
Programs like MOScholars, Roland said, are “specifically designed to have the funding treated as private money rather than public money.”
“Due to the connection to a government-created program, the government might be able to require public disclosure of the persons donating to these programs (and thus receiving the tax credits), but they are not obligated to make this information public if they don’t want to,” he wrote in an email.
But for those wary about the MOScholars program, less transparency only makes frustrations worse.
Senate Minority Leader Doug Beck, a Democrat from Affton, has been a vocal critic of MOScholars and has sought clarity from program administrators, including Malek. In 2024, Beck asked for “all the data” the office had compiled on MOScholars and received a screenshot of a webpage with basic demographic information.
“We should have accountability and transparency,” he told The Independent. “We don’t know where the money is coming from. We don’t know how much money it is. How do we know it’s getting where it is supposed to go?”
He pointed to a report from the State Auditor’s Office released earlier this month which called out Malek’s office for depositing $35 million of general revenue into the wrong fund.
The audit also identified a lack of transparency in the administration of the MOScholars program. The treasurer’s office wasn’t hiring annual audits of the program as required and it missed inconsistencies in quarterly reports from educational assistance organizations.
Trent Blair, director of programs in the State Treasurer’s Office, told The Independent that the office has already rectified this mistake and recently hired an auditing company.
The demand for more oversight of MOScholars has accelerated in recent months, with state lawmakers passing a $51 million direct appropriation to the program. A lawsuit filed at the beginning of July is challenging the constitutionality of the funding windfall.
But Blair, when asked if Missourians should feel safe handing over $50 million in the wake of oversight issues, said taxpayers could trust the state.
“There are no fewer accountability issues with this program than any other,” he said in an email. “So Missourians should feel confident about the fiscal responsibility associated with this appropriation.”

Why should we let them undo the laws and policies we approve?
Left unaddressed, it gives tacit approval and sanctions a dangerous and destructive practice.
Ultimately, Missourians pay the price.
We run the risk of being rendered totally voiceless, having less or no say at all about many aspects of our daily lives.
When it comes to maintaining and exercising our inalienable individual rights. When it comes to how we provide for our families, educate our kids, where we live, the quality of housing, employment, on and on.
This is evident in the actions taken during the last legislative session, and legislative sessions in the recent past.
Some important measures the majority of Missourians voted for have been undone, or will be undone, and the impending results will not be in the best interest of many Missourians.
The most recent is that hard-working employees will be denied access to paid sick leave. More than 58% of voters, through an initiative petition, passed a measure last November that would allow Missouri workers to accrue paid sick leave, beginning this past May 1. On Aug. 28, those workers will lose what has been accrued and will not be able to accrue any time moving forward.
The governor signed a bill rescinding paid sick leave for workers, succumbing to powerful business lobbyists, under the guise of protecting job-creating businesses.
But the governor was not alone in ignoring the vote of the people.
The majority in the Missouri Senate invoked a rarely-used rule to force the bill to the governor’s desk. This was done even after the Missouri Supreme Court upheld the paid sick leave law following vigorous challenges by businesses and other interest groups.
Do Missouri workers not deserve to have earned paid time off to recover from an illness or to take care of a family member who has fallen ill?
Could businesses not have made or negotiated some level of accrued paid sick leave based upon what they could afford? Wouldn’t workers have understood and accepted such modified arrangements based on the nature or state of the business?
In addition to paid sick leave being taken away, the bill also repeals the required annual adjustment to the minimum wage based on inflation — a provision that had been in effect since 2006.
How does taking away paid sick leave and denying annual adjustments to the minimum wage help Missouri families?
Repealing paid sick leave was not the only overt disregard and dismissal after voters’ approval.
‘Kicked a hornet’s nest’: Missouri GOP repeal of voter-approved laws inspires backlash

Even though a majority of voters, 52%, approved a constitutional amendment that reinstated the right for women to access abortion, the legislature passed an amendment with disguised language to be put on the ballot in 2026 to once again ban abortion.
We all should be concerned about the pattern to undo or subvert the vote of the majority of people of Missouri. But ignoring and undermining the will of Missourians just didn’t begin with the last legislature.
In August 2020, voters approved an amendment for Medicaid expansion. In March of the following year, the legislature voted down funding for the expansion even though the state was sitting on a record budget surplus in the general fund.
After many challenges and court battles, Medicaid expansion was finally funded and enrollment of the thousands of eligible Missourians began in October of 2021.
Denial of paid sick leave, abortion care and Medicaid funding are areas that get the most attention. What about other less visible areas being impacted by elected officials undoing the wishes of the people?
There is a trend of undermining voters in less visible areas, too.
In 2010, a majority of voters approved a law to implement tougher rules on dog breeders. Months later the legislature passed a bill to weaken and reverse portion of that law.
In 2018, a constitutional amendment that would have required legislative districts to be drawn to ensure partisan fairness, known as the Clean Missouri initiative, passed with 62% of the vote. In 2021, state lawmakers put a measure on the ballot to repeal that amendment. It garnered 51% of the vote and the Clean Missouri initiative was never implemented.
During the 2025 legislative session, lawmakers passed a bill that renders existing laws unenforceable that prevent landlords from discriminating against renters who receive public assistance.
Missouri public schools have dire needs. Yet $51 million of taxpayers’ dollars are designated for private school vouchers in the current budget.
A majority of voters oppose the state controlling police departments. But it does in St. Louis and Kansas City.
Some advocacy and coalition groups are beginning to organize and raise money to support counter-initiatives that aim to reinstate or stop the most recent actions of the legislature taken to undo the will of Missouri voters, and to make it more difficult for future legislators to continue this practice.
The overriding question: what are we willing to do about votes being nullified, our tax dollars misused, and our wishes ignored?
Are we contacting — through calls, letters, personal visits — our elected representatives to express our displeasure and demanding that the needs of the majority of voters should be their priority?
Are we doing research to determine who or what influences representatives decisions?
Are we organizing and educating voters to participate in upcoming elections?
We all can do something.
Other than waiting around, wondering what will be taken from the people of Missouri.
What will be next?

Mikie Sherrill will face off in November in the governor's race. (Photos by Reena Rose Sibayan/Amanda Brown)A new poll of the New Jersey governor’s race finds Rep. Mikie Sherrill, a Democrat, leading Republican Jack Ciattarelli by eight points, with 16% of respondents still undecided.
The Fairleigh Dickinson University poll of likely voters has Sherrill ahead of Ciattarelli 45% to 37%. The two are squaring off in November to succeed two-term Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat who can’t seek a third term in the fall.
“While Republicans have been narrowing the gap, there are still more Democrats than Republicans in the state, and Ciattarelli needs to start pulling in more independents and Democrats if he wants to win,” said Dan Cassino, a Fairleigh Dickinson professor and the poll’s director.
A Rutgers-Eagleton poll from earlier this month gave Sherrill a 20-point lead.
Republicans have viewed polls of the race with skepticism, noting that polls released in the weeks before the 2021 governor’s race — when Ciattarelli tried to unseat Murphy — showed Murphy with big leads, though his winning margin ended up being just three points.
Results from the new Fairleigh Dickinson poll reveal why Ciattarelli, a former state assemblyman, has been intent on shifting focus to local issues, despite Sherrill’s push to tie him to President Donald Trump.
After respondents were initially asked which candidate they preferred, they were randomly assigned questions about either local or national issues. Respondents were then asked again about their vote choice.
Those in the local framing group answered questions about NJ Transit, energy policy, farmland development, flood prevention infrastructure, the state’s response to extreme weather, and rising energy bills. The national framing group was asked about Trump, including his job approval, the federal budget bill, and immigration enforcement.
The results showed notable shifts among independents. Questions about local issues helped Ciattarelli by 7% by moving some voters who had been unsure into his corner (there was no significant change among Democrats or Republicans). 
National issues decreased Ciattarelli’s support among independents by 4%, with those voters shifting from supporting him to saying they were unsure, though reminding respondents about national issues strengthened his support among Republicans.
“The more nationalized this race is, the worse Ciattarelli does overall,” Cassino said.
Ciattarelli has mocked Sherrill for her frequent Trump-bashing on the campaign trail, but Cassino said this tactic has “no downside” for Sherrill. A Rutgers-Eagleton poll from earlier this month put Trump’s approval rating among New Jerseyans at 30%.
“Ciattarelli is walking a fine line with Trump: he needs to consolidate Trump supporters, but do so without making the race too national, or turning off voters who don’t like what’s happening in Washington,” Cassino said.
The poll surveyed 806 registered New Jersey voters and has a margin of error of +/- 3.9 percentage points.

Libby’s tremolite asbestos lurked in the shadows for decades until determined citizens brought the hidden killer to light. But too late for more than 400 people who died and many more left sickened with asbestosis, dying slowly and painfully from asbestos fibers lodged in their lungs. 
A similar disaster was narrowly avoided when actinolite, a mineral that belongs to the amphibole family became a topic of concern about the proposed Skalkaho vermiculite mine near Hamilton in 1999. The question of asbestos was not addressed by officials until the mine was almost permitted. Only after the Bitterroot National Forest had issued its Final Environmental Impact Statement did the agency decide to evaluate the potential for asbestos exposure. The mining company folded before testing. 
As “Roadside Geology of Montana” notes: “Several early attempts to mine vermiculite in the Skalkaho intrusion went poorly. While at one time that seemed unfortunate, now it’s clear that we narrowly escaped having another major environmental disaster.”
Yet, Montanans are facing this situation once again with the U.S. Critical Materials Sheep Creek mine project at the headwaters of the West Fork of the Bitterroot River. There could hardly be in a riskier place to mine given the location, the surrounding wilderness lands, and the threat of river contamination throughout the Bitterroot Valley. 
One of those areas of concern is actinolite, a close relative of Libby’s deadly tremolite — and both are asbestos in their fibrous form. 
As a recent study on the dangers of actinolite concluded: “The lack of widespread awareness regarding actinolite complicates efforts to mitigate its health risks. Unlike more commonly known asbestos types…actinolite often remains underestimated. Actinolite occurs in both fibrous and non-fibrous forms, but the fibrous type has garnered a reputation due to its links with asbestos. The health risks associated with this mineral cannot be overstated: Exposure to actinolite, particularly in environments where it is disturbed, poses significant respiratory health risks. The potential for mesothelioma, lung cancer, and other diseases expands with prolonged exposure.”
To be clear, nobody knows if there is asbestos at Sheep Creek. But there is good reason to suspect asbestos may be there. Geologists at Montana Tech report that actinolite is one of the most common minerals in the host rock and the veinlets containing ore are “actinolite-rich.” The Montana Bureau of Mines and Geology Crowley Bulletin reports actinolite at Sheep Creek “forms masses of radiating fibers surrounding other crystals.” The American Mineralogist, a prestigious industry journal, confirms: “actinolite forms clusters of fibers, usually in radiating groups.” 
There’s no question the actinolite is there. But although U.S. Critical Materials has sampled ore for several years and tested for a long list of analytes, I can find no mention of possible asbestos on US Critical Materials’ website. 
Asbestos exposure happens by breathing contaminated dust, which is very hard to contain and clean up. Mining is dusty business. Workers at Sheep Creek are already breathing dust. So why not test for asbestos to inform both the public and agency management? We’ve been down this lethal road before. Public health concerns are clear: test soon to avoid spreading asbestos around if it’s there.
Contact Bitterroot NF Supervisor Matt Anderson matthew.anderson3@usda.gov and Ranger Dan Pliley Plileydaniel.pliley@usda.gov about possible asbestos at Sheep Creek.

All public schools in the state are now subject to a new rule governing school counselors' work time. (Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — A new Oklahoma rule places strict limitations on how much time public school counselors can spend on non-counseling tasks, but some have raised concerns of whether the regulation is too vague to have its desired effect.
The rule requires school counselors to spend at least 80% of their work time on direct and indirect counseling services that have “an impact on student growth in the areas of academic advisement, college and career, and life skills and wellness,” according to its text. The remainder of their time could be spent on “program planning and school support.” 
The Oklahoma State Board of Education and the state Legislature approved the rule this year. State Superintendent Ryan Walters, who proposed the rule, said the goal is to ensure school counselors aren’t saddled with administrative duties that distract from their primary responsibility of counseling students.
The Oklahoma School Counselor Association is supportive of the 80% concept, said Chelsea Hinkle, president of the association’s board. That work-time ratio is what the American School Counselor Association recommends as a national best practice.
But, the lack of specificity in Oklahoma’s rule has caused uncertainty among school counselors in the state, Hinkle said. The rule gives few examples of tasks that count as direct and indirect services, it doesn’t define “work time,” and it doesn’t explain how districts will be held accountable if they don’t uphold the 80% target.
Because of this vagueness, she said, Oklahoma counselors are wondering whether schools will classify non-counseling tasks, like administering state testing, as “direct services” if they involve face-to-face contact with students.
“I think I would say it leaves us curious,” Hinkle said. “It leaves us curious to how it’s going to play out. I think it leaves us curious to see how districts interpret and apply this, curious to see what guidance (the Oklahoma State Department of Education) has, what that looks like. We’re just kind of waiting. I personally am cautiously, very cautiously, optimistic.”
The Education Department, through its communications office, said academic advising, mental health and wellness support, and career planning are examples of counseling services that could make up 80% of a school counselor’s work time.

However, the agency did not answer questions asking how it will define that “work time,” whether it’s a specific number of hours in a day, the number of days each week, or total hours or days out of the school year.
Districts will have to submit a comprehensive school counseling plan to the state Education Department to ensure quality implementation, spokesperson Madison Cercy said.
The agency also referred to a link giving general information on school counseling programs, and noted it offers professional learning opportunities to district staff for further training.
Hinkle estimated she spends about 70% of her time on direct and indirect counseling services at the Oklahoma City public school where she works. 
Her direct services include one-on-one meetings with students, small-group counseling and classroom instruction. Counselors also teach life skills, address absenteeism issues and check if students’ basic needs are being met at home, Hinkle said.
Indirect services are part of her job, too, such as calling parents, making a referral for outside therapeutic services and meeting with a teacher about a student’s behavior.
Administering state tests, substitute teaching, running a gifted and talented program, and developing 504 plans for students with disabilities are common non-counseling duties many counselors are assigned to do, Hinkle said.
Several of these tasks, along with clerical work, are among the activities the American School Counselor Association deems “inappropriate” for counselors.
“One thing that school counselors believe to their core is each and every student deserves access to a school counseling program, and it’s really hard to make sure each and every single one of your students has access when you’re doing 700 other things,” Hinkle said.
Walters agreed that school counselors, rather than shouldering administrative work, should be allowed to focus on the central elements of their job, like helping students work through mental health issues or plan for a future career.
“I do believe if somebody wants to be a school counselor they want to help kids in these ways,” Walters said during a June 26 meeting of the Oklahoma State Board of Education. “That’s their background. That’s what they’re there to do. That’s why it’s a separate certification. They’re not a principal. They’re not a vice principal. They’re a school counselor. If we’re going to use these titles and this certification, we need to protect that role.”
Neighboring states have been far more specific when implementing similar work-time rules for school counselors. 
A Texas state law clarifies that administering tests cannot qualify as a direct or indirect counseling service. Like Oklahoma, the Lone Star State requires counselors to spend 80% of their work time on the counseling program at their school.
Arkansas goes above the nationally recommended ratio, requiring 90% of school counselors’ work time to focus on counseling services. The Arkansas rule gives definitions for direct and indirect services, and it outlines specific administrative activities that can make up no more than 10% of counselors’ work time.
As Oklahoma’s rule takes effect, Edmond Public Schools is looking at the potential impact, but it’s not rearranging staff at this time, spokesperson Jeff Bardach said. The district of 25,700 students is waiting for further guidance from the state Education Department before making any changes.
School counselors in Norman Public Schools already spend 80% of their time providing direct and indirect services to students, spokesperson Courtney Scott said.
“This new rule reinforces that their time should not be overcommitted to administrative tasks such as coordinating state testing, managing 504 plans, or taking on other duties that fall outside their professional role,” she said. “Counselors should be engaged in face-to-face instruction or communication with students, as well as with teachers and families who support those students.”
In northwest Oklahoma, Seiling Public Schools Superintendent Kyle Reynolds said he’s never had to quantify the percentage of his school counselors’ time spent on various tasks, but meeting the 80% rule in a small, rural district will be “a pretty significant challenge.”

Seiling, a district of 400 students, employs a counselor at its elementary school and another at the secondary school level. 
Small districts have fewer employees and therefore rely on counselors for a greater variety of tasks, Reynolds said. It’s also a position that, like teachers, has a workforce shortage, so hiring more counselors isn’t an easy solution, he said.
Without access to more funding or a larger pool of candidates, Reynolds said it’s difficult to be sure the new rule will benefit students.
“It just puts you more in a pinch with what you can do with your existing resources,” he said.

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)In March 2023, Daphne Huang emailed her supervisor — repeating concerns she had shared a day earlier.
She was troubled with the ethics of the Idaho Attorney General’s Office new management — months after Raúl Labrador became Idaho’s attorney general.
“I don’t think (the executive office) is concerned with our ethical responsibilities under professional rules of conduct to which we are all bound,” Huang wrote. “They instead appear intent on dismantling government, and doing so without regard for the people who believe in public service who fall in their wake. They have drawn the (Attorney General’s) Office into adversity with its clients based on anti-government pursuits irrespective of how the law applies to the facts.”
Judge again rejects Idaho Attorney General Office’s attempt to stop Labrador’s deposition

Before firing her a couple hours later, Labrador didn’t look into her concerns, he recently said in a deposition.
“I had no concerns. It was clear that she was not acting in good faith. And it was clear that she was already preparing for litigation,” Labrador said, according to a partial transcript. 
Months before Huang’s whistleblower lawsuit against the Attorney General’s Office is set to go to a jury trial, the Attorney General’s Office has asked an Idaho judge to dismiss the case, arguing Huang was fired for misconduct — not whistleblowing. Huang was fired early in Labrador’s investigation into $72 million of child care grants distributed by the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare, the agency she represented as a deputy attorney general.
Huang’s email, Labrador’s deposition and hundreds of other pages of evidence were released in court documents related to the Attorney General’s Office request to dismiss the lawsuit.

 AG’s Office says lawyer was fired for misconduct

In its request, attorneys for the Attorney General’s Office said: “Even under the most charitable interpretation of the facts, (Huang) was fired for misconduct — not for refusing to carry out an unlawful directive or for whistleblowing.” 
Part of the case centers around Huang allegedly giving the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare the cell phone of her former supervisor, who was asked to resign days before Huang was fired. The phone had data that Health and Welfare allegedly claimed privilege over and was deleted from the phone before it was returned to the Attorney General’s Office, court documents show. That was despite a request from the Attorney General’s Office to return the phone with the data preserved, the records show.
The Attorney General’s Office argues that the timeline “is clear: she made alleged ethical complaints because she was being fired, and not the other way around.”
Huang’s attorneys responded with a timeline of the events leading up to her firing, arguing that Labrador started his leadership of the Attorney General’s Office with an unusual change.
“On the day he became AG, Labrador met with (deputy attorneys general) and staff and informed them everyone would be reappyling for their jobs and that he wanted employees who would be ‘Team Labrador,” Huang’s attorneys said. 
They allege Labrador told staff that the Attorney General’s Office “did not represent state agencies.” That confused Huang, who knew the office’s attorneys “are public attorneys for the people of the state,” her lawyers say.
On Monday, Idaho 4th District Court Judge Jonathan Medema heard oral arguments on the Attorney General Office’s request to dismiss the case, through a motion for summary judgment. He will issue a decision later. 
In court, Deputy Solicitor General Michael Zarian argued Huang didn’t refuse the office’s directive.
“A refusal would be to decline to accept the directive and to express that,” Zarian said. “And that is the definition of the word refusal. … But here, she expressed a willingness to agree and then did the opposite. And that’s just, honestly, dishonesty to your employer.”
An attorney for Huang, Guy Hallam, argued Huang did what she was supposed to do.
“The client requested the phone, and she gave it to the client. She has a duty to that client,” Hallam said. “… She did what she should do under the law, and under her duties under the rules of professional conduct. And it may have amounted to a refusal that they view as insubordination, but it’s appropriate under the law.”
The lawsuit is scheduled to go to a jury trial in October.
 Recent court ruling affirmed Labrador’s civil subpoena power

This month, another court ruling seemed to clear a hurdle for the investigation. The Idaho Supreme Court on July 10 unanimously ruled Labrador had the authority to issue civil investigative demands to organizations that received the grant funds from Health and Welfare. 
But the court wrote that “nothing in this opinion should be read as implying that we have concluded that any of the Grant Recipients have violated the law because we have not been asked to address that issue.”
In a statement after the ruling, Labrador said the office’s goal “is not to punish grant recipients but to ensure taxpayer funds were used according to state law.”
“We will continue to defend the investigative powers the Legislature has entrusted our office,” he said. 
But more than two years after the investigation began, its status is unclear. For more than a year, state officials have released no information about how it’s going.



 A timeline of Labrador’s investigation into Health and Welfare grants:

Launched months after the former congressman became Idaho’s top attorney in 2023, the grants investigation is one of several legal clashes Labrador has had with state government agencies that his office legally represents — including his now-dropped lawsuit against the State Board of Education related to University of Idaho’s attempted purchase of the University of Phoenix. 
Two state officials linked to the grants investigation — Huang, the fired attorney, and Dave Jeppesen, the former Department of Health and Welfare director — filed complaints against Labrador with the Idaho State Bar, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported.

January 2023: Raúl Labrador becomes Idaho’s attorney general.
March 2023: Shortly after Legislature orders audit of Idaho Department of Health and Welfare grants, Labrador serves civil subpoenas, also known as civil investigative demands, to current and former state health officials, and organizations that received the grants. Officials and organizations soon sue over the subpoenas.
August 2023: A state audit finds issues in the grant distribution and spending, despite two legal memos Daphne Huang — who was fired from the Attorney General’s Office — wrote to Health and Welfare, saying the grant funds was legally sound. Labrador’s office later withdraws the legal advice. Labrador calls the advice a “cover your butt” letter, in a December 2023 interview with Idaho Reports.
December 2023: Labrador’s appointed special prosecutor, Christopher Boyd, claims in a legal filing that he found probable cause that the agency’s then-grant manager had committed a crime. But he publishes no specific evidence for the allegation, or says what crime may have been committed. The grant manager still has not faced public criminal charges, state court records show.
January 2024: Months after the critical audit’s release, Health and Welfare announces reform efforts. Initially, agency leadership refuted all of the audit’s findings.
March 2024: Two lawsuits by current and former state health officials that challenged the civil subpoenas conclude — months after Boyd told the officials he’d withdraw the civil subpoenas.




 New records show state officials received more subpoenas 

In late 2023, when Labrador’s special prosecutor, Christopher Boyd, told state health officials he’d withdraw the civil investigative demands that they sued to block, he said he’d look to appoint a special inquiry judge — a court process outlined in state law that allows secrecy. At the time, Boyd wouldn’t say whether such a judge had been appointed, the Sun previously reported. 
But government records obtained by the Idaho Capital Sun through a public records request show state employees were subpoenaed in early 2024 or earlier to testify to a special inquiry judge. The records don’t identify the judge. Government agencies linked to the investigation could not be immediately reached for comment.

In an email on Feb. 26, 2024, Idaho Department of Health and Welfare Deputy Director Jennifer Palagi told the agency’s then interim director, Dean Cameron, that two state officials had been subpoenaed by special prosecutor Boyd to testify before a special inquiry judge on March 5, 2024. Those subpoenas were similar to ones she, other current and former state officials — including the agency’s previous director, Dave Jeppesen — had received, Palagi wrote.
The Idaho governor’s then-director of operations, Lori Wolff, also received a similar subpoena, Idaho Gov. Brad Little’s General Counsel Brady Hall wrote in a separate Jan. 30, 2024 email.
All the subpoenas were signed by Boyd, sought testimony on the grants program and came with an “Agreement to Testify with Immunity,” Hall wrote. 
The Idaho Capital Sun obtained the emails through a public records request to the Idaho governor’s office. An attorney for Huang first obtained the emails from the governor’s office after allegedly not receiving them in the legal discovery process from the Attorney General’s Office. Judge Medema in July denied Huang’s attorneys’ request for sanctions over the evidence dispute.
The emails also asked how to arrange legal representation for the subpoenaed officials. It’s not immediately clear whether the testimony sought by the subpoenas happened, or how legal representation for the officials was arranged.
The Idaho Attorney General’s Office declined to share information on the investigation’s status. Other agencies and officials involved in the emails or investigation — including the Idaho governor’s office, the Department of Health and Welfare, and Boyd, who is also Canyon County’s prosecuting attorney — could not be immediately reached for comment.
Boyd was also appointed as a special prosecutor in Ada County “to prosecute this case,” Chief Deputy Attorney General Phil Broadbent said in a reply email to the governor’s attorney in January 2024. Last week, the Ada County Prosecuting Attorney’s Office declined to comment on Boyd’s appointment, telling the Sun that the matter remains under investigation.

(Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)The Commission on Indiana’s Legal Future, tasked with brainstorming attorney shortage fixes, has released a final report packed with new recommendations and updates on ongoing initiatives.
The Hoosier State’s rate of 2.26 lawyers per capita was 43rd worst in the nation last year, per the American Bar Association.
About 16,000 practice in-state, but the distribution is uneven.
Marion County alone hosts more than 6,000 lawyers, almost 40%. When combined with those in seven surrounding counties, they make up more than half the total. Other counties have as few as five.
Indiana’s attorney production pipeline — stunted, in particular, by the 2020 closure of Valparaiso Law School — has also contributed.
“The answer is not as simple as ‘more lawyers,'” Appeals Court Judge Nancy Vaidik and Supreme Court Chief Administrative Officer Justin Forkner wrote.
  Many active attorneys have clustered in urban areas. Lawyers in rural counties are generally older. The darkest blue counties have the most attorneys, and the darkest brown counties have the oldest. (Screenshot from Commission on Indiana’s Legal Future final report)
“Instead, this challenge needs a complete reevaluation of how legal services are provided in Indiana,” the pair, who co-chaired the commission, continued.
The Indiana Supreme Court created the commission in April 2024. The group, published an initial list of budgetary and legislative suggestions four months later, ahead of the Indiana General Assembly’s budget-writing session.
The final report — which was completed July 1 and released last week — is open for public comment until August 29 at noon.
Progress on interim recommendations
There’s already been movement on several earlier proposals.
The Indiana Supreme Court approved its Innovation Committee’s parameters for a new regulatory “sandbox” program in March. Inspired by a 2020 Utah agency, it would authorize and evaluate non-traditional legal service projects.
That pilot program incorporates another recommendation for grants to help launch nonprofit law firms that use lower-cost legal service providers like law students or allied legal professionals.
The court has also established uniform definitions of areas with high legal need, including maps of rural counties and legal deserts.
A subsidy program for legal practice startups in those needy areas is expected to go live this summer, according to the report. It’s for use on expenses that are most burdensome in the startup phase, like rent, utilities, insurance, legal research services, databases, case management software and billing software.
Attorney shortage commission makes budgetary, legislative recommendations

Also expected to go live this summer is a student loan repayment assistance program for law school graduates practices in areas of high legal need.
A scholarship program for law students who go into public roles was signed into law in May, but lawmakers allotted it no funding amid major spending cuts. The shortage is particularly acute among public prosecutors and defenders because the pay is often too low to pay off law school loans despite the heavy workload.
The commission suggested seeking private sector funding.
Other ideas also suffered in the cuts.
Funding for remote-appearance technologies in local jails was one.
“It is not clear yet if the Court will have sufficient funds to provide these grant opportunities in the current fiscal climate,” the commission wrote of proposal to upgrade technology in local courts.
It noted that a different potential funding source, the federal Digital Opportunity Grant, was recently suspended by President Donald Trump.
New recommendations
The commission added several suggestions in its final report.
Chief among them was designating someone with the “ongoing oversight, marketing, and coordination of the Commission’s recommendations so they do not ‘die on the vine.'”
It will also be “vital” to centralize information on initiatives and grants on one webpage, the commission added.
It also recommended piloting a public service pathway to licensure — not easier, and maybe even more demanding, than the current bar exam, but tailored.

“The initial parameters provide a tailored path to law licensure for qualified ABA-accredited Indiana-based law-school students who commit to and practice in Indiana for three years after graduation in either a high-needs public-sector field or in a legal desert,” the report said.
Other proposals are in progress, including some involving the use of artificial intelligence to ease the “unsustainable” workloads on judicial officers. By automating or simplifying some menial tasks, they’d have more time for duties that require deep thought and expertise.
Additional proposals focus on educational and career support: mentorship programs, curricular pathways, boot camps, a public service job board and more.
The commission acknowledged that its work was limited, and ended the report with suggestions of what comes next.
Would-be Indiana lawyers need more access to legal educational institutions, it asserted. Some possibilities include reopening Valparaiso Law School, launching Indiana University satellite law schools or widening access to online law school graduates.
But many graduates, especially those from Notre Dame and IU Maurer, practice law elsewhere.
“We must sell the idea of staying and practicing here—the notion that Indiana is a good place to live,” the commission wrote. “We must promote and market the value of not just being a lawyer, but also the unique importance of being a Hoosier lawyer.”
Student loan debt was identified as another major problem, because it often pushes graduates into higher-paying corporate careers in urban areas.

National survey of Wyoming voters shows Gordon’s popularity has remained steady throughout his tenure.
The post Gordon among nation’s most popular governors despite criticism from right flank, poll finds appeared first on WyoFile .","Despite ongoing attacks from the Republican Party’s right flank, Wyoming Gov. Mark Gordon remains one of the country’s most popular state leaders, a Morning Consult poll released earlier this month shows.
During a survey conducted between April and June, Wyoming voters gave Gordon a 65% approval rating, placing him as the fourth most popular among his peers. Twenty-four percent disapproved of Gordon’s job performance while 11% responded that they either didn’t know or had no opinion. 
Morning Consult, a political research firm, tracks approval ratings for all 50 state governors and releases the results quarterly. 
The poll results follow a steady drumbeat of criticism from the most hardline elements of Wyoming’s Republican Party, who’ve taken the governor to task for his stances on a number of issues including wind energy and for his vetoes of certain bills.
Throughout his tenure, Gordon’s job performance has remained steady according to the survey findings. His high-water mark — 74% approval — tied Gordon with Vermont Republican Gov. Phil Scott as the most popular governor in July 2022. In January 2020, a 69% approval rating also placed him at the top. 
“These poll results are indicative of the good things going on in Wyoming. They also show that Wyoming citizens recognize that the Governor continues to put this head down and work to move the state forward — including sticking to the issues that are truly important to most Wyoming folks,” Gordon’s spokesman Michael Pearlman wrote in a statement to WyoFile. 
Pearlman said those include the economy, education, addressing mental health and strengthening the state’s core energy industries. 
“Most people in Wyoming want less government in their lives, the opportunity to make a good living, enjoy recreational activities and have their children receive an excellent education. Governor Gordon wants the same, and that shows in this poll.
“Finally, while polls are nice, ultimately there’s only one poll that matters and that’s the election coming a little more than a year from now,” Pearlman added. 
Gordon has not announced what he plans to do following his second term. When the Wyoming Supreme Court ruled that term limits on the top elected positions in the state were unconstitutional, the high court did not address the qualifications for governor. Given the high court’s ruling against legislative term limits, a court challenge on the gubernatorial term limits would likely be successful, the Casper Star-Tribune reported in 2010, when then-Gov. Dave Freudenthal announced he would not seek a third term.
In 2022, Gordon coasted to a second-term win, first capturing 61.5% of the vote in the Republican primary election before sweeping the November election with a 74% victory. 
His 2018 gubernatorial victory, however, set off a tense relationship with the further right-wing of the party after his opponents insisted he only won due to the support of Democrats registering as Republican in order to support him. Despite being statistically unfounded, the claims endured, and the Legislature passed a crossover-voting ban in 2023 after many failed attempts. Laramie, Platte and Teton County voters are currently challenging the ban in court. 
The Wyoming Republican Party voted in 2024 to censure Gordon after he vetoed a property tax bill and legislation to repeal gun-free zones. 
Wyoming GOP Chairman Bryan Miller did not respond to WyoFile’s request for comment by the time this article published. 
Since forming in 2020, the Wyoming Freedom Caucus has also taken aim at Gordon, particularly for his energy policies. And earlier this year, one of the group’s leaders went so far as to accuse Gordon and former members of the Joint Appropriations Committee of violating a state spending law. The accusation caught headlines during the legislative session and not much else. 
More recently, Gordon has clashed with Secretary of State Chuck Gray, who has regularly taken to social media to criticize the governor, particularly when it comes to election security, mining and wind projects. 
Gray as well as U.S. Rep. Harriet Hageman are among names being floated as potential gubernatorial candidates in 2026.

The Mississippi State Department of Health, like other state health departments, is concerned about the potential loss of federal funding. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)Between 2016 and 2022, as congenital syphilis cases rose nationally and especially in the South, Mississippi saw a one thousand percent increase — from 10 to 110 — in the number of newborn babies who were hospitalized after contracting the disease, known to cause developmental issues, intellectual disabilities, and even death.
So in 2023, the state Department of Health mandated that all medical practitioners screen for the disease in pregnant mothers, and it has been running advertisements to spread awareness.
Annual congenital syphilis cases in Mississippi rose from 62 in 2021 to 132 in 2023, according to state data. The number fell to 114 last year. There have been 33 cases so far this year.
That work won’t stop despite potential budget cuts, Dr. Daniel Edney, Mississippi’s state health officer, said in an interview. “We’re going to keep doing what we have to do, you know, to keep it under control.”
State by state, public health departments take a similar approach: They monitor, treat and try to stem preventable diseases, alongside their host of other duties. But in the coming year, health department officials — with their agencies already strapped for cash — fear they’ll find it much more difficult to do their jobs.
President Donald Trump’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2026 would cut the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention budget by more than half, from $9.3 billion to $4.2 billion. The proposal serves as a wish list from the administration, a blueprint for the Republican-controlled Congress as it works through upcoming spending legislation.
If lawmakers hew to Trump’s vision, then state and county public health departments would be hit hard. States contribute to their own health departments, but a lot of them rely heavily on federal funding.
And around half of local public health department funding comes from federal sources, primarily the CDC, as noted in a 2022 report from the National Association of County & City Health Officials.
Medicaid cuts are likely to worsen mental health care in rural America

“The federal government provides a lot of funding, but the actual implementation of public health programs happens at the state and local level,” said Josh Michaud, associate director of global health policy at KFF, a health policy research group. “Each state has its own approach, in many ways, to how public health programs are overseen, how they’re funded, how they are implemented.”
In announcing his department’s share of the proposed budget, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said Trump’s goals align with “new priorities in reversing the chronic disease epidemic.”
But many local health leaders point to the longtime mission of state public health departments in preventing the spread of disease.
“Local public health is on the front lines preventing communicable disease, operating programs to prevent chronic disease, ensuring our septic and well water systems are safe,” said Dr. Kelly Kimple, acting director of North Carolina’s Division of Public Health within the Department of Health and Human Services.
“I’m very concerned,” Kimple said, “especially given the magnitude of funding that we’re talking about, as we can’t keep doing more with less.”
Clawing back COVID-era grants
Other federal budget cuts also have states worried.
Many state public health departments grew alarmed when the Trump administration announced in March that it would be clawing back $11.4 billion in COVID-era funding for grants that were slated to extend into 2026.
Twenty-three states and the District of Columbia sued. A federal district court in Rhode Island temporarily blocked the cuts, and the case remains tied up in court.
The court’s preliminary injunction may not protect temporary staff or contractors, though. Public health departments have been laying off staff, cutting lab capacity and reducing immunization clinics, said Dr. Susan Kansagra, chief medical officer for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.
Historically, public health departments receive funding in “boom and bust” cycles, meaning they tend to get more federal support during emergencies, said Michaud, of KFF. But “since the Great Recession of 2008, there was a general decline in public health support funding until the COVID pandemic.”
For example, KHN and The Associated Press reported that between 2010 and 2019, spending on state public health departments declined by 16% per capita and spending for local health departments fell by 18%.
Nationally, syphilis cases reached historic lows in the 2000s, thanks to robust prevention efforts and education from public health officials. By 2022, however, cases reached their highest numbers nationally since the 1950s.
“In the wake of the COVID emergency, you’ve seen a sort of backlash to what people had been calling the overreach of public health and imposing vaccination requirements and lockdowns and other public health measures,” Michaud told Stateline.
Smallpox, cholera and typhoid
Public health departments and officials go back to the 19th century, when there was a greater emphasis on sanitation efforts to prevent spread of diseases such as smallpox, cholera and typhoid, which were rampant at the time.
By the end of the century, 40 states had established health departments, which to this day are responsible for water sanitation, tracking the spread of disease, administering vaccinations, furnishing health education, providing screenings for infants and some prenatal care for moms at local clinics, offering family planning services, and tracking and treating sexually transmitted infections, among other things.










What we're seeing now is a complete upheaval of the funding going into public health.


– Josh Michaud, associate director of global health policy at KFF


Kimple pointed to measles as a current example of a disease that’s spreading fast. When North Carolina’s health department detected a case in the state, she said, the department “identified and contacted everyone who might have been exposed, helped people get tested, worked with doctors to make sure they knew how to respond.”
That’s the legacy of local public health, Michaud said.
“The federal government cannot decide, ‘This public health program will happen in this state, but not that state,’ that kind of thing. And cannot declare a national lockdown. The COVID pandemic tested a lot of those boundaries. It really is a state and local responsibility to protect public health. And that’s always been the case, since the beginning of our country,” Michaud said.
“And what we’re seeing now is a complete upheaval of the funding going into public health.”
A major cut in services
Kimple said she’s seen recent progress in her state in the support for funding public health.
“North Carolinians viewed our work as highly important to improving health and well-being in the state, and appreciated the local presence, the reliable information, the role in prevention and efforts to protect, in particular, vulnerable communities,” she said.
Similarly, Edney said that Mississippi state lawmakers were showing more support, despite some setbacks in 2016 and 2017. New federal cuts could throw a wrench in the health department’s economic plans and its ability to reach small communities.
“Now the federal rug is being pulled out from under us,” he said.
Edney said he expects the federal share of his department’s public health funding to fall from its current 65% to around 50%.
Edney said he’s been trying to strengthen Mississippi health department’s longevity by diversifying its revenue streams by, for example, accepting private donations.
The state will not stop doing its “core” work, he said, regardless of federal funding.
“We’re not going to cut back on services at the county health department, because what we do now is all mission critical,” Edney said.

Sen. John Barrasso has not yet taken a stand on Safeguard American Voter Eligibility, but Sen. Cynthia Lummis and Rep. Harriet Hageman are all for HR 22, writes Marion Yoder. 
The post SAVE Act would silence American voters, mainly women appeared first on WyoFile .","Wyoming isn’t called the Equality State for nothing. In 1869, Wyoming women struggled for and secured the right to vote here, years before statehood. We are justly proud that Wyoming was the first American state or territory to extend suffrage to women, putting them on equal political footing with men.

Opinion

So why then are the two female members of Wyoming’s congressional delegation supporting a bill that would hurt women’s access to the polls?
The Safeguard American Voter Eligibility, or so-called SAVE Act, already passed the U.S. House with an appalling “Aye” from Wyoming’s lone representative, Harriet Hageman. More correctly derided as the “Silencing Americans Act,” House Resolution 22 would suddenly require millions to produce passports or original birth certificates to prove citizenship when registering to vote or updating their registration. 
For no good reason. As the Brennan Center put it after meticulously studying many national elections, and finding incident rates between 0.0003% and 0.0025%, an American will more likely be struck by lightning than try to “impersonate another voter at the polls.” 
About 140 million Americans do not own passports and some 69 million married women’s surnames differ from those on their birth certificates, according to the Center for American Progress. More than 21 million Americans lack any readily available proof of citizenship. 
The nonpartisan League of Women Voters very much opposes SAVE. It would suppress votes from millions of eligible voters, especially women, seniors, students and people of color. Also, service members who move often and would have to provide strict documentary proof each time they re-register to vote. Military ID alone would not suffice. Nor would Tribal IDs cut it, as most don’t show birthplace. And disaster survivors; who knows where their papers are? Anyone with a name that has changed since birth: the 80% of women who change surnames upon marriage, trans people, others. Rural, working class, people of color or older voters are all less likely to hold a passport. The League is urging people to insist their senators oppose the SAVE Act. 
If SAVE passes, and you are among the 40% of Wyomingites who hold a passport, you might be in luck, if it’s current. Passports cost at least $165 to apply for and nearly that to renew. You have to get a professional picture, fill out papers and you may need an appointment. It takes weeks to get them. 
Sen. John Barrasso has not yet taken a stand on SAVE, but Sen. Cynthia Lummis and Rep. Hageman are all for HR 22. Why not? It doesn’t affect them. They kept their names upon marriage. 
So did I, but I don’t like SAVE and no one I know does, though not many have heard much about it. When SAVE does hit the radar screen, I foresee a lot of angry Wyomingites from any or no party. The Republicans pushing this anti-voter bill are theoretically big on family values and thus marriage. So how can they justify making it difficult for married women to vote? 
As if it isn’t already hard enough to vote. You must already (a) register with documentary proof, (b) educate yourself on the issues, (c) get a ballot by mail or go to the polls, (d) provide valid ID and (e) vote. Wyoming is one of only eight states that do not allow online voter registration. Reason: “election integrity.” 
The Heritage Foundation has found precisely four documented instances of voter fraud statewide over the last 25 years, during which time dozens of elections have occurred. All four were U.S. citizens! Two were convicted of false registration/fraudulent use of absentee ballots, one (a sitting state representative) used a phony address and pled guilty, and one was ineligible to vote since he was a convicted felon. 
Contrary to Secretary of State Chuck Gray’s assertions, Wyoming’s 23 elected county clerks competently keep voter rolls accurate and ensure that only eligible people vote. That’s still not good enough for Gray, whose sworn duty is to facilitate elections but instead delights in making voting unnecessarily difficult. Thanks to him and the Freedom Caucus, voting restrictions are having a heyday. A “crossover” voter must change their registration by mid-May, before candidates even declare. And now there’s a Wyoming version of SAVE, House Bill 156. Its challenge in federal court was recently dismissed without prejudice. That case can, and likely will, be refiled. For more changes, see “What’s New About Wyoming’s Elections,” put together by the Laramie County Clerk. You can, and should,  check the status of your registration by calling your county clerk. In Laramie County, the number is 307-633-4242. 
Wyomingites worried about SAVE are sending postcards to Barrasso and Lummis, saying the “Silencing Americans Act” is anti-democratic. They close with: “I stand with my fellow Wyomingites and Americans to demand that you pass national voting rights legislation such as the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, the Freedom to Vote Act, the Native American Voting Rights Act and DC Statehood.” 
Senate Republicans, terrified of Trump and scared about 2026 midterms, are about as into Washington, D.C.’s Statehood as they are into addressing global warming. Nevertheless, Congress needs to realize it is blundering badly with this insulting SAVE Act. American women are not going to accept being told to go away when they go to vote in 2026. 
Senators nationwide are now being told this: “We will never stand quietly as politicians attempt to prevent citizens from exercising their fundamental right to vote. Voting rights belong to everyone.” For my part, I’ve called and written both Lummis and Barrasso, asking for their current positions on this bad bill. I’ve also asked Barrasso to urge Lummis, a junior senator, to withdraw her early support.
Even quipping misogynists don’t have the gall to tell their wives to behave like most women had to before 1920, when the 19th Amendment, granting women suffrage nationwide, was adopted after a century of hard fighting. It reads, “The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex.” Damn straight.
No Wyoming voter would be assisted by the SAVE Act. Time to call it a day for this sexist, hyper-partisan bill. We cannot allow elected officials to “pick voters” rather than us picking the winners at the polls. Just as our Founders intended.

Since 2022, the Nebraska Democratic Party has outraised the Nebraska GOP each year, both in state-level donations logged on Nebraska Accountability and Disclosure (NADC)[...]","State Sen. Merv Riepe of Ralston and Fletcher Reel of Omaha discuss election results for Pennsylvania at the Nebraska GOP watch party in Bellevue on Nov. 5, 2024.  (Marissa Lindemann/Nebraska News Service)LINCOLN — While Nebraska remains a firmly red state in terms of its registered voters and elected leadership, that tilt hasn’t translated into donations to the state’s top political parties.
Since 2022, the Nebraska Democratic Party has outraised the Nebraska GOP each year, both in state-level donations logged on Nebraska Accountability and Disclosure (NADC) and in federal giving recorded by the Federal Elections Commission (FEC).
The turning point was the state GOP’s 2022 convention, which saw a mass exodus of party leadership and shifted away from the previous establishment Republicans to Trump-era populists and some old-guard conservatives.
Some viewed the party leadership change as an indictment of the way the party was run under a team loyal to former GOP governor-turned-U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts, as many Republicans at the convention said he held too much control.
Ricketts was a major funder for the party at the time — one of the party’s dominant funders. A six-figure donation from him was not an uncommon occurrence. After the 2022 convention, those donations stopped.

In fact, none of Nebraska’s current congressional delegation has donated directly to the state GOP since 2022, according to NADC and FEC filings. Democrats last held a federal office in 2017 with the late-U.S. Rep. Brad Ashford.
Ricketts has remained an active political funder since then, instead donating directly to Republican candidates and organizations. Recent FEC filings show a donation from him of more than $750,000 to the National Republican Senatorial Committee, as just one example.
He’s also frequently provided donations to other state Republican parties and local GOP groups outside of Nebraska, usually in $10,000 sums, according to his FEC filings.
Jessica Flanagain, a spokesperson for the Ricketts campaign and the senator’s top political consultant, said he remains committed to helping the “most conservative candidates who can win” races win, regardless of how he donates.
“Senator Ricketts has been clear about his commitment to conservative candidates and causes,” Flanagain said. “He has championed protecting women and children by passing Initiative 434 (cementing Nebraska’s 12-week abortion ban), and he has helped secure our elections by passing Voter ID.”
The Nebraska GOP last outraised the Nebraska Democratic Party in 2022, according to NADC filings, primarily because of multiple six-figure donations from Ricketts prior to the convention.
That year, the party logged over $1 million in contributions, but only about $98,000 of that total came in after the July convention.
“This puts a spotlight on how Ricketts’ billionaire pocketbook has been propping up the Republican Party for so many years,” said Nebraska Democratic Party Chair Jane Kleeb.
Since the GOP leadership change, the Nebraska Democratic Party has raised more money, both locally and nationally. For example, during the high-stakes elections of 2024, the Democrats logged over $1 million in donations on NADC, which correlates to dollars intended to be spent on state and local races. The same year, the Nebraska GOP recorded $196,000 in contributions.
On the FEC, which tracks donations intended to be used for federal races, financial records are tracked over a two-year period. For 2023-2024, Nebraska Democrats recorded over $6.6 million in contributions compared to $2.8 million for the Nebraska GOP.
This year is still up in the air, though Democrats are currently in the lead with $322,000 in contributions filed in the FEC versus about $252,000 filed for the Nebraska GOP.
State parties in federal races often act as pass-through entities, with campaigns using the money to access parties’ lower-cost postage rate for sending campaign mailers and for voter outreach and engagement.
State-level giving to the parties remains more of a mystery, according to NADC filings. The Nebraska Democratic Party has recorded over $336,000 in donations so far this year, but the Nebraska GOP has yet to file. Nebraska GOP Chair Mary Jane Truemper said this is because the party hasn’t directly contributed to any state campaigns this year, so it is only required to make one financial report for all of 2025.
This funding disparity may not be obvious to most, as Republicans hold most elected offices and have gained ground in the Nebraska Legislature since 2022. Retiring U.S. Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., has also maintained his seat in the Omaha area’s highly competitive 2nd Congressional District.
What does it all mean?
According to Dona-Gene Barton, associate professor of political science at University of Nebraska-Lincoln, the explanation lies in Nebraska’s voter registrations, where Republicans remain dominant.
The latest voter registration statistics on Nebraska’s Secretary of State website show that there are over 623,000 registered Republicans in Nebraska, versus about 330,000 registered Democrats.
That large of a gap indicates that money doesn’t make much of a difference in most statewide races, Barton said. She noted the 2024 U.S. Senate race with independent candidate Dan Osborn challenging incumbent U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer, R-Neb.
Though Osborn was well-funded and put Fischer in a “weakened” position, Barton said, Fischer still comfortably won because she had the advantage of a built-in voter base.
“Despite the amount of money that was sunk into that race, the Republican still wins in the end,” Barton said.
Kleeb says Nebraska Democrats have gained ground since she became party chair in 2016, more than doubling the amount of Democrats in elected offices statewide. She also noted signs of progress in 2024, namely that Nebraska, which splits its electoral votes and awards them by congressional district like Maine, was the only battleground nationally that sent an electoral vote to Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris.

While funding may not make a massive difference, Kleeb said it helps candidates in local races. The party having more resources means those candidates can focus more of their energy on their specific regions.
Truemper largely agreed with this mindset, though she still believes the Nebraska GOP is in good shape. She said political parties always have to work with what they have, but the amount of funding parties receive determines the scale of what they can accomplish.
“It’s like a campaign — I’ve been a campaign manager,” said Truemper, who managed Bacon’s campaign in 2018 and later his primary opponent’s in 2024. “You have a plan, and then depending on how much money you have, you scale up or down.”
Barton agreed that party funding in a state like Nebraska is most likely to have an influence on lower-level elections and ballot measures. It’s particularly helpful when there are other factors at play that will motivate partisan and independent voters to go to the polls, like a promising presidential candidate, she said.
Evidence of this could be seen in 2024, when four of Nebraska’s six ballot initiatives favored more progressive outcomes, such as legalizing medical cannabis and approving mandatory paid sick leave. The outlier was a pair of competing abortion initiatives, which resulted in the more restrictive measure — Initiative 434 — prevailing.

Lately, Truemper said the Nebraska GOP has been more focused on regional, state and federal races, and have relied on county parties to support down-ballot races.
Fallout from the 2022 convention meant the Nebraska GOP basically “started from scratch,” Truemper said. She said the party shifted to a more “grassroots” effort reminiscent of what it looked like under former Gov. Dave Heineman.

During Heineman’s administration, Truemper said the governor focused less on directly funding the Nebraska GOP and instead encouraged party participation at the county level. This brought it a broader base of financial support statewide, she said.
When Ricketts took office, he funded much of the party’s activities, Truemper said. During that time, she said, some of the Nebraska GOP’s local bases of support “dried up,” though she declined to say that Ricketts was the main cause of that.
Still, Truemper gave Democrats props for their skill at raising money and using their funds strategically. She acknowledged that the Nebraska GOP isn’t raising as much as she would like, and said she is focusing on rebuilding the party’s fundraising base.
What comes next?
Heading into the 2026 election season, Truemper said the Nebraska GOP intends to prioritize the 2nd Congressional District House race, as well as Ricketts’ re-election bid. Ricketts faces a returning challenger in Osborn.
Truemper said the party plans to support Ricketts’ campaign by emphasizing the values and successes of GOP candidates in office and focusing on the importance of maintaining Republicans’ majority in the Senate.
“Financially, he doesn’t need our support,” she said with a laugh.
Truemper said she also hopes to increase the GOP’s majority in the Nebraska Legislature, which currently holds just enough votes to overcome opposing filibusters, if Republicans stick together on controversial bills.
“We are confident that the voters will see the improvement in the economy and the Republican’s common sense approach to policy as a reason to vote Republican in 2026,” Truemper said.
Truemper didn’t offer many details as to how she hopes to improve donations to the party. She only said she will focus on building relationships and seek support from the Republican National Convention.
Nationally, Republicans are outpacing Democrats in fundraising. Recent reporting from The Hill shared that the Republican National Committee raised over $16 million during the month of June — nearly double the $8.6 million the Democratic National Committee raised in the same period.
The Republican National Committee has nearly $66 million more in cash on hand through the first half of 2025 compared to the Democratic National Committee, CBS News reported. Federal filings show the RNC with $80.7 million by late June and the DNC with $15.2 million.
Kleeb said she is focusing on building out the Nebraska Democratic Party’s state and county-level infrastructure to better support local candidates. She also said the party is increasing its investment in voter registration efforts.
“We take the ridicule that the Republicans want to throw at us, because we haven’t won the big-ticket items that people only look at, but we’ve been building,” Kleeb said. “And we’ve been building towards what we think are going to be big wins for our party in ‘26 and ‘28.”
As expected, the Nebraska Democratic Party also plans to prioritize the 2nd District House race in 2026. Kleeb said they’ve learned from past elections that they need to invest in the region earlier. And the state party is working with local Democrats to recruit and support legislative candidates.
Nebraska Democratic Party Executive Director Precious McKesson said the party is organizing community support efforts in the area, as well as other events meant to improve the party’s visibility. McKesson said this stems from feedback they received that the party isn’t as present outside of election seasons.
Unlike most races, Barton said the House race in NE-02 is one where party funding could affect the outcome. Past elections in the district ended with razor-thin margins, and Republicans will no longer have the incumbency advantage with Bacon.
The nonpartisan Center for Politics, the home of Larry Sabato’s Crystal Ball, has shifted the Omaha-based House race to lean Democratic from toss-up. The Cook Political Report also shifted the race to lean Democrat.
“The fact that Don Bacon is not going to be seeking reelection is a very strong signal about the possibility of a Democrat winning that seat in the next election,” Barton said.

(Photo courtesy of Heather Murray)I have owned and operated a child care center for the past 19 years. Not only do I make sure staff and the bills are paid, I clean toilets, clean windows and change diapers.  I have devoted my life to educating and caring for young children. I didn’t go into this profession to line my pockets with money. But everyone in my field deserves a living wage and to know they are supported in their community. My goal is to create a safe and nurturing learning environment for the children who enter my center.  My belief is that their parents have decided to partner with us to make sure their children are getting the best possible environment to learn and grow.  
Creating  this high-quality environment for children has become increasingly hard over the years for child care providers in Wisconsin. Parents can’t pay more and providers need to keep qualified staff and pay them a liveable wage. For my center, wages for employees went up by $4 an hour recently  to keep up with the other businesses in my community.  
I started advocating and organizing around child care and early education right before the latest state  budget cycle. I found  there were some pretty big hurdles to jump over to get our legislators to listen to child care providers.
 I’ve heard legislators tell providers “all you want is money.” I’ve heard them say   “these women just need to learn how to run their business.”  My favorite observation is: “We don’t need child care.  Women should just stay home and take care of their children.”  It wasn’t easy to get anyone at the Capitol to take providers seriously. In the last state budget child care received no funding.  Wisconsin was  one of six states that did not put any state money into child care or early education. Gov. Evers did find a way to support providers with direct payments using federal money, which  helped keep many providers’ doors open throughout the state.  
Meanwhile, advocates and early educators kept coming to hearings,  talking about what we do on a daily basis and how that is important to our communities and the state.
Providers across Wisconsin held Community Conversations and Day Without Childcare events. Many elected officials from both sides of the aisle received tours of centers.  Providers also sent letters to the editor and talked with every type of news outlet that would listen. I am so proud of all the providers who stepped up and continued to push this message that what we do is important and we deserve support. As a result,  ideas at the Capitol started to shift.  
I spoke to legislators from both sides of the aisle. I heard legislators starting to talk about the “child care crisis” and realize that it wasn’t happening just because we didn’t know how to run our businesses. They started to say out loud that parents shouldn’t have to pay 25% of their income for  child care. Legislators who previously wouldn’t have said they supported child care investment said they would try and get something done.
In the end, the new state budget  wasn’t ideal but it did do two things: Direct payments will continue to go to providers for the next year and early education is finally funded with state dollars in the Wisconsin budget.
Does this budget solve everything? No. Does it provide the $330 million Evers sought in direct payments  to providers? No. Did Wisconsin for the first time  put state money into  early education? Yes — including $110 million in direct payments to providers Does it deregulate child care, increasing the number of  infants and toddlers one staff person can care for and allowing 16-year-olds to count as full-time assistants? Yes.

I absolutely do not think deregulation is the answer to the child care crisis. I believe it is harmful to children. I will not be participating in the deregulated infant/toddler program outlined in this budget.  I know I cannot get staff in my center to continue work when I ask them to take care of three more toddlers on their own. A single teacher in this proposed program would take care of seven toddlers ages 18 months and up. Right now that same teacher is expected to care for four toddlers that age. Even though some states have this ratio,  the National Association for the Education of Young Children clearly states best practice is 1:4 for this age group.
I would also not hire a 16-year-old as an assistant teacher to add to my staff. I don’t believe 16-year-olds are ready to handle large groups of small  children and provide the  quality time and interaction they need; 16-year-olds are still children themselves. And since they are in school themselves, they are not that much help with the labor  shortages centers experience all day long.
I’m grateful that Gov. Evers made child care a priority, and that our state finally joined the majority of other states in providing some support for this essential resource in the state budget.
Advocating for policy changes is a constant back and forth. Much of the time you don’t get  what you want. This means that we must go back in two years, to make Wisconsin’s child care support better and  more durable.  Child care advocates have created a strong network and we are not done advocating for the change needed for providers to keep their doors open and for educators to earn a living wage. I believe child care is infrastructure and a public good.  Together with other child care providers, I will continue to advocate and educate our leaders about how a well supported child care system is essential to  our community and our economy.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Tennessee leaders joined an Elon Musk company’s officials Monday in announcing plans to bore an underground tunnel dubbed the “Music City Loop” from downtown Nashville to burgeoning Nashville International Airport.
Musk’s Boring Company initially would dig a 10-mile tunnel from the Music City Center to the airport on the city’s southeast side using land beneath state-owned roads. All-electric vehicles, possibly Musk’s Teslas, would be used to carry riders on an eight-minute transit. 
In a press conference at the airport Hilton, Gov. Bill Lee said the estimated two-year project would be privately funded and not require any public money or tax breaks. A press release from the Governor’s Office said the company plans to start construction as soon as the approval process is complete and the first part of the loop could be operating by fall 2026, though the governor said environmental permits would not be expedited.
Lee declined to give an estimated cost for the tunnel but said it “will transform the way people travel from the airport” to downtown Nashville.
Officials predicted the loop will remove thousands of vehicles from Nashville roads, though neither state officials nor Boring Company President Steve Davis gave many details about ride estimates or costs.
Davis admitted digging a tunnel through Middle Tennessee’s limestone will be difficult but said the company makes safety a priority. Customers should be able to walk out of the airport and be less than 100 feet from the tunnel to downtown Nashville, he said.

Davis credited Nashville with being “so welcoming and kind” for the project’s quick takeoff and said the tunnel could branch out across Middle Tennessee with numerous stations eventually.
U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy attended Monday’s announcement, calling the project “innovation at its finest.” He said the project will have federal support.
It also has the backing of the Tennessee and Metro Nashville Chambers of Commerce, the Metro Nashville Airport Authority, which is tied up in a lawsuit with state over board appointments, and the Greater Nashville Hospitality Association.
Nashville Mayor Freddie O’Connell did not attend Monday’s press conference. But Lee said the mayor is supporting the project.
U.S. Sen. Marsha Blackburn in a video address to the event’s audience said Boring Company received a 99.57% safety and security rating from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and Transportation Security Administration for its work on the Vegas Loop.
Nashville’s Democratic legislative delegation wasn’t invited to Monday’s press conference, and Rep. John Ray Clemmons criticized the proposal afterward, saying Musk found an “easy target in starry-eyed Bill Lee.”
“No responsible executive would give away unrestricted and unlimited underground property rights to an unhinged billionaire, who (President) Donald Trump doesn’t even trust anymore, and grant him and his company exclusive access rights beneath our city and a monopoly to profit in perpetuity,” Clemmons said in a statement.
Clemmons said problems have arisen from the Las Vegas project because of a lack of oversight and regulations, and he questioned potential consequences of the Nashville project’s environmental impact as well as threats posed by boring on the city’s aged stormwater and “fragile” wastewater system. 
The plan marks the second project Musk is undertaking in Tennessee’s two biggest cities. An artificial intelligence facility under way in Memphis is drawing opposition from Democratic state Rep. Justin Pearson, who says it will create more pollution that the city’s residents will be forced to breathe.

The Boring Company is in the midst of building the Vegas Loop, a 2.2-mile tunnel that uses Tesla vehicles to carry riders. Initially, it was to have 29 miles of underground tunnels connecting 51 stations around central Las Vegas but fell under criticism for focusing on tourism spots instead of helping workers commute from home to work, according to reports. The project involves the use of Tesla vehicles to transport riders.
A similar tunnel proposal was made in 2018 as part of former Mayor Megan Barry’s $5.4 billion plan to improve transportation. That idea, which was to be funded by a sales tax increase, failed by a 64-36 margin in a local referendum after Barry resigned amid scandal. The plan included 24 miles of light rail and 25 miles of bus rapid  transit.
Nashville Mayor O’Connell is pushing a new transportation plan, expected to cost $3.1 billion over 15 years, that would focus on increased bus routes, transit centers, park and ride facilities and new sidewalks and bike routes.
Monday’s proposal displays a shift in attitude for airport officials who recently responded to WSMV questions by saying, “Since late 2024, there have been numerous rumored and/or hypothetical discussions regarding connecting Nashville International Airport to downtown via tunnel, just like the theoretical discussions regarding the possibility of colonizing Mars in the future.”
At Monday’s event, Metro Nashville Airport President and CEO Doug Kreulen said, “this potential initiative is an important step toward easing roadway congestion and enhancing access to the airport.

They underwrite almost every aspect of life, from the ability to plan for retirement to visiting family over publicly funded roads. But since 1960, the people who fuel the state’s economic engine have been leaving in droves. 
In terms of population growth in the U.S., Michigan has consistently come in 49th over a 30-year period. Making matters worse, the state faces a severe demographic crisis with birth rates projected to decrease through at least 2050 — a crisis now compounded by threats to the immigrant communities helping to fill the gap.

Immigrants, documented or undocumented, are essential to Michigan’s future, already representing roughly 60% of the state’s population growth over the last decade. 
But the current administration’s campaign of mass deportation represents a direct threat to Michigan’s immigrants, who are our neighbors, co-workers and business owners. The campaign not only threatens these people in our communities but is also a direct threat to Michigan’s fiscal sustainability, potentially removing a significant portion of the workforce and taxpayer base that the state’s economy depends on for continued growth and demographic stability.
The immigrant community brings unique strengths that particularly benefit Michigan’s economic future and are vital to Michigan’s key economic sectors. In U.S. agriculture, Michigan is the sixth largest recipient of H-2A agricultural worker visas, with 19,000 migrant and seasonal farmworkers supporting Michigan’s place as the 16th largest agricultural-exporting state by value. In auto manufacturing, immigrants comprise 14% of the workforce, which the state has identified as a priority industry. The technology sector especially benefits from immigrant innovation, with 30% of Michigan’s software developers being foreign-born — workers who nationally represent 16% of inventors but generate nearly one-quarter of America’s total innovative output when assessed by patent volume, citations received and market value. In health care, where immigrants represent 28% of Michigan’s physicians, they are filling essential roles in a sector under strain, with 32.7% of physicians nearing retirement and 65 of 83 counties designated as health professional shortage areas. 
Furthermore, immigrant tax contributions, which are long-term net positive regardless of legal status, are crucial for Michigan. Immigrants in the state are estimated to pay $5.5 billion and $2.6 billion in federal and state and local taxes, respectively. They are also 24% more likely to be of working age and therefore net fiscal contributors. Some 70,000 immigrant children currently comprise 15% of Michigan’s high school population, making them a significant portion of the future labor force and tax base. 
The state budget is sensitive to revenue changes that could create a mid-year deficit. Deporting immigrants threatens to destabilize the budget in the long run and further destabilize crucial programs like Medicare and Social Security, which undocumented immigrants pay into but cannot benefit from. But new laws and policies in 2025 aim to discourage immigration, encourage self-deportation and expel new Michiganders en masse. 
The so-called “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” imposes a new regime of immigration-related fines and fees while decreasing benefit access, rendering immigration unaffordable for many. Simultaneously, the law strips away crucial support systems by blocking lawfully present immigrants from Affordable Care Act premium tax credits and marketplace eligibility, cutting federal Medicaid funding for states and eliminating Child Tax Credit benefits for 22,300 Michigan children — U.S. citizens —  whose parents pay taxes with Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers (ITINs) but lack Social Security numbers. 
These punitive measures transform the immigration system into a pay-to-play system that threatens to lock out would-be taxpaying community members from Michigan’s labor force. 
More fundamentally, the law launches an unprecedented campaign of mass deportation by quadrupling the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s (ICE) detention capacity and flooding communities with immigration agents empowered to raid schools, churches and hospitals — once spaces of safety. 
The $13.5 billion allocated to expand 287(g) agreements that deputize local police to carry out immigration enforcement will further fracture the trust between immigrant families and the institutions meant to protect them. This creates a pervasive atmosphere of fear where parents avoid taking sick children to hospitals, students stop attending school and workers disappear from essential industries rather than risk detention and family separation.
Protecting and welcoming immigrants is not just a moral imperative but an economic necessity. As the state grapples with chronic population decline, an aging workforce and tight budget margins, it cannot afford to squander the demographic dividend that immigration provides. Michigan can embrace the entrepreneurs, innovators and workers that underwrite its future or watch them flee. 
While other states compete aggressively for international talent and investment, Michigan risks ceding its economic recovery by allowing fear to eclipse opportunity and growth. Michigan’s success will ultimately be measured not by how many people it expels, but by how many it inspires to call the Great Lakes State home.

Minimum fines for speeding in a construction zone increase to $150 on Aug. 1, 2025. Other speeding fines will increase, too. (Jeff Beach/North Dakota Monitor) North Dakota’s interstate speed limit is going up to 80 mph on Friday, but in some areas, the speed limit will go down. 
The state is lowering the speed limit to 70 mph on interstate segments at Dickinson, Grand Forks, Jamestown, Valley City and Medora. Those areas had previously been 75 mph. 
“The biggest change for people will be slowing down in those areas, and so I think that will be more what we’ll hear about after Aug. 1 than even the 80 miles per hour change,” Lt. Jenna Clawson Huibregtse with the North Dakota Highway Patrol said. 
Bismarck and Fargo have already had slower interstate speeds and those areas are expanding. 
The 55 mph speed limit in West Fargo will stretch west to the Sheyenne Street exit. The lower speed limit area east of Bismarck will be lengthened by one more exit, to Exit 161. 
The higher speed limit, along with an increase in fines for speeding, was hammered out in a compromise in the waning days of this year’s legislative session. 
North Dakota speed limit going up Aug. 1 as governor signs bill 

Other changes approved by the Legislature affecting drivers include new rules on tinted windows and the availability of what are known as “blackout plates” — license plates with white letters and numbers on a plain black background. 
North Dakota’s rule has been that tinting of windshields and front windows must let at least 50% of the sunlight through. That will be reduced to 35% 
Those changes also take effect Friday. 
While the speed limit is going up, drivers won’t see the new signs right away. 
The contractor hired by the North Dakota Department of Transportation won’t be replacing the 75 mph signs with the 80 mph signs until Monday, and it will take at least two weeks for the new signs to go up. 
Drivers can still go 80 legally though. 
“It’s North Dakota law, so people are allowed to drive 80,” Clawson Huibregtse said. 
Many drivers already go 80. She said the average speed on North Dakota interstates is 81 mph. 
Clawson Huibregtse said the faster speeds mean drivers should increase their following distance. 
“You have to give yourself more time to stop if something occurs in front of you or somebody jams on their brake,” she said. 
The bill that increased the speed limit also increased speeding fines, but with a simpler calculation for those fines, which Clawson Huibregtse said is a benefit to state troopers. 
She said troopers previously had to consult about 10 different tables to calculate the speeding fine. 
“This simplified it down to two plus your special zones like construction zones and school zones, so significantly less cumbersome,” she said. “It did increase fine fines a little bit, but we are still the cheapest state in the nation to get a speeding ticket.” 
There also are increased fines for areas such as school zones and construction zones. The additional fine for speeding in a construction zone with workers present would increase from $80 to $150.
For highways with a speed limit of 65 mph or higher, the fine will be $20 or $5 for every mile per hour over the limit, whichever is greater. If the driver is going more than 16 mph over the limit., $20 is added to the fine. A driver ticketed for going 95 mph in a 80 zone would be fined $75; but if the ticket is for 96 mph, the fine jumps up to $100.

Adrian Smith is proposing additional tax relief aimed at increasing U.S production of minerals used in electronics,"U.S. Rep. Adrian Smith, R-Neb., listens to a presenter on Monday, June 19, 2023, in Lincoln, Neb. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN – Nebraska Republican U.S. Rep. Adrian Smith is proposing additional tax relief aimed at increasing American production of minerals used in electronics, including microchips. 
The legislation aims to increase the “depletion allowance” for producers of rare earth materials and scandium from 14% to match the tax break enjoyed by producers of minerals deemed the “highest-priority,” which is 22%. 
The “depletion allowance” is a tax break that allows companies that mine the materials to “recover a percentage of gross income.” 
Smith, a senior member of the House’s tax-writing Weighs and Means Committee, represents Nebraska’s largely rural 3rd Congressional District. He introduced the measure along with California Democratic Rep. Jimmy Panetta and Pennsylvania Republican Rep. Guy Reschenthaler. 
“Embracing our nation’s full capacity to produce critical minerals at home is essential to growing our economy,” Smith said in a statement. 
Rare earth materials and scandium are used in a wide variety of technologies, from smartphones to electric vehicles, wind turbines and even jet fighters. The 17 types of metals known as “rare earth” minerals are actually quite common and mined globally, but China has cornered a near-monopoly on refining them. 
Nebraska has a rare-earth mine in the southeastern part of the state that is home to the second-largest deposit of rare earth elements in the U.S. The mining company, NioCorp, plans to ramp up pre-construction efforts. The other mine is in Montana. 
China, earlier this year, paused the export of several rare earth minerals and metals as a response to President Donald Trump’s tariffs on Chinese goods. In April, Ukraine and the U.S. signed an agreement granting the U.S. a stake in its mineral reserves in exchange for tacit security guarantees against future Russian aggression.

(Allen Best/Big Pivots)This story is the first part of a four-part series about three groundwater basins in Colorado. It was originally published by Big Pivots. The story was commissioned by Water Education Colorado and a version of it appears in the summer 2025 issue of Headwaters magazine.
To understand the predicament in the Republican River Basin of eastern Colorado, you need to appreciate the volume of water being hoisted from the underlying High Plains Aquifer. The most important component is the Ogallala.
Farmers and the few small towns in the Republican River Basin average 720,000 acre-feet of withdrawals annually. In one hot and dry year, 2012, they pumped 940,000 acre-feet. As a point of reference, Blue Mesa Reservoir, the largest water body in the state, can hold 947,435 acre-feet.
Groundwater mining cannot be sustained far into the future in many areas of the Republican River Basin. Wells in some areas have not declined while wells in other areas have declined 13 feet during the last decade. Pumping at existing rates cannot be maintained. Within 25 years, about a third of land that’s now irrigated will have no water. In other places, pumps already sputter.

“Sustainable” and “pumping” do not belong in the same sentence in this basin. The water of the Republican River Basin in the High Plains Aquifer accumulated from 18 to 4 million years ago.
Far from the snowmelt of the Rocky Mountains, it is recharged by minimal surface water. Based on studies, the Republican River Compact of Colorado, Nebraska and Kansas assumes that 17% of the water on the surface trickles down through the ground to the aquifers. So, only very slowly is the aquifer recharged. It’s mostly an ancient bank account with now small, almost tiny deposits and fast-and-furious withdrawals.
The Republican River Basin and several other regions of the state rely largely on groundwater. In a 2024 decision, Colorado Supreme Court justices pointed out that it would be difficult to overstate the importance of groundwater given the state’s population and arid climate. The 285,000 wells poked into the earth across the state deliver 18% of Colorado’s water.
The Republican River Basin, the San Luis Valley, and the south metro area of the Denver Basin are all, to varying degrees, rethinking water — both its sources and uses. All three have historically relied heavily on groundwater, and all have made at least limited progress in shifting toward more sustainable groundwater use in the last 20 years. The cities have adopted policies that foster smaller, less water-intensive lawns. They have diversified their sources. Two south-metro water utilities that 20 years ago pulled nearly all their water from wells, today have lessened that dependency to 60% to 65%.
Farmers in the Republican River Basin and San Luis Valley have somewhat different challenges. They have taken action to use less water and to save their communities, but whether those actions match the scale of the challenges they face is another matter. Changes can best be achieved before emergency sirens wail. In the Republican River Basin, some already see a swirl of red lights warning of catastrophe ahead.
It’s going fast
The Republican River Basin consists of 7,000 square miles, an area slightly smaller than New Jersey. It is largely located within a triangle between Julesburg, Limon and Cheyenne Wells. A few businesses cater to travelers but agriculture constitutes nearly all of the basin’s economic foundation.
An average 17 inches of precipitation falls per year across the basin, less in some areas. High-dollar agriculture depends almost entirely upon water drawn from the Ogallala. A 2010 state report found that of the basin’s 600,000 acres then under irrigation, only 1,000 were supplied by surface water. Locals suggest the true number is far, far less.
Dryland farming prevailed until the arrival of high-capacity pumps and rural electrification in the late 1940s. Farmers in the 1950s began converting dryland areas to irrigation, dramatically expanding crop yields. Other farmers arrived to plow hitherto virgin turf. Twice in the 1970s, groundwater extraction exceeded a million acre-feet per year.
Drafting of groundwater via 5,000 wells today produces a bounty of herbaceous crops. Most end up in the bellies of livestock. Two feedlots near Yuma alone can each hold more than 150,000 cattle and several others can accommodate 75,000. The basin also has three hog farms, several dairies, and an ethanol plant.
  (Nebraska Department of Water, Energy and Environment)
In 1942, Colorado, Nebraska and Kansas allocated the waters of the Republican River and its tributaries in an interstate compact. The state engineer in 1973 ordered a moratorium on new wells. The most powerful limitation did not come until 1990. Rules were changed, reducing the allowed rate of depletion, effectively precluding new well permits.
Existing wells, however, were drawing down the aquifers in the Republican River Basin. Kansas in the 1990s complained that it was getting shorted by Nebraska. Nebraska in turn blamed Colorado. A 2002 settlement stipulation among the three states represented a new line in the sand. By whatever means, Colorado had to figure out how to deliver water to the downriver states.
Colorado responded by forming the Republican River Water Conservation District. In effect, the state gave farmers and others in the eight-county district responsibility for figuring out how to comply with the compact. To help achieve compliance, legislators gave the district authority to levy fees on irrigators. The fee, originally $5 per acre, has been boosted twice and is now $30 per acre annually.
This $15 million in annual revenue is used in several ways. An early project was a pipeline to boost the amount of water flowing into Nebraska. The pipeline carries water from eight wells previously used for irrigation. They had been drilled amid hills with sugar-like sand between Wray and Holyoke in the deepest part of the aquifer. The water from these wells flows 12.6 miles through the pipeline and into the North Fork near the Nebraska border. The wells are pumped from October to April, ensuring minimal loss to evaporation or riverine trees or grasses.
This pipeline, since its completion in 2012, has allowed Colorado to meet its compact delivery requirements. The cost of the wells, pipeline, and water rights was $72 million. Faced with declining production from these wells, the district in 2025 is planning four more wells and 9.5 miles of pipe at an estimated cost of $14 million to deliver what the compact pledges to Nebraska.
  With members and staff of the Republican River Water Conservation District looking on, Colorado Gov. Jared Polis signed a bill in May 2023 that allocated $30 million to be used to retire irrigated acreage as necessary to meet a 2029 deadline. (Office of Gov. Jared Polis)
In another move toward compact compliance, Bonny Reservoir, a 165,238 acre-foot impoundment on the South Fork of the Republican, was drained. Prior to the 2011 draining, Bonny had delighted boaters and anglers but lost too much water to evaporation and seepage. Water now flows more efficiently downstream.
More actions were needed to ensure Nebraska and Kansas received their apportioned water. Beginning in 2006, Colorado removed 30,000 to 35,000 acres from irrigation. A multi-state agreement in 2016 specified that Colorado would remove an additional 25,000 acres in the South Fork drainage by 2029. Dick Wolfe, then Colorado’s state engineer, was asked at the time how this was to be done. He paused a moment, then likened it to getting a haircut: a snip here, a snip there.
This snipping of irrigated acreage has been encouraged with financial incentives assembled from pots of local, state and federal funds. The money is delivered via two federal programs: the Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP), and the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP). The latter allows farmers to use the land for dryland farming or grazing.
By early 2025, the Republican River Water Conservation District had retired 17,120 of the 25,000 acres as required by the 2016 settlement. It was a milestone, a time for momentary celebration. The harder work lies ahead. Nearly 8,000 additional acres must be retired to meet the December 2029 deadline. If the goal is not met, the state engineer has authority to shut down wells. Nobody wants that, least of all the state engineer. To help sweeten the incentives in 2025, state legislators appropriated $6 million. This adds $750 to the $4,500 per acre paid to farmers participating in CREP and $750 to the $3,500 per acre in EQIP.
  By June 2025, Bonny Reservoir in Yuma County had a forest of trees, but the water that had drawn boaters and anglers was drained in 2011. (Allen Best/Big Pivots)
Using less water is the paramount challenge. This has been accomplished almost exclusively by taking land out of irrigation. There are other ways, too. Today, corn is king, responsible for about 85% of irrigated acres in the basin. It commonly receives 20 to 22 inches of supplemental water. A growing realization of late has been that less can be more. Planting fewer seeds — say 18,000 per acre instead of 30,000 — will save money and require less fertilizer. Fewer seeds will then require only 12 to 14 inches of supplemental water, meaning less pumping and shaving electricity bills. Lower crop yields can counterintuitively produce better profit margins.
Conversations are also underway about water-conserving crop alternatives: milo, millet and wheat, kidney and pinto beans, even black-eyed peas. It’s partly a matter of developing markets. Deb Daniel, the general manager of the district since 2011, has been toying with how to emphasize productivity strategies with the phrase “crop per drop.”
None of this adds up to the scale of the challenge, though.
  Most of the water in the Republican River comes from the aquifers, and by Wray there’s little in the river. (Allen Best/Big Pivots)
Kenny Helling, a fourth-generation farmer from the Idalia area of Yuma County, believes more is needed than financial incentives to take land out of production. “Continuing to throw money at the problem won’t fix the problem,” he says. Ways must be found to keep land in irrigation, because irrigated land pays more in property taxes. Those taxes are crucial for operating fire departments, schools and other community purposes. “It’s a very big concern to me.”
The answers? Helling sees value in permits specifying reduced volume of pumped water. He would like to see more crop rotation.
Helling was a member of the Republican River Water Conservation District Board of Directors for nine years. He says the district needs other tools. The true authority for limiting pumping belongs to the eight groundwater subdistricts within the basin. They do not use it. Why?
“Everybody on those groundwater management districts are generally irrigators,” says Helling. “Most of them are neighbors. A lot of them go to church together. A lot of them might have kids and grandkids in school together. Nobody wants to make anybody mad. And so, unfortunately, the groundwater management districts do not use all the authority they could to restrict the amount of water used.”
Colorado legislators, he says, need to give the Republican River Water Conservation District more authority. It needs sticks, not just carrots. “We need to use less water.”
Tim Pautler told members of the Colorado Groundwater Commission something similar in May 2025. A dryland farmer from the Stratton area, he has served on the Republican River Water Conservation District’s Board of Directors for 21 years. He says that the board has accomplished almost no basin-wide conservation. It hasn’t figured out how to substantially reduce water use.
Most landowners who have taken advantage of the incentives have been irrigators who have less groundwater available in their wells — nearly all in the southwestern portion of the basin, where many wells were already sputtering. He says if reduced water use is the goal, the fees charged to farmers must be based on acre-feet of water pumped and not just on irrigated acres.
There’s no pretense of sustainability in the Republican River Basin. The water deposited over millions of years is now being mined. The task is to maximize value of the remaining water, to prolong the availability of the High Plains Aquifer. Few have yet been willing to talk about the gravity of the challenge.
“I hope enough water remains in the hole to sustain society,” says Pautler. “I hope we don’t go completely dry.”

(Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)Louisiana’s newest member of Congress accuses President Donald Trump of unconstitutional actions that he says are destroying democracy. 
U.S. Rep. Cleo Fields, a Democrat representing Louisiana’s new 6th Congressional District, delivered his remarks Monday to the Baton Rouge Press Club. 
“I think the president is really bringing this country closer and closer to a dictatorship, and I’ve said to my constituents the best way to deal with a bully is to stand up to him,” Fields said.
The White House did not provide a response when reached for comment Monday afternoon. 
Fields’ remarks were particularly pointed for the even-keeled congressman who has been a fixture of politics in Baton Rouge since the 1990s. Fields is known both for his progressive politics and his willingness to work with Republicans, having previously chaired a state Senate committee in a Republican super-majority thanks to his close relationship with Gov. Jeff Landry.

His speech focused primarily on Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill, which Fields called “one big ugly bill” because of the legislation’s steep cuts to the nation’s social safety net programs. The bill will reduce federal spending on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program by roughly $186 billion and cut nearly $1 trillion from Medicaid, which is estimated to take health coverage away from 10 million people, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. 
“Hospitals will close,” Fields said. “Grocery stores will close.”
The congressman also criticized Trump’s spending and tax law for its massive debt burden. The measure extends tax breaks and provisions that largely benefit wealthy earners and owners of large estates, businesses and trust funds. It is forecast to increase federal deficits by $3.8 trillion from 2025 through 2034, according to the Tax Foundation. 
The one “silver lining” in the legislation, Fields said, is its provision that exempts taxes on tips. It was the only  part of the bill he supported, he said. Workers can deduct the first $25,000 in tips they earn from their taxable income, but any additional amount is subject to federal income taxes. The tax break is not available to anyone who earns more than $150,000 a year.
Fields also weighed in on the Trump administration’s immigration policy. He said he believes the U.S. should maintain secure borders but disapproves of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s aggressive tactics. Using masked agents to grab people off the street and imprison them in foreign lands without affording them a court hearing is “simply unconscionable” and a violation of due process rights in the Constitution, he said.
Fields said he still has faith in the U.S. Supreme Court to abide by the Constitution but criticized the GOP-majority Congress for abandoning its duty as a separate, equal branch of government that is supposed to limit presidential overreaches. 
“We’re destroying our democracy as we know it today,” Fields said. “It’s not about party; it’s about right and wrong, constitutional and unconstitutional.”
Although Fields took several jabs at Trump, his overall soft-spoken messaging contrasts with Democratic Party strategies to break through to voters constantly bombarded with digital distractions. His most pointed comments came in response to questions from reporters, which he fielded during most of the luncheon. His prepared speech was short and focused largely on issues affecting his constituents. 
“I think our discourse should always be civil no matter how much we disagree … but people need to go to the polls and vote,” he said. 
Asked if he feels Democrats need to embrace a more politically charged messaging style that focuses on Republican scandals such the Jeffrey Epstein files in order to turn out voters, Fields said he plans to stick to his old strategy.
“I think we should deal with the issues that affect people back home directly,” he said.

(Douglas Sacha | Getty Images)For those who have been following the state’s opioid epidemic over the years, it probably came as no surprise more than half of the money cities and counties spent last year from their first share of the settlement funds went to law enforcement.
West Virginia has a serious drug problem. For years, the Mountain State has been referred to as “ground zero” for the nation’s ongoing drug and overdose epidemic.
Research has proven that the most effective way to help people who use drugs intravenously is syringe service programs. These programs provide free needles for drug users to help stop the spread of diseases, like HIV and hepatitis C.
However, those programs are banned in West Virginia. 
And while harm reduction programs have proven to be effective, lawmakers continue to make it difficult to open or run them. 
The National Institute on Drug Abuse says that the best way to help people addicted to opioids is to treat them with medication, like methadone, which is more effective for people addicted to fentanyl. Researchers say more methadone centers are needed to help with the drug epidemic. 
West Virginia has nine methadone clinics, and state law prohibits any more from opening.
There’s also a shortage of treatment beds — specifically in the areas of the state that have been hardest hit by the drug epidemic.
Instead of passing any laws that are considered “best practices” to aid those in recovery and addiction, lawmakers have chosen to focus on criminalization of people who suffer from substance use disorder and harsher penalties for those drug dealers (which, oftentimes, are themselves suffering from substance use disorder).
So after West Virginia Watch reporter Caity Coyne spent hours and hours putting together data from a spending report from the West Virginia First Foundation, neither of us were shocked when the numbers showed the majority (52.76%) of the money went to law enforcement.
Rehabilitation, recovery and treatment programs received only 6.43% of the initial round of localities’ opioid funding. 
The state’s memorandum of understanding dictates how the opioid funds can be spent — which is basically on anything that can be used to help drug abatement efforts.
Caity reported that police across the state have so far received $3.64 million of the opioid settlement money, for things like 22 new police cruisers, officers’ salaries, drug K-9 teams, firearms, ammo and a new shooting range.
Sure, you can argue that police will keep drug dealers off the street and that helps with the drug epidemic. But new guns and ammo? A shooting range? Drones? It doesn’t inspire much confidence or hope that so many of the agencies responding to these issues seem to be entering the situation with the presumed need to fire their guns. 
Granville Police invested more than $7,000 in “more accurate” firearms. The Madison Police Department bought a moving shooting target system that can mimic the “unpredictable movement, variable speeds and irregular patterns” of people in a “mental health crisis” or who are suffering from “drug-induced psychosis or aggression.”
Or if they must have weapons, a better use of the money would be on less lethal items, like tasers or stun guns. Or training like Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion (LEAD), which teaches officers to divert individuals struggling with drug addiction into intensive support programs instead of putting them in jail.
It’s also disappointing to see counties spend the money on their jails. I understand that running a jail is expensive, but this is one-time money. And, to be clear, if we’re putting such a large portion of money into law enforcement to increase arrests, these jail bills are only going to rise.
There are ways that counties can lessen those operating costs  — such as harm reduction programs and alternative sentencing instead of jailing people, and creating shelter beds for homeless people instead of arresting them for being homeless.
More than 65% of this first round of opioid settlement money has been used on things that are not at all proven to help with the state’s drug problem. This money was split between law enforcement, jail bills and local governments paying their bills. 
Meanwhile, just around 31% went to areas that actually provide direct services and, possibly, save some lives.
Quick response teams, which are often a mix of police officials, counselors, peer coaches and first responders, received 9.92%. Emergency medical services received 9.3%. Since they often respond to drug overdose calls, it makes more sense for them to receive funding for vehicles and equipment.
It sounds great that youth services received money, even if it was only 5.98%, until you look at where most of it went.
GameChanger is a drug prevention program established in 2018 that has set a goal to be in all West Virginia schools. The program has dozens of sponsors, and according to tax documents, received about $1 million in funding from businesses, the government and private companies, according to reporting from West Virginia University. 
A teacher participating in the GameChanger program said “There’s no real curriculum,” and they must plan lessons themselves. Prevention experts say the program lacks a research-backed curriculum and has no measurable outcomes to show.
Just like the state Legislature, cities and counties have — for the most part — chosen to ignore experts and use this funding in a way that won’t help reduce drug overdoses. 
Until lawmakers start listening to actual medical experts, things will never improve.

It looked for a while like the coal mining era was over in the Clearfork Valley of East Tennessee, a pocket of mountainous land on the Kentucky border. A permit for a new mine hasn’t been issued since 2020, and the last mine in the region shuttered two years ago. One company after another has filed for bankruptcy, with many of them simply walking away from the ecological damage they’d wrought without remediating the land as the law requires.
But there’s going to be a new mine in East Tennessee — one of a few slated across the country, their permits expedited by President Donald Trump’s declaration of an “energy emergency” and his designating coal a critical mineral.
Trump was only hours into his second term when he signed an executive order declaring a national energy emergency that directed federal agencies to “identify and exercise any lawful emergency authorities available to them” to identify and exploit domestic energy resources. The administration also scrapped Biden-era rules that made it easier to bring mining-related complaints to the federal government.
The emergency designation compresses the typically yearslong environmental review required for a new mine to just weeks. These assessments are to be compiled within 14 days of receiving a permit application, limiting comment periods to 10 days. The process of compiling an environmental impact statement — a time-intensive procedure involving scientists from many disciplines and assessments of wildlife populations, water quality, and other factors — is reduced to less than a month. The government insists this eliminates burdensome red tape.
“We’re not just issuing permits — we’re supporting communities, securing supply chains for critical industries, and making sure the U.S. stays competitive in a changing global energy landscape,” Adam Suess, the acting assistant secretary for land and minerals management at the Interior Department, said in a statement. A representative of the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement told Grist that community safety is top of mind, pointing to the administration’s $725 million investment in abandoned mineland reclamation.
The Department of Interior ruled that a new mine slated for Bryson Mountain in Claiborne County, Tennessee, would have “no significant impact” and approved it. It will provide about two dozen jobs. The strip mine will cover 635 acres of previously mined land that has reverted to forest. Hurricane Creek Mining plans to pry 1.8 million tons of coal from the earth over 10 years.
The Clearfork Valley, which straddles two rural counties and has long struggled economically, bears the scars of more than a century of underground and surface mining. Local residents and scientists regularly test the creeks for signs of bright-orange mine drainage and other toxins.
The land is part of a tract the Nature Conservancy bought in 2019 for conservation purposes, but because of ownership structures in the coalfields, it owns only the land, not the minerals within it. “We have concerns about the potential environmental impacts of the operation,” the organization said in a statement. “We seek assurance that there will be adequate bonding, consistent and transparent environmental monitoring, and good reclamation practices.”
Matt Hepler, an environmental scientist with the environmental advocacy group Appalachian Voices, has been following the mine’s public review process since the company applied for a permit in 2023. He remains skeptical that things will work out well for Hurricane Creek Mining. Despite Trump’s promise that he is “bringing back an industry that’s been abandoned,” coal has seen a steady decline, driven in no small part by the plummeting price of natural gas. The number of people working in the nation’s coal mines has steadily declined from 89,000 or so in 2012 to about 41,300 today. Production fell 31 percent during Trump’s first and has continued that slide.
“What is this company doing differently that’s going to allow them to profitably succeed while so many other mines have not been able to make that work?” he said. “All the time I’ve been working in Tennessee there’s only been a couple of mines permitted to begin with because production has been on the downswing there,” Hepler added.
Economists say opening more mines may not reverse the global downward trend. Plentiful, cheap natural gas, along with increasingly affordable wind and solar, are displacing coal as an energy source. The situation is so dire that one Stanford University study argued that gas would continue its climb even with the elimination of coal-related regulations. Metallurgical coal used to make steel — and which Hurricane Creek hopes  to excavate — fares no better. It has seen flat or declining demand amid innovation in steel production.
Expedited permits are leading to new mines in the West as well. The Department of the Interior just approved a land lease for Wyoming’s first new coal mine in 50 years. Ramaco Resources will extract and process the material to retrieve the rare earth and other critical minerals found alongside it. The Trump administration also is selling coal leases on previously protected federal land. Shiloh Hernandez, a senior attorney at the Northern Rockies office of the environmental nonprofit Earthjustice, thinks it is a fool’s errand.
“I don’t see them changing the fundamental dynamics of coal,” he said. “That’s not to say that the Trump administration won’t cause lots of harm in the process by both making the public pay more money for energy than they should and by keeping some of these coal plants and coal mines that really are zombies.”
Still, Hernandez said he isn’t seeing many new permits, just quicker approval of those already in the pipeline. That said, the Trump administration’s moves to streamline environmental review will reduce oversight and the time the public has to scrutinize coal projects.
“The result is there’s just going to be it’s going to be more difficult for the public to participate, and more harm is going to occur,” Hernandez said. “There’s going to be less attention to the harm that’s caused by these operations.”

(Win McNamee/Getty Images)A federal appeals court on Monday overturned a lower court ruling that had prevented enforcement of an Arkansas law limiting the number of voters someone can assist at the polls.
The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals’ ruling vacated a permanent injunction granted by a federal district judge that declared Act 658 of 2009 in violation of the federal Voting Rights Act. Monday’s ruling also overturned the award of attorneys’ fees granted by U.S. District Judge Timothy Brooks of Arkansas’ Eastern District.
Act 658 prohibits someone other than a poll worker from helping more than six voters mark and cast their ballots. Immigrant advocacy group Arkansas United sued in 2020 to block enforcement of the six-voter limit, saying it violated the Voting Rights Act. Arkansas United traditionally helps voters with limited English skills at the polls.
Brooks enjoined enforcement of the six-voter limit in 2022, and the circuit court stayed the injunction about two months before that year’s elections. The state filed an updated appeal challenging Brooks’ award of about $103,000 in attorneys fees to Arkansas United and its co-plaintiffs in 2023.
Monday’s circuit court ruling used the same reasoning the court used in an Arkansas redistricting case in which it declared that only the U.S. attorney general can enforce the Voting Rights Act’s provisions. The historic voting rights law does not grant individuals or private organizations the right to sue for enforcement, the appeals court decided in 2023, thereby upending years of precedent.
“In Arkansas State Conference NAACP v. Arkansas Board of Apportionment,” the appeals court said Monday, “… we held there is no private right of action under § 2 of the Voting Rights Act (VRA). Here, we are asked to decide whether there is a private right of action under § 208 of the VRA. Like the provision at issue in Arkansas State Conference, we conclude the text and structure of § 208 do not create a private right of action.”
The circuit court ruling says Section 208 “speaks only of the assistance that a voter ‘may be given’ … it is silent as to ‘who can enforce it.’”

In a statement Monday, Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin said the circuit judges “properly determined that the district court erred by denying the State’s motion for summary judgment and by ruling for the plaintiffs.” 
Monday’s decision means election officials can continue to enforce the law and voters have confidence in elections, he said. 
Act 658 of 2009, signed into law by then-Gov. Mike Beebe, a Democrat, “protects the right to vote free from undue influence or manipulation by limiting the number of voters that one person can assist in marking ballots to six,” Griffin said.
Griffin noted that this “commonsense approach to protecting our election process went unchallenged until 2020, when Arkansas United filed a lawsuit challenging the law shortly before midnight on the day before the general election.”
Arkansas United directed requests for comment to the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, whose attorneys are representing the nonprofit organization in the case. MALDEF did not return a request for comment by deadline.

It occurs when powerful politicians leave office and then later return to visit their old stomping grounds.
As regulars at the North Carolina General Assembly can attest, unless the politician in question has gone on to another position of prominence in which they wield significant influence, the response from the members currently serving is almost always the same: a moment of polite applause, a few handshakes and selfies and, well, that’s about it. By the time of their second visit, the once prominent pol is pretty much just another face in the crowd.
A similar process often impacts political leaders – most typically presidents and governors – who find themselves confronting term limits and the approach of lame duck status. Absent the possibility that they’ll stay in the game and remain a force with which to be reckoned after departing office, even powerful politicians can quickly find their influence leaking away like air from a deflating tire.
The expectation, since confirmed, that he would seek a U.S. Senate seat, combined with his steady overall popularity with voters, helped to insulate former North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper somewhat from this phenomenon, but for two-term presidents, genuine political relevance and influence as the end approaches – much less in the years that follow — is almost always elusive.
Bill Clinton was part of an unprecedented effort by a former president to evade this age-old pattern by returning to the White House as First Gentleman, but that was a unique situation unlikely to be repeated anytime soon.
And this reality – the hard truth that political power is fleeting and generally not hereditary in the American system — is something that seems sure to soon impact Donald Trump and the cult of personality to which he has given rise.
It’s true of course, that we are just a little over six months into a second Trump term that’s scheduled to run through 2029. It’s also true that the first six months have featured a whirlwind of activity – including scores of norm-shattering executive orders, hundreds of federal lawsuits (many of which Trump has won), and the enactment of one of the largest and most radical pieces of legislation in U.S. history.
Indeed, when it comes to dominating the political and lawmaking scenes, Trump is arguably at the pinnacle of his career and power. Among most Republicans, his word is currently law and few presidents in U.S. history have ever claimed and sought to act as if they had such complete power.
But it’s also true that there are several factors already at work that are causing noteworthy cracks to form in the Trump edifice – cracks that are likely to grow and spread (perhaps rapidly).
Topping the immediate list in this realm is the metastasizing controversy surrounding the Jeffrey Epstein files. Though Trump has long skillfully manipulated and exploited the controversy surrounding his former pal and his sex crimes, there is growing evidence that his magic in this area may be running out.
Having helped convince millions of his followers that there was a nefarious conspiracy at work surrounding Epstein, Trump’s sudden “there’s nothing to see here” explanation is falling flat with many on the right. And if any sort of smoking gun emerges confirming Trump participation in Epstein’s sexcapades, it would be a presidency-altering development.
But even if the Epstein crisis somehow fizzles, the list of other looming Trump troubles remains long and daunting.
There are his ebbing poll numbers. The latest Gallup Poll finds his approval rating at 37% (29% among independents) — the lowest point of second term.
There’s the widespread unpopularity of the so-called “big, beautiful bill.” While it’s true that many provisions are not scheduled to take effect right away, it’s hard to see how the impending reality of lost health insurance and food assistance for millions (or the plan to ignore the global climate crisis) can possibly boost Trump’s popularity.
There are the upcoming 2026 elections in which the chance that Democrats will win back control of the U.S. House and maybe even the Senate continues to grow steadily. Talk about a presidency-altering development!
And then, of course, there is Trump’s mental and physical health. With his 80th birthday fast approaching, a recent diagnosis of chronic venous insufficiency, obvious weight and memory challenges, and a well-known penchant for teenager’s diet, Trump’s chances for a relatively rapid decline would appear significantly less than zero.
Nothing is for certain, of course. Trump has confounded critics many times before and with six Supreme Court justices sitting ready to do his bidding, he remains formidable.
But given the challenges he faces, the lack of any plausible political heir apparent and the emptiness of the GOP bench right now, it’s easy to see how both Trump and the MAGA movement could be poised for a rapid political decline. And if that happens, experience shows that it won’t take long for both to quickly be seen and treated as yesterday’s news.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/trumptariffs-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-29 05:56:12.951765

The Mississippi State Department of Health, like other state health departments, is concerned about the potential loss of federal funding. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)Between 2016 and 2022, as congenital syphilis cases rose nationally and especially in the South, Mississippi saw a one thousand percent increase — from 10 to 110 — in the number of newborn babies who were hospitalized after contracting the disease, known to cause developmental issues, intellectual disabilities, and even death.
So in 2023, the state Department of Health mandated that all medical practitioners screen for the disease in pregnant mothers, and it has been running advertisements to spread awareness.
Annual congenital syphilis cases in Mississippi rose from 62 in 2021 to 132 in 2023, according to state data. The number fell to 114 last year. There have been 33 cases so far this year.
That work won’t stop despite potential budget cuts, Dr. Daniel Edney, Mississippi’s state health officer, said in an interview. “We’re going to keep doing what we have to do, you know, to keep it under control.”
State by state, public health departments take a similar approach: They monitor, treat and try to stem preventable diseases, alongside their host of other duties. But in the coming year, health department officials — with their agencies already strapped for cash — fear they’ll find it much more difficult to do their jobs.
President Donald Trump’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2026 would cut the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention budget by more than half, from $9.3 billion to $4.2 billion. The proposal serves as a wish list from the administration, a blueprint for the Republican-controlled Congress as it works through upcoming spending legislation.
If lawmakers hew to Trump’s vision, then state and county public health departments would be hit hard. States contribute to their own health departments, but a lot of them rely heavily on federal funding.
And around half of local public health department funding comes from federal sources, primarily the CDC, as noted in a 2022 report from the National Association of County & City Health Officials.
“The federal government provides a lot of funding, but the actual implementation of public health programs happens at the state and local level,” said Josh Michaud, associate director of global health policy at KFF, a health policy research group. “Each state has its own approach, in many ways, to how public health programs are overseen, how they’re funded, how they are implemented.”
In announcing his department’s share of the proposed budget, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said Trump’s goals align with “new priorities in reversing the chronic disease epidemic.”
But many local health leaders point to the longtime mission of state public health departments in preventing the spread of disease.
“Local public health is on the front lines preventing communicable disease, operating programs to prevent chronic disease, ensuring our septic and well water systems are safe,” said Dr. Kelly Kimple, acting director of North Carolina’s Division of Public Health within the Department of Health and Human Services.
“I’m very concerned,” Kimple said, “especially given the magnitude of funding that we’re talking about, as we can’t keep doing more with less.”
Clawing back COVID-era grants
Other federal budget cuts also have states worried.
Many state public health departments grew alarmed when the Trump administration announced in March that it would be clawing back $11.4 billion in COVID-era funding for grants that were slated to extend into 2026.
Twenty-three states and the District of Columbia sued. A federal district court in Rhode Island temporarily blocked the cuts, and the case remains tied up in court.
The court’s preliminary injunction may not protect temporary staff or contractors, though. Public health departments have been laying off staff, cutting lab capacity and reducing immunization clinics, said Dr. Susan Kansagra, chief medical officer for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.
Historically, public health departments receive funding in “boom and bust” cycles, meaning they tend to get more federal support during emergencies, said Michaud, of KFF. But “since the Great Recession of 2008, there was a general decline in public health support funding until the COVID pandemic.”
For example, KHN and The Associated Press reported that between 2010 and 2019, spending on state public health departments declined by 16% per capita and spending for local health departments fell by 18%.
Nationally, syphilis cases reached historic lows in the 2000s, thanks to robust prevention efforts and education from public health officials. By 2022, however, cases reached their highest numbers nationally since the 1950s.
“In the wake of the COVID emergency, you’ve seen a sort of backlash to what people had been calling the overreach of public health and imposing vaccination requirements and lockdowns and other public health measures,” Michaud told Stateline.
Smallpox, cholera and typhoid
Public health departments and officials go back to the 19th century, when there was a greater emphasis on sanitation efforts to prevent spread of diseases such as smallpox, cholera and typhoid, which were rampant at the time.
By the end of the century, 40 states had established health departments, which to this day are responsible for water sanitation, tracking the spread of disease, administering vaccinations, furnishing health education, providing screenings for infants and some prenatal care for moms at local clinics, offering family planning services, and tracking and treating sexually transmitted infections, among other things.
Kimple pointed to measles as a current example of a disease that’s spreading fast. When North Carolina’s health department detected a case in the state, she said, the department “identified and contacted everyone who might have been exposed, helped people get tested, worked with doctors to make sure they knew how to respond.”
That’s the legacy of local public health, Michaud said.
“The federal government cannot decide, ‘This public health program will happen in this state, but not that state,’ that kind of thing. And cannot declare a national lockdown. The COVID pandemic tested a lot of those boundaries. It really is a state and local responsibility to protect public health. And that’s always been the case, since the beginning of our country,” Michaud said.
“And what we’re seeing now is a complete upheaval of the funding going into public health.”
A major cut in services
Kimple said she’s seen recent progress in her state in the support for funding public health.
“North Carolinians viewed our work as highly important to improving health and well-being in the state, and appreciated the local presence, the reliable information, the role in prevention and efforts to protect, in particular, vulnerable communities,” she said.
Similarly, Edney said that Mississippi state lawmakers were showing more support, despite some setbacks in 2016 and 2017. New federal cuts could throw a wrench in the health department’s economic plans and its ability to reach small communities.
“Now the federal rug is being pulled out from under us,” he said.
Edney said he expects the federal share of his department’s public health funding to fall from its current 65% to around 50%.
Edney said he’s been trying to strengthen Mississippi health department’s longevity by diversifying its revenue streams by, for example, accepting private donations.
The state will not stop doing its “core” work, he said, regardless of federal funding.
“We’re not going to cut back on services at the county health department, because what we do now is all mission critical,” Edney said.

(Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)U.S. Rep. Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond, is pushing back against Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s recent claims that all 2,500 immigrants detained in statewide operations since March were violent offenders, saying Monday she doesn’t believe it — and won’t — until the administration provides proof.
‘They should be arrested’: Youngkin holds firm on support for ICE raids at Virginia courthouses

“Until you show me that all 2,500, all of their cases, what they were convicted of … you are innocent until proven guilty,” McClellan told The Mercury after meeting with courthouse staff, advocates and attorneys at the Chesterfield County Courthouse, where Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers have conducted ongoing raids. 
McClellan stopped short of directly accusing Youngkin of lying, but she made clear her doubts. 
“I would say officials in the Trump administration are not telling the truth in 100% of the cases,” she said. “I think the governor either is not doing his due diligence to ask the right questions and is just parroting what he has been told — at best.”
McClellan’s comments came as part of a broader rebuke of current immigration enforcement tactics in Virginia — including federal-only ICE operations like the courthouse raids and the parallel efforts of Youngkin’s Virginia Homeland Security Task Force. 
“I heard stories today about people who were detained when they came for their arraignment, so they haven’t been convicted and they haven’t had their trial,” she said. “I want details. And until the administration provides them, because … we know they have lied in certain instances, I won’t believe what the governor has to say.”
While the Chesterfield arrests are not part of the task force, McClellan linked them as symptoms of a state and federal immigration system that she said increasingly violates due process and fosters fear among communities of color.
Last week, the Richmond Democrat introduced legislation, H.R. 4703, that would require the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to track and publicly report every instance where U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents are detained or deported for immigration enforcement purposes. While the bill’s full text is not yet available, McClellan said its goal is to create transparency and prevent wrongful removals.
“We know that citizens and people lawfully present have been detained and deported, primarily because of the great reporting from the press,” she said. “But we don’t know how many, we don’t know all the circumstances, so this is part of my oversight responsibilities.”
On Monday, McClellan visited the Chesterfield courthouse at the invitation of Circuit Court Clerk Amanda Pohl, who said she was alarmed by what the courthouse staff has witnessed over the last month.
“We are not getting any of the names, we’re not getting anything like that,” Pohl said of the individuals detained inside the courthouse. “What we’re seeing at the General District Court is that people are coming in for traffic violations, for minor offenses. They’re trying to have their day in court, and ICE is taking them.”
Pohl said that at least 16 people were detained by ICE agents during a single week in June, and that federal activity at the courthouse has continued since then — though more sporadically. 
“We saw somebody come in, who had a charge. His case was continued. He had no other prior convictions, and he was still taken by ICE. He didn’t even get to have his day in court, and he was still taken from his family,” she said. “From what I understand, that gentleman was deported very quickly.”
A spokesman for ICE on Monday did not respond to a request for comment about the agency’s ongoing operations in Chesterfield.










Being an undocumented immigrant is not a crime,” she said. “And the dehumanization that this administration is doing — trying to paint with a broad brush every undocumented immigrant, and U.S. citizens, that they are hardened criminals — is wrong and is un-American.


– U.S. Rep. Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond


Youngkin has repeatedly stood by the arrests carried out by ICE and those under the Homeland Security Task Force — a state initiative created earlier this year to work in coordination with federal partners, including ICE — and has insisted that all detainees are dangerous criminals.
“They should be arrested,” the governor said earlier this month, defending the task force’s mission. “These are folks that are here illegally and they’ve committed crimes.”
But McClellan said the absence of supporting data makes such blanket characterizations irresponsible and dangerous.
“Nobody knows the details around it,” she said. “That is creating fear that we have seen among communities of color, particularly in the Spanish-speaking community or anybody who’s brown.”
Virginia Attorney General Miyares, who has championed the task force and joined Youngkin in calling for tougher immigration enforcement, last week declined to provide evidence backing up the administration’s “violent offender” claims when asked by The Mercury.
Miyares offers no proof that 2,500 immigrants arrested by Va. task force were violent offenders

McClellan said what’s happening in Chesterfield and across the state goes far beyond any single program — and is undermining trust in law enforcement and the courts. 
“We’re seeing people who aren’t showing up to get marriage licenses, who aren’t showing up to report crimes, to press charges, to testify, because they’re afraid, ‘Am I going to be disappeared even though I’ve done nothing wrong?’” she said. “It is not making our communities safe. It’s having the opposite effect.”
McClellan said she’s heard from translators who are now afraid to appear in court, and domestic violence advocates who say victims are staying silent out of fear. 
“It’s hard enough to get someone to step forward who has been domestically or sexually abused,” she said. “I’m hearing instances of all of that in the Richmond region, and it is concerning.”
McClellan also raised alarm over ICE agents reportedly wearing face coverings and refusing to identify themselves. 
“All law enforcement agents, including immigration agents, need to be able to show their face and their badge or their identification,” she said. “If you can’t see their face, you don’t have their identification, you can’t hold them accountable, and that person cannot enforce their own civil rights. And that is dangerous.”
While the Chesterfield raids are not tied to Youngkin’s task force, McClellan said the impact is the same — a culture of fear driven by racial profiling and mass enforcement, not public safety.
“There are people who have been in this country, in some cases for decades, who may have been lawfully present when they first got here, or who may be on a path to citizenship,” she said. “There are refugees from Afghanistan who worked with the U.S. government. There are many reasons why someone may lack documentation today. That doesn’t make them criminals.”
McClellan emphasized that immigration violations are civil offenses — not crimes — and said conflating them with criminal law is misleading. 
“Being an undocumented immigrant is not a crime,” she said. “And the dehumanization that this administration is doing — trying to paint with a broad brush every undocumented immigrant, and U.S. citizens, that they are hardened criminals — is wrong and is un-American.”
Recent analysis by Stateline adds further context to McClellan’s concerns: Fewer than half of the nearly 112,000 ICE arrests made nationwide between Jan. 20 and late June were of convicted criminals — just 40 % — far lower than the 53% rate during the same period under the Biden administration. 
The share of those arrested with violent crime convictions shrank from 10% to 7%, while arrests tied to drug convictions fell from 9% to 5%. 
At the same time, the number of detainees without any criminal record nearly tripled, rising from roughly 47% to 60% of ICE arrests, most commonly for minor traffic or immigration violations. McClellan’s demands for data and due process protections align with these national trends, as critics argue the enforcement push increasingly sweeps up individuals who lack serious criminal histories.
‘Hallowed ground, desecrated’: ICE sweeps at Chesterfield court draw fierce backlash

Pohl said she invited several local officials, nonprofit leaders and attorneys to Monday’s meeting, including Sheriff Karl Leonard, who runs the Chesterfield County jail. “Unfortunately, we didn’t get a response,” she said. “But I’m sure he has other obligations.”
Pohl also emphasized that her office does not coordinate with ICE or the Sheriff’s department and is not participating in enforcement. “Sheriff Leonard and I do not collaborate around this issue … but we have made it very clear: We’re not assisting ICE,” she said.
Leonard also did not respond to requests for comment Monday. 
For McClellan, the current moment echoes dark chapters of American history. 
“This is very reminiscent, to me, of the backlash to Reconstruction, when Confederate iconography was placed at courthouses in an effort to intimidate certain communities,” she said. “That intimidation is happening here too, to brown people. It is wrong. It is very reminiscent of what we saw in Nazi Germany.”
As Virginia’s first Black congresswoman and a longtime civil rights attorney, McClellan said her concerns are rooted in protecting the constitutional rights of all residents.
“I think there are ways that we can invest in processing immigration cases in a much better way,” she said. “But I think the way not to do it is to dehumanize people. And what the Trump administration is doing is dehumanizing the immigrant community, whether they are citizens or not, including children. And that is wrong.”

The proposal serves as a wish list from the administration, a blueprint for the Republican-controlled Congress as it works through upcoming spending legislation.","Medical workers with Delta Health Center prepare to vaccinate people at a pop-up COVID-19 vaccination clinic in a rural Delta community on April 29, 2021 in Leland, Mississippi. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)Between 2016 and 2022, as congenital syphilis cases rose nationally and especially in the South, Mississippi saw a one thousand percent increase — from 10 to 110 — in the number of newborn babies who were hospitalized after contracting the disease, known to cause developmental issues, intellectual disabilities, and even death.
So in 2023, the state Department of Health mandated that all medical practitioners screen for the disease in pregnant mothers, and it has been running advertisements to spread awareness.
Annual congenital syphilis cases in Mississippi rose from 62 in 2021 to 132 in 2023, according to state data. The number fell to 114 last year. There have been 33 cases so far this year.
That work won’t stop despite potential budget cuts, Dr. Daniel Edney, Mississippi’s state health officer, said in an interview. “We’re going to keep doing what we have to do, you know, to keep it under control.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
State by state, public health departments take a similar approach: They monitor, treat and try to stem preventable diseases, alongside their host of other duties. But in the coming year, health department officials — with their agencies already strapped for cash — fear they’ll find it much more difficult to do their jobs.
President Donald Trump’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2026 would cut the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention budget by more than half, from $9.3 billion to $4.2 billion. The proposal serves as a wish list from the administration, a blueprint for the Republican-controlled Congress as it works through upcoming spending legislation.
If lawmakers hew to Trump’s vision, then state and county public health departments would be hit hard. States contribute to their own health departments, but a lot of them rely heavily on federal funding.
And around half of local public health department funding comes from federal sources, primarily the CDC, as noted in a 2022 report from the National Association of County & City Health Officials.
Medicaid cuts are likely to worsen mental health care in rural America

“The federal government provides a lot of funding, but the actual implementation of public health programs happens at the state and local level,” said Josh Michaud, associate director of global health policy at KFF, a health policy research group. “Each state has its own approach, in many ways, to how public health programs are overseen, how they’re funded, how they are implemented.”
In announcing his department’s share of the proposed budget, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said Trump’s goals align with “new priorities in reversing the chronic disease epidemic.”
But many local health leaders point to the longtime mission of state public health departments in preventing the spread of disease.
“Local public health is on the front lines preventing communicable disease, operating programs to prevent chronic disease, ensuring our septic and well water systems are safe,” said Dr. Kelly Kimple, acting director of North Carolina’s Division of Public Health within the Department of Health and Human Services.
“I’m very concerned,” Kimple said, “especially given the magnitude of funding that we’re talking about, as we can’t keep doing more with less.”
Clawing back COVID-era grants
Other federal budget cuts also have states worried.
Many state public health departments grew alarmed when the Trump administration announced in March that it would be clawing back $11.4 billion in COVID-era funding for grants that were slated to extend into 2026.
Twenty-three states and the District of Columbia sued. A federal district court in Rhode Island temporarily blocked the cuts, and the case remains tied up in court.
The court’s preliminary injunction may not protect temporary staff or contractors, though. Public health departments have been laying off staff, cutting lab capacity and reducing immunization clinics, said Dr. Susan Kansagra, chief medical officer for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.
No one knows whether Trump’s $50B for rural health will be enough

Historically, public health departments receive funding in “boom and bust” cycles, meaning they tend to get more federal support during emergencies, said Michaud, of KFF. But “since the Great Recession of 2008, there was a general decline in public health support funding until the COVID pandemic.”
For example, KHN and The Associated Press reported that between 2010 and 2019, spending on state public health departments declined by 16% per capita and spending for local health departments fell by 18%.
Nationally, syphilis cases reached historic lows in the 2000s, thanks to robust prevention efforts and education from public health officials. By 2022, however, cases reached their highest numbers nationally since the 1950s.
“In the wake of the COVID emergency, you’ve seen a sort of backlash to what people had been calling the overreach of public health and imposing vaccination requirements and lockdowns and other public health measures,” Michaud told Stateline.
Smallpox, cholera and typhoid
Public health departments and officials go back to the 19th century, when there was a greater emphasis on sanitation efforts to prevent spread of diseases such as smallpox, cholera and typhoid, which were rampant at the time.
By the end of the century, 40 states had established health departments, which to this day are responsible for water sanitation, tracking the spread of disease, administering vaccinations, furnishing health education, providing screenings for infants and some prenatal care for moms at local clinics, offering family planning services, and tracking and treating sexually transmitted infections, among other things.










What we're seeing now is a complete upheaval of the funding going into public health.


– Josh Michaud, associate director of global health policy at KFF


Kimple pointed to measles as a current example of a disease that’s spreading fast. When North Carolina’s health department detected a case in the state, she said, the department “identified and contacted everyone who might have been exposed, helped people get tested, worked with doctors to make sure they knew how to respond.”
That’s the legacy of local public health, Michaud said.
“The federal government cannot decide, ‘This public health program will happen in this state, but not that state,’ that kind of thing. And cannot declare a national lockdown. The COVID pandemic tested a lot of those boundaries. It really is a state and local responsibility to protect public health. And that’s always been the case, since the beginning of our country,” Michaud said.
“And what we’re seeing now is a complete upheaval of the funding going into public health.”
A major cut in services
Kimple said she’s seen recent progress in her state in the support for funding public health.
“North Carolinians viewed our work as highly important to improving health and well-being in the state, and appreciated the local presence, the reliable information, the role in prevention and efforts to protect, in particular, vulnerable communities,” she said.

Several states have passed new laws regulating these machines, which officials say are increasingly being used to scam consumers. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)They may resemble other ATMs, but officials are increasingly warning about the potential for fraud with the expanding fleet of cryptocurrency ATMs popping up across the country.
The National Consumers League says the largely unregulated machines have become favored by scammers for their anonymity and irreversibility — once a user transfers or deposits funds, that money is essentially gone.

 Three bills related to cryptocurrency failed in Virginia’s legislative session this year. SB 1170 would have required candidates to disclose digital assets to the the Virginia Conflict of Interest and Ethics Advisory Council. HB 2428 would have amended state code to add computer equipment and peripherals used in a data center, including systems used to engage in digital asset mining business activities, to the list of tangible personal property for taxation. HB 1796 would have created the Virginia Decentralized Autonomous Organization Act to govern the legal framework for blockchain-based business structures.  

While officials say the machines can be used for legitimate purposes, red and blue states are increasingly imposing new regulations to protect consumers: AARP says 11 states have recently passed new laws or regulations of the machines.
“In state after state, AARP found lawmakers on both sides of the aisle and local law enforcement eager to work on commonsense rules that balance innovation and consumer safety,” Nancy LeaMond, AARP’s executive vice president and chief advocacy and engagement officer, said in a news release.
Last year, the FBI reported nearly 11,000 complaints of cryptocurrency ATM fraud. Those cases disproportionately affected older Americans and cost victims $246.7 million.
Cryptocurrencies are digital assets, including bitcoin, that offer an alternative payment or method without control of a central bank or government like other currencies. Crypto ATMs, sometimes called crypto kiosks, allow users to insert cash or use debit cards to convert currencies such as U.S. dollars into cryptocurrencies.
The Federal Trade Commission says crypto ATM scams often start with a call or text message warning of a supposed problem, such as unauthorized bank charges or suspicious activity on an Amazon account.
The FTC says consumers should contact banks or other institutions directly about any account issues. And it warns consumers not to believe anyone who says they must use a crypto ATM to address a financial problem.
“Real businesses and government agencies will never do that — anyone who does is a scammer,” the agency said.
After signing a bill with new regulations, Nebraska Republican Gov. Jim Pillen was clear that the state would continue to welcome cryptocurrency businesses as it aims to become a hub for the industry.
The Nebraska law requires ATM operators to acquire state licensure, warn customers of the potential for criminal exploitation and take “reasonable steps to detect and prevent fraud.” The law also limits transactions to $2,000 per day for new customers and $10,500 for existing customers, and requires operators to issue refunds for properly reported fraudulent transactions.
At least 40 states have introduced legislation regarding cryptocurrency, digital or virtual currencies and other digital assets in the 2025 legislative session, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Those measures include ATM regulations, prohibiting the use of digital currencies by governments and allowing state investment in digital assets.
Federal lawmakers are also taking action on the issue. The Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives declared the week of July 14 “Crypto Week,” when lawmakers considered several pieces of legislation.
At the end of that week, President Donald Trump signed into law the GENIUS Act, the first major law governing digital currency. It establishes a regulatory framework for the industry.
Trump hopes the bill will instill confidence in the industry that spent heavily to strengthen its legitimacy and political might, The Associated Press reported.
“This signing is a massive validation of your hard work and your pioneering spirit,” the president told crypto executives.
In state legislatures, new bills regulating crypto ATMS have enjoyed bipartisan support. AARP tracking shows new bills have been approved in Arkansas, Iowa and Oklahoma, as well as in more liberal states such as Maryland and Vermont.
In May, Arizona Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs signed Republican-sponsored legislation that sets daily transaction limits and mandates crypto ATM operators provide customers certain disclosures and warnings.
The legislation followed local news coverage of at least two dozen crypto scams, including one that cost an Arizonan $28,000.

(Photo by Evan Houk/ Maine Morning Star)Pennsylvania is in a race against time: can we bring enough new energy onto the grid to meet our region’s growing power demand (primarily fueled by new data centers, both speculative and real) in time to avoid dramatic spikes in the cost of energy paralleling the destabilization of our energy grid?
While solar power has emerged as the cheapest new electricity source in history, thousands of new energy projects are trapped, waiting for approval to come online as part of grid manager PJM’s bottlenecked interconnection process. This costly administrative limbo can delay construction for over five years or even cause developers to abandon projects entirely after significant investment.
This delay in bringing new energy online is already making it more expensive for Pennsylvanians to keep the lights on, and it could get much worse: a new report by Evergreen Collaborative and Synapse Economics finds that “Mismanagement by PJM is set to spike electric bills by almost 60 percent over the next 10 to 15 years.” Unless something changes, the results for Pennsylvania families and businesses will be catastrophic. And while PJM has initiated limited reforms, their full impacts remain unclear.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The problem is immense, but there’s also a clear workaround: Local energy generation like community solar can bypass this bottleneck while democratizing our energy transition and providing concrete benefits to Pennsylvanians.
Community solar lets ratepayers subscribe to a local solar array and receive guaranteed energy bill savings. It’s a shovel-ready, distributed approach to bringing new energy online. If you haven’t heard of community solar, don’t feel bad: it’s probably because Pennsylvania is one of a rapidly dwindling number of states that has yet to authorize it.
Community solar projects are generally much larger than a residential solar array, but small enough to connect to the local energy distribution system, letting them sidestep the PJM interconnection queue that so often traps large-scale projects. By bringing more energy online quickly, community solar can ease the intensity of our energy crisis.
Community solar projects also deliver immediate benefits to local communities:


They allow renters, apartment dwellers, and homeowners with unsuitable roofs to access affordable, locally generated energy


They create jobs and tax revenue in local communities


They strengthen grid resilience by bringing energy generation closer to home


They provide savings on electricity bills, especially critical for low-income families struggling with rising rates


Neighboring states like New Jersey, Maryland, Delaware and New York have already opened the door to community solar, but Pennsylvania has failed to act.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
This could change very soon: a bill to authorize Community Energy (which includes community solar) recently passed through the PA House, and is now awaiting action in the Senate. This legislation would guarantee that everyone who subscribes to community solar would see savings on their energy bills, while expanding renewable energy access to communities that have historically been excluded (such as renters and low-income communities). It is supported by diverse stakeholders ranging from The Pennsylvania Land and Liberty Coalition to Our Solar PA, a statewide coalition of dozens of groups working for a community-centric renewable energy future.
We can’t afford to wait for the problems with our regional energy system to solve themselves, or for PJM to reform in response to pressure from the Governor’s office, State Public Utility Commissions, and ratepayers advocates.
Community solar gives us a way to make progress now. It puts regular people—not just utilities and large corporations—at the center of our energy transition. This isn’t just a way to sidestep the interconnection backlog—it’s an inclusive approach to building our energy future together.It’s past time to authorize community energy projects across the state, and to clear the path for energy solutions that work for our communities.

The subject? Democrats.
After disappointing results in November, Kansas state House Democrats are touring the Republican-leaning state, trying to improve relationships and set the stage for a comeback. Pittsburg, a college town of 20,500 in the southeastern corner of the state, elected a Democratic state representative as recently as 2018 before choosing a Republican in the past three elections.
“Your guys’s messaging sucks,” local resident Justin Mcelwain told a panel of state Democratic lawmakers during the Q&A portion of the town hall-style event last Thursday, adding that when it comes to getting their points across, Democrats “are not even in the same sphere as the right wing.”
Earlier, Mcelwain had raised his hand along with a handful of others to indicate he had never before attended a political event.
During a brief interview, he described his political views as “so far to the left that guns are cool again.” What Democrats need to do, he said, is repeatedly emphasize the effects of President Donald Trump’s and Republicans’ policies.
“They need to drive it home and hold on to that forever — that your life, over the next five, 10 years or whatever, all the decline in your quality of life is a direct result of the Republican Party,” Mcelwain said.
Some state-level Democrats believe Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act provides a perfect opening.
States scramble to shield hospitals from GOP Medicaid cuts

Trump signed the massive tax cuts and spending legislation into law on Independence Day. The sweeping measure cuts more than $1 trillion from Medicaid, the safety net insurance program funded jointly by the federal government and states. It slashes spending on food assistance and green energy programs and cuts taxes in a way that overwhelmingly benefits the wealthiest earners.
In Kansas and a majority of states, Republicans dominate the legislature, with many increasingly tying themselves to the Make America Great Again movement. As Democrats search for a path back to power, both at the federal and state levels, they are seizing on Trump’s signature legislation six months into his second term as a major rallying cry.
“Let’s not even get started about the one big beautiful awful bill,” Kansas state House Minority Leader Brandon Woodard told the Pittsburg crowd.
A few audience members groaned in agreement.
Trump’s sweeping law is an opportunity, Kansas Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly, who chairs the Democratic Governors Association, said in an interview with Stateline. Portions of it “are so obviously cruel and detrimental to so many people,” she said. Reductions to Medicaid and food assistance, for example, will cut across party lines.










They need to drive it home and hold on to that forever — that … all the decline in your quality of life is a direct result of the Republican Party.

Kelly said Republicans already appear worried about the political consequences: She pointed to efforts by U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, to repeal some of the federal cuts to the safety net health program.
“I do think that they’re very concerned, as they should be,” Kelly said. “And I hope that the public stays engaged, stays informed, continues to protest as they have been, and that those of us in positions to educate and inform take that role very seriously.”
‘Not a bumper sticker bill’
The law’s enactment comes as Democrats have been searching for a compelling message. They’re trying to connect with disaffected voters after Trump and Republicans attacked the party last year as elitist and out of touch, and they’re highlighting Trump’s actions since his inauguration.
But amid a daily barrage of Trump developments, the party has been pulled in a multitude of directions — spotlighting everything from violent immigration raids to Trump’s connections to convicted child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
Earlier this month, the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, which works to elect Democrats at the state level, launched ads in several states with upcoming competitive legislative races slamming Republicans “for selling us out” with Trump’s tax and spending law.
The group is focusing heavily on New Jersey and Virginia, the two states with legislative and gubernatorial races in the fall. In 2026, it will target swing states including Michigan and Wisconsin, but also divided states, such as Kansas, North Carolina and Pennsylvania, that have Democratic governors but Republican control of one or both legislative chambers.
GOP cuts to food assistance would hit rural America especially hard

Nevada House Speaker Steve Yeager, a board member of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, said Republicans have failed to live up to the rhetoric of the 2024 race that focused largely on lowering costs, presenting a “big opportunity” for his party.
In his state, Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo is expected to face one of the nation’s most competitive gubernatorial races next year.
Yeager said Nevada Democrats will tell voters about the “complicity” of Republicans at the state level — and share a positive vision of Democratic priorities.
“I think Democrats in Nevada and nationwide are a little more clear-eyed in terms of what our objective is and should be, and that’s just to help people with the day-to-day issues that they face,” he said.
State Democrats may also look to a GOP strategy from 15 years ago.
Chris Cooper, a professor of political science and public affairs at Western Carolina University, wondered whether Democrats would employ Trump’s “big, beautiful” law against Republicans the way the GOP used President Barack Obama’s signature health care law against his allies.
“Is this going to become the Republican version of Obamacare?” Cooper asked. Despite proving popular over time, the passage of the Affordable Care Act was initially a political albatross for Democrats, who lost hundreds of seats in statehouses in 2010, Cooper said.
But at hundreds of pages long, Trump’s federal legislation will require lots of education for voters to fully appreciate the implications to taxes, social services and immigration. And many of the deepest cuts won’t be felt for months or years, with Republicans setting up the cuts to go into effect after the midterm elections.
“It’s not a bumper sticker bill,” Cooper said.
“The Democratic strategy can’t just be, ‘Remember what happened,’” he said. “First they have to teach people what happened, and then they have to work to assign blame, and then they have to work to mobilize that blame to their benefit.”

In Pennsylvania, officials expect more than 300,000 residents to lose health coverage through Medicaid cuts and over 140,000 to lose food assistance. Pennsylvania Democratic state Sen. Vincent Hughes said Republicans will be held accountable for that devastation in next year’s state races.
“The very loud silence coming from Republican elected officials, MAGA elected officials, Trump-loving elected officials all across the country, that will be spoken about, that will be talked about, because their silence screamed volumes,” Hughes said. “They chose to look the other way, knowing the kind of damage this would do.”
For their part, national Republicans have sought to frame the law as a major win because of its deep tax cuts and huge influx of spending on immigration enforcement. At the state level, the messaging has so far been more mixed. In May, 20 of the nation’s 27 GOP governors signed a letter in support of the bill.
The Republican Legislative Campaign Committee, the party’s state committee, did not respond to Stateline’s requests for comment.
Michigan state Sen. Aric Nesbitt, former chair of the committee, said that Democrats “will feel the consequences next year” of opposing Trump’s bill. The minority leader of Michigan’s state Senate, Nesbitt is running to be the GOP’s nominee for governor.
“Democrats walked the political plank by voting for a $2,000 tax increase on working families, for allowing illegal immigrants to continue collecting Medicaid, against eliminating taxes on tips, overtime & Social security benefits, for [former President Joe] Biden’s war on American energy & against enforcing our immigration laws,” he wrote in a statement to Stateline.
Democrats ‘fight back’
This summer, Kansas House Democrats have embarked on a “Fight Back” tour across the state, visiting communities where the party has struggled in recent years.
“We’re going to places that unless there’s someone representing them as a Democrat, we’re being defined by cable news as to what a Democrat is,” Woodard, the Kansas House minority leader, told Stateline.

In Pittsburg, some Democrats said they are unsure whether the federal tax and spending law will help shake loose Republicans’ grip locally.
Janice Arthur, a lifelong Democrat who retired after working in the customer service industry, refused to say Trump’s name as she spoke about the legislation, declaring there’s “nothing about the current occupant of the White House that I agree with or I appreciate.”
When asked whether the law would cause her Republican friends and neighbors to vote for Democrats, she voiced uncertainty. “I don’t know,” she said.
Pittsburg was historically a Democratic stronghold in Republican-leaning Kansas. The party lost substantial ground locally over the past two decades, until the last Democratic state representative failed to win reelection in 2020. Last year, the city’s Democratic candidate for the state House received just 40% of the vote.
But these are the kinds of races Kansas Democrats will have to win if they want to break the Republican supermajority in the state legislature and, one day, take control of a chamber — something that hasn’t happened since the 1990s. Democrats need to flip five seats in 2026 to end the Republicans’ veto-proof majority in the House.
Emily Walters, who chairs the Crawford County Democratic Party, which includes Pittsburg, said many voters locally cast ballots for the first time last year, enthusiastic about what she called “the image” they have of Trump. They voted Republican down the ballot, she said.
“My suspicion is … they are being quickly disillusioned by the reality of Donald Trump,” Walters said. “And without that artificial buoyancy, I think that Crawford County has a very good shot of reverting to its blue self.”

(Photo courtesy U.S. Department of Energy.)Last week’s energy auction by multistate power grid operator PJM will cause monthly electric bills to go up $2 to $5 next summer — but that’s on top of other costs, for transmission, fuel and more, that one advocate calls “death by a thousand cuts.”
It’s also the latest evidence, say ratepayer advocates and policymakers, that policies of PJM, the grid operator in a 13-state region that includes Kentucky, are out of whack.
The latest of the “thousand cuts” is mostly the result of energy-guzzling data centers, David Lapp, the Maryland People’s Counsel, who is charged with representing state ratepayers in that state. Predictions for their proliferation are largely behind inflated projections of energy demand in PJM states, pushing demand past supply in the auction process, sending the price skyward.
And ultimately, consumers pay the price.
“It’s fundamentally unfair,” Lapp said. “Why should residential customers be responsible for costs being driven by some of the biggest and wealthiest corporations in the world?”
At the same time, consumer advocates say PJM policies have restricted supply, with a backlogged queue for energy projects, many of them renewable energy proposals.
“Until there’s actual queue reform, there’s not going to be real relief,” said Emily Scarr, a senior adviser for Maryland PIRG, or Public Interest Research Group.
All eyes were on this year’s auction because last year’s was a blockbuster: The clearing price jumped 800% compared to the 2023 auction, setting a record for the most expensive such auction in PJM history.
This year’s auction surpassed that record, but it was offset by policies that consumer advocates — and some governors — pushed PJM to adopt.
Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro (D) was behind a new cap on the auction’s clearing price. The auction hit the cap, saving consumers about $2.9 billion in total costs on their bills.
As various parts of energy bills increase, grid decision-makers don’t seem to be asking a key question, says Laurel Peltier, a low-income ratepayer advocate for the AARP: “Can people afford this?”
During a news conference Tuesday, Stu Bresler, a PJM executive vice president of market services and strategy, said that auction costs are a “small part of retail bills, and it also varies” how auction costs translate into rate changes for consumers.
But Peltier said that ignores key context.
“That’s like being in a bakery, and you know that the flour got more expensive, the butter got more expensive, the labor got more expensive, and you’re the egg maker, and your eggs are 800% more, and you’re like, ‘It’s OK. It’s just a little part,’” Peltier said.
Changes inside PJM?
In a July 16 letter to PJM, a bipartisan group of nine governors in PJM’s 13-state territory — including Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear — said the moment presents an opportunity for change.
With the “abrupt termination of two long-standing members of the Board of Managers and the imminent departure of the CEO,” their replacements must “understand the concerns of ratepayers facing rising costs,” and create “a more collaborative and more effective ethos” at PJM, the governors wrote.
“In the past, other regions looked to join PJM due to its many strengths; today, across the region, discussions of leaving PJM are becoming increasingly common,” read their letter.
In a July 18 response, PJM Board of Managers Chairman David Mills pushed back.
“Our operators are keeping the lights on through some of the most challenging circumstances that any grid operator, anywhere, has faced in its history,” he wrote. “We also continue the necessary function of operating regional markets as well as planning for a grid that is seeing an explosion of demand growth at the same time that state and federal policies have pushed a meaningful amount of generation capacity into retirement.”
He listed a number of changes PJM has made to its auction “to address concerns raised by our states,” including the “temporary” cap.
In a statement announcing the auction results Tuesday, PJM wrote that it “continues to focus on enhancing its process for connecting new generation resources onto the system, which includes clearing all the projects in its transition queue over the next 18 months, opening its new cycle process in spring 2026, and leveraging artificial intelligence through our partnership with Google to reduce processing time.”
Regime change may help, but some advocates warn that more transformative change may be necessary to lower prices. That includes changing how the organization is governed, Lapp said.
“We and the 13 other state consumer advocate offices in PJM — we get one vote. There are transmission-owning utilities that have more votes than us together,” Lapp said. “It’s the transmission owners that wield the most influence at PJM.”
Those same companies generally lose out when more power generation comes online, Scarr said.
“The legacy power plants lose out when that happens — but they’re the ones managing the ship,” Scarr said.
A spokesman for PJM pointed to a fact sheet describing the grid operator’s governance structure, which highlights that PJM’s 10-member Board of Managers must not be financially tied to any PJM member. But on the member’s committee, which includes about 1,000 members, votes are divided between five industry sectors. State consumer advocates are the other voting members.
Data center projections
When he hears projection for data center demand Lapp said he worries they are overblown because technology could be advancing to increase power efficiency at the facilities, which are full of computer servers that require immense amounts of energy to run and to keep from overheating.
That’s a major reason why data centers themselves should be footing the bill for their own power demand, and the upgrades to the power system they may require, Lapp said.
“If the data centers aren’t responsible for paying for all the costs that they are driving, they have much less incentive to find more computer chips, to operate more efficiently, to reduce their own costs,” he said.
It’s PJM’s job to change the paradigm, wherein ratepayers pay for enhancing the electric system, he said.
“It’s an unprecedented period of time in the industry, when you have city-sized demand being built up in just a few years,” Lapp said. “You can’t treat that the same as load growth gradually occurring over time.”

Last year’s auction to ensure the grid operator serving Ohio could meet demand saw capacity prices shoot up more than 830%. In the most recent auction, prices rose even higher.
When the 830% increase came down last year after an auction held by electric grid operator PJM Interconnection, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro sued.
As part of the settlement, PJM agreed to cap the price for the auction that concluded last week. Regardless, the capacity auction price rose even higher, hitting the cap laid out ahead of time by regulators.
Power producers will get paid $329.17 per megawatt/day. That’s up from roughly $270 per megawatt/day in the previous auction.
“These prices are reflecting the fact that the resource adequacy crisis is real in PJM,” Jon Gordon, director of Advanced Energy United explained.

At bottom, the auction is meant to match supply and demand. Higher auction prices serve as a price signal to encourage more power generation, but PJM has a massive backlog of power plants waiting to connect to the grid. That interconnection queue has been closed to new projects since 2022.
“It’s pretty hard to bring new generation resources online when the process for doing so is closed for new generation,” Gordon explained.
Energy bills likely to tick up again in 2026 after electricity auction clears at maximum price

Last year’s auction price only began showing up on consumers’ energy bills this June. The latest auction prices take effect next year. That means Ohioans, and most energy consumers across PJM’s 13-state footprint, aren’t likely to see energy prices come down anytime soon.
Johns Hopkins University Research Scholar Abe Silverman explained, “We have less generation on the grid today than we need given all the load growth, and so whether the price impacts are affecting you today or tomorrow, they’re definitely coming, because we are just sort of entering this very, very tight market.”
PJM itself says the new capacity auction prices could push some consumers’ bills another 1.5% to 5% higher when they take effect next year. Although it also claims “it is possible that consumers in some areas could see a drop in retail rates.”
How does the capacity auction work? Or not work?
To make sure PJM has adequate power when demand peaks, it holds a regular auction where producers commit a given amount of power. PJM compares it to a mall parking lot — they’re doing the energy equivalent of making sure there’s enough space come Black Friday.
With the most recent auction landing at $329 per megawatt/day, a hypothetical 1-megawatt power plant would get a little more than $120,000 ($329 x 365 days). If the plant can’t meet its commitment, PJM imposes fines.
Importantly, the capacity pricing isn’t for the energy itself, it’s a kind of insurance policy to make sure the grid has plenty of power. Silverman said capacity costs make up about 20% of a typical consumer’s bill, and the overall price tag for the latest auction will come out to about $16 billion.
Like Gordon, Silverman said rising capacity prices are a product of delays in getting new plants up and running.
“It’s like the interconnection queue is the class of graduating seniors from college who are going to take the jobs as you know, some of us start to retire,” he explained.
For several years that wasn’t a problem as demand stayed flat.
“Then all of a sudden, the data center load growth started kicking in, and we found ourselves desperately needing that next generation of resources,” he said.
Ohioans’ electric bills could climb depending on regional grid auction

PJM acknowledged “electricity demand is growing rapidly,” and noted its forecast for the auction year put peak demand 5,400 megawatts higher, “driven largely by data center expansion, electrification and economic growth.”
Spokesman Jeff Shields added there are roughly 63,000 megawatts of additional power PJM expects to study and approve over the next year and a half.
At the same time, Shield contends a significant challenge in meeting demand falls outside PJM’s control.
Currently there are 46,000 megawatts-worth of PJM approved projects — the majority of them solar and wind — stymied by the nuts-and-bolts challenges of actually building power plants.
Many of those projects are waiting on permitting and siting decisions from federal, state or local governments.
Additionally, tariffs are raising the prices of raw materials, and surging demand has created bottlenecks for essential equipment like turbines.
What do we do?
To power companies, the next steps are obvious: build, build, build. For instance, Todd Snitchler, president and CEO for the Electric Power Supply Association has claimed in recent years that state and federal policy favoring renewable energy — or “political interference” — “led to the premature retirement of essential generation.”
“When allowed to function, competitive electricity markets are the most effective way to deliver affordable, reliable power,” he said. “But a reliable grid isn’t free. Resources must be fairly compensated to stay available when they’re needed most.”
Much of the power waiting to come online comes from renewable sources like wind and solar. Skeptics worry about shifting the balance toward sources that rely on inconsistent environmental factors.
Earlier this year, PJM got approval for a fast-track process, effectively allowing some gas, battery, and nuclear projects to jump to the front of the line.
Evergreen Action Deputy State Policy Director Julia Kortney said leaving clean energy in limbo is costing consumers.
“PJM has failed to incorporate clean energy into the grid while its fossil fuel, utility, and transmission members are making record profits off the lack of competition and customers pay more for less,” she said.
The Natural Resources Defense Council has said part of the explanation for rising capacity costs is PJM better accounting for the unreliability of gas-fired plants.
Defense council Senior Advocate for Climate and Energy Tom Rutigliano nodded to the state siting and permitting hurdles PJM referenced that are keeping previously approved projects sidelined.
“Bringing just a fraction of these projects into service will ensure more affordable and reliable electricity,” he said.
While much of the marketplace is focused on increasing supply, Environmental Law & Policy Center Managing Attorney Rob Kelter said states need to work harder on reducing demand.
“These results underscore the urgent need for Ohio to invest in energy efficiency and demand response — proven, cost-effective tools that can quickly reduce demand, ease pressure on the grid, and lower costs for all utility customers across the state,” he said.
Demand response programs allow large consumers to cut deals with power companies agreeing to power down if demand peaks in return for a lower energy bill.
“With these continued price increases,” Kelter added, “the (Public Utility Commission of Ohio) has to do more to help Ohioans use less.”

The Department of Public Safety houses emergency management, which leads the immediate response. Consumer Services flags price gouging scams. Agriculture officials survey damage to farms and crops, and Environmental Quality helps guide cleanup of debris and waterways.
A newly drafted bill puts forward a new system: an all-in-one disaster response agency, governed by bipartisan appointees.
That agency, outlined under a new version of House Bill 907 released Monday, would be called the North Carolina Commission for Preparedness and Recovery. Its exact proposed duties, and structure, could change as discussions about the bill continue.
  Rep. John Bell (R-Wayne) (Photo: NCGA video)
“This is a piece of legislation that will be worked on for many months to come,” said Rep. John Bell (R-Wayne).
As currently written, the commission would wide-ranging powers: coordinating disaster readiness, spearheading recovery and rebuilding, and handling the hundreds of millions of dollars in state and federal funds that flow into the state. In all, it would oversee homebuilding, flood resiliency and mitigation, landslide and floodplain mapping, flood insurance and more.
The commission would be governed by a group of 13 board members: seven appointed by the governor, and six total appointed by legislative leaders. The board would appoint an executive director, who could hire additional staff as needed.
Lawmakers’ proposed overhaul comes as North Carolina continues to rebuild from Hurricane Helene, the deadliest storm in state history — as well as finish building in the east years after Hurricanes Florence and Matthew.
And the plan could impact (and be impacted by) potential changes coming down from Washington, where President Trump has considered abolishing FEMA and handing responsibility for disaster response to the states.
Among the commission’s proposed first steps: adopting a “strategic plan” that addresses how the state will handle all stages of disaster response.
The bill would also create a new fund, overseen by State Treasurer Brad Briner’s office, for buyouts, gap funding, loans and grants and other disaster-related projects.
“It’s a way to look at and get input and work together,” Bell said of the bill, “as not just a House and Senate, but with the governor.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Chantal-flooding-SouthernPines-NCDOT.jpg,,,2025-07-29 05:56:12.951765

Jill Nolin/Georgia RecorderYou expect to see politicians working hard to earn donations, but some Republicans in Georgia are scrambling to give them back.

A growing list of politicians and groups who received money from the conservative lending firm First Liberty Building & Loan and its founder, Brant Frost IV, are sending donations back after Frost was implicated in a purported $140 million Ponzi scheme that feds say started around 2021 and scammed 300 investors.
A U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission complaint says Frost donated more than $570,000 of those investor funds to right-wing candidates and groups across multiple states, though the full number could end up being higher, according to the Georgia Secretary of State’s office.
First Liberty targeted right-wing and Christian groups, and its now-defunct website touted efforts to fund food pantries, a crisis intervention program for middle school boys and other good works.
“At First Liberty Building & Loan, we believe that charitable giving is a fundamental part of our responsibility as authentic followers of Christ,” Frost said on First Liberty’s website. “By choosing us for your financial needs, you can rest assured that we prioritize giving back to our community. We support charities and organizations that align with our values, and we are committed to making a positive impact in the lives of those less fortunate among us.”
Instead, the SEC complaint alleges that Frost transferred more than $5 million of investor funds to himself and his family. The complaint alleges Frost took in investor money for short-term loans for worthy small businesses, but instead spent it on luxury items including a Maine vacation home, jewelry and a $20,000 watch.
“We call these affinity frauds, where you base it on a certain group, and this is very religious Christians and Republicans,” said Gregory Hays of Atlanta-based Hays Financial Consulting, who was appointed by a U.S. district court judge to receive the money from those returning the funds. “So most of all the victims are either in politics or very faith-based investors, and all of them that I talked to were influenced by the charitable giving and the feel-good side of the company.”
Frost allegedly painted a rosy picture of the loans’ performance to investors, but in reality the majority of the loans that were made went into default, and Frost was using money from new investors to make interest payments to previous investors.
Now, the investors are left holding the bag.
“It’s just devastating to them,” Hays said. “There’s a lot of retirement money. I talked to one gentleman this morning that put $300,000 in, and he said it was all his retirement money, the $300,000. So it’s having some devastating impact on a lot of people.”
  Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, whose office is investigating First Liberty alongside the SEC, issued an earlier statement calling on recipients to return political contributions from the company or from members of the Frost family. Raffensperger told media outlets he personally returned about $8,400 after learning of the allegations.
As of Wednesday, Hays said recipients had returned about $60,000. By Monday afternoon, that number had increased to $130,000. The response has been intense enough for Hays to set up an automated response to emails warning that he may be slow to write back due to the heavy work load as he fields calls and emails from the investors and hundreds of politicians.
“There was a big hurry right after the secretary of state asked for all Georgia Republicans to return the money, and so we had calls from a lot of different politicians wanting to return the money, and that was before we even found a report of some of the donations,” he said. “We haven’t sent out demands to recover money yet from the politicians, it’s just people are searching their own records and returning money.”
Still, Hays said the process will take a long time to play out.
Frost issued a statement through his attorneys earlier this month taking “full responsibility” and asking that “everyone allow the receiver time to sort things out and do his best to repair the damage I created.”
Payback time
State and federal donation records for First Liberty, Frost and his immediate family members show donations to conservative candidates dating back to the early 2000s, with one in 1995, but stepping up around 2021, when the illegal activity is alleged to have begun.
Some of the recipients are well-known conservative firebrands on the national stage, like Colorado Congresswoman Lauren Boebert and former Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz, who each received $2,900 from First Liberty in the 2024 election cycle, according to campaign records.

One of the top beneficiaries of the First Liberty money was Alabama State Auditor Andrew Sorrell, who is running for Alabama Secretary of State. Frost gave Sorrell $71,000, and Sorrell’s PAC made a loan to First Liberty, according to reporting from the Alabama Reflector.
Members of the Frost family and First Liberty have donated more than $50,000 to the state Republican Party in Georgia since 2001 through numerous donations, some as small as $10. Georgia Republican Party Chair Josh McKoon said last week that the party had searched its records and returned $36,843.97, the amount they determined came in since the start of 2021.
“On behalf of our Party, I am profoundly saddened that members of our conservative movement, along with many others, were misled by false promises of safe investments. This has left countless Georgians facing uncertain futures and financial distress,” McKoon said.
Records show three donations from members of the Frost family to Gov. Brian Kemp in 2019, before the scheme was alleged to have begun, totaling $7,500. Kemp’s campaign said the governor sent $13,800 in donations to Hays’ office.
Lt. Gov. Burt Jones, who is running for governor next year, received $1,000 from a Frost family member and is sending it to Hays, a campaign spokesperson said.
Several of Georgia’s sitting Republican members of Congress received donations, including Congressmen Brian Jack, Andrew Clyde and Rich McCormick, each of whom records show received thousands of dollars from First Liberty and the Frost family since 2021.
Congressman Barry Loudermilk’s most recent donation of $3,600 came in 2014, records show. Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene and Congressman Rick Allen received only $80 and $50 respectively from First Liberty in 2024.
A spokesperson for Jack’s office said in a statement he immediately returned two donations and emphasized that they made up a small portion of his support.
“Since announcing his campaign for Congress in March 2024, Congressman Jack has received 28,473 donations,” said spokeswoman Alex Stone. “Just 2 of those donations were from individuals who either identified First Liberty as their employer or are named in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s complaint charging First Liberty.”
Jack won his seat last year, replacing retired GOP Congressman Drew Ferguson in the west Georgia district, which includes Newnan where Frost resides.
First Liberty spent big in that race, also supporting at least two of the men who faced Jack in the GOP primary for that seat, records show, including more than $10,000 to former state Sen. Mike Crane and $7,500 in payments to businessman Jim Bennett.
McCormick’s office also confirmed he plans to return donations, which include $11,600 from First Liberty in 2024, according to FEC records.
Georgia Public Service Commission member Tim Echols, who is up for reelection this year, said he has returned two $1,000 donations to the receiver.
The Frosts also spent on lesser-known candidates, in some cases funding challenges to established incumbents.
State Rep. Jordan Ridley, a Woodstock Republican who is returning $3,000 he received in 2022, said the Frosts were fixtures at state Republican events.
“They were definitely big in fundraising for your more right leaning-candidates,” he said. “They were always a staple at the state party events, with tables and things like that. Definitely very active, very involved and very supportive financially.”
Ridley said he was referred to the Frost family by another member of the General Assembly as a potential fundraising source.
Campaign finance records show that other state lawmakers  who received First Liberty money include Woodstock Rep. Charlice Byrd, Buford Rep. David Clark, Locust Grove Rep. Noelle Kahaian, Columbus Rep. Carmen Rice, Trenton Sen. Colton Moore and Johns Creek Sen. Shawn Still.
Ridley said he’s talked with colleagues in the Legislature who received the donations and most will be ready to give back their donations without much persuasion.
“For anybody to run a Ponzi scheme or take somebody else’s money like that is just completely unacceptable, and I feel for the victims and I hope they get back as much as possible,” Ridley said.
Ridley said Frost may have been a prolific donator, but losing his money won’t hurt Republicans in 2026 or beyond.
“I don’t think they were that big of a donor statewide for that many people that it’s going to have that big of an impact,” he said. “For some candidates, sure, it may be a lot, but for me, I received a donation one time three years ago. For me, it’s not going to be an issue, and for a lot of my colleagues I know who have received money. They weren’t the only donor or a massive donor, they were just a piece of the pie.”

Their confusion deepens when he explains that he’s Indigenous and a member of the Aquinnah Wampanoag nation.
“Their surprise says as much about Martha’s Vineyard as it does about the way this country sees Indigenous people,” Lee writes in his new book, “Nothing More of This Land,” which was published last week. “Very few people ever say it, but I can always feel an unspoken ‘but I thought you were all dead’ in those moments.”
Throughout his book, Lee grapples with the question of what it means to be Indigenous. It’s a question intricately connected to climate change, Lee says, because it’s a question directly related to land. On Martha’s Vineyard, Lee’s community has long been saddled with the effects of colonization, which fuels both extreme gentrification and rising sea levels. Lee traces the history of his own tribal nation, reflects on being mixed race and living in diaspora, and envisions potential futures unencumbered by colonial constraints.
This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.
Q. How would you describe the connection between Indigenous identity and climate change?
A. When you talk about Indigenous people, you have to talk about land. And right now, when you’re talking about land in any context, climate change is the looming backdrop. So many of the challenges Indigenous communities are facing may not be outwardly related to climate change, but they’re impacted by climate change. Fighting for water rights, which I would say is a sovereignty fight and a political fight, is made more difficult and the stakes are higher because of drought. Tensions around land ownership and what we do with our land are also made more complicated by climate impacts like rising sea levels and stronger storms that are eating away at our land. If you’re fighting over land and land you’re fighting over is shrinking because sea levels are rising, it makes that fight much more intense and much more urgent. You could look at salmon and the right to protect salmon and for subsistence lifestyles and all that’s becoming more complicated not just because of overfishing but because the way that salmon and other fish are impacted by warming waters and climate change. Any area of the story that you’re looking at, climate change is present.
Q. I also grew up on an island that is a tourism hub, and in so many communities that’s often perceived as the only viable economic driver. Can you talk about what it feels like to be Indigenous in a land that’s become a tourist destination, and how that affects our communities?
A. In this country, one part of the experience of being Indigenous is the experience of erasure and of being ignored. That’s throughout history, through culture, through politics, through all these spaces. But I think especially in a place like Martha’s Vineyard, it’s even more extreme because the reputation of the place is so big and so specific. Being Indigenous, people are really often not listening to you. The more your land becomes a tourist destination, the harder it is for Indigenous voices to be heard, the harder it is for Indigenous people to hold onto the land.
In a very concrete way, tourism typically drives property values up. It drives taxes up. And that makes it harder for folks to hold on to land that’s been in the family for generations. And that’s what’s happened in Martha’s Vineyard. Beyond that, I think tourism is just a really, really difficult and unfortunate choice that people have been kind of forced into. When so much opportunity has been taken away or denied from Indigenous communities in these places, tourism is often the only thing that’s left. So it can become like a choice between having nothing and contributing to tourism, which is probably ultimately harming the community and the land, but there’s no other way to make a living. So I think that’s just a really unfortunate reality.
Q. There’s a part in the book where you’re talking about how every time you say you’re from Martha’s Vineyard, people either assume you’re really rich or they think, “Oh, I didn’t realize that people live there.” What do you want people to know about your community and your tribe in particular, separate from the broader journey of this book? Is there anything that you wish people knew that this book could convey so that other tribal members don’t have to be on the receiving end of that question?
A. First, I hope that this will help to change the narrative of erasure that has existed about Wampanoag people for most of this country’s history. At the very least, I hope this helps people know that we exist — we’re here. And also, I like to think that it helps to show some of the complexity and diversity of my community: that we have disagreements, we have different perspectives, we have different talents, we live in different places.
Something else that your question made me think of was the question of audience. And I thought about that a lot. Even growing up within the tribe, there was so much just about my own community that I didn’t know. And so I try not to be judgmental of what people know, whether they’re Indigenous or not. And that’s how I really wanted to approach the book. I would hope that Indigenous and non-Indigenous readers can get something out of it, both in terms of learning things, but also hopefully seeing themselves in the pages and this exploration of figuring out who we are and where we want our community to go.
Q. Another part that really resonated with me and I think a lot of Indigenous readers will relate to is the struggle of what does it mean to be Indigenous if you aren’t living on your land. I was wondering what you hope Indigenous readers will take away from the book in terms of understanding what distance from their land can mean for their identity.
A. I hope that Indigenous readers will discover what I’ve discovered, which is that there are so many ways to engage with your homelands and your home community, even if you don’t live there. I used to think that I was only engaging if I was there with the tribe doing some cultural tribal event or something, and I realized that there are so many other ways of engaging. I don’t think any of us are less Indigenous because we live somewhere else.
For a long time I felt like if it wasn’t perfect, it wasn’t worth it. If it wasn’t the perfect ideal of me participating in the tribe, I thought I shouldn’t do it. Ultimately what that led to is I just wasn’t doing anything because I didn’t have as many opportunities to go to these tribal gatherings or participate in tribal politics. And so I just did nothing, and I felt the distance sort of growing over the years. What other people can do is realize that there are all these small ways to engage and to try to embrace those, and not let ideas of what it means to be Indigenous be defined by outsiders, or these big colonial structures like federal recognition, for example, or blood quantum.
Q. Why? What’s at stake? Why do you think it’s important for folks to embrace Indigenous identity and why is it important, particularly at this moment?
A. Circling back to what we talked about at the beginning, we’re not going to be able to address these huge existential crises like climate change if we can’t be at least in some way united as a community, as a people. If we’re always fighting over who belongs and what does it mean to be Indigenous and saying that people are less Indigenous because of XYZ, that takes away our ability to tackle those bigger challenges. Right now we’re facing these serious challenges and that’s what we should be dealing with, so figuring this out is the first step.

Kelly Ayotte said she had privately lobbied Secretary of Education Linda McMahon to lift the freeze. (Photo by Will Steinfeld/New Hampshire Bulletin)The Trump administration will release a series of grants to schools in New Hampshire and other states that it had abruptly withheld in June, ending weeks of uncertainty for schools across the country.
On Friday, the U.S. Department of Education announced it would release the final $5.5 billion of a $6.8 billion portion of funding designated for English language learner instruction, college and career counseling, STEM programs, and educator training. The department had held that $6.8 billion for weeks, pending a review. 
The administration had previously released $1.3 billion of the $6.8 billion, which will go to summer and after-school programs, on July 18.
Friday’s announcement means that $27 million in total assistance grants for New Hampshire schools is no longer in limbo.
The release came after pushback against the freeze from Democrats and some Republicans, which included a lawsuit filed by Democratic-led states. 
New Hampshire Republican Gov. Kelly Ayotte, who did not publicly comment when the department instituted the freeze, hailed the reversal and claimed partial credit for it, saying she had privately lobbied Secretary of Education Linda McMahon to lift the freeze. 
“Today, Governor Kelly Ayotte secured the release of federal education funding for academic enrichment, English language learning, and other key programs for New Hampshire schools,” a statement from her office read Friday. 
“As I told Secretary McMahon in multiple meetings, this funding is critical to delivering a best-in-class education for every child in New Hampshire, and I thank her and the Trump Administration for responding to our concerns,” Ayotte said in a statement. “I will continue to advocate directly for the programs and services Granite Staters depend on.”
U.S. Rep. Maggie Goodlander, a Democrat representing the state’s 2nd Congressional District, also claimed credit, pointing to her “weeks of advocacy” toward the Trump administration. 
The funding freeze began on June 30, when the Trump administration told state departments of education it would hold back money from multiple funding programs until federal officials could confirm that the funding was “spent in accordance with the President’s priorities and the Department’s statutory responsibilities.”
Those programs included Title II-A, which helps pay for teacher professional development; Title III-A, which helps fund English language learning; Title IV-A, which pays for some STEM education and college and career counseling; and Title IV-B, which funds after-school and summer programs.
School administrators and Democrats blasted the freeze, which they said would deprive school districts of funds they had been relying on when they crafted and passed their budgets in spring. Superintendents in larger districts, such as Nashua, said the loss of funding could have required staff layoffs in the fall, especially in the English language learning program. 
On July 14, two weeks after the freeze, attorneys general in 24 states and the District of Columbia sued to require the Trump administration to release the funds. New Hampshire’s attorney general did not sign on to that lawsuit. 
In a statement Monday, the New Hampshire Department of Education welcomed the funds, but said the Trump administration’s review was necessary.
“This review ensures that the students of New Hampshire are supported in accordance with congressional objectives, which supports the goal of leading to bright futures for all children in the state,” the statement said. “Within the U.S. Department of Education’s notification to release the funding, it included important parameters to ensure the grants are distributed according to their intended purpose, and we look forward to working with the schools to maximize the grants for the students of New Hampshire.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/ayottecolumn-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-07-29 05:56:12.951765

The Mississippi State Department of Health, like other state health departments, is concerned about the potential loss of federal funding. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)Between 2016 and 2022, as congenital syphilis cases rose nationally and especially in the South, Mississippi saw a one thousand percent increase — from 10 to 110 — in the number of newborn babies who were hospitalized after contracting the disease, known to cause developmental issues, intellectual disabilities, and even death.
So in 2023, the state Department of Health mandated that all medical practitioners screen for the disease in pregnant mothers, and it has been running advertisements to spread awareness.
Annual congenital syphilis cases in Mississippi rose from 62 in 2021 to 132 in 2023, according to state data. The number fell to 114 last year. There have been 33 cases so far this year.
That work won’t stop despite potential budget cuts, Dr. Daniel Edney, Mississippi’s state health officer, said in an interview. “We’re going to keep doing what we have to do, you know, to keep it under control.”
State by state, public health departments take a similar approach: They monitor, treat and try to stem preventable diseases, alongside their host of other duties. But in the coming year, health department officials — with their agencies already strapped for cash — fear they’ll find it much more difficult to do their jobs.
President Donald Trump’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2026 would cut the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention budget by more than half, from $9.3 billion to $4.2 billion. The proposal serves as a wish list from the administration, a blueprint for the Republican-controlled Congress as it works through upcoming spending legislation.
If lawmakers hew to Trump’s vision, then state and county public health departments would be hit hard. States contribute to their own health departments, but a lot of them rely heavily on federal funding.
And around half of local public health department funding comes from federal sources, primarily the CDC, as noted in a 2022 report from the National Association of County & City Health Officials.

“The federal government provides a lot of funding, but the actual implementation of public health programs happens at the state and local level,” said Josh Michaud, associate director of global health policy at KFF, a health policy research group. “Each state has its own approach, in many ways, to how public health programs are overseen, how they’re funded, how they are implemented.”
In announcing his department’s share of the proposed budget, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said Trump’s goals align with “new priorities in reversing the chronic disease epidemic.”
But many local health leaders point to the longtime mission of state public health departments in preventing the spread of disease.
“Local public health is on the front lines preventing communicable disease, operating programs to prevent chronic disease, ensuring our septic and well water systems are safe,” said Dr. Kelly Kimple, acting director of North Carolina’s Division of Public Health within the Department of Health and Human Services.
“I’m very concerned,” Kimple said, “especially given the magnitude of funding that we’re talking about, as we can’t keep doing more with less.”
 Clawing back COVID-era grants

Other federal budget cuts also have states worried.
Many state public health departments grew alarmed when the Trump administration announced in March that it would be clawing back $11.4 billion in COVID-era funding for grants that were slated to extend into 2026.
Twenty-three states and the District of Columbia sued. A federal district court in Rhode Island temporarily blocked the cuts, and the case remains tied up in court.
The court’s preliminary injunction may not protect temporary staff or contractors, though. Public health departments have been laying off staff, cutting lab capacity and reducing immunization clinics, said Dr. Susan Kansagra, chief medical officer for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.

Historically, public health departments receive funding in “boom and bust” cycles, meaning they tend to get more federal support during emergencies, said Michaud, of KFF. But “since the Great Recession of 2008, there was a general decline in public health support funding until the COVID pandemic.”
For example, KHN and The Associated Press reported that between 2010 and 2019, spending on state public health departments declined by 16% per capita and spending for local health departments fell by 18%.
Nationally, syphilis cases reached historic lows in the 2000s, thanks to robust prevention efforts and education from public health officials. By 2022, however, cases reached their highest numbers nationally since the 1950s.
“In the wake of the COVID emergency, you’ve seen a sort of backlash to what people had been calling the overreach of public health and imposing vaccination requirements and lockdowns and other public health measures,” Michaud told Stateline.
 Smallpox, cholera and typhoid

Public health departments and officials go back to the 19th century, when there was a greater emphasis on sanitation efforts to prevent spread of diseases such as smallpox, cholera and typhoid, which were rampant at the time.
By the end of the century, 40 states had established health departments, which to this day are responsible for water sanitation, tracking the spread of disease, administering vaccinations, furnishing health education, providing screenings for infants and some prenatal care for moms at local clinics, offering family planning services, and tracking and treating sexually transmitted infections, among other things.










What we're seeing now is a complete upheaval of the funding going into public health.


– Josh Michaud, associate director of global health policy at KFF


Kimple pointed to measles as a current example of a disease that’s spreading fast. When North Carolina’s health department detected a case in the state, she said, the department “identified and contacted everyone who might have been exposed, helped people get tested, worked with doctors to make sure they knew how to respond.”
That’s the legacy of local public health, Michaud said.
“The federal government cannot decide, ‘This public health program will happen in this state, but not that state,’ that kind of thing. And cannot declare a national lockdown. The COVID pandemic tested a lot of those boundaries. It really is a state and local responsibility to protect public health. And that’s always been the case, since the beginning of our country,” Michaud said.
“And what we’re seeing now is a complete upheaval of the funding going into public health.”
 A major cut in services

Kimple said she’s seen recent progress in her state in the support for funding public health.
“North Carolinians viewed our work as highly important to improving health and well-being in the state, and appreciated the local presence, the reliable information, the role in prevention and efforts to protect, in particular, vulnerable communities,” she said.
Similarly, Edney said that Mississippi state lawmakers were showing more support, despite some setbacks in 2016 and 2017. New federal cuts could throw a wrench in the health department’s economic plans and its ability to reach small communities.
“Now the federal rug is being pulled out from under us,” he said.
Edney said he expects the federal share of his department’s public health funding to fall from its current 65% to around 50%.
Edney said he’s been trying to strengthen Mississippi health department’s longevity by diversifying its revenue streams by, for example, accepting private donations.
The state will not stop doing its “core” work, he said, regardless of federal funding.
“We’re not going to cut back on services at the county health department, because what we do now is all mission critical,” Edney said.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-07-29 09:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,CT’s solar industry clouded by Trump administration policies,Jan Ellen Spiegel,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/29/ct-solar-big-beautiful-bill/,"By ending a tax credit, the bill could slam the brakes on renewable power. In CT, and all of New England, the brunt will be felt on solar.","On the sunny first day of the mid-July heatwave, Will Herchel and his team walked along the edge of a nearly 18-acre field in Glastonbury three-quarters filled with solar panels. Even though the day was already pushing 90 degrees by late morning, the panels couldn’t take advantage of all that sunshine – yet. 
That should happen in late September or early October when all 6,840 panels are in place and able to generate nearly four megawatts of power, estimated to be enough to run more than 775 average homes. The installation, being built by Verogy — the West Hartford-based company Herchel co-founded and now heads, will provide power to low- and moderate-income homes, as well as to small businesses and municipal buildings, through a concept known as a community solar or shared solar. Connecticut calls it shared clean energy facilities. 
Regardless of the name, the concept is designed to bring clean energy — almost always solar power — to anyone who cannot install a system on their own property. That generally mean renters, condo or apartment owners, and people whose homes simply aren’t suited to solar due to lack of sun or badly configured roof angles.

Community solar has had a balky rollout in Connecticut. It’s taken years for the state to find the right model with parameters and financial requirements that will have staying power.
But, just as it gains momentum here, that effort may be about to hit a major roadblock — the Trump administration.
The tax-and-spending reconciliation bill President Donald J. Trump signed into law on July 4 has the potential to slam the brakes on two of the biggest and fastest-growing sources of renewable power in the U.S. — solar and wind.
The legislation eliminates a valuable 30% federal tax credit for owners of and investors in solar and wind systems. For Connecticut and the rest of New England, the brunt of the pressure will be felt on solar.
“It’s difficult to understand why these technologies were singled out in that way, other than it’s just a more political driven decision,” Herchel said.
Up-front costs
Wind is still the top renewable power source in the U.S. — but solar’s increase the last few years has pushed combined wind and solar beyond 17% of U.S. electricity production, eclipsing coal. A recent U.S. Energy Information Administration report shows solar poised to surpass wind as the top renewable power source during the summer by next year.

Long term, both forms of power will remain much cheaper than conventional sources. For starters, the fuel for the power — wind or solar — is free. But there are fears many people — especially homeowners who want solar — will find themselves priced out because the removal of the tax credit means higher up-front costs and break-even times several years longer than they are now. 
The 30% tax credit for homeowners who purchase residential rooftop solar will disappear on December 31 of this year. There will be no gradual rollback, which is what Trump did his first term when he opted to scale back tax credits over several years. The rate was down to 26% when he left office. 
The Biden administration restored the rate to 30% retroactively with a 10-year lifespan, transitioning to a gradual rollback in 2033.
People who lease solar for their homes, and all forms of commercial solar and wind projects have a longer runway before tax credits expire. They must start construction by next July or be in service by the end of 2027 in order to get the tax credit. For large commercial projects that’s a tight time frame and on leased systems it is the company that owns the system that gets the tax credit, not the homeowner. But homeowners will still face the owner’s higher costs being passed on to them.
Since the budget bill became law, additional policies have been unveiled that have solar developers like Herchel even more worried.
Three days after he signed the measure, Trump issued an executive order that appears likely to further tighten the parameters of access to solar and wind even while the tax credit is still operative. 
The executive order seems designed to restore some provisions of earlier iterations of the bill. Those provisions were more restrictive and were jettisoned to ensure the bill would pass. One part of the order essentially asks the Treasury Department to re-evaluate what it means for a project to be in construction. The goal seems to be to redefine it in a way that would make it harder for projects to meet the timing to qualify for tax credits.
“I think the industry was in a position of relief that they understood what the path forward was,” Herchel said of the original legislation that removed the 30% tax credit. 
His company only does medium size commercial and industrial sector solar and has the slightly longer runway before the tax credit disappears.
“The executive order threw a wrench in that whole process,” he went on. The order gave the U.S. Department of the Treasury 45 days to take action, so companies are stuck waiting. “You don’t know how to start construction, and because of that, everyone is concerned and confused as to which projects are going to qualify and which projects are not going to qualify.”
The uncertainty of how, when or even if to start construction is keeping Herchel and his investors up at night.
“The tough part for us is that, in our industry, the longest part of our installation cycle is permitting and interconnection. We don’t control those aspects,” Herchel said. The Glastonbury project, for example, will take three years from concept to operation, with actual construction only accounting for about seven months.
The uncertainty around the meaning “in construction” could mean that contracted projects already in the production process could be thrown into tax credit limbo. “Those projects essentially become non-viable until you understand whether they’re going to qualify,” Herchel said.
“We don’t know exactly what the rules are, and so when you don’t know what the rules are, you can’t appropriately navigate your business and you can’t appropriately invest capital in those businesses,” he said. “We’re all working very hard and diligently with third party counsel and other advisors, accounting firms, to try to understand what’s actually going to happen. But most of their experience is no longer relevant because no individual executive administrative body has behaved in the way that we’re currently experiencing.”
Proactively, Verogy last week asked Connecticut’s Public Utilities Regulatory Authority, PURA, to take emergency action help ensure as many solar projects as possible can beat the new tax credit clock.

Verogy’s community solar installation is scheduled to be operational early this fall and should receive a 30% federal tax credit. But beginning a year from now, projects like it will not and there is some uncertainty about whether similar projects could lose that tax credit advantage even sooner, causing them to become more expensive.

Jeff Macel, co-founder and managing director of Lodestar Energy, which focuses exclusively on community solar in about eight states, including Connecticut, said he isn’t sleeping terribly well either. He points out the executive order literally contradicts what’s now in statute.
“The legal advice we get is that that can’t happen, but the practical advice is, ‘how are you going to work through that? Is that going to get litigated?’” he said. “So it’s going to be a dog fight, I think, legally.”
He called Trump’s new clean energy policies “100% politically motivated.”
“It’s a difficult time to do business because norms have been thrown out the window and it’s hard to understand what is the status quo,” he said. “I think we take a conservative position and trust lawyers who tell us this is what it says, stick to your guns. And I think you have to.”
Other solar companies and their advocates take great pains to paint the situation in the best light they can, wanting to project that their industry is still valuable and affordable, even at a higher cost. And they note the many policy changes the solar industry has navigated over the years.
“They don’t call it the solar coaster for nothing in this industry,” said Mike Trahan, executive director of the Connecticut Solar and Storage Association, which represents the 50 to 75 solar companies actively operating in the state at any given time and their 2,500 employees. He characterized solar developers and installers as a resilient bunch, used to dealing with disruption.
“It’s an uncomfortable place to be,” he admitted, also referencing the recent policy controversies in the Connecticut legislature. “We’re going to have to do what we did the last time the Trump administration was pursuing changes with the tax credits. You have to find a place where you can be successful. If they’re just going to continue to raise the bar for us, we just have to jump higher.”
“Actively hostile”
Some fear Trump administration actions herald existential threats to clean energy more broadly by encouraging a greater reliance on the fossil fuels whose emissions have caused the climate change the planet is already experiencing.
And, on the most basic level, there’s widespread sentiment that the Trump policies will cause energy prices to go up, emissions to go up and air to be dirtier. States, including Connecticut, will be hard-pressed to meet their renewable energy and greenhouse gas emissions targets as a result.
Trump has a long history as a notorious hater of wind power, with solar power not far behind. He reiterated that during his recent trip to Scotland. 
During the 2024 presidential campaign, he infamously told a group of fossil fuel industry executives gathered at Mar-a-Lago that if they donated $1 billion to his campaign he would cut their taxes and regulatory hurdles in return.  Though he did not get that much money from them, he has indeed introduced multiple policies and executive orders to increase fossil fuel extraction and use. even as most other nations look to switch away from such reliance to greater use of renewables.
Another part of the July 7 executive order would impose stricter rules on products from “foreign entities of concern.” While many components for solar have ties to China — something that has helped to dramatically reduce the cost of systems in recent years — solar panels made in the U.S. are more readily available than they had been, largely due to Biden administration policies that incentivized solar panel manufacturing here.
“At some point our industry does need to stand on its own two legs,” said Sam Schneider, co-founder and chief executive officer of Earthlight Solar and Energy Solutions, which is based in Ellington.
He traveled to Washington, D.C. twice to lobby for better terms in the original legislation. “I can’t say that I’m just jumping for joy, but I will say that it’s much better than where we were, and it gives us runway, and it gives us time.”
In some cases anyway.
Earthlight’s residential solar work is about half of their solar business. About 70% of that is purchased systems, which means the tax credit runs out in less than six months, though Schneider said he still has the capacity to complete projects by then. The rest of the residential solar, which is leased systems, as well as all his commercial work, do have the longer time frame.
“I believe that people are still going to pursue ownership of solar in residential; I one hundred percent believe that,” Schneider said. “It’s not ideal, but it is doable.”

Solar systems like this one on a condo project in Mystic by Earthlight Technologies will lose a federal tax credit that made them less expensive. The heat pumps also on the roof will lose their tax credit as well. Both actions were part of the tax and spending bill signed into law by President Trump on July 4. Credit: Earthlight Technologies
But he faces other tax credit deadlines for related work his company does. The law also ends federal tax credits at the end of this year for a host of energy-saving functions, including the purchase of heat pumps, home and business energy efficiency upgrades, and energy audits. Tax credits for energy efficiency measures in new construction end in June 2026.
Those cutbacks essentially eliminate most other means home and business owners have to reduce their energy bills at a lower upfront cost. It may prove especially troublesome for the low- and moderate-income sector, which often turns to those solutions.
In Connecticut that sector also faces the solar tax credit deadlines in a program specifically designed for them. For 10 years, PosiGen has provided leased solar systems to qualifying low- and moderate-income Connecticut residents — more than 7,000 systems so far.
“This bill is going to have really dramatic consequences for the most vulnerable across Connecticut, generally,” said Kyle Wallace, PosiGen’s vice president of public policy and government affairs and leader of the company’s community impact team.
Leased systems do benefit from the longer deadline, but after that, the increased price likely will be passed along to consumers, Wallace said.
“I think even beyond this, we’re just continuing to see an administration that is just actively hostile to renewables, and we had hoped that they would be more indifferent and not actively hostile,” he said. “They’re going to try every way they can though to hurt renewables.”
Ten days after the July 7 executive order, the U.S. Department of the Interior announced solar and wind projects on federal property would now require personal approval from Secretary Doug Burgum across 69 categories of permitting.
The move is widely seen as a way to slow down approvals, possibly causing them to miss the new deadlines. Its most direct impact on Connecticut and New England would be on offshore wind projects, which are in federal lease areas. But it could have a bearing on federal approvals needed for projects that are not on federal property.
It all worries Harry Godfrey, a managing director at Advanced Energy United who heads up the advocacy group’s federal engagement efforts. He and others note that there is existing statutory language on what constitutes a project being in construction. The Treasury Department could come up with a conflicting standard. 
But the notion of predicating a tax credit on an in-service date for a project is new. Projects face unforeseen delays for all kinds of legitimate reasons. The fear is that such a regulation will open the door to governmental mischief designed to deliberately slow down projects to make them less economically worthwhile and therefore more likely to be killed.
“You kill projects in the present through uncertainty in the future and a ‘placed-in-service’ deadline, like that is the thing that cuts the knees out from under projects,” Godfrey said. “That’s made all the worse if those parties are operating in bad faith — intentionally working to kill a project through delay. Between the executive order and recent actions by the Interior Department, that possibility is coming into more acute focus.”
Stability
Trump and Republican operatives, especially those who developed the energy and climate chapters of Project 2025, have long decried solar and wind power as expensive and destabilizing for the electric grid because they cannot operate fully all the time. Solar, for instance, cannot provide power at night. Storage will eventually change that dynamic.
But even without storage, solar has actually become a key stabilizing factor for the six-state New England grid. Matt Kakley, a spokesman for grid operator ISO New England, said there’s thousands of megawatts of solar in New England equal to about twice the region’s nuclear fleet.
To meet consumer demand, he said, solar is playing an increasingly important role.
“We really count on it every day,” Kakley said. “When we are putting together our daily forecast in our schedule we’re looking at what we expect that solar to do, and we’re counting on it showing up.”

In winter, when heat and electricity compete for the same natural gas supply, solar during the day helps stretch daytime heating supplies. On hot summer days, solar has prevented power crunches when air conditioning use is high. 
The ISO recently reported that the kind of solar that might be on a residential roof —called behind-the-meter solar — reduced power consumption by 5% in 2024. 
During a recent heat wave when power use peaked on June 24 to its highest level in a dozen years and some power plants were unavailable, solar was one factor that helped stabilize the situation. The ISO noted at the time that without behind-the-meter solar, demand would have peaked three hours earlier and more than 2,000 megawatts higher than it did. It also noted that at that time, non-carbon-emitting resources including all solar, wind, nuclear, hydro and battery storage together provided a up to 40% of the energy consumed in the region.
The ISO is predicting demand on the grid will start to rise — 35% over the next 20 years — after years of staying relatively flat and even declining. Whether solar deployment will grow with demand and continue to take the edge off it in the face of the changes that are coming remains to be seen.

There are a few large New England offshore wind projects under construction that will provide large swaths of power in another few years as long as the administration doesn’t stop them. And a large project for transmission of onshore wind from Maine to the rest of the region is in an early planning stage.
But now it’s possible the end of tax credits for heat pumps and electric vehicles may dampen demand. Data center growth, a big energy eater that has caused concern in other parts of the country, has not been a factor in this region.
There’s also a question of whether the solar industry here will contract.
Ken Gillingham, an energy and environmental economist at Yale specializing in renewable energy and efficiency, thinks the residential, small-scale solar industry in Connecticut, New York and Massachusetts will shrink.
“I don’t think it’s going to disappear, but it’s likely that some of the smaller, weaker players are not going to be able to make it, and that means job losses,” he said. “We have this combination of losing the tax credits and higher costs, and you put those together, and suddenly solar is less affordable. A worst case scenario — it’s going to become a very, very small market, almost back down to a niche market like it was 20 years ago.”
Despite Trump’s contention to the contrary which he reiterated again in the July 7 executive order, solar power — grid-scale solar in particular — is one of the least expensive energy sources. A United Nations report unveiled by Secretary General Antonio Guterres last week showed onshore wind, solar and hydropower to be the three least expensive sources of power. Solar is 41% cheaper than fossil fuels and onshore wind is 59% cheaper. Both, the report said, are also the fastest to build.
In 2024, the report said, renewables made up 92.5% of all new electricity capacity additions. And it predicted that solar and wind power generation would surpass nuclear power next year and, “In 2029, solar PV electricity generation is expected to surpass hydropower to become the largest single renewable power source, and wind will surpass hydropower in 2030.”
Stepping up
The mantra has been that the states need to step up to fill the void left by Trump administration policies — something they did in the energy and environment sectors during Trump’s first term pullbacks. With so many voids to fill this time around, it’s unclear how that might play out.
In the meantime, the emergency filing Verogy’s Herchel made with PURA asks that the annual cap on community solar and non-residential solar projects be lifted to allow more projects to capture the tax credit before it expires.
“If PURA does not take this action, the likelihood that projects participating in the program will be eligible for the federal tax credits will significantly deteriorate,” Herchel said. “If participating projects cannot avail themselves of the federal tax credits, then the cost of energy required for these projects will dramatically increase. This premium would create a completely unnecessary cost for Connecticut ratepayers.”
PURA did not respond to a request for comment.
He and others have pointed to what Massachusetts put into motion even before the Trump plan had fully passed Congress. On June 20, that state updated its solar energy incentive program — SMART — via emergency regulation to expedite their process for approving projects.  Noting that the Clean Energy Buyers Association estimates household electricity costs will increase 6% as a result of the reconciliation package, Massachusetts Energy and Environmental Affairs Secretary Rebecca Tepper said: “President Trump and Congressional Republicans are taking us backward.”
The Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection is opting for a more measured approach, with official outreach to developers and other energy stakeholders this month to review new state and federal laws and to gauge their specific challenges. The point, said DEEP Commissioner Katie Dykes, is “so we can make sure that the steps that the state takes are targeted and effective, especially given the very short time that we’re working in.”
Dykes said DEEP is considering whether to initiate an expedited zero-carbon renewable solicitation for grid scale resources that could qualify for the tax credit if companies can move fast enough.
“We’re making sure that we’re engaging with the developers so that we’re not doing it in a vacuum, and that the steps that we are taking are aligned with what they need,” she said. To that end, DEEP issued a request for information last week to gauge developer interest with a speedy one-week turnaround.
Solar companies and advocates suggest that in the immediate term, the state find ways to speed up permitting and streamline other processes to get as much solar in the pipeline before timing restraints kick in. PURA is already looking at how to update the existing solar programs in Connecticut. A PURA spokesperson said that the federal changes could be part of what they consider.
Trahan, of the Solar and Storage Association, said the situation will require the legislature to step up, in addition to PURA, and reconsider both the restrictions the state has placed on solar over the years and the costs they’re willing to assume for things like labor and grid interconnections. 
“The question is going to be, how badly do we want to have a solar industry here?” he said. “If we want one, we’re going to have to make some significant changes in the cost to develop solar.”
Dykes agreed money will be an issue – just as the state is trying to lower energy costs. “There’s going to be some tough questions ahead about how much of the federal tax credit revenue could be offset or made up by higher levels of funding from complementary state programs. That’s a difficult trade off,” she said. “Those will be important things to try to balance.”
Wallace at PosiGen said it would be more important than ever for states and solar businesses to make changes, both short- and long-term, as they face pressures from tariffs, problematic supply chains and high interest rates, in addition to the blow of losing the tax credit so rapidly. Even before the tax credit for his lease customers ends, they might find they are saving only 10% or 15% with their system instead of the usual 20%. 
“We need to use the time we have now to find ways to lower costs, to be more efficient, to be able to better serve low-income communities,” he said. “We essentially need to increase the value that’s going to consumers now so that when the tax credit goes away and maybe prices have to increase, there’s enough of a buffer where it’s still a really compelling product.”
At Lodestar, Jeff Macel is already gaming out future plans through the lens of the company’s development pipeline, projects, and their drop-dead date of December 31, 2027.
“We’ve said, ‘okay, let’s work backwards from those dates. What projects can be built by then? We need to make sure we procure labor. We need to make sure we procure equipment. We need to make sure that we have utilities signed up to place them in service,’” he said. “So we’ve started that process internally to rank order our projects and say we can get these built by the date. And those are the sacred projects. Those are the ones we are focused on driving to the finish line.”
So far, companies that specialize in residential purchased systems, which face a much earlier loss of the tax credit, do not seem inclined to pivot to leased systems, which have the longer runway, though statewide data from PURA shows that shift has been happening on its own over the last few years.
“The amount of red tape involved with some of the stuff is cumbersome. So if I can do it without doing that, that would be my primary way to move forward,” said James LaPorta, owner of Litchfield Hills Solar, which only provides purchased systems and is booked through the end of the year. “My bigger concern is how it’s going to affect the whole industry.”
At Earthlight, Schneider said he doesn’t plan to shift the focus of his residential work, which has been mostly purchased systems. “I’m not looking for a doom and gloom here. Our industry has been through a lot over the last 15 years,” he said. “If our industry goes into a small downturn or even a large one, I’m ready for it.”

Herchel at Verogy said his first task is to shore up the immediate pipeline to ensure the viability of the projects underway before passage of the act. Then he will focus on the individual portfolio projects that could be completed before December 31, 2027.
“That’s kind of our narrow, immediate window for action,” he said. “We do believe, at least as we sit here today, there is a viable path for solar as a technology even without the current [tax credit] infrastructure; albeit it’s going to require a higher revenue stream to support it.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/solar-verogy-glastonbury-drone-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-07-29 05:56:12.951765

Almost half of the 63 million Americans who care for a family member say they struggle financially to do so. (Photo by Bruce Bennett/Getty Images)More than 63 million Americans are caregivers for a family member with complex medical needs, a 20 million increase over the past decade, according to a new report.
But state policies, workplaces and the American health system haven’t kept up with this surge in family caregiving responsibilities, said Dr. Myechia Minter-Jordan, a physician and the CEO of the AARP, which released the report with the National Alliance for Caregiving, a nonprofit policy and research organization.
“Nearly half of caregivers say they face major financial consequences, draining savings, falling into debt or struggling to afford basic needs like food and housing,” Minter-Jordan told reporters on a call this week.
One of the biggest reasons for the surge in family caregivers is that Americans are living longer, yet they’re not necessarily healthier. There’s a 12-year gap between the average number of years that Americans live and the number of years they’re healthy.

The caregiving role typically involves helping a family member with daily tasks like bathing, dressing and eating. But more than half of caregivers also perform more complex medical tasks, such as managing catheters or administering injections, the report found.
A growing number of caregivers are so-called “sandwich caregivers” — parents caring for their children as well as for an adult family member, such as an aging parent. About 17 million people are sandwich caregivers, compared with 11 million a decade ago. And most caregivers are also working a job.
And while the bulk of caregiving still falls on women, 40% of American caregivers are men.
Some states have heeded the growing calls for action.
Earlier this year, Maine lawmakers created a state program to provide respite care, which includes services such as adult day care that give family caregivers a temporary break.
Also this year, Tennessee extended its pilot program that provides respite care for Alzheimer’s and dementia patients, and also passed a bipartisan bill that directs the state Medicaid program to develop guidelines to allow family caregivers to be paid for their work.
Last year, Nebraska passed a tax credit for family caregivers; Oklahoma passed a similar law the year before. And while the United States is one of few countries that doesn’t mandate paid family leave at the federal level, 13 states and the District of Columbia have established their own paid family leave rules.
Meanwhile, the historic cuts to Medicaid enacted as part of the GOP’s Big, Beautiful Bill Act will shift health costs to states, leaving experts worried that family caregivers could lose Medicaid-funded services they rely on.

(Photo courtesy of the Ohio Immigrant Alliance.)In the middle of a national firestorm, the top executive of a venerable Ohio hospital last Thursday told employees that “misinformation and lack of context can spread quickly, making it easy to jump to conclusions without all the facts.”
However, Cincinnati Children’s Hospital President and CEO Steve Davis didn’t provide any facts about the firings of two chaplains who spoke out in support of a former colleague whom the Trump administration is trying to deport. 
Instead, he urged employees “to trust that our leaders and your colleagues are making decisions with the best interests of our patients, families and each other in mind,” according to a note to the staff obtained by the Capital Journal. 
Children’s Hospital’s public affairs office was sent a copy of the note, which was posted late Thursday afternoon, but it didn’t respond to questions about it.
In addition to telling employees to trust him, Davis, the $2.5 million-a-year CEO, reminded his underlings of hospital policies regarding advocacy and media relations, according to the note. 
Davis was addressing the controversy around Ayman Soliman, a man who served as a Muslim chaplain at Children’s after fleeing his native Egypt in 2014 and receiving asylum in the United States in 2018. 
Soliman was arrested, beaten, and tortured in Egypt because of his work as a journalist during the Arab Spring.
ICE continues to hold Ohio cleric. His defenders say the government’s claims are bogus

Soliman’s asylum was revoked on June 3 and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested him on July 9. He’s been in the Butler County Jail ever since. A federal judge issued an order preventing ICE from removing Soliman from Ohio at least through July 30.
Soliman’s lawyers say the administration has used a bogus, shifting set of claims to try to deport Soliman. Many have rallied to his support.
On July 17, there was a vigil for Soliman in Cincinnati. About 100 protesters left it to march in the travel lanes across the John A. Roebling Bridge to Covington, Ky., impeding traffic. Covington police arrested 15 — in some cases acting violently even though the protesters appeared to be peaceful.
Among those arrested were a reporter and photographer for CityBeat. Felony charges against them were later dropped, but misdemeanors remain pending.
In the aftermath, Cincinnati Children’s fired Adam Allen, one of its chaplains, merely for attending the vigil, Allen told WCPO TV. He said he tried to comply with what he thought was hospital policy.
“There was an HR meeting with our department to discuss media policies,” Allen told the station. “I understood from that meeting that I shouldn’t be a speaker. I could be misrepresented in the media as being a representative of the hospital. So I wore a shirt to the event that said, ‘I do not represent Cincinnati Children’s Hospital.'”
The hospital also fired chaplain Lizzy Diop, who had given media interviews in support of Soliman. 
Children with serious medical conditions — both chronic and acute — have long been treated at Children’s. And chaplains have played an important role comforting traumatized kids and their parents, a story published Wednesday in Rolling Stone said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Soliman was valuable to the hospital because of his generous demeanor, his ability to speak Arabic, and his training in Muslim theology, the story said.
Despite the seeming importance of chaplains to hospital care, Children’s is down three in a short span. The losses are all due to the same controversy — which stems from the priority President Donald Trump has placed on mass deportations.
In his note to the staff, Davis, the Children’s CEO, didn’t directly mention that controversy.
“As our country continues to experience changes and challenges, Cincinnati Children’s is not immune to the scrutiny that arises when polarizing topics and events occur,” the note said. “In fact, our reputation as a national leader in pediatric health brings a high level of attention and assumed expectations from our supporters, colleagues and the general public.”
Davis added, “Please know the absence of a public response should not be mistaken for a lack of caring or action.”
Children’s didn’t respond when asked whether the hospital feared retaliation from the Trump administration if employees speak out against Trump’s actions. Trump has engaged in high-profile battles in which he tried to defund elite universities over issues relating to free speech. 
In the note to employees, Davis referenced rules from the hospital for employees about their own speech.
“While there may be divisiveness outside of our walls, we expect all employees to live our values and follow our policies, every day and in every interaction,” he wrote. “I encourage you to review our Code of Conduct, as well as policies related to Advocacy, Media Relations, Social Media and Solicitation.”

(Photo by Jnaiah Price)Twenty-eight-year-old Michaela Bonner has been working 12-hour shifts as an emergency medical technician in Norfolk, Virginia, for the past four years, while attending and paying for college to finish her prerequisites for medical school.
But now that President Donald Trump’s signature tax and spending law bars students from borrowing more than $50,000 annually in unsubsidized federal loans for medical school, Bonner is worried her dream of becoming a doctor is financially out of reach.
“I get told, ‘Well, we really need you. We have a physician shortage, and you’ve done all this work leading up to this point,’ and that’s true as well, and it’s not that I want to quit,” Bonner said in a recent interview. “But there are no systems in place that I can rely on to support me now that I can’t take out the full cost of living through loans.”
The tax and spending law includes provisions that significantly alter the student loan process for higher education. The law halts current student loan repayment plans for loans that are granted on or after July 1, 2026. On that date, the law also terminates Grad PLUS loans, which have helped people pay for their higher education degrees and total cost of attendance. Current borrowers will be grandfathered in.
The federal law gives current borrowers enrolled in loan repayment plans for students based on income — such as those plans known as SAVE or IBR — until July 1, 2028, to switch to a new plan. Interest collection will resume Aug. 1 for students enrolled in the Biden-era SAVE plan.
At the same time, medical or law school students hoping to get unsubsidized federal loans — in which the borrower is responsible for paying the interest at all times rather than the government — will only be able to borrow $50,000 per year, with a $200,000 lifetime cap. Those seeking advanced degrees in areas such as history or philosophy have a $100,000 lifetime cap.
The average yearly cost of medical school for the 2024-25 academic year ranged from around $42,000 to $72,000, depending on whether the school was private or public and whether the student was a resident or nonresident, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges.
Some congressional Republicans say that students need to be working harder to pay for higher education, like medical school, on their own. Others say the caps put the onus back on colleges and universities to rein in the rising cost of tuition. But critics of this legislation say the loan caps are only going to harm students, especially from lower-income backgrounds, and will exacerbate physician shortages.
In recent years states have tried to ease physician shortages by implementing various policy solutions. Since 2023, at least nine states have made it easier for doctors trained in other countries to get medical licenses. States have also participated in interstate licensing compacts, allowing nurses and physician assistants to travel across state lines to work, so long as they are licensed in one state within the compact.
For student loan relief, more than 20 states have enacted legislation to address student loan forgiveness, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, a group that tracks states policies. Georgia passed a measure that will expand a cancelable loan program for physicians working in rural and underserved areas. Idaho also created the Rural Nursing Loan Repayment Program, offering nurses $25,000 in forgivable loans after three years of service in a rural area.
McKenzie Richards, a health care policy fellow at the conservative think tank Cicero Institute who has been studying the pace of physician shortages, told Stateline that the national physician shortage could potentially exceed 100,000 by 2034. At the end of 2024 that projected number was closer to 64,000 physicians.
Richards said states will be looking toward more policy solutions should the student loan changes exacerbate physician shortages.
“We know what’s going to be happening coming down the line in just five years, so I think policies that states can adopt to get out of this are really important to be looking at now,” she said.
“The hope is that by capping [federal loans], it will encourage schools to lower tuition prices,” Richards added. “Then maybe they need to be admitting more students, which would have a great downstream effect for getting more doctors through.”
Other students will be in the same boat, said Lesley Turner, an associate professor of public policy at the University of Chicago and an economist.
“This is going to hit some students worse than others,” Turner told Stateline. “Those [students] in more expensive programs tend to borrow more, and so for those students they will need to return to private student loans or other ways of financing their graduate education.”
Many students were already questioning their capacity to go to medical school before the student loan caps, said Shannon Jimenez, dean of the Arkansas College of Osteopathic Medicine.
“I expect that this bill, this cap, is going to push people out of primary care and into specialties to help pay off those higher interest rate loans,” Jimenez told Stateline. She added that caps will likely deter students from lower socioeconomic statuses from going into primary care — important in places like Arkansas, where she says there is a “maldistribution of physicians.”
“Many schools like us try to attract those students, because they’re more likely to go into primary care and serve in underserved areas. So it’s going to tie our hands in a lot of ways.”
Large states and more rural states will feel the gaps more deeply, said Richards, of the Cicero Institute. Louisiana, for example, is projected to be short almost 5,000 doctors from a variety of specialties by 2030, including close to 400 primary care doctors. Already more than a third of Louisiana physicians are close to retirement age — similar to the situation in neighboring Arkansas.
As for whether schools will just be able to lower tuition, Jimenez said, “it makes no sense.”
“We still function in a somewhat market-driven economy and have to compete with other schools around us, so our cost is based mostly on what we have to pay our faculty, and that’s not going to go down,” she said. The annual cost of attendance at her school is between $80,000 and $85,000.
Bonner, the EMT, holds a political communications degree from Regent University and now is studying biomedical sciences at Old Dominion University. She already has $20,000 in loans, she said, and for the rest of college tuition, she has paid out of pocket. Since she’s supporting herself, she hasn’t been able to save much.
She’d planned to take the medical school entrance exam next spring, but now worries about how she’d pay for living expenses while attending. “Medical school scheduling doesn’t allow for working, so you have to take out loans for living expenses,” she said.
“A lot of people, I feel, would be panicked if you had worked for eight to 10 years of your life and found out that all the systems that you were banking on in a really academically challenging space are disappearing,” Bonner said.
“I don’t see a path forward for certain, but I’m fighting to make one.”

(Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)  A major cut to funding to the Appalachian Regional Commission was stopped by a congressional committee after supporters of the commission’s work, which includes areas of Ohio, expressed their outrage at the potential reductions.
President Donald Trump’s discretionary budget proposal had included a 93% cut for the commission, which provides grant funding and program assistance to areas in the Appalachian region. That region includes 32 counties in Ohio, from Clermont County to Ashtabula County, with several counties considered by the commission to be economically distressed, and 15 others to be at risk of economic distress.
In Ohio, projects related to improving broadband, water quality and wastewater systems were part of $12.5 million in investments in fiscal year 2024, as part of a partnership between the commission and the Ohio Governor’s Office of Appalachia.
Trump requests 93% cut to Appalachian Regional Commission. Ohio would take a huge hit.

The original cut proposed by Trump would have taken the commission down from $200 million in funding to $14 million. A July 17 report by the House Appropriations Committee for energy and water development funding recommended $150 million for the Appalachian commission instead. After discussions, the final markup approved by the appropriations committee included the full $200 million restored to the commission budget.
“Despite significant and unprecedented new challenges from the downturn of the coal mining industry, the substance use crisis and numerous natural disasters, Appalachian is the home of tremendous energy for innovation and the deep community commitments to put new projects in motion,” said Dana Kuhnline, program director for advocacy group Reimagine Appalachia, in a statement after the vote.
The appropriations, among other discretionary funds, now move to the full U.S. House for a vote, and then the Senate for consideration, where Kuhnline said they will look to the chamber to “preserve programs like the ARC … so that the potential of the region isn’t flatlined at this critical moment.”

Twenty years ago, investigative reporter Barry Levine started covering a wealthy socialite named Jeffrey Epstein. Five years ago, after he was convicted of sex crimes and died in jail, Levine published an acclaimed book on Epstein.
And last week, as the controversy surrounding mountains of FBI data and evidence about Epstein slowly consumed the government and threatened the Trump presidency, Levine penned a powerful essay in the New York Times detailing the questions to which Americans deserve answers.
His central message – quote “With the exception of redactions required to protect the innocent and materials that must be withheld while under court seal, the complete F.B.I. files should be released.”
And amazingly in these divided times, most North Carolina Democrats and Republicans agree. As Senator Thom Tillis put it succinctly, “release the damn files.”
The bottom line: President Trump, as well as many other prominent people were close to Epstein and for the good of the country, Americans deserve to know the full truth about whether any of them were involved in his criminality.

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)Millions of individuals in America live with a chronic illness. Many can’t get the access to the health care they need just to live. Add to this housing insecurity, food insecurity and lack of family support, and people feel trapped and vulnerable.
I live with a chronic illness. I take daily medication for it, and every two weeks I drive my car to a nearby clinic to receive an injection in my arm. I must admit it sometimes hurts a bit, but my brain could not live without it. I have been living with this illness since I was 18 in 1993. I have been taking medication since 1993. I had just graduated from high school, and then I was diagnosed.
I have to admit, I take the good and the bad. Thankfully, my faith is important to me, and I pray a lot. I often feel alone in my battles. Prayer helps me feel less alone. Sometimes I take long drives in my little car and I listen to soft, encouraging music. I feel like the singers are singing right to me. Somehow, they understand my pain.
I have been hospitalized many times, but thankfully my last hospitalization was in February of 2007. I have fought valiantly since then to remain out of the hospital. Don’t get me wrong, going to the hospital when one is ill is not something to be ashamed of. If one needs help, I say go get it.
For one whole day years ago, my mom, dad, sister and I took a family educational workshop on my illness. The workshop was done by Valeo Behavioral Health Care in Topeka, and they even gave each of us a special notebook with all kinds of helpful information. My dad learned a lot, and the day really helped our relationship.
Living with a chronic illness is not for the faint of heart. Sometimes I still struggle with acute anxiety and paranoia, and I text my sister for reality checks. I want to live my life right. I want to say the right things to people. I struggle with anxiety in this dark world, but my faith and family and Shot Queen — as I call the nurse extraordinaire who administers my bimonthly injection — give me hope.
We all need hope these days. There is hope.
Each person is unique in the way they search for and find glimmers of hope. However, lack of health care or access to good health insurance can be a huge barrier in receiving nurturing, comforting care. A lot of folks don’t understand what a prior authorization is, but it’s when a health insurance company has to approve a medication or procedure. So many people have denials with their prior authorizations. It’s a real crisis. I have a friend who works at Valeo who works on prior authorizations, along with scheduling appointments. She works so hard to get people what they need medically.
Many people also lack of housing or transportation, which adds to the stress of their illness they battle each and every day. They may be homeless, and they may also experience a drug addiction or substance abuse disorder. This can be disabling as well. Places like Valeo, Breakthrough House and the Topeka Rescue Mission try to reach people where they are in their addiction journey and their co-occurring mental illness and offer support and care. People like Robert Sanders who works at the Topeka Rescue Mission truly help people who come there for hope and healing.
Family support is vital. However, too many individuals experiencing a chronic illness don’t have that support. My mom helps me in many, many ways. My younger sister, Laura, and her husband Don invite me to their beautiful home in Tucson, Arizona, and it’s a true blessing to be with family in a lovely setting. It takes my mind off my illness.
The bottom line is people need help with their journeys, their situations and their efforts to care for themselves. We need to reach out and help those in need. We need to offer hope. It may be all we have to give.

(Photo by Bill Pugliano/Getty Images)Ohioans whose livelihoods are inextricably linked to the automotive industry are in for a bumpy ride. 
The Big Three automakers, who employ 86,000 workers in vehicle and parts manufacturing in the state, along with Honda’s strong presence, are grappling with escalating costs and tumbling profits as Trump tariffs take effect. 
Cumulative tariff costs for U.S. automakers are pegged at nearly $4-5 billion this year, according to a recent study, roughly $5,000 per vehicle in parts. 
Last week, General Motors and Stellantis, formerly Chrysler, announced bad news about their bottom lines.
GM said Trump’s tariffs on its biggest trading partners cost the company more than $1 billion in the second quarter of 2025. Stellantis expects a $2.7 billion loss in the first half of the year, in part from tariffs. Ford Motor, and other import-heavy brands, face similar strains from tariffs. 
Analysts predict Ford’s Q2 earnings will show a double-digit earnings decline when the company releases its numbers Wednesday.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
But understand this: The financial tumult of tariffs eating into U.S. carmakers’ profit margins will reverberate in factory hubs throughout Ohio when import costs cannot be sustained without steep markups on cars people won’t buy. 
We’ve seen this movie before. If inventory isn’t moving, plants cut shifts. Layoffs mount as unsold vehicles pile up in dealership lots.
When that happens — and it sure appears to be the tariff-induced trajectory we’re on —  it won’t just be tens of thousands of Ohio manufacturing jobs that will be affected by declining car sales and plummeting company profits. 
Several times that many people in the state are employed by businesses that serve automakers and their families. The impact of the auto industry on Ohio’s economy cannot be overstated. 
The toll of Trump’s irrational trade war with Mexico and Canada, Ohio’s largest trading partner, will ultimately be paid by Jeep workers in Toledo, employees at the Ford assembly plant in Avon Lake, the Lima engine plant, the GM stamping and metal plant in Parma and others. 
These are Ohioans earning solid wages (average salary is $29.85 an hour or $62,097 a year, according to ZipRecruiter) with better benefits. 
Many are Trump supporters but he is directly jeopardizing their success stories by threatening to hike tariffs even higher on Mexico and Canada — 30% and 35%, respectively — on Friday.
Adding insult to injury, Trump further undercut U.S. car companies last week by lowering tariffs for Japanese imports to 15% while GM, Ford and Stellantis still pay 25% tariffs for cars they manufacture in Canada and Mexico. 
The American Automotive Policy Council, that represents the Detroit Big Three, said “any deal that charges a lower tariff for Japanese imports with virtually no U.S. content is a bad deal for the U.S. industry and U.S. autoworkers.” 
But despite the pressing concerns of American automakers that Trump’s plan could give Japanese automakers unfair advantage, U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick brushed off the complaints with his trademark, tone-deaf drivel. 
“Oh my God, that’s just so silly,” Lutnick sputtered on CNBC’s “Squawk on the Street.” American auto companies don’t mind the discrepancy in tariff costs that favor a foreign competitor, he brayed. They’re “cool with” paying higher tariff fees than Japan, Lutnick assured absolutely no one. 
Does the commerce secretary really believe domestic automakers and suppliers are “cool with” the cost of business rising astronomically? Or jacking up consumer prices on vehicles that inevitably reduce sales? Will the Big Three be “cool with” massive job losses at shuttered factories?
It is absurd blather from a billionaire carrying water for another billionaire lost in magical economic thinking. 
Trump promised a new “golden age” in U.S. manufacturing courtesy his nonsensical trade war with some of America’s closest allies. 
The “very stable genius” insisted his barrage of tariffs, with little discernible rationale, will generate a domestic manufacturing boom like no other — contravening every fundamental taught in ECON 101.  
“Jobs and factories will come roaring back into our country,” declared the felon (with multiple bankruptcies) based on nothing.

But instead of roaring back, U.S. manufacturers are in a slump.
 In just the second quarter of this year they are reeling with oppressive import costs they are forced to offset with prices increases on products buyers can no longer afford. 
Tack on more tariff charges (taxes) for other imported material (steel and aluminum) on top of EV (electric vehicles) incentives, such as tax credits, going away and tell me again how the Big Three are “cool with” unsustainable losses caused by a seemingly addled 79-year-old with a nostalgic tick for the 1950s. 
Second quarter numbers scream for course correction but Trump is on a tariff power trip that defies reason. 
His economic policy (?) — driven by impulse and flattery — could set American competitiveness in manufacturing back decades and increase the prospects of more hollowed out communities like Youngstown, Ohio.
Trump promised an economic renaissance there, too. Remember? 
In 2017 he said all the lost auto jobs, that used to fill the GM Lordstown parking lot with 4,500 employees, would come roaring back. 
The exact opposite happened. GM cut the second shift at Lordstown in 2018. A year later the plant would close for good. 
Trump betrayed those who elected him and never looked back. Is he doing that again by risking auto-dependent livelihoods in the state with reckless trade wars to no end?

The Mississippi State Department of Health, like other state health departments, is concerned about the potential loss of federal funding. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)Between 2016 and 2022, as congenital syphilis cases rose nationally and especially in the South, Mississippi saw a one thousand percent increase — from 10 to 110 — in the number of newborn babies who were hospitalized after contracting the disease, known to cause developmental issues, intellectual disabilities, and even death.
So in 2023, the state Department of Health mandated that all medical practitioners screen for the disease in pregnant mothers, and it has been running advertisements to spread awareness.
Annual congenital syphilis cases in Mississippi rose from 62 in 2021 to 132 in 2023, according to state data. The number fell to 114 last year. There have been 33 cases so far this year.
That work won’t stop despite potential budget cuts, Dr. Daniel Edney, Mississippi’s state health officer, said in an interview. “We’re going to keep doing what we have to do, you know, to keep it under control.”
State by state, public health departments take a similar approach: They monitor, treat and try to stem preventable diseases, alongside their host of other duties. But in the coming year, health department officials — with their agencies already strapped for cash — fear they’ll find it much more difficult to do their jobs.
President Donald Trump’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2026 would cut the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention budget by more than half, from $9.3 billion to $4.2 billion. The proposal serves as a wish list from the administration, a blueprint for the Republican-controlled Congress as it works through upcoming spending legislation.
If lawmakers hew to Trump’s vision, then state and county public health departments would be hit hard. States contribute to their own health departments, but a lot of them rely heavily on federal funding.
And around half of local public health department funding comes from federal sources, primarily the CDC, as noted in a 2022 report from the National Association of County & City Health Officials.
Medicaid cuts are likely to worsen mental health care in rural America

“The federal government provides a lot of funding, but the actual implementation of public health programs happens at the state and local level,” said Josh Michaud, associate director of global health policy at KFF, a health policy research group. “Each state has its own approach, in many ways, to how public health programs are overseen, how they’re funded, how they are implemented.”
In announcing his department’s share of the proposed budget, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said Trump’s goals align with “new priorities in reversing the chronic disease epidemic.”
But many local health leaders point to the longtime mission of state public health departments in preventing the spread of disease.
“Local public health is on the front lines preventing communicable disease, operating programs to prevent chronic disease, ensuring our septic and well water systems are safe,” said Dr. Kelly Kimple, acting director of North Carolina’s Division of Public Health within the Department of Health and Human Services.
“I’m very concerned,” Kimple said, “especially given the magnitude of funding that we’re talking about, as we can’t keep doing more with less.”
 Clawing back COVID-era grants

Other federal budget cuts also have states worried.
Many state public health departments grew alarmed when the Trump administration announced in March that it would be clawing back $11.4 billion in COVID-era funding for grants that were slated to extend into 2026.
Twenty-three states and the District of Columbia sued. A federal district court in Rhode Island temporarily blocked the cuts, and the case remains tied up in court.
The court’s preliminary injunction may not protect temporary staff or contractors, though. Public health departments have been laying off staff, cutting lab capacity and reducing immunization clinics, said Dr. Susan Kansagra, chief medical officer for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.
No one knows whether Trump’s $50B for rural health will be enough

Historically, public health departments receive funding in “boom and bust” cycles, meaning they tend to get more federal support during emergencies, said Michaud, of KFF. But “since the Great Recession of 2008, there was a general decline in public health support funding until the COVID pandemic.”
For example, KHN and The Associated Press reported that between 2010 and 2019, spending on state public health departments declined by 16% per capita and spending for local health departments fell by 18%.
Nationally, syphilis cases reached historic lows in the 2000s, thanks to robust prevention efforts and education from public health officials. By 2022, however, cases reached their highest numbers nationally since the 1950s.
“In the wake of the COVID emergency, you’ve seen a sort of backlash to what people had been calling the overreach of public health and imposing vaccination requirements and lockdowns and other public health measures,” Michaud told Stateline.
 Smallpox, cholera and typhoid

Public health departments and officials go back to the 19th century, when there was a greater emphasis on sanitation efforts to prevent spread of diseases such as smallpox, cholera and typhoid, which were rampant at the time.
By the end of the century, 40 states had established health departments, which to this day are responsible for water sanitation, tracking the spread of disease, administering vaccinations, furnishing health education, providing screenings for infants and some prenatal care for moms at local clinics, offering family planning services, and tracking and treating sexually transmitted infections, among other things.










What we're seeing now is a complete upheaval of the funding going into public health.


– Josh Michaud, associate director of global health policy at KFF


Kimple pointed to measles as a current example of a disease that’s spreading fast. When North Carolina’s health department detected a case in the state, she said, the department “identified and contacted everyone who might have been exposed, helped people get tested, worked with doctors to make sure they knew how to respond.”
That’s the legacy of local public health, Michaud said.
“The federal government cannot decide, ‘This public health program will happen in this state, but not that state,’ that kind of thing. And cannot declare a national lockdown. The COVID pandemic tested a lot of those boundaries. It really is a state and local responsibility to protect public health. And that’s always been the case, since the beginning of our country,” Michaud said.
“And what we’re seeing now is a complete upheaval of the funding going into public health.”
 A major cut in services

Kimple said she’s seen recent progress in her state in the support for funding public health.
“North Carolinians viewed our work as highly important to improving health and well-being in the state, and appreciated the local presence, the reliable information, the role in prevention and efforts to protect, in particular, vulnerable communities,” she said.
Similarly, Edney said that Mississippi state lawmakers were showing more support, despite some setbacks in 2016 and 2017. New federal cuts could throw a wrench in the health department’s economic plans and its ability to reach small communities.
“Now the federal rug is being pulled out from under us,” he said.
Edney said he expects the federal share of his department’s public health funding to fall from its current 65% to around 50%.
Edney said he’s been trying to strengthen Mississippi health department’s longevity by diversifying its revenue streams by, for example, accepting private donations.
The state will not stop doing its “core” work, he said, regardless of federal funding.
“We’re not going to cut back on services at the county health department, because what we do now is all mission critical,” Edney said.

They may resemble other ATMs, but officials are increasingly warning about the potential for fraud with the expanding fleet of cryptocurrency ATMs popping up across the country.
The National Consumers League says the largely unregulated machines have become favored by scammers for their anonymity and irreversibility — once a user transfers or deposits funds, that money is essentially gone.
While officials say the machines can be used for legitimate purposes, red and blue states are increasingly imposing new regulations to protect consumers: AARP says 11 states have recently passed new laws or regulations of the machines.
“In state after state, AARP found lawmakers on both sides of the aisle and local law enforcement eager to work on commonsense rules that balance innovation and consumer safety,” Nancy LeaMond, AARP’s executive vice president and chief advocacy and engagement officer, said in a news release.
Last year, the FBI reported nearly 11,000 complaints of cryptocurrency ATM fraud. Those cases disproportionately affected older Americans and cost victims $246.7 million.
Cryptocurrencies are digital assets, including bitcoin, that offer an alternative payment or method without control of a central bank or government like other currencies. Crypto ATMs, sometimes called crypto kiosks, allow users to insert cash or use debit cards to convert currencies such as U.S. dollars into cryptocurrencies.
The Federal Trade Commission says crypto ATM scams often start with a call or text message warning of a supposed problem, such as unauthorized bank charges or suspicious activity on an Amazon account.
The FTC says consumers should contact banks or other institutions directly about any account issues. And it warns consumers not to believe anyone who says they must use a crypto ATM to address a financial problem.
“Real businesses and government agencies will never do that — anyone who does is a scammer,” the agency said.
States look at shoring up consumer protections as Trump hobbles federal watchdog

After signing a bill with new regulations, Nebraska Republican Gov. Jim Pillen was clear that the state would continue to welcome cryptocurrency businesses as it aims to become a hub for the industry.
The Nebraska law requires ATM operators to acquire state licensure, warn customers of the potential for criminal exploitation and take “reasonable steps to detect and prevent fraud.” The law also limits transactions to $2,000 per day for new customers and $10,500 for existing customers, and requires operators to issue refunds for properly reported fraudulent transactions.
At least 40 states have introduced legislation regarding cryptocurrency, digital or virtual currencies and other digital assets in the 2025 legislative session, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Those measures include ATM regulations, prohibiting the use of digital currencies by governments and allowing state investment in digital assets.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Federal lawmakers are also taking action on the issue. The Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives declared the week of July 14 “Crypto Week,” when lawmakers considered several pieces of legislation.
At the end of that week, President Donald Trump signed into law the GENIUS Act, the first major law governing digital currency. It establishes a regulatory framework for the industry.
Trump hopes the bill will instill confidence in the industry that spent heavily to strengthen its legitimacy and political might, The Associated Press reported.
“This signing is a massive validation of your hard work and your pioneering spirit,” the president told crypto executives.
In state legislatures, new bills regulating crypto ATMS have enjoyed bipartisan support. AARP tracking shows new bills have been approved in Arkansas, Iowa and Oklahoma, as well as in more liberal states such as Maryland and Vermont.
In May, Arizona Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs signed Republican-sponsored legislation that sets daily transaction limits and mandates crypto ATM operators provide customers certain disclosures and warnings.
The legislation followed local news coverage of at least two dozen crypto scams, including one that cost an Arizonan $28,000.

Brown/Maryland Matters).After months of deliberation, information gathering and public testimony, a state board unanimously agreed Monday that two common medications for type-2 diabetes and other conditions appear to pose an affordability challenge to the state and Marylanders.
The state Prescription Drug Affordability Board approved two resolutions saying that prescription drugs Jardiance and Farxiga likely pose an “an affordability challenge for the state health care system” and the state should look for ways to bring down those costs.
Health care advocates call the long-awaited resolution an “important first step” in the process in bringing down prescription costs for those on the state’s health plan.
Vincent DeMarco, a long-time supporter of the board’s effort and president of the Maryland Health Care for All Coalition, called the preliminary decision a “really big deal.”
In a written statement, the coalition commended board members for agreeing that the “critically-needed diabetes drugs” can cause an affordability challenge for the state, and expressed hope that the board will quickly make decisions to bring those costs down.
The preliminary determination allows the board to consider options for reducing spending on those drugs for the state, including the possible use of upper payment limits to cap how much the state is willing to pay for them.
But it may be a while before the state sees any savings on those medications.
“It’s an important milestone, but it is not a final step,” Andrew York, the board’s executive director, told board members during the public portion of Monday’s meeting.


Targeted drugs
Six drugs were selected for “cost review,” and address several conditions including Type 2 diabetes, heart disease, kidney disease, eczema, Crohn’s disease and more.

Dupixent
Farxiga
Jardiance
Ozempic
Skyrizi
Trulicity



That milestone has been years in the making. Created in 2019 by the General Assembly, the Prescription Drug Affordability Board was slow to launch due in part to a veto from former Gov. Larry Hogan (R) amid pandemic-induced economic uncertainty in 2020 that delayed the board’s formation.
After Gov. Wes Moore (D) allocated funding for the board’s operation in 2023, the entity went through lengthy rule-making to create the “cost review” process for targeted drugs.
Farxiga, a brand name for the drug dapagliflozin, and Jardiance, a brand name for empagliflozin, are the first drugs to make it all the way through the cost review process, which involves collecting data, industry secrets and public testimony from different parts of the health care system to help the board determine if a drug is unaffordable. Four other drugs will undergo the process later.
Del. Bonnie Cullison (D-Montgomery), who has been involved in PDAB-related legislation for years, said that the work of the board is helping to shed a light on the “black hole” of information on drug costs.
“This board exists because we’re watching the cost of prescription drugs escalate,” she told the board, “and we had to get a handle on that pricing.”
“It’s always been a black hole in terms of how the process works through all of the different components,” she said. “And what this board has accomplished, and the staff of this board has accomplished, is to try to bring light to all of the possible data in this chain, to make a determination whether or not the residents of Maryland are getting the best benefit out of their prescription drugs and what they’re paying for.”
Cullison acknowledged that “it’s been an arduous process, but it was arduous simply because you gave every opportunity to every stakeholder to be engaged in this process.”
PDAB staff members reported that the Farxiga and Jardiance wholesale acquisition costs, which is the manufacturer’s price on a drug when selling to a wholesaler, has risen higher than the rate of inflation, indicating a potential affordability challenge.
The board also cited out-of-pocket costs for consumers and state and local spending on those drugs as indicators that there may be an affordability challenge.
The board will now look at options to address the potential affordability challenge, which could include setting an upper payment limit on those drugs. But it’s not clear when the state will see cost savings.
That said, some members of the health care system and the pharmaceutical industry say that policies such as upper payment limits could weaken access to life-saving drugs. Others say that the board has not engaged enough viewpoints from the health care industry.
PDAB weighs diabetes drug affordability, as Moore weighs bill to expand PDAB

“This is a pivotal moment,” Derek Flowers, president of the Value of Care Coalition, said in virtual public testimony. “As the board  makes today’s decisions and looks ahead, we urge you to engage clinicians more meaningfully, evaluate real-world consequences of UPLs [upper payment limits], and more importantly, consider non-UPL strategies that lower costs while improving health outcomes.”
Opponents to prescription drug affordability boards also argue that any cost-reduction efforts will likely not result in lower out-of-pocket costs for patients, but rather create savings for the state. But PDAB advocates counter that freeing up taxpayer dollars by reducing spending on prescription drugs could help support other state-led health programs.
Board members also argue that upper payment limits are just one tool among many to potentially bring costs down for the state, and that they are not required to set an upper limit if it would impede access to those drugs.
Maryland lawmakers this year also approved a law that will let the Prescription Drug Affordability Board expand its cost reduction efforts to the commercial, not just the state plan. That expansion only takes effect a year after the board has successfully placed upper payment limits on two drugs.

Angela Alsobrooks, Reps. Sarah Elfreth, Johnny Olszewski and Kweisi Mfume, Sen. Chris Van Hollen and Rep. Glenn Ivey wait outside ICE offices in Baltimore. (Photo courtesy Sen. Chris Van Hollen's office)Six members of Maryland’s congressional delegation were turned away Monday when they showed up to inspect a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in Baltimore where they said people are being temporarily held for deportation or awaiting court hearings.
Democratic Sens. Angela Alsobrooks and Chris Van Hollen and Reps. Johnny Olszewski Jr. (D-2nd), Sarah Elfreth (D-3rd), Glenn Ivey (D-4th) and Kweisi Mfume (D-7th) entered the George H. Fallon Federal Building, where the ICE detention facility is located.
In a joint statement, the lawmakers said the visit was part of teheri oversight responsibility as members of Congress, and that they were “exercising our legal authority … to inspect the Baltimore federal holding facility, and, if necessary, speak directly with detainees.”
But they were denied entry by an ICE official who told the lawmakers that it was an office, not a detention facility, and that they were not authorized to to enter, even though they wrote the head of ICE and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem last Monday to alert them to the visit.
Despite the claim that it’s just an office, Alsobrooks said previous visits by congressional staffers, and a court brief filed by Maryland Attorney General, indicate that immigrants are being held for several days at a time in “hold rooms” at the facility. Those rooms are designed to hold detainees for up to 12 hours while awaiting a court appearance, but are not meant for longer stays, lawmakers said.
“They are breaking the law in there,” Alsobrooks said. She said the official they encountered refused to say who gave the order to bar lawmawkers from the building.
Eastern Shore pastor detained by ICE transferred to Louisiana facility

A representative from ICE didn’t respond to requests for comment Monday. But Rep. Andy Harris (R-1st), the only Republican in the state’s congressional delegation, derided what he called the “‘sit-in’ stunts for cameras,” after several of the lawmakers saw down in front of the ICE office doors.
“Spare us the show. We stand with ICE and their mission to keep Maryland safe,” Harris said in a social media post.
Alsobrooks did not respond to Harris’ post directly, instead chiding him for not using his influence with the White House to secure federal disaster relie for Western Maryland flood victims, which was rejected last week by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
“We share a responsibility to the people of Maryland,” she said. “It would be great to be able to get his assistance in getting the disaster relief that people need.”
The Baltimore office recently held Eastern Shore pastor Daniel Fuentes Espinal, an undocumented immigrant from Honduras with no criminal record, who was arrested last week and has since been transferred to the Winn Correctional Center outside New Orleans. Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Beltsville resident arrested and erroneously deported to El Salvador before being brought back to in Tennessee, where is currently being held, also started his journey in the Baltimore office in March.
Lawmakers said Monday’s visit was a follow-up to a March visit by Alsobrooks and Van Hollen staffers that found overcrowding of up to 54 people in holding rooms, no infirmary or medical staff on-site, with ICE staff “making sandwiches themselves or buying McDonald’s” to feed detainees.
Attorney General Anthony Brown (D) filed an amicus brief in June outlining the conditions in Baltimore and limited “access to counsel” and “basic hygiene.”
Alsobrooks noted that some of the ICE agents were “walking around that building with masks on. The inhumanity and cruelty is an ongoing theme of the people who are treated inside that building.”
“They’re walking around that building with masks on,” she said. “The inhumanity and cruelty is an ongoing theme of the people who are treated inside that building.”
The lawmakers said that federal law gives members of Congress the “explicit right to conduct unannounced oversight visits to DHS [Department of Homeland Security] detention facilities. No prior notice is required, and no agency has the authority to obstruct that legal responsibility.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Ivey, who traveled in El Salvador in May in an unsuccessful attempt to visit Abrego Garcia, said he wasn’t shocked when was refused a visit there, because officials in that country “don’t have the longest history of democracy there and arguably, don’t have it right now.”
“But this is unbelievable, that they [ICE officials] would turn us away from this building here in the United States … to see our constituents,” Ivey said Monday in a news conference in front of the building. “Not only that, the power of the purse under the Constitution gives us the authority and the obligation to conduct oversight, to make sure money’s being spent wisely.”
Crisaly De Los Santos, director of CASA’s Baltimore and Central Maryland office, called the ICE decision to prevent members fo Congress from touring the building “outrageous.”
“Although federal lawmakers are legally afforded jurisdictional oversight of all ICE facilities, Baltimore ICE unlawfully denied access underscoring that the Trump regime is escalating its denial of restraints and the proper oversight role of the legislative branch,” De Los Santos said. “Imagine, if members of Congress can be treated so poorly by ICE, what is happening in our streets to you and me?”

Wes Moore moves up at the National Governor's Association, and Del. Emily Shetty and Kali Schumitz land National Women's Law Center fellowships.","Ed Hale insists he still plans to run for governor next year, but the lifelong Democrat is not sure what party he'll run in. (File photo by Angela Breck/Maryland Matters)Two months ago, Ed Hale announced his candidacy for governor, with plans to challenge incumbent Wes Moore, a Democrat. Hale said he still plans to file, but he has to answer one big question first.
Will he remain a Democrat?
In a brief phone interview, Hale said he plans to conduct polling later this summer and “looking at what the best path is for me.”
When he announced his intentions in May, Hale, 78 and a lifelong Democrat, said the plan was to challenge Moore in the Democratic primary next year.
Moore is expected to pose a formidable challenge in 2026. He’s a prodigious fundraiser, a frequent guest on national and local TV and radio and is rumored to be a potential 2028 presidential candidate (speculation he repeatedly but so far unsuccessfully has attempted to quiet).
Hale’s entry into the race as a Republican could give him a bit of a leg up if he can parlay his business connections into a powerful fundraising machine. Currently, there are two Republicans in the gubernatorial primary: John Myrick, who previously ran an unsuccessful campaign for U.S. Senate; and Carl A. Brunner Jr., a Carroll firearms instructor.
Another potential entrant is Republican former Gov. Larry Hogan. Hogan has been quiet about his intentions, but speculation persists that he might run for his old job.
Hale said he has no plans to talk to Hogan as part of his decision-making process as he considers a run as a Republican or independent candidate.

He has time. The deadline to file is in February, and the primary election is not until June.
Hale said he hoped to make a final decision about his path and party affiliation later this year before he files.
Hale, who is recovering from “back fusion surgery” said he does plan on attending the Maryland Association of Counties annual convention in Ocean City next month.
Gov., er, make that Vice Chair Moore
Gov. Wes Moore (D) got another title to add to his resume Saturday: vice chair.
More specifically, the governor was elected to serve in that position for the National Governors Association during its summer meeting in Colorado Springs, Colo. The post also make him the association’s 2026-27 chair-elect.
Part of Moore’s duties as vice chair will include leading the association’s work to identify innovative policy solutions through bipartisan collaboration and research. Moore replaces Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt (R), who was elevated to the NGA chairmanship for 2025-26.
Moore will also lead the association’s Center for Best Practices, which conducts hands-on research and development, offers pilot projects and workshops with a goal to create bipartisan policies and solutions for states in 10 areas, including health, infrastructure and education.
Earlier this month, the association and a national nonprofit group called Third Sector Capital Partners selected Maryland, Idaho, North Carolina and South Carolina to participate in a policy academy to strengthen SNAP E&T (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and Employment and Training). The program, slated to run through February, will have cohorts from those states establish an action plan to meet goals to expanding access to SNAP and employment and training programs, provide coaching support and host webinars to engage in peer learning as plans are being developed.
Moore will also work alongside Stitt as part of initiative the Oklahoma governor announced Saturday called “Reigniting the American Dream.” Throughout the year, Stitt will lead a series of meetings with governors, private-sector leaders and “changemakers” with a focus on three policy priorities: unlocking economic opportunity, empowering every learner and energizing the future.
“We all want to create a brighter future for our states, and the nation. When we get together at the National Governors Association, we’re focused on whether an idea is good, not on where the idea came from,” Moore said in a statement. “I’m looking forward to collaborating with my fellow governors to build stronger on-ramps to opportunity so every person in our states has a shot at success – no matter how they define it.”
Shetty, Schumitz in inaugural gender fellowship cohort

Del. Emily Shetty (D-Montgomery) and Kali Schumitz, vice president for external relations with the Maryland Center on Economic Policy, will represent the first cohort as part of the center’s State Gender Policy Collective.
The 18-month program that began this week and ends in December 2026 includes Shetty and seven other state legislators, and Schumitz joins nine other individuals who work at various nonprofit organizations. Besides Maryland, the other fellows are from Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Virginia and South Carolina.
According to a summary of the collective, its goal will be to facilitate peer learning to help fellows grow their knowledge on gender justice issues such as reproductive rights, LGBTQ+ and child care.
“States are on the frontlines of the fight for gender justice, and they are already leading progress by protecting their communities from abortion bans and attacks on LGBTQ+ rights, advancing their own equal pay protections, and investing in child care and Black maternal health policies,” Fatima Goss Graves, president and CEO of the National Women’s Law Center, said in a statement. “We are thrilled to be working with state policymakers and advocates to harness our collective power to restore our democracy in advancing gender justice.”
Schumitz works at the center that advocates annually for various statewide policies that includes health, worker protections and criminal justice. In addition, the center is a member of the Annie E. Casey Foundation’s annual Kids Count data book.
Shetty, who was elected in 2018, had several bills signed into law this year including House Bill 881, which begins a phase-in for 100% of monthly child support payments “pass through to the family” who seek assistance in a Family Investment Program. The bill was also sponsored in the opposite chamber by Sen. Cory McCray (D-Baltimore City).
Shetty, who serves on the House Appropriations Committee, said in a text message Friday on in the fellowship, “It’s wonderful and I’m so honored to have the opportunity to participate.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IMG_0768-1.jpg,,,2025-07-29 02:56:46.069984

Moore asked the Legislative Policy Committee in June to approve the use of $30,000 with the current budget to help cover the salaries of two new part-time contractual employees to handle recruitment and hiring of federal employees, according to an analysis by the Department of Legislative Services.
Since making the request, Moore announced a hiring freeze in most state agencies. The governor is also looking to reduce state payroll through a voluntary buyout program.
House Minority Leader Del. Jason C. Buckel (R-Allegany) said the request is surprising.

	“How can we, at the same time, pursue the hiring of former federal employees, unless they are in those critical positions he’s outlined?” Buckel said in a statement. “That is unlikely. If his administration needs to essentially hire additional staff whose job it will be to hire additional staff, that contradicts any notion about government efficiency. It seems disingenuous to take from state employees with one hand while giving to former federal employees with the other.”
The relatively small amount comes from $2 million set aside by the legislature this year to fund a program to expedite the hiring of federal employees who are fired or laid off. Since February, the state has hired 251 people across all state agencies, according to legislative analysts. But just 7% of those — about 18 people — were hired through the program meant to help displaced federal workers, according to the Department of Legislative Services.
“We have a duty to be good stewards of the taxpayer dollar, particularly in these tight budget times,” Senate Minority Leader Sen. Stephen S. Hershey Jr. (R-Upper Shore) said. “Our taxpayers cannot afford the unsustainable level of hiring the Moore Administration has pursued over the last three years, and they certainly cannot afford a phony hiring freeze.

However, I am increasingly concerned about communications I’m receiving about people in our nation.
To put it simply, it seems the First Amendment, providing us with the right to free speech and expression, is not being upheld with the protection it deserves, allowing foreign entities to abuse domestic residents.

Sen. Saud Anwar, M.D. D-South Windsor
Through my own personal communications, and with my fellow members of the Asian Pacific American Affairs Caucus, I have received troubling reports of United States citizens, including ones in Connecticut, facing foreign censorship after criticizing those countries for their policies. What’s worse, this censorship appears to be working.
In one instance, I am in conversation with a U.S. resident and journalist facing pressure from the Pakistani government for his YouTube videos. In those videos, he criticizes the government’s policies and actions; in return, it is seeking to have his account taken down. The worst elements of this story? YouTube, owned by Google, an American company, appears to be receptive to Pakistan’s demands and is willing to strip videos from the man’s account.
When there is already a significant campaign working against immigrants in the United States — seen clearly in the targeting of non-violent immigrants by ICE and of a number of U.S. residents by federal officials over their past speech — the foreign interference of other nations on American soil represents a further threat to the security of our residents.
In addition to Pakistan, other governments have targeted and harassed residents of the United States. Chinese authorities have targeted critics and activists protesting treatment of the Uyghur people. Vox reported last year that the Indian government has regularly retaliated against academics and critics, including those in foreign nations.
In many cases, foreign governments targeting U.S. residents, especially those focused on their former residents, are going after those who may have left their home countries for better opportunity or to flee oppression, imprisonment or worse. The increasing connectivity of the world through technology, primarily through digital communication, makes it possible for repressive regimes to reach residents directly with threats, harassment and unwanted contact.
Should these foreign entities achieve their goals of silencing dissidents globally, with little or no interference or defense mounted by U.S. officials, what would stop them from becoming emboldened and expanding their approach or actions?
Our nation’s First Amendment provides our residents with the power and right to free speech and expression. International intimidation and manipulation of our residents, especially immigrants who have come here to build careers, businesses, families and lives, is a direct threat to those freedoms. When social media misinformation proliferates but abuse silences those who are speaking truth, we are in a new paradigm – one only made worse by a lack of digital regulation and lack of defense for those most impacted.
When the federal government is failing to act, it is time for state governments to step in and create these protections. We should treat foreign interference and harassment of this type like we treat hate crimes – with serious consequences, not only to stop an abuser but to prevent others from acting in a similar manner.
This year, I introduced legislation to the General Assembly that would update our statutes to require the State Police Hate Crimes Investigative Unit to respond to and investigate reports of repression or targeting by foreign nations against Connecticut residents. This would serve as an important layer of protection preserving the safety and security of our residents, and while it did not pass the legislature in 2025, I plan to reintroduce it in 2026 in the name of those impacted.
There is a reason why immigrants come to the United States: it offers freedoms and opportunities for success unobtainable in other regions, and, for some, a new home safe from oppressive foreign governments. To restore and preserve that strength, I am adamant that we must work to improve our protections.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/protect-the-constitution-e1753227736484.jpeg,,,2025-07-29 00:04:56.766109

What happened to the much-simpler-to-take pills?
Part of the problem is the “pill penalty” that was written into the federal Inflation Reduction Act.
One of the IRA’s most counter-productive measures is its provision that the federal government begin to “negotiate” the price Medicare pays for medicines.
Adding insult to injury, the IRA provides that “negotiation” begins four years sooner for small molecule drugs (that take form as a pill) than for large molecule drugs (that need to be injected).
Truth be told, the IRA’s negotiation process is anything but. The government states what it will pay and biopharma companies can take it or leave it.
There’s no authentic, transparent back and forth and no competition among multiple potential buyers. The most egregious aspect of this brave new world of “negotiation” is that it allows the government to obtain a price that is lower than the cost of all the research and development innovation that goes into creating a new medicine.
Pill penalty disincentivizes R&D
At a superficial level this results in somewhat lower drug prices, but it disincentivizes companies from investing in more R&D.
New medicines save lives and save money. As expensive as a new medicine may seem, the hospitalizations, surgeries, etc., it replaces save the overall healthcare system billions of dollars.
The IRA’s “negotiation” undercuts the patent system that has served us so well. When a person or a company designs something new, novel, unique and innovative they can apply for a patent.
If granted by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, the patent holder has a 20-year exclusivity period when no one else can use the recipe described in the patent without the holder’s permission.
This system works spectacularly well to incentivize innovation and allows inventors to recoup their R&D costs. After 20 years, anyone can take advantage of the innovation memorialized in the patent, free of charge.
As to drugs, the IRA reduced the time after which the government could set prices to 13 years for injectables and nine years for pills.
As common sense would predict, this dramatically disincentivized R&D into small molecule drugs. In 2023, injectables received nearly 50% more venture capital financing than small molecule drugs.
Both established large biopharma companies and smaller early stage biotechs have announced plans to cut small molecule R&D programs and divert resources to large molecule drugs.
Real consequences for patients
This distortion has real consequences for patients. Some of the most critical diseases needing better treatments and therefore more R&D are neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis and brain cancer.
What makes creating treatments for them such a challenge is the blood-brain barrier—the complex layer of cells lining the blood vessels to the brain and spinal cord that act as a shield against substances that could potentially be toxic to the brain.
It’s a challenge to fashion a small molecule drug that can pass through the blood-brain barrier. It’s as close to impossible as it gets to create a large molecule injectable that can make its way across the blood brain barrier.
If we’re ever going to find effective treatments and cures for neurodegenerative diseases, they are likely to come in the form of small molecule drugs.
While the Trump administration announced earlier this year its intention to revise the exclusivity period to 13 years for both small and large molecule drugs, the administration has more recently focused on pushing dangerous ‘Most Favored Nation’ (MFN) drug price setting policies. If the administration’s goal is greater access and affordability, disincentivizing R&D and implementing price restrictions will not get us any closer to that objective. 
Congress should act at once to revise the pill penalty and reject other proposed drug ‘negotiation’ schemes.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-07-29 04:01:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Food security taken from children with celiac disease in a SNAP,Caroline Brauner MD,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/29/food-security-taken-from-children-with-celiac-disease-in-a-snap/,The federal budget reconciliation bill signed into law July 4 only reinforces and exacerbates the food insecurity that children with celiac disease face.,"The American Academy of Pediatrics strongly advocates for food security in all households. They emphasize that “food insecurity manifests itself in…biopsychosocial outcomes, including health, education and economic prosperity.”  Children do not simply feel hungry when missing a meal. The United States Department of Agriculture reports that 13 million children in the United States (almost one in five, and one in six in Connecticut) live in food insecure households.
The health impacts of food insecurity become even more clear when medical conditions rely on a specific diet for its treatment. Celiac disease – an autoimmune gastrointestinal disorder where gluten incites inflammation in the gut- is a great example. 
As someone with celiac disease, I personally manage the strict elimination of all wheat, barley, and rye products from my diet. I am fortunate that I can afford the basic gluten-free bread, pasta and crackers, which can be marked up on average more than 200% compared to standard counterparts. Through working with the underserved pediatric population in New Haven, I am well aware of two things: 1) many families rely on government programs like Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) to afford basic goods 2) celiac disease does not discriminate based on socioeconomic status.
A recent study from 2022 reported that of families with at least one child with celiac disease, 19% experienced food insecurity and 21% experienced “gluten free food insecurity”- meaning they felt unable to consistently access enough gluten-free food. These families were also more likely to have their children intentionally consume gluten due to lack of availability, funds and access to appropriate gluten-free options.
It is well known that intestinal inflammation and resulting malabsorption causes iron deficiency anemia and vitamin D deficiency in patients with celiac disease. A 2022 Canadian study found that less than two thirds of adults who were FI with celiac disease consumed adequate amounts of vitamins A, B1, B6, C, D, K, and minerals like iron, calcium, magnesium or zinc. They also found that only 24.1% of celiac disease food insecurity patients followed a gluten free diet in contrast to 67.9% of celiac disease food secure patients.

Food insecurity on top of celiac disease will only make the outcomes of these deficiencies worse. If left untreated, celiac disease can lead to osteopenia/osteoporosis, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, intestinal adenocarcinoma and infertility. Effects in children can include short stature, failure to thrive, delayed puberty, and damage to teeth enamel.
It is a no-brainer that children with celiac disease– especially those that are food insecure– in Connecticut and across the United States should receive additional financial support to maintain a balanced gluten free diet. Unfortunately, this is not the case. The federal budget reconciliation bill signed into law July 4 only reinforces and exacerbates the food insecurity that children with celiac disease face. 
According to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, this bill will eliminate food assistance to 2 million food insecure children (including those with celiac disease) and slash 30% of SNAP funding over the next decade. Children with celiac disease, one in five whose families already feel food insecure, will be further challenged to afford nutritious gluten free foods, adhere to a gluten free diet, and avoid the serious health complications of associated with celiac disease.

Mike Dunleavy announced his policy priorities for the Alaska State Legislature for when they reconvene for a special session scheduled to start on Saturday.
On Monday, the governor called for legislators to address what he called “Alaska’s chronic education outcome crisis” and to reconsider his executive order they had previously voted down, creating a new Department of Agriculture that he said would strengthen food security in Alaska. 
Separately, the Alaska State Legislature released a joint statement on Monday from leaders of the House and Senate majorities announcing their focus for the special session: two override votes. One would override Dunleavy’s budget veto of more than $50 million for Alaska schools, and the second vote would be on a bill to boost legislative oversight of oil and gas revenues. After the votes, they said they intend to adjourn. 
Dunleavy called the session last month, then asked the 19 Republican members of the House minority caucus to stay away from the session for the first five days to boycott the override votes. This drew outrage and criticism from some members of the House and Senate majorities as they rally support for the overrides, particularly to restore funding for K-12 schools. 
The Legislature is required to take up veto override votes within the first five days of the next session, and 45 votes of 60 members are needed to override the governor’s budget veto of school funding. A lower bar, of 40 votes, is needed to override non-budget bills.
Dunleavy’s office did not respond to a request for comment on Monday about whether he is still asking Republicans to stay away. In a statement posted on social media, Dunleavy said he would be in Juneau when the special session begins. “I invite all legislators to be there to focus on solutions that deliver real results for Alaskans,” he said.
Dunleavy released an agenda with eight items, including an executive order creating a Department of Agriculture to focus on food security for Alaska and growing the state’s agricultural sector.
The other seven items were focused on education policy:

tribal compacting between the state Department of Education and Early Development and select tribes to create better performing schools;
expand the corporate tax credit program for education;
authorize the Department of Education as a charter school authorizer in addition to local districts;
allow public school students to enroll in any public school that has room, including outside of a student’s resident district;
support grants for reading improvement and for a new after school reading tutoring program; 
pass recruitment retention payments to classroom teachers to reduce turnover, especially in areas of the state that suffer from chronic teacher turnover; and
establish long-term certainty in funding for K-12 schools if agreement is reached on policy.

“This is an opportunity to address Alaska’s performance issues and funding issues in K-12 education well into the future,” Dunleavy said in a statement released with the announcement. “By addressing this now, school districts, students, parents, teachers, and policymakers will have certainty and will not have to debate this issue during the regular session that begins in January.”
The Alaska House and Senate majorities have very different priorities for Saturday.
A statement from House Speaker Bryce Edgmon, I-Dillingham, and Senate President Gary Stevens, R-Kodiak, on Monday said legislators will immediately go into a joint session at 10:15 a.m. on Saturday to take up two override votes: “restoring $51 million in public education funding and overriding the Governor’s veto of Senate Bill 183, which affirms the Legislature’s oversight of oil and gas tax revenues.”
“After which, the Legislature intends to adjourn later that day, having completed its work,” the statement said.
Stevens questioned the timing of the session, which is being held when legislators had previous commitments and plans. He emphasized both measures passed with broad bipartisan support. 
“This special session was called under circumstances that raise serious concerns, not only about its timing but also its clear aim to complicate legislative participation. Nevertheless, I urge every lawmaker not formally excused to be present in Juneau to fulfill our constitutional duty,” Stevens said. 
“These override votes are not just symbolic. They are about preparing Alaska’s students, restoring public trust in how we manage billions in state revenues, and maintaining the Legislature’s role as a co-equal branch of government. We owe it to our constituents and the future of this state to show up and do our jobs,” he said. 
Edgmon also called on every legislator to appear in Juneau to participate in the override votes. 
“Alaskans expect us to lead, not walk away from our responsibilities. Families, students, and teachers are counting on us to follow through on the commitments we made during the regular session,” Edgmon said. “This special session is not about partisanship, but about standing up for our students and preserving the checks and balances that keep government accountable. Every elected state lawmaker needs to uphold their constitutional duty, come to Juneau, and vote their conscience.”

Almost half of the 63 million Americans who care for a family member say they struggle financially to do so. (Photo by Bruce Bennett/Getty Images)More than 63 million Americans are caregivers for a family member with complex medical needs, a 20 million increase over the past decade, according to a new report.
But state policies, workplaces and the American health system haven’t kept up with this surge in family caregiving responsibilities, said Dr. Myechia Minter-Jordan, a physician and the CEO of the AARP, which released the report with the National Alliance for Caregiving, a nonprofit policy and research organization.
“Nearly half of caregivers say they face major financial consequences, draining savings, falling into debt or struggling to afford basic needs like food and housing,” Minter-Jordan told reporters on a call this week.
One of the biggest reasons for the surge in family caregivers is that Americans are living longer, yet they’re not necessarily healthier. There’s a 12-year gap between the average number of years that Americans live and the number of years they’re healthy.

The caregiving role typically involves helping a family member with daily tasks like bathing, dressing and eating. But more than half of caregivers also perform more complex medical tasks, such as managing catheters or administering injections, the report found.
A growing number of caregivers are so-called “sandwich caregivers” — parents caring for their children as well as for an adult family member, such as an aging parent. About 17 million people are sandwich caregivers, compared with 11 million a decade ago. And most caregivers are also working a job.
And while the bulk of caregiving still falls on women, 40% of American caregivers are men.
Some states have heeded the growing calls for action.
Earlier this year, Maine lawmakers created a state program to provide respite care, which includes services such as adult day care that give family caregivers a temporary break.
Also this year, Tennessee extended its pilot program that provides respite care for Alzheimer’s and dementia patients, and also passed a bipartisan bill that directs the state Medicaid program to develop guidelines to allow family caregivers to be paid for their work.
Last year, Nebraska passed a tax credit for family caregivers; Oklahoma passed a similar law the year before. And while the United States is one of few countries that doesn’t mandate paid family leave at the federal level, 13 states and the District of Columbia have established their own paid family leave rules.
Meanwhile, the historic cuts to Medicaid enacted as part of the GOP’s Big, Beautiful Bill Act will shift health costs to states, leaving experts worried that family caregivers could lose Medicaid-funded services they rely on.

(Photo provided by U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service)Yukon Flats Tribes and the river system they call home gain nothing and stand to lose everything with the Alaska Division of Oil and Gas’s recent proposal to open state lands in the region to oil exploration. Once again we are seeing outside decision-makers trying to decide our future without our input or consent. The Tanana Chiefs Conference and 42 Interior Tribes have standing resolutions opposing oil and gas development in the area. The Gwich’in Nation and Tribes of the Yukon Flats will continue to demand a seat at the table for these decisions. We have the right to say no when there is so much at stake.
This new proposal comes as Yukon River salmon populations are collapsing. Tribes are in a crisis, banned from accessing the food and cultural sustenance they’ve depended on for millennia. No amount of money can possibly justify endangering the Yukon River watershed, or the Tribes’ health and traditions, all for corporate profits we will never see. The state should be doing absolutely everything it can to protect salmon and the Yukon River watershed, not creating yet another threat.
The ongoing salmon collapse is reshaping life along the Yukon River and is an emergency that cannot be ignored. Industry activity and the climate crisis are having a huge impact on our communities, and oil is a dire new threat—not only to traditional foods but the physical and cultural health they provide. A new generation is already missing out on learning and experiencing their own culture. 
The state hasn’t shared which company applied for a permit, or exactly where this development would take place—the lack of transparency in this process is deeply concerning. 
There is no place for oil development in the Yukon Flats. Not only does it hold life-giving salmon rivers, but it’s also home to intact wetlands and other waterways that sustain communities. Oil and gas exploration would be yet another assault on the health of these communities, lands, and waters, and a gateway to many more problems. An April spill of 1,000 gallons of diesel fuel close to the Yukon River, by a contractor that has supported Doyon-Hilcorp oil exploration near Birch Creek, shows that industry accidents and contamination  are not a question of if, but when. 
The state has an opportunity right now to do the right thing and deny this permit, to show the communities of the Yukon Flats that their rights matter more than corporate profits. The state can support communities’ access to clean water, healthy fish and wildlife populations, to plants and berries, and their right to say no to harmful development. This could open the door to disaster in the Yukon Flats. The state can deny this oil exploration application now, and any others in the future.
The public comment period for this proposal is open until July 30. Click here for more information.

Kopsky's organization is a member of Protect AR Rights, the ballot question committee that submitted its proposal to the attorney general's office. (Sonny Albarado/Arkansas Advocate)Arkansas’ attorney general on Monday certified a ballot title aimed at preserving voters’ right to direct democracy after previously rejecting the proposal twice for failing to meet a new reading-level law. 
Act 602 of 2025 prohibits the attorney general from certifying a proposed ballot title with a reading level above eighth grade as determined by the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level formula. The test uses word complexity and sentence lengths to calculate what level of education is needed to comprehend written material.  
In Monday’s opinion, Attorney General Tim Griffin said the most recent submission from Protect AR Rights ranks at a 9.2 grade level. Griffin certified the ballot title after making “a few minor changes” to ensure it meets the reading-level requirement. He also made “several changes” to the ballot title so it “more clearly and accurately reflects the contents” of the proposed constitutional amendment.
Arkansas ballot measure again rejected for not meeting reading-level requirement

Griffin certified the measure’s popular name as submitted. 
“We were notified today that the Arkansas Attorney General amended and then approved the ballot title for the Arkansas Ballot Measure Rights Amendment,” Protect AR Rights said in a statement. “Our campaign partners and legal team are still assessing the AG’s opinion and its impact on our campaign to protect the fundamental right of every Arkansas citizen to have a say in the laws that impact us.”
With the attorney general’s certification, Protect AR Rights may begin collecting signatures to qualify its measure for the 2026 ballot. Although Griffin signed off on the measure’s popular name and substituted ballot title Monday, he cautioned that ambiguity in lengthy and complex constitutional amendments could lead to a successful court challenge. 
“Significant changes in law often have unintended consequences that, if known, would give voters serious ground for reflection,” Griffin said. “As several of my predecessors have noted when certifying certain lengthy and complex ballot titles, the Arkansas Supreme Court has repeatedly warned sponsors of statewide measures about their ballot titles’ length and complexity.”
Griffin also said he was including a copy of instructions to canvassers and signers that he said must be incorporated into Protect AR Rights’ petition before circulation. 
Canvassers and signers must meet a number of new requirements following passage of several direct democracy-related laws during the 2025 legislative session. 
Direct democracy is the process by which Arkansans can propose new laws or constitutional amendments and place them on the ballot for a statewide vote. Arkansas is one of 24 states that allow citizen-led initiatives, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
Protect AR Rights is challenging some of the new laws in court. A judge last week allowed the group to intervene in a lawsuit filed by the League of Women Voters of Arkansas in April. Protect AR Rights filed its own complaint and motion for a preliminary injunction in the case last week. 
The League is pursuing its own ballot measure to protect direct democracy in Arkansas. Griffin certified the group’s ballot title in May and volunteers having been collecting signatures in support of the measure.
Both groups argue the new requirements make it more difficult for Arkansans to propose laws and place them before voters. Supporters of the new laws have said the requirements will help protect the integrity of the state’s initiative and referendum process.
In its complaint, Protect AR Rights challenged laws not included in the original lawsuit, including the reading-level law and a 2023 law that requires signatures to be collected from 50 counties instead of 15. 
The latter law is part of a separate lawsuit that also involves the League of Women Voters of Arkansas. A judge will consider a motion for judgment in that case during a hearing on Sept. 3 in Pulaski County Circuit Court.

(Photo by Emily Elconin/Getty Images)Amid recent political rhetoric about rising crime and violence in American cities, a new analysis shows that violent crime has continued to decline this year.
Homicides and several other serious offenses, including gun assaults and carjackings, dropped during the first half of 2025 across 42 U.S. cities, continuing a downward trend that began in 2022, according to a new crime trends report released Thursday by the nonpartisan think tank Council on Criminal Justice.
Homicides fell 17% in the first half of 2025, compared with the same period in 2024, among the 30 cities that reported homicide data, according to the report.
During that same period, five cities saw increases in homicide — ranging from 6% in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to 39% in Little Rock, Arkansas.
While the report’s authors say the continued drop in violent crime — especially homicides — is encouraging, they note that much of the decline stems from a few major cities with historically high rates, such as Baltimore and St. Louis.
More than half of the cities studied have higher homicide rates than before the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, though, the analysis found that there were 14% fewer homicides during the first half of 2025 compared to the same period in 2019.
The authors say more research is needed before crediting any specific policy or practice for the continued drop in violent crime.
The group’s findings come as President Donald Trump continues to amplify concerns about crime, at times citing misleading statistics and narratives.

In a Truth Social post earlier this week, Trump claimed that cashless bail — a practice that allows people charged with a crime to be released pretrial without paying money, unless a judge deems them a threat to public safety — were fueling a national crime surge and endangering law enforcement.
He wrote: “Crime in American Cities started to significantly rise when they went to CASHLESS BAIL. The WORST criminals are flooding our streets and endangering even our great law enforcement officers. It is a complete disaster, and must be ended, IMMEDIATELY!”
Some research suggests that setting money bail isn’t effective in ensuring court appearances or improving public safety. Opponents of ending cash bail often raise concerns that released suspects might commit new, potentially more serious crimes. While that is possible in individual cases, studies show that eliminating cash bail does not lead to a widespread increase in crime.
The Truth Social post also marked a sharp shift from Trump’s remarks during a June roundtable with the Fraternal Order of Police, where he claimed the national murder rate had “plummeted by 28%” since he took office — a figure that overstates the decline and overlooks the fact that murder rates began falling well before he returned to office.
According to data consulting firm AH Datalytics, which manages the Real-Time Crime Index — a free tool that collects crime data from more than 400 law enforcement agencies nationwide — the number of homicides between January and May 2025 was 20.3% lower than the same period in 2024.
Similarly, data released in May by the Major Cities Chiefs Association showed that homicides fell roughly 20% in the first quarter of 2025 compared with the first three months of the prior year. The group’s data is based on a survey of 68 major metropolitan police departments nationwide.
Researchers at the Council on Criminal Justice note in their report that it’s difficult to pinpoint a single reason for the drop in homicides, but they note that fewer people appear to be exposed to high-risk situations, such as robberies.
Most major crimes fell in the first half of 2025 compared with the same period last year, according to the council’s report.
Motor vehicle thefts dropped by 25%, while reported gun assaults fell 21%. Robberies, residential and non-residential burglaries, shoplifting, and aggravated and sexual assaults also saw double-digit declines
Drug offenses held steady, while domestic violence reports rose slightly — by about 3%. Carjackings declined 24% and larcenies were down 5%.
Compared with the first half of 2019, before the pandemic and nationwide reckoning over racial justice and policing, overall homicides are down 14%, robberies by 30%, and sexual assaults by 28%.
Still, more than 60% of the cities in the council’s study sample report homicide rates that remain above 2019 levels.
Motor vehicle theft remains the only crime tracked in the report that is still elevated compared to pre-pandemic levels — up 25% since 2019 — although it has declined sharply since 2023.
The council also released another analysis on the lethality of violent crime, showing that while violent incidents have decreased, the share of violence that ends in death has increased significantly. In 1994, there were 2 homicides per 1,000 assaults and about 16 per 1,000 robberies. By 2020, those figures rose to 7.2 and 55.8, respectively.

(Photo Oregon Capital Chronicle)As Montana courts data centers and leaders mull ways to encourage artificial intelligence developments, lawmakers are looking into the state’s power generation capacity as part of the Energy and Technology Interim Committee.
The committee met Monday to determine priorities and also heard concerns and comments about data centers and power load.
Power, especially energy used to help run new technology, was a major discussion point during the session, especially in relation to strain on the electrical grid and impacts to consumers. Sen. Daniel Zolnikov, a Billings Republican and committee chairman, called the issues “tied together.”
And some on Monday said the legislature is running out of time to put guardrails in place before it’s too late to make large, structural changes in how the state will approach the issue.
“I think this is our last chance as a legislative body, ahead of 2027, to kind of address this before it’s completely out of the barn,” Derek Goldman, representing the Northwest Energy Coalition, told the committee. “In other states that have seen large data center loads increase, customers have seen significant impacts in rates. And I really strongly encourage this committee to use its jurisdiction under statute or under one of the existing study bills it has for it to really dig in on the data center issue.”
NorthWestern Energy, the state’s largest energy provider, has been under the microscope in recent years over the rates it charges. 
Since last fall, several new data centers have been planned statewide that are expected to require around 1,000 Megawatts of energy. This includes a 600 MW facility near Great Falls announced in June. 
“Adding this amount of electric demand in Montana will require massive changes to our energy supply and transmission system,” a letter from the Northwest Energy Coalition to the interim committee states. “We must consider all the implications for regulated utilities, customer-owned utilities, large commercial, industrial and residential electric customers in Montana.”
Federal changes around artificial intelligence were also discussed by some in attendance for public comment, including Jesse Luther, who said she was representing some data center companies. The legislature did work on AI this session, but federal changes could mean state changes too, and the technology is evolving rapidly.
“Consistent with the federal government’s implementation of the Build AI America plan, we would encourage Montana to explore regulatory reforms that embrace energy production,” Luther told the committee.
The interim committee has three different studies assigned during the session — one on energy transmission (Senate Joint Resolution 12), another into interstate power grid development (Senate Joint Resolution 21), and a study of artificial intelligence (House Joint Resolution 4).
Work on those studies has to be completed by September 2026.
SJ 21 directs the committee to determine what it would take, and if there are opportunities to better connect Montana’s energy grid to neighboring states. It looks to clarify the legal and economic issues surrounding any interstate compacts. 
The committee may combine efforts for that study, to some degree, with SJ 12, which touches on many of the same issues. SJ 12 is looking at Montana’s current electrical outlook and looks at more specific upgrades and “congestion,” as well as stress on transmission infrastructure.
The interim committee also heard updates from the Public Service Commission, a regulatory agency active in major changes regarding energy in the state. 
PSC President Brad Molnar and NorthWestern Lobbyist Alan Olson traded barbs over several topics. Most of those comments dealt with HB 490, a bill passed this session dealing with wildfire mitigation plans for power utilities. 
Members of the committee also started the process of determining topics for bills going into the next session. The committee is also looking to resurrect several vetoed bills, including one regarding genomics and another dealing with shared solar cooperation.
Cryptocurrency, electronic device privacy, transmission lines and railroad easements were also discussed as potential bill topics.
The committee mixes a number of legislators who have been active in energy and tech policy. It will be led by Sen. Zolnikov, R-Billings, who has spearheaded and crafted significant parts of the state’s tech laws for years. Rep. Becky Edwards, a Bozeman Democrat, will serve as vice chairperson.
Other members include Sen. Chris Pope, a Bozeman Democrat, who is active on energy policy, as well as Rep. Katie Zolnikov, a Republican from Billings who served as Speaker Pro Tem during the session and saw a variety of policy see passage. Sen. Gayle Lammers, a Hardin Republican who carried blockchain legislation, and Rep. Bob Carter, a Missoula Democrat who served on the House’s tech and energy committee last session, are both on the committee, which is eight legislators in total. 
During a brief comment on Monday morning, Sen. Zolnikov said he feels the state has a lot of, “good, well written” tech policy, but some bills — especially some that did not originate in the energy and tech committee — are “not always well written.” Montana legislators did pass a wide range of tech and privacy legislation during the 2025 Legislature.
“It’d be nice, as we start to mature a tech committee, where we try to funnel some of these things in, especially since energy and technology are now the same exact thing. We’re hearing about the massive new technology of AI, well, that uses a lot of energy, and it’s becoming very tied together,” Zolnikov said. “So there were some bills last session, again, some good policies, some good ideas, not always well written, that if they would have gone to our committee, there could have been the work put into them.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/QTS-Data-Center-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-28 20:56:26.520280

The Pennsylvania Game Commission met on Monday to announce the dates for Sunday hunting in 2025. The move came a few weeks after Gov. Josh Shapiro signed legislation to repeal the state’s ban.
From September 14 through December 7, all Sundays will be open to hunting.
“I would just like to say to all of my fellow hunters out there, let’s make this a golden opportunity and do Sunday the way it needs to be done,” Game Commissioner Robert C. Schwalm said during Monday’s meeting. “We need to recruit. We need to reactivate and we need to retain.”
“We can turn this around,” he added. “We finally got this in our arsenal. Let’s make it happen.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Supporters of repealing Pennsylvania’s Sunday hunting prohibition argued that it was an outdated ban that limited opportunities to make it accessible for younger people and those who work on weekdays.
State Rep. Mandy Steele (D-Allegheny) and state Sen. Dan Laughlin (R-Erie) led the bipartisan effort to get House Bill 1431, which gave the commission authority to decide which Sundays should be open to hunting, over the finish line. They celebrated the additional Sundays open to hunting in social media posts.
“The Pennsylvania Game Commission has approved 10 additional Sunday hunting days this season!  This is just the beginning!!” Steele wrote.
“Sunday hunting dates are set. Mark your calendars. Good luck to all hunters!,” Laughlin said.

Migratory game bird seasons are the lone exception, according to the Game Commission, because those seasons are set through federal frameworks and “adding any Sundays at this time would result in a loss of hunting days in 2025-26.”
Prior to House Bill 1431 being signed, three Sundays each year — one during archery season, one during rifle season, and one Sunday selected by the Game Commission — were open for hunting in Pennsylvania, thanks to a law signed by Gov. Tom Wolf in 2019. However, hunting crows, foxes and coyotes had been legal on Sundays prior to 2019.
Game Commissioner Kristen Koppenhafer described the decision to expand hunting to 13 Sundays as a “big” and “calculated, very strategic step,” and an effort in “making sure that we do this the right way.”
“I think what’s important to me, as a commissioner and also as a hunter, is that those are 13 consecutive Sundays,” Koppenhafer said. “So, hopefully it minimizes confusion for when hunting is allowed on Sundays.”
Farming organizations backed the effort to repeal the ban, believing that it can help reduce crop damage by better managing deer population.
Groups and others who were opposed the effort included some hiking and environmental organizations who are concerned that the additional days for hunting will keep non-hunters out of the woods in Pennsylvania.
The Game Commission noted that firearms deer season will still end on Saturday, Dec. 13.
“Many established hunting seasons will continue to close as scheduled on a Saturday,” the Game Commission wrote in a press release. “Sundays must fall between the established opening and closing days of a season to be open to hunting.”

In January, the Game Commission Board will begin the process of setting the 2026-27 hunting seasons.
“Let’s do it in a way that’s meaningful and at the same time, let’s look ahead to next year and say, ‘is this the framework that we want to continue with? Is there opportunity to expand it, or do we need to throttle it back?,” Koppenhafer said.
“For the side of the aisle that says, ‘Let’s go 52 weeks a year, full throttle,’ just respectfully asking you to pump your brakes a little bit,” Koppenhafer added. “And for those that say, ‘Man, I don’t like Sunday hunting, and I don’t think there’s any room for it,’ for them to understand it, that we hear them too, and we’re taking a soft, calculated approach and making sure that we do this the right way.”
Pennsylvania has joined 39 other states with no limitations on hunting on Sundays and allows hunters to take deer, bear, turkey or other game, as long as it’s on an in-season Sunday.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/hunter-field-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-28 20:56:26.520280

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)The Salt Lake City School Board member who prosecutors say tried to bribe his political opponent last year has agreed to resign as part of a plea agreement. 
Mohamed Baayd, 49, won his election as the incumbent candidate for the district’s Precinct 5 in November 2024 — but that following December, he was charged with bribery in elections, a third-degree felony, stemming from accusations that he tried to get his opponent, Russell Askren, to drop out of the race in exchange for favors. 
On July 22, Baayd agreed to a deal that included submitting his letter of resignation to the Salt Lake City School Board, effective no later than Aug. 5, according to a plea in abeyance agreement filed in 3rd District Court.

A plea in abeyance typically means an accused person will plead not guilty or no contest, and will be given conditions to adhere to in exchange for charges being dropped. Baayd’s agreement requires him to pay $1,000 within three months and remain “law-abiding” for six months — after that, the state will move to dismiss the charge. 
Although Baayd was initially charged with a felony, his charges were amended this month to a class B misdemeanor as part of his plea agreement. 
Baayd did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday. In a text message in December after charges were filed, he declined to comment on the case but did tell Utah News Dispatch: “I’m an innocent man, and am entitled to the presumption of innocence under the constitution, and I look forward to my day in court and to continuing to serve the community to the best of my ability.”

According to court documents, Baayd met with Askren, his opponent, in March 2024. During the meeting, “Baayd told Mr. Askren that he knew a councilmember position was going to open in two years and that he was planning to run and had a very good chance of winning. Baayd stated that it was important for him to remain in his current position and asked Mr. Askren to withdraw from the election and allow Baayd to be re-elected,” the charging documents read. 
If Askren withdrew from the race, Baayd said for the next two years he would involve him “in the work of the board and make sure he got to know all of the members of the board and the district superintendent,” the court documents read. “Baayd explained that if he won the councilmember position, he would advocate for Mr. Askren and recommend to the board that they appoint him as a replacement. … Baayd further explained that Mr. Askren would complete the last two years of Baayd’s seat and then be able to run as incumbent in 2028.” 
Baayd told Askren that he wanted an answer by the end of the week, according to court documents, but Askren declined and ultimately ran against Baayd. The two men were the only candidates on the ballot, and Baayd won with 64.2% of the vote compared to Askren’s 35.78%.

Each July, our community observes Disability Pride Month. It’s a time to celebrate our experiences and show the world how people with disabilities move through and experience that world in a variety of different ways and that we live rich and rewarding lives that have value.
We also celebrate the many wins in the disability rights movement with a special emphasis on the Americans with Disabilities Act. Signed into law by President George H. W. Bush on July 26, 1990, the ADA was a major turning point for disability rights that propelled our movement forward.
As part of this year’s Disability Pride Celebration, we have partnered with select public libraries across Michigan to host special ADA pop-up displays. Library visitors can explore a powerful visual timeline of the disability rights movement, learn about influential leaders in the disability community, and discover the impact the ADA has had on the lives of millions. As we said, we have much to celebrate!

Unfortunately, today’s political machinations seem intent to not just stop our momentum, but to push us backwards: drastically cutting Medicaid and implementing arduous requirements, attacking DEI (which, of course, includes people with disabilities) as if diversity, equity, and inclusion are four-letter words, shuttering the Administration for Community Living, the uncertainty around the funding for students with disabilities, a Health and Human Services Department at odds with vaccinations. It is against this backdrop that we observe Disability Pride Month in 2025.
While this is a frustrating and painful time, it is important to remember that we are not in completely uncharted territory. Before its passage, the ADA had the support of voters across the country, but it was not without its detractors. Business groups opposed it, saying it cost too much and would harm businesses, especially small businesses. Greyhound Bus Lines claimed it would destroy public transportation. Evangelical Christian groups opposed it because they did not want people with HIV/AIDS protected by the ADA.  And yet, despite that opposition, we prevailed. And we will prevail again.
The ADA did not solve every issue of accessibility, discrimination, or stigma. There will always be work to do when it comes to protecting and expanding our rights. One of the ways we do that is by telling our stories and being clear about what we need, especially to people in positions of power. In fact, we have an easy way for members of the disability community and allies to communicate with elected leaders about crucial needs: affordable and accessible housing, accessible transportation, and access to mental health care. We must make ourselves heard.
We will not stop fighting for our right to live, our right to be fully included members of society, and our right to the accommodations we need to do so.
We will also not stop celebrating. In the face of adversity, celebration is an act of resistance. It’s a way for people with disabilities to show that we are not weak, we are not defeated, and we are not going away.

Act 624 of 2025 would have banned pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) from holding a permit to operate a drug store in Arkansas after Jan. 1, 2026. PBMs negotiate prescription benefits among drug manufacturers, distributors, pharmacies and health insurance providers, and the biggest ones also own pharmacies and insurers.
Four PBMs, including the three largest in the nation, and the Pharmaceutical Care Management Association (PCMA) filed four challenges to Act 624 between May and June. The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas combined the four complaints into one case.
Both sides presented their arguments to U.S. District Judge Brian Miller on Wednesday. In Monday’s 17-page order, Miller granted the plaintiffs’ request for a preliminary injunction, and the case is expected to go to trial.
Miller agreed with the plaintiffs’ attorneys that Act 624 violates the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution because it “appears to overtly discriminate against plaintiffs as out of state companies and the state has failed to show that it has no other means to advance its interests,” he wrote.

Act 624 preliminary injunction 
“This is true because section one of Act 624 specifically states that its purpose is to eliminate plaintiffs’ ‘business tactics that have driven locally-operated pharmacies out of business,’” Miller wrote. “…Although the state argues that it is merely targeting a form of business structure, this appears to only be a half-truth because the statute discloses that the state is also attempting to protect “locally-operated pharmacies” as opposed to just consumers and non-PBM affiliated pharmacies, including out of state non-PBM affiliated pharmacies like Walgreens.”
Miller called Act 624 Arkansas’ “latest and most aggressive” attempt to regulate PBMs in recent years. Act 900 of 2015 required PBMs to pay pharmacies at least the national average of what drugstores pay wholesalers for drugs, and two 2018 laws prohibited PBMs from reimbursing their affiliated pharmacies in Arkansas at a higher rate than their locally owned competitors. An additional statute prohibits PBMs from excluding a pharmacy from a health benefit plan if the pharmacy “is willing to accept the health benefit plan’s operating terms and conditions.”
Lawmakers, state insurance department officials, independent pharmacists and the Arkansas Pharmacists’ Association have repeatedly claimed that PBMs routinely violate Act 900 and the 2018 statutes, creating a struggle for independent pharmacies in rural areas to remain operational.
However, “based on the evidence in the record, it appears that these laws are sufficient for the state to achieve its stated purposes of curtailing plaintiffs’ business tactics and minimizing the conflicts of interest inherent in PBM-affiliated pharmacies,” Miller wrote.
He also agreed with plaintiff Express Scripts’ claim that Act 624 impedes its mail-order pharmacy’s requirement to provide prescription medication to members of the military, their families and veterans in Arkansas. ESI Mail Pharmacy Inc. is the primary mail-order pharmacy provider for Tricare, the military’s health insurance program.
Act 624 allows the state pharmacy board to issue limited permits to PBMs if they provide “drugs that are otherwise unavailable in the market to a patient or a pharmacy that would otherwise be prohibited” under the law. Daniel Volchok, Express Scripts’ attorney, said last week that this provision is insufficient because it covers only a “subset” of medications approved by the Department of Defense for Tricare participants.
The plaintiffs’ attorneys made several other arguments for an injunction that Miller said did not have merit. In one such argument, an attorney for OptumRx, one of the three largest PBMs along with Express Scripts and CVS Caremark, argued that Act 624 violates the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.
Portions of Iowa’s pharmacy benefit manager law blocked as lawsuit advances

The law, known as ERISA, sets certain standards for employee benefit plans, but Act 624 “does not regulate PBMs in their capacity as employee benefit plan administrators” and instead simply regulates pharmacy licensure, Miller wrote.
An Iowa law meant to regulate PBMs was partially blocked in federal court last week because its mandates of certain cost-sharing arrangements between pharmacies and PBMs potentially violated ERISA, according to the judge’s ruling. Similarly to Arkansas, supporters of the new Iowa law said it would help rural and small pharmacies remain in business.
Miller also rejected the plaintiffs’ argument that Act 624 is an unconstitutional bill of attainder, meaning it imposes a legislative punishment without due process. He said the law does not name specific plaintiffs even though it targets “a very narrow group.”
“While Act 624 is tainted by its protectionist rhetoric so much as to render it unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause, it was not enacted in a wholly arbitrary manner,” Miller wrote.
CVS Health, which includes plaintiff CVS Caremark, expressed opposition to Act 624 during this year’s legislative session and said the law would force the company’s 23 Arkansas pharmacies to close.
In a statement Monday, CVS Health praised Miller’s ruling and said it is “actively looking to work together with the state to reduce drug prices and ensure access to pharmacies.”

Dr. King believed in a nation that could transform from the inside out. So the choice remains as urgent now as it was then.
The post The arc still has time to bend  appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","MARTIN LUTHER KING JR. did not arrive late to the anti-war movement. He was there before the headlines called him “divisive,” before his friends whispered that he’d gone too far, before even the movement he helped birth began to turn away.  
Long before all that, Dr. King stood before the nation and declared that the choice before us was not simply moral, it was existential: “It is either nonviolence or nonexistence.” This was not the language of political convenience. It was the language of a man who understood that the architecture of American power, its bombs, its bases, its brutal indifference, was not confined to foreign jungles. It echoed in the segregated streets of Birmingham, in the poverty-choked tenements of Chicago, in the deafening silence of a government more committed to empire than to equity. 
In recent weeks, almost six decades later, the country stared down the barrel of another global disaster of a war with the military strikes against Iran. Though a fragile ceasefire now holds, the world watched as violence again erupted, underscoring how unresolved conflict continues to reverberate across borders and within us. 
The names of the countries may be unrelated, the locations may be different, but the logic remains the same. America is once again entangled in a region already hemorrhaging from too much history and too little justice. Our drones hum where helicopters once thundered. Our sanctions choke where napalm once seared. And still, we claim the role of peacekeeper, broker, reluctant warrior. 
We must be honest about the moral duplicity here. This is a nation that lectures the world on freedom while banning books that teach its children about the actual cost of freedom. A nation that funds bombs abroad while defunding equity at home. A nation that speaks of democracy in foreign tongues but forgets how to pronounce it in places like Ferguson, Flint, or Florida. 
This is not merely a contradiction; it is a collapse. Because while America projects its might overseas, it wages a quieter war here at home. A war on memory. A war on truth. A war on justice itself.   
The recent passage of the federal One Big Beautiful Bill Act deepens the moral fault lines Dr. King warned us about. 
Signed on July 4, the bill amounts to a sweeping rollback of civil rights protections masquerading as legislative reform—codifying indifference at the highest level. It slashes over $1 trillion from Medicaid, imposes strict work requirements on SNAP recipients up to age 64, and phases out clean energy credits, while simultaneously funneling historic levels of funding into ICE enforcement and military expansion.  
It also dismantles key equity safeguards, including the rescission of Executive Order 11246, which had long mandated affirmative action for federal contractors. These are not abstract policy shifts; they are material assaults on the health, agency, and future of marginalized communities. And make no mistake—when the rights and resources of the most vulnerable are eroded, the whole of society fractures. The assault on some of us destabilizes all of us, deepening distrust, weakening democracy, and shrinking the moral imagination of the nation.  
Just as Dr. King confronted a government that prioritized military aggression abroad over dignity at home, we now face a federal agenda that elevates cultural backlash over civil rights and silences the most vulnerable under the guise of national renewal. As King warned, “justice too long delayed is justice denied.” The challenge now is whether we will be a nation of memory and accountability—or one of erasure and retreat. 
Somewhere deep in the midst of this turmoil, America’s greatness might still be found.  
We can find the capacity to face ourselves and to confront our contradictions with determination. We are a nation that celebrates not one, but two Independence Days with July 4th and Juneteenth—one born in revolution, the other in reckoning. One declares freedom, the other proves it incomplete. 
These two celebrations aren’t contradictions. They’re a mirror. They show us the whole story of who we’ve been and point toward who we still can become. They remind us that the American promise was never finished work, but something we shape with every act of courage, every step toward justice. A nation capable of forgiving itself by not forgetting, but by remembering more honestly, telling the full story, and making whole what was broken. 
This is how we show the world what democracy looks like, not in our military might, but in our moral courage, not in our slogans, but in our willingness to build a country that keeps its promises. We can exercise our First Amendment right “to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances” — nonviolent resistance works if we look across time and the globe.  
On the eve of our country’s 250th birthday, we can show the world that equity is not an afterthought, but an engine proving that shared prosperity outperforms 246 years of chattel slavery. Boston certainly can do this, with the myriad stories told through the many initiatives established to mark the anniversary: Everyone250, Boston250, MA250, and Revolution250.  
Dr. King saw that possibility. He believed in a nation that could transform from the inside out. So the choice remains as urgent now as it was then. Not between nostalgia and progress, but between conscience and complicity. Between myth and memory. Between nonviolence and nonexistence. 
And between the country we are, and the country we still have time to become.

(Photo by Patrick Lohmann / Source NM)The outcome of a legislative ethics subcommittee hearing last week over allegations of harassment against a high-ranking senator remained secret Monday, and it’s anyone’s guess when that information will come to light.
A Legislative Council Service employee accused New Mexico Senate President Pro Tempore Mimi Stewart (D-Albuquerque) of calling her “stupid” and shouting at her following a dispute during the legislative session earlier this year. But because of a carveout in New Mexico’s transparency law, the accused, the alleged victim and the public are left in the dark about the committee’s findings after an hours-long hearing Friday, including any decision if Stewart’s behavior amounted to “harassment” under the Legislature’s anti-harassment policy.
Amanda Lavin, legal director at the New Mexico Foundation for Open Government, told Source NM on Monday that the Interim Ethics Committee’s Hearing Subcommittee is not legally required to make its decision in public. An exemption in the New Mexico Open Meetings Act (OMA) applies, in part, to “matters relating to personnel or matters adjudicatory in nature or to investigative or quasi-judicial proceedings relating to ethics.”
Lavin said while OMA requires committee work on public business to be conducted in the open, meetings about investigative proceedings related to ethics and conduct may be closed to the public.
“There is no requirement under OMA that a legislative committee make its final vote in public, unlike OMA’s requirements for any other public body,” Lavin said in a statement.
The matter stems from a complaint filed by legislative staffer Michelle Jaschke over an alleged incident involving Stewart on Feb. 27, according to a summary of the investigation given during the hearing. Jaschke did not respond to an email Monday seeking comment.
Former New Mexico Supreme Court Justice Richard Bosson, who chaired the subcommittee, said during the hearing Friday afternoon that the panel would issue a written, formal order “in the near future, which will be public, in due course.”
Ethics subcommittee considers harassment allegation against Sen. Mimi Stewart

The subcommittee went into closed session and deliberated for more than an hour-and-a-half. 
The purpose of Friday’s hearing was to make a recommendation to the Senate Ethics Committee, Bosson said. Since the complaint involves a member of the Senate, the Hearing Subcommittee’s recommendation goes next to “the appropriate standing committee,” according to the Legislature’s rules. In this case, that is the Senate Ethics Committee, Casebier said.
According to the Senate’s own rules, the president pro tempore is supposed to chair the Senate Ethics Committee. But since Stewart is the subject of the complaint, the rules require Senate Majority Floor Leader Peter Wirth (D-Santa Fe) to appoint a substitute from Stewart’s political party.
Interim Ethics Committee Co-Chair Sen. Liz Stefanics (D-Cerillos) said the Legislature is handling the matter now because it took time for employment and labor lawyer Lorna Wiggins, who served as special counsel for the Ethics Committee’s investigative subcommittee, to interview the people involved.

Legislative Council Service Director Shawna Casebier told Source in an email that Wiggins’ investigative report “is confidential and has not been released to the public.” “The decision of the hearing subcommittee will be made public once finalized,” Casebier said.
Stewart told Source in a text message Monday morning she had not received the subcommittee’s recommendation.
Source on Monday filed a records request for the report. A records custodian wrote in an email that they would respond by Aug. 12.

(Photo by Izzy Wagener/Minnesota Reformer)One of the strongest data protection laws in the country will go in effect on July 31. 
The Minnesota Consumer Data Privacy Act creates new protections for the personal data of Minnesotans, which includes anything from a person’s name to their search history. 
Under the law, Minnesotans will have a right to know what data a business has collected and a list of any third parties that their data has been sold to. Consumers can edit inaccuracies in collected data, ask a business to delete information and opt-out of a business selling or using targeted advertising with the data. Parental permission is required for businesses to sell or use data for advertising to children under 16. 
“We cannot and should not just think that violations and invasions of our privacy are just the way it is in this modern time. We have a right to our privacy, and we have to protect it,” Attorney General Keith Ellison said at a press conference.  
The law is expected to crack down on data brokers that store and sell personal information. Small businesses are exempt.
Rep. Steve Elkins, DFL-Bloomington, authored the bill. He said he has been working on data privacy legislation since 2019, his first year in office. The bill received bipartisan support in committee and was signed into law in May 2024. As the 19th state to pass a data protection law, Minnesota took inspiration from many other states’ versions. 
The law protects against what’s called data profiling and automated decision making. Minnesotans can now opt-out of profiling — the use of personal data to evaluate or predict someone’s behavior — when it comes to significant issues like housing or employment. 
The Attorney General’s Office will be hiring attorneys and an investigator to enforce the law. A new website — privacymn.com — will provide information on the new protections to consumers and businesses.

Getty Images. Parents trying to overturn a Washington law protecting runaway transgender youth have hit another roadblock in federal court.
A three-judge appeals court panel on Friday unanimously dismissed a constitutional challenge to the controversial 2023 statute, which allows operators of emergency shelters to notify state authorities, rather than parents, when children seek refuge as they pursue gender-affirming care and support services.
The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco upheld a lower court ruling that concluded those challenging the law lacked legal standing to sue because they could not prove they suffered actual or imminent harm from the statute. The plaintiffs who brought the case included several parents whose teenage children exhibited signs of gender dysphoria, but were not runaways, and two nonprofits that oppose gender-affirming care for children.
In a statement, Washington Attorney General Nick Brown’s office said, “We are pleased that the court saw through this politicized attempt to create a case where none existed.”
America First Legal Foundation, counsel for the plaintiffs, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The conservative legal organization was founded by Stephen Miller, deputy chief of staff for President Donald Trump.
State law calls for parents to be notified within 72 hours of their child’s arrival at an emergency shelter unless there are “compelling reasons” not to do so. If there are signs of abuse or neglect, for example, shelter staff are to inform the state Department of Children, Youth and Families, which would take the lead on reaching out to parents.
The court fight is over Senate Bill 5599, which expanded the list of compelling reasons to cover situations when a young person feels they could be subject to abuse or neglect because they are pursuing gender-affirming care or reproductive health services. The law’s passage incensed conservatives, who said it was an attack on parental rights.
America First Legal Foundation sued in August 2023, days after opponents of the law failed to gather enough signatures to get a referendum on the ballot.
The lawsuit argued the statute “deprives certain parents—but not all parents—of their fundamental right under the U.S. Constitution to direct the care and upbringing of their children, as well as their rights to the free exercise of religion, due process, free speech, and equal protection.” 
Miller, in a statement issued at the time the suit was filed, said his group was “leading the courtroom charge against radical transgenderism and the sexual exploitation of our children by militant gender activists.” He added: “No state action more frighteningly illustrates the threat to our children than this law.”
International Partners for Ethical Care, Inc. and Advocates Protecting Children joined the parents as plaintiffs.
After the state responded that the plaintiffs lacked standing, America First Legal amended its complaint to broaden the original challenge. That didn’t work.

It was the word echoed by transit advocates and bus riders outside a Providence union hall and again inside a fourth-floor lecture hall at the Community College of Rhode Island’s Warwick campus, as they urged state leaders to find the money necessary to avoid sweeping service cuts being proposed by the state’s bus network.
But it’s unlikely those calls will be answered anytime soon by Gov. Dan McKee and legislative leaders, who still await final recommendations from a long-overdue efficiency study they asked of the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority.
“Without reform, RIPTA will continue to face recurring budget shortfalls and remain on an unsustainable path,” Olivia DaRocha, a spokesperson for McKee’s office, wrote in an email to Rhode Island Current Monday afternoon.
That response came just a little over an hour after RIPTA finished the first of 12 public hearings on its plans to cut or reduce 58 of its 67 routes to make up a $10 million budget deficit — the largest service reduction in the agency’s 59-year history.
Altogether, RIPTA plans to eliminate 17 routes — a combination of 11 routes and zones where riders book trips in advance, along with half a dozen park and ride connections. Should the agency’s board of directors move forward with the recommendations, cuts would take effect Sept.13.
Outside the Amalgamated Transit Union Local 618 hall in Providence an hour before the public hearing, Liza Burkin of the Save RIPTA coalition said the agency’s plan would effectively shrink a statewide bus system into one focused on metro Providence — with some coverage in Newport.
“This proposal before us is not rightsizing RIPTA, it is decimating our public transportation system,” Burkin said. “Make no mistake, if these cuts go through, workers will lose their jobs, students will not get to class, older adults will not be able to get to the doctor or get groceries.”
That fear of job insecurity is certainly real for Jessica Jameson of Warwick, who told RIPTA administrators at the CCRI public hearing that she relies on the Route 29 bus to get to her job at the Warwick Mall — a route that would no longer run on weekends.
“The security of my employment depends on my availability to work on weekends,” she said. “If all weekend service on this route is suspended, I will likely lose my job.”
Rhode Island AFL-CIO Patrick Crowley, who sits on RIPTA’s board of directors, said at the union rally that the proposed cuts were effectively a “tax increase on working-class Rhode Islanders.”
But Crowley has yet to say that directly to McKee, he told reporters afterward. He said he anticipates a discussion with the governor will happen before the board holds a special meeting to approve the cuts on Aug. 8.
The agitation of transit riders has at least reached McKee’s office, his spokesperson confirmed Monday.
“Constituent Services has experienced an uptick in RIPTA-related calls,” DaRocha said in an email. “Approximately one dozen of them referenced changes to specific routes that would impact them; the majority of these changes were related to frequency of bus runs.”

A bumpy road ahead for transit riders 
Each of the nearly two dozen riders and advocates who attended Monday’s hearing at the community college lamented the incoming cuts, but did not place the blame on RIPTA.
“This is nothing against you,” Devin Guirales of Central Falls said from his wheelchair. “We know it’s all because of the budget deficit that our governor and state has handed the agency.”
In January, McKee’s recommended fiscal 2026 state budget left a $32.6 million crater in RIPTA’s budget. The General Assembly eventually propped up RIPTA with nearly $15 million in annual revenue from an additional 2-cent increase on the state’s gas tax and by upping the agency’s share of the state’s Highway Maintenance Account.
RIPTA administrators managed to reduce the shortfall to $10 million, thanks to what RIPTA CEO Christopher Durand called a “favorable price lock” in diesel fuel, along with a positive market performance for the agency’s pension plan. 
Durand told reporters after the Warwick hearing that the agency is still looking for additional ways to reduce service cuts, but said there are very few options.
“The gap is so big,” he said. “To get the kind of savings necessary to balance the budget, it’s cutting a lot of service.”
But Burkin and other advocates say it isn’t too late for state leaders to infuse RIPTA with  much-needed cash.
One idea is for the Rhode Island Department of Transportation (RIDOT) to shift part of the $35 million federal carbon reduction funds toward mass transit. Another would be to reroute state transportation funds from highway projects to bus service.
But RIDOT director Peter Alviti Jr., who heads RIPTA’s board of directors, does not intend to redirect any of the department’s funding.
“In accordance with the mission provided by the governor and legislature to make RITPA more efficient and right size the agency, RIPTA’s administration will be making an assessment of all options that are available to meet that mission,” Alviti said in a statement.

No immediate legislative fix
It also looks unlikely that the General Assembly will shore up RIPTA’s finances by reconvening in the fall for a special legislative session. 
In separate statements, House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi and Senate President Valarie Lawson both pointed to the spending solutions already in place in the fiscal 2026 budget. Any additional help could depend on the still-to-be-completed efficiency study.
Although portions of the study were made public in the final weeks of the 2025 legislative session, a final report has yet to be released.
A June 16 draft memo from the study suggested reallocating resources away from bus service in rural communities with low ridership to more populated low-income areas, along with more service for Providence residents who commute to jobs outside of the city. 
It also recommended the agency increase its $2-per-ride fare, which has been in place since 2010, but administrators have said they want to conduct a study to analyze impacts of a potential fare increase on “ridership, revenue, and equity.”
“It is not reasonable to commit additional funds until RIPTA completes this study and its current public hearing process in order to develop a plan for a better public transit model,” Shekarchi said in a statement.
 Sen. Mark McKenney, a Warwick Democrat who sponsored a failed resolution to fully fund the agency this year, argued at the union press conference that RIPTA is already run efficiently. He added that the state also finds ways to find financial solutions for local businesses, citing the quick tax code change in 2024 to keep Citizens Bank from moving out-of-state.
“If we come up with that, we ought to come up with funding here,” he said.

July 24, 2025 | Ben Solis/Michigan AdvanceThe Republican sponsor behind the Michigan House of Representatives’ plan to ban cell phones in all K-12 schools said Monday that he is going back to the drawing board to rewrite the legislation – which died on the chamber’s floor last week.
Democratic lawmakers and some members of the GOP House caucus coalesced to defeat the bill July 24 after initial bipartisan support. The measure was even floated by Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer in her annual State of the State address earlier this year, showing a statewide appetite to ban phones in schools.
State Rep. Mark Tisdel (R-Rochester) sponsored House Bill 4141, which would have prohibited cell phone use in schools during instructional hours only. The 53-43 vote on the House floor last Thursday saw nearly every House Democrat voting against the measure.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXIn an interview with Michigan Advance on Monday, Tisdel said that he plans to rewrite the bill before reintroducing it – this time with a strict bell-to-bell prohibition on cellular or wireless devices in K-12 schools. 
The new bill will be based on New York state’s pending bell-to-bell cell phone ban, mandating that devices must not be used for the entire school day. All public school districts there are required to publish new distraction-free cell phone use policies by Aug. 1.
Whitmer in February floated the idea of bringing a school cell phone ban to Michigan, but Tisdel said he has been working on the House’s version since 2023. A lot of that work sought to incorporate input from both sides of the aisle in the House and Senate and other stakeholders.
 With the pending rewrite, Tisdel told the Advance that he was done with the “Mr. Nice Guy stuff.”
“We had it put together, incorporating the best language from all sides … and [House Democrats] played games,” Tisdel said. “If a Democratic legislature and a Democratic governor in New York, a very blue New York state, can see the value in a bell-to-bell prohibition in K-12, somehow that can’t work in Michigan? … If [Whitmer] wants a cell phone bill signed during her term, that’s what it’s going to be.”
Additional resources informing the rewrite include recommendations for the American Legislative Exchange Conference, the Manhattan Institute for Public Policy and Research and the Brookings Institution, Tisdel said.
The conservative, nonpartisan American Legislative Conference leans toward more conservative ideals like limited government, support for free markets and federalism.
The Manhattan Institute is generally perceived as a right-wing think tank, while the Brookings Institution is perceived to be more left-leaning.
Although he’s eying a strict bell-to-bell ban, Tisdel added that he would incorporate exemptions from federal law and would be open to allowances for “dumb” phone devices, like flip phones without broad and user-friendly access to the internet and social media applications.
“I don’t have a problem with that. That was in the last bill, and that was one of the concessions I put in,” Tisdel said. “When you’re using a flip phone, you make the phone call, you hang up, and you put the phone away, because there’s nothing else you can do with it. The problem with smartphones is you never put them away.”
Tisdel noted that he had good working relationships with two Democrats in crafting the original bill, including state Sen. Dayna Polehanki of Livonia and state Rep. Regina Weiss of Oak Park. 
Farhat ousted from key budget post amid GOP standoff and failed Michigan House votes

However, after the bill’s defeat, Tisdel blamed Democrats.
Tisdel said that some Democrats, like state Rep. Noah Arbit of West Bloomfield, publicly supported his legislation. Arbit told The Pulse on Fox 2 Detroit that he agreed with Tisdel that a ban was needed, that he supported the House legislation, championed it being passed by the Michigan Senate and then signed by Whitmer.
Arbit voted against the bill Thursday evening.
Tisdel said he received strong signals of support from Democrats in private conversations, and that he was working with some House Democrats on the legislation to make it a stronger bipartisan effort. He was also forging a deal with Polehanki to get it done in the Senate, even as the Senate was shopping its own school cell phone ban.
Tisdel was not alone in placing the blame on his Democratic colleagues: Michigan House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) echoed some of Tisdel’s talking points when speaking to the Michigan Capitol press corps following Thursday’s session.
A message seeking comment from a House Democratic caucus spokesperson regarding those criticisms, and the alleged broken deals, was not returned at the time of publication.
Several key Republicans who could have moved the measure over the finish line either voted against the bill or were absent from session.
Notably, Republican state Reps. Steve Carra of Three Rivers, James DeSana of Carleton, Jaime Greene of Richmond, David Martin of Davison and Pauline Wendzel of Watervliet were either absent or voted in opposition to House Bill 4141.
The Detroit News reported last week that DeSana was absent from Thursday’s session in protest of Hall not taking up his legislative priorities. Tisdel said he believed that DeSana would have been a likely yes vote.
Tisdel also noted that Martin had an executed absence last week.
Messages seeking comment from Carra, Greene and Wednezel were not returned at the time of publication.
When Tisdel was asked about those defections, he said the situation was unfortunate, but also represented just another day in Lansing with political games aplenty.
He was disappointed, however, in some of his more conservative colleagues who voted against the bill.
“It’s a 2-to-1 legislative layout, the governor and the [Democratic-controlled] Senate against us,” Tisdel said. “We don’t need any barrels inside the caucus pointing at us, as well. It’s just frustrating. I don’t know how this perception got to be that some of these individuals who vote no all the time are the most conservative members. They’re simply enablers.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/DSC_0123-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-28 19:56:58.938781

Governor's Office)On a four-day tour of Germany, South Carolina officials met with industry leaders to tout the Palmetto State’s business-friendly reputation and celebrated 50 years of economic development operations in Europe, a feat that has roots in the state’s once massive textile industry.
Gov. Henry McMaster, joined by the heads of state agencies that oversee economic development, taxes, employment and the technical college system, toured the offices of foreign companies with operations in the Palmetto State.
Stops during their visit included manufacturing automation company Siemens, which operates in Spartanburg; vehicle parts makers Schaeffler (in Fort Mill), and Bosch (in Charleston); medical equipment manufacturer Arthrex (in Pendleton), and Mercedes Benz parent company Daimler, which builds vans in North Charleston.
Along the way, officials also held “confidential economic development meetings” with companies the state hopes to bring to South Carolina, according to Alex Clark, spokeswoman for the state Commerce Department. She declined to give any details.
The governor made similar business calls when he traveled to Germany in June 2024 for a different industry conference, according to Commerce. That trip netted wood paneling manufacturer Homanit, which in May this year announced it would invest $250 million and hire 300 people in Clarendon County.

But this year, the governor’s entourage was much larger, and the trip was about seven times more expensive, with an expected cost of $155,000. The estimate includes hotels, flights, and a banquet. (That compares to $22,000 last year.)
On the final day, the governor addressed some 300 industry and government leaders at the German Chamber of Commerce-German American Business Forum lunch, where he was joined by Senate President Thomas Alexander of Walhalla and House Speaker Murrell Smith of Sumter.
“What we have between you and us is like a marriage. We’ve been working together for so long, making accommodations here and there,” McMaster told attendees of Thursday’s lunch. “And a 50-year marriage, that’s a pretty good run.”
He hinted at turmoil over tariffs without ever saying the word.
“I know there’s uncertainty in a lot of things right now, but it’ll settle down,” McMaster said days before the Trump administration and leaders of the European Union announced an agreement on tariffs.
“I believe that our country is opening up for a burst of economic progress unlike any that we have ever seen,” McMaster added. “And I want you to remember, if you want to do business in South Carolina, the answer to every question is ‘yes.'”
The trip concluded hours later with an anniversary dinner celebrating South Carolina’s 50 years of manning an office in Europe. The delegation flew home Friday.
A history in Europe
South Carolina’s European office opened in 1975 in Belgium, marking the state’s first international presence as leaders sought to attract investment from European companies. The state later moved the office — first to Frankfurt in the 1980s and then Munich, where it is today, in 1999.
It’s an effort that at least one historian says has roots in the Upstate’s textile industry.
In the 1950s, textile giant Roger Milliken, having moved large parts of his operations to Spartanburg, experienced firsthand the American textile industry’s dependence on Swiss and German machinery. He set about convincing these companies to set up shops in the Upstate, according to historian Marko Maunula, who teaches at Clayton State University in Georgia and has written for the University of South Carolina’s Institute for Southern Studies.
How SC’s once-dominating textile industry has transformed to supply new employers

Within a decade, two companies — Rieter and Sulzer — opened American headquarters in Spartanburg. Karl Menzel Maschinenfabrik joined the pack in 1965.
The late Richard Tukey, Spartanburg’s Chamber of Commerce CEO at the time, witnessed these investments and sought to build on that momentum, rallying the business community to recruit German-headquartered Hoechst to build a polyester fiber facility that opened in 1967, Maunula said.
That same year, Tukey flew with Lt. Gov. John West to Basel, Switzerland, to invite the International Textile Machinery Association to hold its next annual convention in Greenville. On the flight home, West has drawn in by Tukey’s strategy, according to a letter he wrote in the Spartanburg Herald-Journal. Returning to Columbia, West sought to implement the strategy statewide.
West and Gov. Robert McNair led a 15-member delegation on a three-week, five-country European recruitment tour in September 1969. South Carolina’s sales pitch included low unionization rates, cheap land and tax breaks.
West went on to make international recruitment a part of his campaign during his successful bid for governor in 1970. A year later, West and Tukey touted the idea at the first Southern Governors’ Conference in 1971, according to the former governor’s letter. (It was under West’s administration — four years later — that South Carolina’s Europe office opened.)
Around the same time, former President Richard Nixon, facing looming inflation, ended the Gold Standard in the United States. This devalued the dollar. Coupled with a 10% surcharge on imports into the U.S., foreign companies began opening U.S. operations, according to Maunula.
Foreign investment in SC
By 1973, Spartanburg County alone was home to 24 foreign corporations employing 4,000 workers.
The strategy got the attention of Georgia, which under then-Gov. Jimmy Carter went on to open offices in Japan and Europe in 1973, two years before South Carolina’s entrance into Brussels.
The opening of South Carolina’s European office coincided with France-headquartered tire manufacturer Michelin beginning operations in the Palmetto State. In the years since, Michelin has expanded multiple times, with 15 facilities across the state, and moved its North American headquarters from New York to South Carolina.
Foreign investment continued with several more European firms, including Swiss electrical equipment manufacturer ABB opening a location in Florence in 1979 and Swiss food maker Nestle coming to Gaffney in 1980, according to the Commerce Department. In 1988, the state saw German companies including chemical maker BASF and clothing maker Adidas, as well as Swiss appliance maker Electrolux. All still operate in the state.
But it would take nearly two decades more before the arrival of BMW and South Carolina beginning its transition into the manufacturing powerhouse it is today.
Since 2011, European companies have invested $16.3 billion in South Carolina manufacturing plants with more than 35,400 jobs, according to the Commerce Department. On a global scale, foreign companies account for 10% of the state’s total private employment numbers.
Today, South Carolina has five international offices: Munich; London; Tokyo; Seoul, South Korea; and Taipei, Taiwan. The state closed offices in China and India in 2023, after 18 years and nine years, respectively. The state also closed several offices in Canada.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-28-at-5.31.42 PM.jpg,,,2025-07-28 18:56:33.874604

The manufacturing industry in Montana hit a growth milestone in Lewistown this month but experienced a closure in Bonner that leaves an estimated 100 employees without a job.
Friday, a vacuum technology company based in Germany opened its new U.S. location in Lewistown.
VACOM drew praise from Montana politicians including Gov. Greg Gianforte, whose office said the new facility represents a $10 million investment in central Montana.
VACOM describes itself as one of the leading European suppliers of vacuum technology.
It also offers cleaning services for components for the semiconductor, chemical and pharmaceutical industries. In those sectors, even tiny contaminants can compromise performance.
In a statement, Gianforte said VACOM, which employs 400 people, “saw something special in central Montana.”
“When companies choose Montana, they’re choosing more than just a place on a map, they’re choosing a state and a pro-business environment that supports job creators and the hardworking Montanans they employ,” said Gianforte, a Republican, in a news release.
Former state Sen. Dan Bartel said VACOM currently employs roughly 12 people in the cleaning sector alone in Lewistown and may hit 25 employees there by the end of the year.
The Governor’s Office said VACOM expects to create as many as 500 “good-paying” Montana jobs and up to 50 “high-tech” jobs by 2027.
The Governor’s Office did not respond to a question about salary ranges or a timeline for expanding the workforce, and representatives for VACOM could not be reached in time for this story.
VACOM has planned an estimated $90 million investment in the state by 2030, according to the news release from the Governor’s Office.
However, on Monday, UFP Industries announced to employees the closure of its UFP Edge facility in Bonner along with an estimated 100 layoffs.
“This is not an easy decision,” said spokesperson Abby Mitch in an email. “We wish this facility had worked out.
“Montanans’ grit and perseverance are among our core values at UFP Industries. We spent 5 years working together to make it work, but big-picture realities beyond our control made consolidation unavoidable.”
UFP Edge described itself as a leader in trim, siding and interior accents and one of the top building materials manufacturers in North America.
“We have committed to our Bonner employees that we will prioritize internal candidates for open positions across the UFP family of companies,” Mitch said in an email.
UFP operates in 215 locations in nine countries, according to its website.
It describes itself as North America’s largest buyer of softwood lumber and works in residential construction, retail building products and industrial packaging.
***
Bartel, who has been in communication with VACOM the last few years as it contemplated locations in the U.S., said VACOM cleans the chips in cellphones as part of its work.
He said Lewistown won the relocation debate for its people, environment and lifestyle.
The VACOM facility was expected to be 40,000 square feet and include a daycare for employees’ children and an education center for staff training.
“They believe that the workforce is here, and it’s the right type of people that they can educate to operate these new high-tech machines,” said Bartel, a Republican and retired Lewistown legislator.
He said the facility will join other small- and medium-sized manufacturing operations based in Lewistown.
“It’ll fit Lewistown really well, and we’re really tickled that they’re going to be here,” Bartel said.
In a news release about its opening, VACOM said it ventured across the Atlantic in 2020 when it opened its first U.S. location in Naples, Florida.
It said the Lewistown site “marks the next important milestone in meeting the growing demand from the U.S. semiconductor industry even better in the future.”
More than 100 people attended the official opening on Friday, VACOM said.
In a prepared statement, VACOM CEO Jens Bergner said the new location sends “a clear signal for long-term growth and transatlantic cooperation.”
“Our decision for Montana was an easy one: Not only have we found a business-friendly environment here, but above all, exceptional people with an impressive work ethic and a strong community.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Outlook-efs5am0p.png,,,2025-07-28 18:56:33.874604

“I know what it’s like to feel like you’re pushing a rock up a hill in the fight for a better life. And families all across Nevada are feeling it, too,” he said. “It feels like the deck is stacked against them. And you know what? It is.

“I know what it’s like to struggle,” Ford said, adding that as children, he and his brother ate stale candy bars, scavenged by his father, a grocery store employee, from the discarded food where he worked. “We weren’t broken but we didn’t have much.”
Ford, a one-time public school teacher, attorney, and former state lawmaker, is serving his second term as attorney general. He has one primary challenger thus far in the gubernatorial contest – Washoe County Commission Chairwoman Alexis Hill, who has yet to formally announce her candidacy. 
Hill, in a statement to the Current, congratulated Ford “on being the Dem insiders’ choice. I look forward to engaging with Nevadans on concrete plans, real solutions and change when I formally announce for governor soon.” 
Ford has been endorsed thus far by U.S. Senators Catherine Cortez and Jacky Rosen, as well as U.S. Reps. Dina Titus and Steven Horsford, who both attended the announcement Monday, as well as fellow Democratic Rep. Susie Lee. 
The state Democratic Party does not endorse candidates in a primary election. 
“As the party chair, I’m happy when anyone gets in the race,” Assemblywoman Danielle Monroe-Moreno, who attended the event, told the Current. “If Alexis invites me, I’ll be there. I know Alexis. I love Alexis’ family.” 
The winner of the primary will likely face Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo, who is seeking a second term.
Monroe-Moreno identified the harm that will come to Nevadans as a result of President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act as Lombardo’s greatest vulnerability.
Ford never mentioned his primary opponent and took aim directly at Lombardo, who he said “has been kowtowing” to Trump while Ford has been taking the administration to court. “I sued both Trump and the Biden administration. It doesn’t matter what side of the aisle you’re on. If someone hurts Nevada families, I’m not backing down.” 
Ford noted that Lombardo, when asked by a reporter about the impact of Trump’s tariffs, said Nevadans “‘may have to feel a little pain.’ Can you believe that our governor wants families to feel pain while he caters to the powerful? Well, thanks to Joe Lombardo and Donald Trump, there’s plenty of pain to go around.”
Ford criticized Lombardo for enlisting a Republican lawmaker to kill legislation that would have limited home buying by out-of-state corporations, whose purchases jack up the prices in Nevada neighborhoods. Under Lombardo’s watch, he added, Nevada has had the highest unemployment rate in the nation while job growth lags other states.   
“The governor said that we should be excited about Trump’s betrayal of a tax bill, excited that it’s going to blow a hole in our state budget; that it’s going to rip healthcare away from over 100,000 Nevadans; that two of our rural hospitals will have to close or to cut essential services,” Ford said. “Maybe we should be excited about slashing SNAP benefits for more than a half a million Nevadans to rely upon.” 
As the single father of an infant while in college, Ford says food stamps kept him and his young son “from going hungry.” 
Ford promised that if elected, he’ll bring prescription drug prices in line with Medicaid’s negotiated prices. He also vowed to hold corporations accountable for price fixing. Lombardo vetoed a bill this year championed by Ford that would have prohibited price-gouging for essential goods and services such as housing, pharmaceuticals, and energy. 
He also promised free school lunches for all Nevada students. 
Ford’s chances of defeating Lombardo could depend on whether Trump-weary voters galvanize during the midterm election next year to generate a blue wave in purple Nevada.
According to his campaign, in 2022, Ford won more votes than any candidate in Nevada midterm history, easily winning re-election in a race against Republican firebrand Sigal Chattah.
NBC News has labeled Lombardo as the most vulnerable Republican governor seeking reelection next year. The governor’s support for Trump’s deportation policies could erode his support among Latino voters, an essential voting bloc in the state.
“It’s breathtaking to see a candidate who speaks our language,” state Sen. Fabian Doñate said of Ford, who briefly addressed the crowd in Spanish.
Doñate, who has endorsed Ford, said he considered the wisdom of making a commitment at this early stage of the race, but says he likely would have heard from other interested candidates.
Ford, he said, “has always shown up for our community. He’s always had an open door for me.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/D00A70BE-9A10-4831-8006-43DCC56DF085-scaled-e1753742610596-1024x667.jpeg,,,2025-07-28 18:56:33.874604

Steve Womack of Arkansas proposes more than $147 million in earmarks for transportation and water system improvements, along with other projects.
The bill, which proposes fiscal year 2026 spending appropriations for the U.S. Departments of Transportation, and Housing and Urban Development, has not yet been voted on by the full House of Representatives. The House is currently in recess and not set to return until after Labor Day.
A significant number of the proposed earmarks are for a variety of water system and infrastructure projects concentrated in Womack’s Northwest Arkansas district, with a handful of other projects in two of the state’s other congressional districts.
The city of Tontitown would receive $12.2 million to construct a gravity sanitary sewer system, according to a news release from Womack’s office.
Tontitown Mayor Angela Russell said in the release that the city was grateful to receive the funding. The new sewer system will enable the town to improve its infrastructure and support growth, she said.
“This project is a significant development for our community,” Russell said.
Northwest Arkansas has seen decades of rapid growth that has strained wastewater systems in the region, leading the Arkansas Department of Health to stop approving new residential development in some areas.
Mountainburg, a city in Crawford County, would receive $4.4 million for improvements to the North Central Crawford County water system — something Mayor Susan Wilson described as “a pipe dream” previously.
“Thanks to this funding, safe and clean drinking water will be available to more residents in our region than ever before,” Wilson said in the release.
The Arkansas Department of Transportation stands to be the biggest beneficiary of the earmarks, should they become law. The bill proposes $59 million for the Springdale Northern Bypass, plus several million for highways and planned future interstate projects.
ARDOT Director Jared Wiley said in a news release that Womack’s “tireless support” as the chairman of the House Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing and Urban Development and Related Agencies for the state’s road projects has been “instrumental in securing tens of millions in Community Project Funding” for projects in the state.
In total, at least $26 million will go toward various water and sewer projects in the state, should the appropriations bill pass. But such an amount would likely do little to dent a multibillion-dollar problem faced by Arkansas’ deteriorating water and wastewater systems. State legislators such as Rep. DeAnn Vaught, R-Horatio, have warned that even the millions in funding appropriated to and by the state to address the problems facing systems thus far is a drop in the bucket compared to the vast need, which falls particularly hard on rural water systems that have fallen behind on upgrades and maintenance as population bases shrink and costs grow.
According to the American Society of Civil Engineers’ 2025 Report Card for America’s Infrastructure, Arkansas faces $7.7 billion in total needs for drinking water infrastructure, plus another $3.1 billion for wastewater infrastructure. Those numbers include anticipated investments and the projected funding gap.
Arkansas has made moves to address the problems, passing laws that require rate studies by water and wastewater systems and creating a new loan program for “shovel-ready” projects.
The Arkansas Natural Resources Commission approved $13.6 million in loans and grants at the end of May, with $7 million of that going to the city of Sherwood to rehabilitate parts of its wastewater system.
 The following projects to be funded in Arkansas’ Third District if the federal appropriations bill passes as-is 

Springdale Northern Bypass construction — $59 million
Future Interstate 49 construction — $3 million
Arkansas Highway 112 improvements — $3 million
Northeast Benton County Volunteer Fire Department fire station improvements — $1.25 million
Benton County Water District #1 PWA of Arkansas for water system improvements — $1.75 million
City of Elkins water system improvements — $3.75 million
City of Farmington bridge repairs — $6.5 million
City of Fort Smith water system improvements — $3 million
City of Huntsville water system improvements — $3 million
Mercy Hospital Berryville to establish an MRI unit — $1.376 million
City of Mountainburg water system improvements — $4.4 million
City of Mulberry to update the Mulberry Community Food Pantry — $500,000
City of Pea Ridge for a new fire station — $2.75 million
Springdale Water Utilities water system improvements — $3 million
City of Tontitown water system improvements — $12.2 million

After four months without a voucher, she may receive enough financial help to put her kids in a day care closer to home. She might be able to afford her own home for her family with the money saved.
After months of halted assistance and thousands of Mississippi parents losing their child care vouchers – and with it, their access to day care for their children — the state is issuing vouchers again.
Ford spent $11,000 on day care just over the last few months – and was forced to move in with in-laws.

“Giving up is not an option,” she said. “I would love the help. You have to be making money to survive in this economy.”
In April, Ford was denied a voucher renewal along with thousands of other families because she did not meet one of the six criteria the Mississippi Department of Human Service set. Those criteria were: being a recipient of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, being deployed in the military, being a guardian to a foster child, being homeless, being a parent of a special needs child and being a teen parent. 
For some families, these restrictions now no longer apply.
The pause to the pause, the result of the loss of coronavirus pandemic-era funding, was made possible by a direct legislative appropriation to the Child Care Payment Program administered by the department. The agency had asked for $40 million to continue serving the same number of families, but instead received $15 million.
This means, despite announcing that the agency is now taking applications from families on its waitlist, the program is not likely to be stabilized or capable of serving as many children as it did prior to the pause.
Carol Burnett, executive director of the Mississippi Low Income Child Care Initiative, speaks about a policy change by the Mississippi Department of Human Services, that removed a child support requirement for the Child Care Payment Program, at a news conference Monday, May 15, 2023, in Jackson, Miss. (AP Photo/Rogelio V. Solis)
“We’re going back to a time where I think we are going to see a waiting list reappear and the thing about the waitlist is if you’re on the waitlist, you don’t ever know how long you’re going to be there,” said Carol Burnett, director of the Mississippi Low-Income Child Care Initiative, which has been advocating on behalf of child care supports for decades. “So it’s wonderful the pause is over and DHS has met whatever criteria they needed to eliminate the pause.”
The previous restrictions eliminated working parents that weren’t TANF recipients. For middle class parents forced to take on child care’s extra costs and fees this summer, leaving the wait list can mean financial security.
Vennesha Price’s biggest expense each month is child care, which includes the gas money needed to travel further for the care.
“For single, struggling parents or single parents that are considered middle class like myself, who do not meet certain low-income requirements, I’m just on my own whether I have the money or not,” she said.
Mississippi receives a little over $129 million through the federal block grant that primarily funds the program, the Child Care Development Fund, in 2024, an increase of about $31 million from 2020. Child care in Mississippi received a bump of more than $600 million during the pandemic, one way the state was able to increase the rolls in recent years.
The child care payment program has only ever served a fraction of eligible children – over 139,000 across the state, according to some estimates. 
In March before the pause began, more than 36,000 children received the voucher. The state currently serves just under 29,000 children, according to the agency.
In years past, the number of children on the rolls hovered around 20,000–in part because of a child support enforcement requirement that the agency rescinded in 2023. 
In 2017, during a notorious five-year period where the agency was approving no new vouchers, there were 21,000 children on the waitlist.
More children served
Through the mostly federally-funded voucher, the state pays up to 80% of a child’s tuition to a qualified provider, with the parent covering the rest. Every three years, the department is required to conduct a market rate survey to ensure its voucher reimbursement rate corresponds to the 75th percentile of the market rate for the different age groups.. 
Weekly rates increased from 2021 to 2024, with variations depending on whether the recipient is in a metro or nonmetro area and the age of the child, since infant care is more expensive. Infant care in the metro area increased from $152 to $185 per week while school- aged care increased from $130 to $135.
Considering these rates, the current annual value of the voucher for infants in a metro area is about $7,700 and $5,600 for school aged children. For nonmetro areas, the state spends about $5,800 and $5,000, respectively. 
The extra state support of $15 million, then, might support roughly 2,500 vouchers for the year, depending on the circumstances of the children who are approved, based on Mississippi Today’s calculations.
That’s only half of the roughly 5,000 children sitting on the waitlist for assistance, according to the agency.
“I’m hoping that it will provide more opportunity for parents,” said Kacheela Dixon, owner of Steppin Up Learning Center in Jackson, Mississippi. “If the parents do sign back up with the vouchers, it will help hire more teachers and pay for more food.”
Dixon might still have to shut her business down in the next couple months unless enrollment increases. The cost of running her business has increased, too. Many of the children rely on her day care for supper.
For day care operator Sherica Lewis, the halt to the freeze might come too late.
She serves less than half the children she did before the child care freeze. She’s had two families with at least three children move to Southaven and Louisiana from Greenville, where her business is based. 
“It’s not going to benefit me as much,” she said. “I already lost the kids and families.”
The families moved to be closer to their extended family that can provide free child care. 
The Department of Human Sservices is also currently accepting proposals for workforce support subgrants under the TANF program that could include child care services. This has the potential to increase access for families without the voucher without requiring more funding for the child care certificate program.
Day care operator Kaysie Burton has been filling out grant applications herself. She saw how day care afforded working parents in her community the opportunity to focus on their careers.
“We want to help Mississippi keep working,” she said. “We’re trying to make sure our hours are tailored to our parents.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/24132111/Child-Care-Providers-presser-5.jpg,,,2025-07-28 18:56:33.874604

An estimated 23 percent of Mississippians are fully vaccinated against COVID-19, and the Mississippi State Department of Health has reported a total of 334 new cases with the numbers currently trending up.

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)Between 2016 and 2022, as congenital syphilis cases rose nationally and especially in the South, Mississippi saw a one thousand percent increase — from 10 to 110 — in the number of newborn babies who were hospitalized after contracting the disease, known to cause developmental issues, intellectual disabilities, and even death.
So in 2023, the state Department of Health mandated that all medical practitioners screen for the disease in pregnant mothers, and it has been running advertisements to spread awareness.
Annual congenital syphilis cases in Mississippi rose from 62 in 2021 to 132 in 2023, according to state data. The number fell to 114 last year. There have been 33 cases so far this year.
That work won’t stop despite potential budget cuts, Dr. Daniel Edney, Mississippi’s state health officer, said in an interview. “We’re going to keep doing what we have to do, you know, to keep it under control.”
State by state, public health departments take a similar approach: They monitor, treat and try to stem preventable diseases, alongside their host of other duties. But in the coming year, health department officials — with their agencies already strapped for cash — fear they’ll find it much more difficult to do their jobs.
President Donald Trump’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2026 would cut the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention budget by more than half, from $9.3 billion to $4.2 billion. The proposal serves as a wish list from the administration, a blueprint for the Republican-controlled Congress as it works through upcoming spending legislation.
If lawmakers hew to Trump’s vision, then state and county public health departments would be hit hard. States contribute to their own health departments, but a lot of them rely heavily on federal funding.
And around half of local public health department funding comes from federal sources, primarily the CDC, as noted in a 2022 report from the National Association of County & City Health Officials.

“The federal government provides a lot of funding, but the actual implementation of public health programs happens at the state and local level,” said Josh Michaud, associate director of global health policy at KFF, a health policy research group. “Each state has its own approach, in many ways, to how public health programs are overseen, how they’re funded, how they are implemented.”
In announcing his department’s share of the proposed budget, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said Trump’s goals align with “new priorities in reversing the chronic disease epidemic.”
But many local health leaders point to the longtime mission of state public health departments in preventing the spread of disease.
“Local public health is on the front lines preventing communicable disease, operating programs to prevent chronic disease, ensuring our septic and well water systems are safe,” said Dr. Kelly Kimple, acting director of North Carolina’s Division of Public Health within the Department of Health and Human Services.
“I’m very concerned,” Kimple said, “especially given the magnitude of funding that we’re talking about, as we can’t keep doing more with less.”
Clawing back COVID-era grants
Other federal budget cuts also have states worried.
Many state public health departments grew alarmed when the Trump administration announced in March that it would be clawing back $11.4 billion in COVID-era funding for grants that were slated to extend into 2026.
Twenty-three states and the District of Columbia sued. A federal district court in Rhode Island temporarily blocked the cuts, and the case remains tied up in court.
The court’s preliminary injunction may not protect temporary staff or contractors, though. Public health departments have been laying off staff, cutting lab capacity and reducing immunization clinics, said Dr. Susan Kansagra, chief medical officer for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.

Historically, public health departments receive funding in “boom and bust” cycles, meaning they tend to get more federal support during emergencies, said Michaud, of KFF. But “since the Great Recession of 2008, there was a general decline in public health support funding until the COVID pandemic.”
For example, KHN and The Associated Press reported that between 2010 and 2019, spending on state public health departments declined by 16% per capita and spending for local health departments fell by 18%.
Nationally, syphilis cases reached historic lows in the 2000s, thanks to robust prevention efforts and education from public health officials. By 2022, however, cases reached their highest numbers nationally since the 1950s.
“In the wake of the COVID emergency, you’ve seen a sort of backlash to what people had been calling the overreach of public health and imposing vaccination requirements and lockdowns and other public health measures,” Michaud told Stateline.
Smallpox, cholera and typhoid
Public health departments and officials go back to the 19th century, when there was a greater emphasis on sanitation efforts to prevent spread of diseases such as smallpox, cholera and typhoid, which were rampant at the time.
By the end of the century, 40 states had established health departments, which to this day are responsible for water sanitation, tracking the spread of disease, administering vaccinations, furnishing health education, providing screenings for infants and some prenatal care for moms at local clinics, offering family planning services, and tracking and treating sexually transmitted infections, among other things.














What we're seeing now is a complete upheaval of the funding going into public health. 


– – Josh Michaud, associate director of global health policy at KFF





Kimple pointed to measles as a current example of a disease that’s spreading fast. When North Carolina’s health department detected a case in the state, she said, the department “identified and contacted everyone who might have been exposed, helped people get tested, worked with doctors to make sure they knew how to respond.”
That’s the legacy of local public health, Michaud said.
“The federal government cannot decide, ‘This public health program will happen in this state, but not that state,’ that kind of thing. And cannot declare a national lockdown. The COVID pandemic tested a lot of those boundaries. It really is a state and local responsibility to protect public health. And that’s always been the case, since the beginning of our country,” Michaud said.
“And what we’re seeing now is a complete upheaval of the funding going into public health.”
A major cut in services
Kimple said she’s seen recent progress in her state in the support for funding public health.
“North Carolinians viewed our work as highly important to improving health and well-being in the state, and appreciated the local presence, the reliable information, the role in prevention and efforts to protect, in particular, vulnerable communities,” she said.
Similarly, Edney said that Mississippi state lawmakers were showing more support, despite some setbacks in 2016 and 2017. New federal cuts could throw a wrench in the health department’s economic plans and its ability to reach small communities.
“Now the federal rug is being pulled out from under us,” he said.
Edney said he expects the federal share of his department’s public health funding to fall from its current 65% to around 50%.
Edney said he’s been trying to strengthen Mississippi health department’s longevity by diversifying its revenue streams by, for example, accepting private donations.
The state will not stop doing its “core” work, he said, regardless of federal funding.
“We’re not going to cut back on services at the county health department, because what we do now is all mission critical,” Edney said.

Members of the Lapeer District Library Board agreed to move their regular meeting time at its most recent meeting, from 5:30 p.m. to 10 a.m. on the third Thursday of each month. 
The move has been viewed by some as a way to prevent community members from fighting against a rash of book challenges that began in 2023 and following the election of several members with conservative ideologies, who have come to hold a majority of seats on the nonpartisan board. Some of those members have ties to the book challenges in question.
The board first proposed the idea of changing its meeting location and time during its June meeting, with board member Carol Brown noting she is frequently late to a meeting she has scheduled after the library board meetings. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXVice Chair John DeAngelis raised issues with the board’s current meeting place, the Lapeer Center Building, saying the building had heating issues in the wintertime and leaked when it rained. He offered the American Legion Hall in Lapeer as an alternative, but noted that their current meeting time slot was unavailable due to a standing meeting at the hall every Thursday. 
With the board’s treasurer Perry Valle raising concerns about transparency and board chair Kari Kohlman proposing the board look into alternative locations, the matter was tabled.
However, at the board’s July meeting, no alternative locations were discussed, with DeAngelis bringing a motion to move the board meeting to 10 a.m. at the American Legion.
Despite protest from Valle and board member Bonnie Lawrence, DeAngelis’ motion – and the promise of no leaks, air conditioning and heat in the winter – prevailed.
“I think that if you change the meetings to 10 o’clock in the morning, you’re stabbing the general public in the back,” Valle said, “I think that’s what your purpose is.”
Karen Braschayko, a member of Fight For the First Lapeer, which advocates against censorship within the library district, said the board’s argument about facilities issues was a thinly veiled attempt to reduce the crowd size at meetings.
“It’s just my personal belief that they are trying to keep people like me from going,” Braschayko said. “I won’t be able to go unless they take a morning off of work or a day off of work, really.”
While Secretary Peggy Brotzke noted there’s nothing to say the board cannot change the meeting time if they see a drop in public participation, Braschayko said there’s no reason to take the board at its word. She also said that Fight For the First Lapeer would continue to have a presence at the 10 a.m. meetings. 
“We will find all of our retired friends or people with flexible schedules to show up at those meetings and speak, but it excludes people like me,” Braschayko said, noting that 84% of workers in the U.S. work a regular daytime schedule. 
Community activists have been on high alert, pointing to a memo from the board’s former attorney, Anne Seurynck, examining potential strategies to keep minors from accessing certain books, including placing books in an adult’s section, or putting certain books behind glass or a circulation desk.
Lapeer library board mulls age restrictions on materials despite shaky legal ground 

Though Seurynck advised against adopting any of the proposals warning they would place the library on “at best, shaky Constitutional ground” some members of the board have continued to look for ways to keep children from accessing books without running afoul of the law. 
During a March meeting of the Lapeer Tea Party, attendees asked the board’s DeAngelis and Brotzke about efforts to limit children’s access to some books. While unable to offer specifics on potential restrictions, DeAngelis said the board would be working with its attorney. When asked for a timeline for potential options, he offered six months, emphasizing that the board was not looking to get sued.
In an interview with Michigan Advance on Wednesday, DeAngelis said the decision was ultimately based on the availability of board members and their attorney, the time conflict with the Young Marines at the American Legion and the issues with the facilities. 
However, Lori Sawatzke, the building manager for the Lapeer Center Building, told the Michigan Advance she was never informed of any issues with the building. 
“Kara [Haight], the [library’s] assistant director, she would come over every Thursday, the day of their meetings, and get the key from me,” Sawatzke said. “She never once said, ‘Hey, it’s cold in that room,’ or ‘It’s hot in that room.’ Nothing.”
When asked if he had any concerns about the change in meeting time affecting transparency or attendance, DeAngelis said no.
On members’ push to protect children from books members feel are inappropriate, DeAngelis said the board would follow the law where it takes them, emphasizing that they do not want to be sued. 
“We’re not going to do anything like that unless it’s absolutely legal, above board,” DeAngelis said.
DeAngelis also expressed concerns that disputes with members of Fight For the First could lead to the board losing its millage.
Efforts to restrict or protect libraries both grew this year

Government transparency is important, especially when dealing with controversial matters, said Jay Kaplan, a longtime attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan’s LGBTQ+ project. 
While Kaplan said the decision to change a meeting from the evening to the morning wouldn’t violate the Open Meetings Act, which governs public  access to meetings, transparency and the ability for the public to respond to the board’s actions remains vital.
“The idea and the purpose of what some of these library board members are trying to do is to censor materials that they don’t like. That raises serious Constitutional concerns,” Kaplan said. “I would ask them if, indeed, they feel what they’re doing is above board. If there’s an effort to try to limit public input or public knowledge about what’s going on, what are they hiding from?”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ry5DR-0g-1024x680.jpeg,,,2025-07-28 18:56:33.874604

(Courtesy of the Sioux Falls School District)If South Dakota’s average teacher salary matched the state’s target teacher salary, the state would have ranked 38th in the nation this year for average teacher pay.
Instead, it ranked 46th at an average salary of $56,328, according to the 2025 National Education Association teacher salary report.
The target teacher salary isn’t actually the state’s goal for average teacher pay. In reality, it’s a basis for the state’s public education funding formula. Funding determined by the formula goes not just toward teacher salaries, but also toward overhead costs and salaries for other school workers. 
In recent years, the gap between the target teacher salary and the average teacher salary in South Dakota widened. The target teacher salary for the 2023-24 school year, which is what the latest rankings are based on, was $59,659.


In addition to climbing the ranks in teacher pay if the target salary was reached, South Dakota would have risen above neighboring states Montana and North Dakota.
Members of the state Teacher Compensation Review Board learned more about the rankings during their Monday meeting in Pierre. The group is required to meet each year by law to review teacher compensation compared to surrounding states and report the findings to the governor and Legislature.
Going forward, lawmakers hope to see progress in teacher pay due to a law passed by the 2024 Legislature that sets a minimum teacher salary and mandates increases in average teacher compensation in school districts nearly equal to increases in state education funding. About 95% of South Dakota school districts met the state’s mandated minimum $45,000 salary last school year.
Board member Sen. Taffy Howard, R-Rapid City, said she wants to see the new legislation “play out” before the board recommends further changes to adjust or improve teacher compensation.
Board turns its attention toward teacher retention, student behavior
Howard and other board members called for ways to improve teacher job satisfaction and address one of the leading reasons teachers leave the profession: behavior problems among students.
South Dakota Department of Education data presented by Caitlin Scott of Marzano Research showed that the teacher turnover rate in South Dakota is higher than most surrounding states. About 16% of teachers in April 2024 reported that they no longer taught at the same school. North Dakota was the only surrounding state with higher numbers at 23% turnover.
Elementary and music teacher vacancies were higher than average at the beginning of the 2023-24 school year, according to the data. Ahead of the 2024-25 school year, math and science teachers were revealed as having high vacancy numbers. Overall vacancies as of June of this year stood at the second lowest number since 2019 at 144 vacancies throughout the state, according to the Associated School Boards of South Dakota.
US Education Department to unfreeze contested K-12 funds

Board members discussed student-teacher ratios, funding for schools and incentives for school districts and teachers to better address student proficiency and behavior problems.
Howard told board members she’d prefer to see a list of recommendations from local school districts, rather than “unfunded mandates” from the Legislature, especially as the state faces a $24.5 million shortfall in projected revenue.
“I would like us, if it’s a purview of this committee, to try and focus more on how we can make the teacher’s life better in the classroom and in the school,” Howard said. “Because we don’t necessarily have a lot of money to throw at this.”
Howard told South Dakota Searchlight after the meeting that finding ways to address teacher retention and student behavior is a form of compensation.
“Does it always have to be a monetary form of compensation?” Howard said. “Or can we do other things to compensate them by making their life better in the classroom in general?”
South Dakota Department of Education Secretary Joseph Graves said he plans to follow up with board members on their concerns and prepare recommendations for the board’s next meeting in August.

(Friends of Joanna Doven)As an industrial city and an incubator for artificial intelligence, Pittsburgh is uniquely positioned to lead the world, as AI-powered systems move out onto highways, factory floors and battlefields.
Joanna Doven, executive director of the city’s AI Strike Team, said the Steel City’s academic, manufacturing and health care, combined with its high quality of life and low cost of living put it in a unique position to catch the next wave of the AI revolution.
“Physical AI isn’t just the next tech buzzword. It’s an entirely new category of industry,” Doven said Monday at the Pennsylvania Press Club luncheon, where she was the featured speaker.
“These are intelligent systems that move, sense, adapt and act in real time in the physical world,” she said. “We’re talking about autonomous vehicles, submarines, defense systems, AI powered manufacturing, industrial robotics, and next generation energy systems.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The new industry is about to have a “hockey stick moment,” describing the shape of its growth curve, with value projected to increase nearly ten-fold by 2030, Doven said.
“This is not just market evolution, it’s market creation. And here’s the best part … no region or state has claimed ownership of this new industry. Pittsburgh and Pennsylvania must be first,” she said.
Next month, the city will host the AI Horizons Pittsburgh summit, Doven announced, where industry and government leaders will discuss how to help Pennsylvania capitalize on strengths that are attractive to the physical AI industry. 
Doven said the summit would focus on how the state can build a network to incentivize and support physical AI development and production in Pennsylvania with state and federal initiatives through Small Business Administration loans and public investment.
Speakers will include Martial Hebert, dean of the robotics department at Carnegie Mellon University, which Doven described as the world’s No. 1 AI school. Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro and U.S. Sen. Dave McCormick (R-Pa.) are also slated to participate, she said.

The announcement came nearly two weeks after McCormick hosted an energy and innovation summit at CMU, attended by President Donald Trump and several of his cabinet secretaries. It also featured panels with heads of energy, tech and investment firms, who announced an aggregate $90 billion in investments to develop Pennsylvania’s energy supply and infrastructure to support data centers that power AI. 
Doven, who served as press secretary to former Pittsburgh Mayor Luke Ravenstahl, said she saw the beginnings of the city’s AI hub following the redevelopment of a former Nabisco Baking Co. bakery in the East End neighborhood. 
AI companies that were spinning off of CMU’s robotics program began to lease space in the building, known as Bakery Square. In the office space glut of the post-COVID 19 pandemic era, Doven persuaded her clients to brand the building as an AI hub. That led to a working group of tech developers, city, county and state officials that became the AI Strike Team, she said. 
While AI companies lead the city in attracting venture capital, Doven said, investment in the field is still centered on the “tech bro network of Silicon Valley.” 
“The challenge we must face is this, too many of our best companies still migrate west for late stage capital. This is across Pennsylvania,” she said. “We birth the innovation here, and they, out west, capture the value.”
Unlike purely software companies, where employees can be based anywhere, physical AI companies and their workers need to be near where their products are made, tested and deployed, Doven said.
“They need to be near steel mills, near defense contractors and ship builders, near energy infrastructure and power plants. You can’t test a nuclear inspection robot from a We Work office in San Francisco,” she said.

(Otto Kitsinger for Idaho Capital Sun)This story originally published in Idaho Education News on July 28.
Two transgender persons filed a federal lawsuit Friday, challenging a 2025 Idaho law restricting the use of gender-specific campus facilities.
The lawsuit centers on House Bill 264, which requires colleges and universities to designate restrooms, changing rooms and dormitories “for the exclusive use by either females or males.”
The plaintiffs are a transgender student at Boise State University who identifies as male, and a transgender person who spends significant time on the University of Idaho campus and identifies as female. Their lawsuit specifically challenges the restroom restrictions.
They say the two campuses have only a small number of restrooms that are open to all users, regardless of sex. They say they have used restrooms aligned to their gender identity, for years, and without incident. If they are forced to use restrooms consistent with their sex assigned at birth, the plaintiffs say they would be outed as transgender in their campus communities.
“HB 264, if it remains in effect at the beginning of the 2025-2026 school year, will prohibit BSU and U of I from allowing plaintiffs to continue using restrooms that align with their gender identities and how they are perceived on campus,” the lawsuit says.
The Boise State student plaintiff is not “out as transgender to most people on campus,” according to a statement filed with the federal court last week.
“It would be impossible for me to use the women’s restrooms, as I appear and sound male,” the student said. “I believe it would put me at risk for harassment and violence to enter a restroom designated for females.”
The second plaintiff — identified in court documents by the pseudonym Sophie Smith — is seeking to pursue the lawsuit anonymously. “Sophie frequently uses the women’s restrooms at U of I without incident,” according to the lawsuit. “She does so with the permission of administrators, to whom she previously came out as transgender.”
The lawsuit claims HB 264 violates the plaintiffs’ rights to equal protection and privacy under the 14th Amendment; violates federal workplace protections; and violates Title IX, which forbids discrimination in schools on the basis of sex.
The lawsuit seeks a temporary restraining order by Aug. 25, the first day of classes at Boise State and the U of I.
The lawsuit names a list of defendants: the State Board of Education and its members; state superintendent Debbie Critchfield; Boise State and interim President Jeremiah Shinn; and the U of I and President C. Scott Green.
HB 264’s legislative sponsor went onto social media Sunday to predict the lawsuit will fail.
Rep. Barbara Ehardt, R-Idaho Falls, argues that the federal 9th Circuit Court of Appeals has allowed Idaho’s 2023 K-12 bathroom law to go into effect. This law prohibits transgender students from using bathrooms aligned with their gender identity.
The 2025 law, Ehardt said in a Facebook comment, “is EXACTLY LIKE THAT, just for higher ed!”
Ehardt’s House Bill 264 passed the Legislature along party lines. Gov. Brad Little signed it into law in April.

(Photo by Jared Strong/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Corn rated nearly 90% good to excellent during the reporting period from July 21 through July 27, while wet conditions limited farmers’ activities in the field, according to the latest crop progress and condition report. 
Iowa crops continue to progress slightly ahead of schedule while above-average temperatures and precipitation caused humid conditions and in some cases, caused excessive soil moisture. 
Across the state, topsoil moisture went from 21% surplus last week to 30% surplus this week. Subsoil moisture conditions also increased to 24% surplus, up from 17% last week. 
According to State Climatologist Justin Glisan, the weekly average precipitation was 1.58 inches for the reporting period, which is 0.61 inches above the normal. Some regions of the state, however, received as much as 7.2 inches during the reporting period and southeastern Iowa had between 3 and 5 inches.  
Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig said with only a couple of days left in July, it “could rank among the top ten wettest Julys on record.”
“Last week was hot and muggy as a heat dome settled over the Midwest, producing some sweltering heat and humidity,” Naig said in a statement. 
The average temperature for the week, at 77.5, was more than 4 degrees above normal. Temperatures throughout the period were between 2 and 6 degrees above the 30-year average.

Tim Kaldenberg grows corn, soybeans and raises cattle north of Albia and said his farm has had good growing conditions and has not been hit by the “extreme rainfall” that other areas have had. 
“We even hate to say this out loud, but it has been very nice growing conditions,” Kaldenberg said. 
Kaldenberg said in an interview with Iowa Capital Dispatch July 22, the crops in his region “had the nicest looking grow.” 
“We’re so used to that not being the case,” Kaldenberg said. “So we’re just very thankful for that this year.” 
Kaldenberg and his family were awarded the Wergin Good Farm Neighbor Award from the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship in early July for their operation’s dedications to soil health, water quality and community engagement. 
Kaldenberg said the majority of his corn has been pollinated and his soybeans are flowering. He also said pasture conditions were good, and the main challenge he’s had is getting his hay to dry. 
This is in line with conditions across the state. Eighty-four percent of corn is silking and 34% of corn acres have reached the dough stage across the state, according to the report produced by U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Agricultural Statistics Service. 
Soybeans also rated 82% good to excellent for the reporting period and 81% of soybean acres were blooming. Soybeans are five days ahead of last year and two days ahead of the five-year average in terms of setting pods, as 52% of the crop across the state has reached that stage. 
According to the report, nearly half of Iowa oat acres have been harvested, with higher percentages of harvest completed in southern regions of the state. 
Oats rated 83% good to excellent and hay rated 86% good to excellent. 
Across the state 87% of alfalfa hay acres have had a second cutting and 28% have undergone a third cutting. 
Pasture conditions also rated well at 82% good to excellent, though according to the report, some livestock stress was reported on account of the heat and humidity.

K.C. Dressing, a 31-year-old Colchester resident, spent Friday evening exhorting the loudest section of Vermont Green Football Club fans to greater heights by pounding on a limited-edition Pearl snare drum. He’s been attending Green games for several years and is a member of the Green Mountain Bhoys, a group of dedicated longtime supporters.
“It’s a little snapshot of what makes Vermont an incredible place and what makes me feel so lucky to live here,” Dressing said.
Burlington saw two ecstatic pitch invasions this weekend at the University of Vermont’s Virtue Field, after Vermont Green won two hard-fought playoff games to take the club to its first national finals in the United Soccer League’s second tier. On Sunday night, the league announced the Vermont side would retain its home advantage again in the final against Seattle-based Ballard FC on Saturday.
“We’re incredibly excited to be hosting a final,” club co-founder Patrick Infurna said. “Our soccer community in general has earned it.”
Chris Taylor, the club’s head coach, called the team’s playoff run “an amazing ride” on Sunday after the game. He praised his players and said that support from the sold-out crowds had made a profound impact. 
Owen O’Malley, the scorer of the Green’s winning penalty against Dothan United on Sunday, agreed. 
“I do it for the fans, man,” O’Malley said. “I just love these guys so much.”

Vermont Green fans celebrate the football club’s semifinal win
The feeling from fans was mutual. The club estimated Sunday’s attendance at just over 4,000. When O’Malley ran to the stands to celebrate, he was immediately surrounded by a crowd of supporters — first young kids, then parents and adults. 
The boisterous home support had been quieted briefly on Friday when, deep into added time, Lionsbridge Football Club scored what would have been the winning goal. Then cheers resumed as home fans realized the official’s flag was up: the goal had been offside. Two overtime goals secured a Vermont win.
Near the front of Friday’s pitch invasion, Jacob Labowitz brandished an enormous Vermont flag. The Colchester-based lawyer went to Vermont Green’s first-ever game in 2022.
“Freedom and unity right here,” he said, nodding up at the state coat of arms.

Melissa Gara, who works at the University of Vermont Medical Center, said Sunday she was glad to have witnessed two such successful Vermont soccer teams in the same year. The University of Vermont’s men’s team that won the NCAA national championship in December — from which Vermont Green FC has recruited several top players — was still at the forefront of her mind.
“Now I’m a die-hard fan,” Gara said.
Some supporters had been all-in long before Sunday. Jack Beach and Isaac Parker, both 18, said they had waited in a virtual line for tickets in their workplace bathroom last week. Parker, who originally found the Green through Instagram, said he was invested not just in the club, but also in the success of its athletes.
“The player-fan connection is crazy,” Parker said.

Fans have also been drawn to Vermont Green’s off-the-field culture, which includes close relationships with local businesses and an emphasis on political advocacy. Several fans said they appreciate the club’s affiliation with climate and social justice movements.
The club itself has hosted fundraisers in the past for the Vermont Immigration Legal Defense Fund and the Northeast Organic Farming Association of Vermont. Fan groups have also organized support for organizations such as Migrant Justice Vermont. Infurna said the club considers environmental justice its “North Star.”
The club has also hosted three women’s exhibition matches and is looking to expand its women’s program in the coming years.
For people like Jessica Huber, who plays in a coed Sunday soccer league, a Vermont Green women’s team would make a difference. She went to one of the women’s matches, all of which sold out.
“I think the demand is there,” she said.
In general, Huber said, she loves the community that has formed around Vermont Green.
“Vibes are high,” she said. “Vibes are amazing.”

(Photo credit: Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)Inshore shrimp season in Louisiana will open a couple weeks later than usual this year, and shrimpers are all for it. 
The Louisiana Wildlife and Fisheries Commission set Aug. 11 as the opening date for the inshore fall 2025 white shrimp season on Monday, pushed back from the typical Aug. 1 start date based on testimony from state biologists and the public. 
The date was moved to make sure shrimp get to a marketable size, which will fetch higher prices for shrimpers as well as ensuring the shrimp population remains stable. 
Louisiana Shrimp Association president Acy Cooper Jr. said that, for the majority of the shrimpers he represents, the wait is worth it. 
“We really need bigger shrimp in order to try to make money with it. Try with the smaller shrimp, and they just don’t pay us enough,” Cooper said. 
For 2025, shrimping waters from the Mississippi-Louisiana border to the eastern shore of the Mississippi River’s South Pass open at 6 a.m. Aug. 11. Waters east of South Pass to the Atchafalaya River Ship Channel at Eugene Island, marked with a red channel buoy line, open at 6 p.m. From the buoy line westward to the Louisiana-Texas border, shrimping opens at 6 a.m. 
A shrimp’s life cycle and how much it grows is heavily dependent on water conditions, such as salinity, temperature and oxygen content, according to the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries. 
Biologists work to measure these conditions and, with input from the Wildlife and Fisheries Commission and the state’s Shrimp Task Force, can determine where and when shrimp will be the right size to harvest. 
In order to gauge when white shrimp reach a marketable size of 100 shrimp per pound, biologists trawl the state’s estuarine and inland waters, sampling shrimp and testing the conditions. They then plug their measurements into mathematical models to predict when shrimp would reach a big enough size. 
Cooper said opening later in the season is the result of a balancing act between gaging where the shrimp will run and waiting for the chance to make the most money for the work put in. That balance can make the difference for shrimpers when it comes to financially surviving another season. 
“You are taking the chance of losing some, but that’s a chance they’re going to take,” he said. “We really need bigger shrimp in order to survive down here if we’re gonna make any money.”",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IMG_5459-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-28 18:56:33.874604

Written reprimands will be issued for the violations. The Open Meetings Commission is a five-member body appointed by the state attorney general to consider complaints about government bodies around the state. 
The commission concluded the Central City Board of Trustees did not comply with state law, which requires meeting agendas to be posted publicly with the date, time and location at least 24 hours in advance. The board held a budget meeting on Sept. 23, 2024, without posting an agenda, according to complainant Christle Beukens.
Beukens filed the complaint in late 2024. She testified that agendas had routinely been posted in the past but had stopped until she raised concerns in 2023. Although the board resumed posting agendas after that, she said the Sept. 23 meeting showed the problem lingered. The commission declined to find violations on other allegations from Beukens. 
The commission found that the Saddleback Road District Board in Custer County violated state open meetings laws when the board held a Sept. 7, 2024, meeting without notifying the public. The board did not post an agenda or the required 24-hour notice for the meeting. The commission declined to find violations on other allegations against the board in a complaint from Dachia Arritola.
The commission also praised the current road district board for taking steps to correct the problem.

JB Pritzker, firearm owners will soon be required to keep their weapons stored securely and out of the hands of minors while law enforcement agencies will be required to trace the ownership of all firearms they recover from crime scenes. (Capitol News Illinois photo by Andrew Campbell)
Article summary:

Senate Bill 8 requires gun owners to keep their weapons secured and inaccessible to minors, people at risk of harming themselves or others, and people prohibited from possessing firearms. Violations can result in civil fines.
House Bill 1327 requires law enforcement agencies to use a federal data system to trace the ownership of weapons they recover from crime scenes or take into custody because they are believed to have been used for illegal purposes.
While Illinois has been enacting stricter gun control measures, federal courts have taken a more restrictive view of gun control laws. The 7th Circuit Court of Appeals is considering a challenge to Illinois’ 2023 assault weapons ban. Oral arguments in that case will be scheduled soon.


Gun owners in Illinois will soon be required to take additional measures to keep their weapons out of the hands of children under a new law signed Monday by Gov. JB Pritzker.
In addition, law enforcement officers in the state must now start tracing the ownership of any firearm that is recovered from a crime scene, used unlawfully or is believed to be associated with a crime.
Pritzker signed those bills into law at a time when federal courts are growing increasingly skeptical of state and local efforts to curb gun violence. A federal court of appeals is preparing to hear arguments in a challenge to Illinois’ most significant recent gun restriction — a ban on assault-style weapons and large capacity magazines.
“I’m tired, frankly, of treating something completely preventable as inevitable,” Pritzker said at a bill signing ceremony in Chicago. “I’m tired of forcing our children to duck and cover because too many politicians are ducking and covering for the gun industry’s money. I’m tired of hearing thoughts and prayers and then nothing gets done.”
Safe storage requirement
Senate Bill 8, known as the Safe Gun Storage Act, prohibits gun owners from storing their weapons in an unsecured manner at any location where they know, or reasonably should know, that the gun could be accessed by a minor, a person at risk of harming themselves or others, or by a person who is prohibited under state or federal law from possessing a firearm.
To secure the weapon, under the law, owners will be required to keep them in a locked container so that they are inaccessible or unusable by anyone other than the owner.
Gun owners who violate the law could be subject to civil fines of $500. But those fines could go up to $1,000 if a minor, at-risk person or prohibited person  obtains the firearm, and as high as $10,000 if such person uses it to kill or injure someone in the course of committing a crime.
In lieu of those fines, courts could instead order the gun owner to perform community service or pay restitution for violating the law. The new law also provides that gun owners could also be subject to civil liability in private lawsuits.
However, the law also provides that gun owners will not be found in violation of the law if a minor, at-risk person or prohibited person obtains their firearm by unlawfully entering the premises.
In addition to the new storage requirements, SB 8 also requires gun owners to report a lost or stolen firearm to law enforcement within 48 hours of discovery, as opposed to the previous 72-hour requirement.
Supporters of the bill pointed to recent statistics showing firearms are now the leading cause of death for children under 18, surpassing motor vehicles and cancer.
“For far too long, we have witnessed the tragic consequences of unsecured firearms in homes,” Sen. Laura Ellman, D-Naperville, the lead Senate sponsor of the bill, said in a statement. “Firearms, if left unaccounted for and unsecured, pose risks to those who shouldn’t have access to them. Firearm owners can help prevent gun-related incidents by ensuring their guns are securely stored and away from others.”
The bill passed 33-19 in the Senate and 69-40 in the House.
The law takes effect Jan. 1.

Pritzker also signed a bill Monday requiring law enforcement agencies to trace the ownership of every weapon recovered from a crime scene or that they seize because it was possessed unlawfully, used for an unlawful purpose or they reasonably believe to have been used in a crime.
House Bill 1373, an initiative of Attorney General Kwame Raoul, requires agencies to check those weapons through a web-based system known as eTrace, which is operated by the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.
Prior to the new law, participation in the eTrace system was voluntary.
“We know now that approximately half of shootings nationwide never get solved. Only about a third do here in the city of Chicago,” said Sen. Bill Cunningham, D-Chicago, the lead Senate sponsor of the bill. “We also know that the same gun can often be used again and again in multiple shootings, multiple killings. We need to do something about that. That’s what this bill does. It ensures that all law enforcement agencies report all information they have on a gun anytime they recover it at the scene of a crime.”
The bill passed 75-40 in the House and 43-11 in the Senate. It takes effect immediately.
Legal landscape
Since taking office in 2019, Pritzker has signed numerous bills into law that impose new restrictions on the sale, ownership and possession of firearms. The most significant of those was a 2023 ban on assault-style weapons and large capacity magazines, known as the Protect Illinois Communities Act.
During that same time, however, the U.S. Supreme Court has adopted a more expansive view of the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms and imposed new legal standards that make it more difficult for state and local gun control measures to pass constitutional muster.
Most recently, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals on Thursday, July 24, struck down as unconstitutional a California law requiring background checks for people to purchase ammunition. The court found the law was not consistent with the nation’s “historical tradition” of firearms regulation, a standard the Supreme Court established in 2022, less than a year before Illinois passed its assault weapons ban.
Gun rights organizations are using a similar argument in challenging the Illinois law.
In November, a federal judge in East St. Louis struck down the Illinois law using the same “historical tradition” analysis. But his ruling has been put on hold pending an appeal to the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago.
In that case, the attorney general’s office has until Aug. 14 to file its final brief. A three-judge panel will then set a date for oral arguments. However the court rules,  observers expect the law will eventually be appealed to the Supreme Court.

Tim Walz took questions from reporters after a ceremonial bill signing at Apple Jack Orchards in Delano, Minnesota, on July 28, 2025. (Photo by Michelle Griffith/Minnesota Reformer)Gov. Tim Walz on Monday said his administration has halted payments to 50 of the largest providers in the state’s Housing Stabilization Services program, which federal investigators say is the source of a massive fraud scheme.
Earlier this month, the FBI raided five Minnesota businesses that have received millions in Medicaid money for services they didn’t provide, according to unsealed search warrants. The Housing Stabilization Services program is intended to help older adults and people with disabilities find and maintain housing.
Acting U.S. Attorney Joe Thompson told KSTP that the “vast majority” of the Housing Stabilization Services program is fraudulent. He said that when his current investigations are finished, fraud in programs administered by Minnesota could exceed $1 billion, stemming from a pandemic-era food aid program known as Feeding Our Future, the state’s autism program and rapidly increasing sums allegedly pilfered from other Medicaid programs.
Walz, at a ceremonial bill signing in Delano, said that earlier in the day Monday — nearly two weeks after the FBI raids — his administration halted payments to “most of the people involved” in the Housing Stabilization Services program. The governor said he “fully expects” some providers could wind up suing to resume payments, as occurred in a now infamous Feeding Our Future lawsuit in 2021. He agreed with Thompson that fraud in Minnesota could exceed $1 billion.
Asked whether his administration should be held accountable, he gave a lengthy answer.
“Well, I think you’re always accountable for when things happen, but I think the accountability piece that we’re going to have to try and understand is — we’ve seen fraud, whether it’s in United Healthcare, we’ve seen it in other places,” Walz said, referring to a series of investigations of the Eden Prairie-based health insurance giant.
“The question is, in state government, our job is to carry out the programs to try and get the resources to the people who need them. We work with our partners in the counties and so forth, but I think on this one, the question I’m asking is, is the safeguards in place strong enough?”
Walz said fraudsters took advantage of the flow of money moving through government during the pandemic, when policymakers were more concerned with getting money out the door during an emergency rather than enforcing typical safeguards to prevent fraud.
“Anytime, especially during COVID and post-COVID, when you have that much money moving and the idea is to move it as quickly as possible, folks will take advantage of that.”
“So my goal is, and thanks to the Legislature we’ve got some pretty good tools right now, but I think in talking to the U.S. Attorney, one of the things we have to think more of is, these people are being arrested and they’re going to prison. Right now the folks who are involved in this, you will be going to prison.”
Walz said that as a result of the investigations, state government is bound to move slower as it seeks to create more barriers to fraud.
“All of us are going to have to candidly recognize there is going to be legitimate organizations and legitimate need for people in good programs that are just going to have to be a little bit slower and a little more barriers put in place because even right now, the folks can find the loopholes,” Walz said.
Rep. Kristin Robbins, R-Maple Grove and chair of the House fraud prevention committee, asked the feds to conduct an audit of the Minnesota Department of Human Services, which administers the House Stabilization Services program.
“This culture of corruption must end. It’s time for real accountability, and that starts with a full, independent federal audit,” Robbins said in a news release.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_3114-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-28 18:56:33.874604

Konstantin Konev, a citizen of Balurus and a legal permanent resident of the United States for more than five years, is suing the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Citizenship and Immigration Services, as well as the agency’s director, Joseph Edlow, in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa.
According to the lawsuit, Konev is “a law-abiding individual” who became a lawful permanent resident of the United States in December 2017. On Sept. 20, 2022, Konev filed an application for naturalization. In the 34 months since then, he alleges, CIS has yet to begin the prosses of reviewing his application by scheduling an interview.
“Although U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services has thus far prevented the plaintiff from becoming a U.S. citizen, the defendants have not notified the plaintiff of any problems with his case, nor have they afforded him an opportunity to address and correct any basis for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services’ concerns,” the lawsuit alleges.
The lawsuit states this “unlawful conduct” by CIS has deprived Konev of job opportunities as well as the right to vote, the right to serve on juries, the ability to travel abroad without fear of being denied reentry to the United States, and the right to apply for business and educational loans that are U.S. citizens are routinely granted.
The lawsuit seeks judicial adjudication of the naturalization application or a court order that would force CIS to make its own decision on the matter within 30 days.
CIS has yet to file a response to the lawsuit and has yet to respond to several requests for comment from the Iowa Capital Dispatch.
A similar case was filed recently by Mario Cesar Silva Pineda and his wife, Ana Carolina Silva of Perry.
The couple is suing CIS, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, and U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi.
According to the lawsuit, Silva Pineda is a U.S. citizen who was naturalized in August 2022. His wife is a citizen of El Salvador. The two claim they were married in May 2023, after which Silva Pineda filed an I-130 application on his wife’s behalf – generally considered the first step in the immigration process for someone who wishes to stay in the United States permanently based on a close relative’s status.
The couple’s lawsuit claims no action has been taken in the matter since July 19, 2023, when CIS acknowledged receipt of their application. The current average processing time for such applications is 17 months, according to federal records.
The lawsuit claims the delay in acting on the application is unreasonable and illegal and seeks court intervention in the matter. CIS has yet to file a response to the lawsuit.
Lawsuits follow cuts in immigration assistance
Recently, federal officials acknowledged they are moving to deport a central Iowa couple who is suing the government over what they claim is a five-year delay in processing their naturalization application.
The stated rationale for the attempted removal of Justin and Victoria Kokeh from the United States is that the couple lied in 2013 when they claimed to have no children. According to court filings in the case, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security took no action in the matter until recently, after the Kokehs, who have lived in Des Moines and Altoona, sued Noem to force a decision in their naturalization case.
In court filings, Homeland Security has alleged the Kokehs committed fraud in connection with their 2013 visa application by asserting they had no children at the time.
Under federal law, CIS is required to avoid “excessive” delays in making decisions on naturalization applications.  The statute requires the agency to render a decision within 120 days of the initial naturalization interview – although it may take months or years for such an interview to take place.
In cases where CIS doesn’t schedule an interview, applicants can still seek court intervention. In those cases, a federal judge cannot issue a decision on the application but can order CIS to make such a decision and do it in a timely fashion.
Earlier this year, Noem placed all of the staff from CIS’ Office of Ombudsman on 60 days’ administrative leave, essentially shutting down the office that was designed to assist potential immigrants resolve problems with their applications. At the time, Homeland Security said it was attempting to focus more on border security and immigration enforcement.
According to the CIS Ombudsman’s Annual Report for 2024, the office handled about 30,000 requests for assistance in 2023.
In late May, after being sued over the staff reductions, DHS said the ombudsman’s office would reopen but with a considerably smaller staff consisting of a head ombudsman, a deputy and an additional five to eight full-time employees.
The office previously had about 40 full-time employees.

But any Idaho ground water users who are not part of a groundwater district and are not participating in an approved plan need to immediately join a district to avoid having their water shut off, state officials said.
Late Friday afternoon, the Idaho Department of Water Resources announced that Director Mathew Weaver signed an updated curtailment order for groundwater users who pump off the Eastern Snake Plain Aquifer and hold water rights issued more recently than – or junior to – Oct. 11 1900.
However, the 2024 water settlement agreement and mitigation plan that farmers reached agreement over protects members of groundwater districts from having their water shut off.
“The members of the groundwater districts are protected under a stipulated mitigation plan approved following completion of the 2024 Water Settlement Agreement,” Idaho Department of Water Resources officials said in a news release issued Friday. 
The latest updated curtailment order was issued after the Idaho Department of Water Resources signed an order earlier in July predicting a water shortfall for the Twin Falls Canal Co., the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported.
 How Idaho governs water issues

In Idaho, water issues are governed by something called the doctrine of prior appropriation. When there is not enough water to go around, water users who hold older water rights, called senior water rights, have priority over water users who hold more recently issued water rights, called junior water rights.

State officials use the saying “first in time, first in right,” to describe how the doctrine of prior appropriation governs water issues.
Water issues are extremely important to Idaho farmers who need water to irrigate their crops during the summer growing season.
Water issues came to a head in May 2024 when the Idaho Department of Water Resources issued a curtailment order that required 6,400 junior water rights holders to suddenly shut their water off during the growing season, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. 
The 2024 curtailment order was ultimately in place for about three weeks until the two sides reached an agreement for the year. 
Then, Gov. Brad Little called on farmers to reach a long-term water agreement and mitigation plan, which resulted in the 2024 water settlement agreement and mitigation plan that state officials said is protecting water groundwater districts from curtailment following this year’s updated order.
 Groundwater districts who signed agreement are protected, attorney says

T.J. Budge, an attorney for the Idaho Ground Water Association, told the Idaho Capital Sun that groundwater districts that are part of the agreement are protected.
“Yes, things are the same as they were a few weeks ago,” Budge said Monday. “Those who are participating in an approved mitigation plan are protected from curtailment.” 
In addition to groundwater districts, Idaho Department of Water Resources officials also said the Southwest Irrigation District, the Coalition of Cities, A&B Irrigation District and the Water Mitigation Coalition are operating under approved mitigation plans and protected from curtailment.

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)On Monday, Rhode Island education officials were still waiting to learn when they’d get federal education grant funding for the current fiscal year.
In total, the frozen funds span five buckets of federal money, Rhode Island Department of Education (RIDE) spokesperson Victor Morente said in an email Monday. He added that RIDE had still not received grant notifications as of Monday, but had been notified on Friday that the grants were being unfrozen beginning the week of July 28. 
“It’s my understanding that this is for remaining Title I, Title II, Title III, and Title IV-A funds,” Morente said. “These funds support teacher professional development, English language acquisition support, health and safety and Adult Basic Education.”
Morente could not yet provide specifics of how programs would be impacted at the local or district level yet.
“While final financial decisions would be made at the local level, RIDE has been in close communication with district leaders throughout the last few weeks offering support and guidance and will continue to do so,” Morente said.
The withholding of approximately $6.8 billion in federal education funding arrived in the inboxes of state education departments nationwide on the evening of June 30. 
Rhode Island would have lost nearly $30 million if the funds were not unfrozen. The majority of that money, about $23.5 million, is tied to the grant programs that RIDE was notified on Friday would begin to be released.
The feds’ June 30 announcement of the temporary fund freeze came the night before education departments and school districts nationwide expected to begin allocating money for the new fiscal year beginning July 1. According to the email, the U.S. education department was reviewing funds before they could be released.     
Two lawsuits, both filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island, followed the news of the freeze.The first was filed by a coalition of Attorneys General on July 14. A second multistate lawsuit over the same disputed funds was filed on July 21 by a collection of 14 plaintiffs that comprised school districts and teachers’ unions, including Rhode Island Federation of Teachers and Health Professionals (RIFTHP). 
On July 18, the U.S. education department announced it had finished reviewing and would release about $1.3 billion of the frozen funds. These funds are distributed through Title IV-B grants, which includes the 21st Century Community Learning Centers program — the only federal funding source dedicated to afterschool programming, including summer programs. 
Morente said the 21st Century grants notifications, which comprised $6.5 million, have already been received by RIDE.
According to the July 21 lawsuit, educators rely on funds from grant programs that are still pending release. A memorandum filed with the suit notes that 11 union members “were recently informed that they were losing their jobs.”
A declaration from Federation President Maribeth Calabro was filed with the July 21 lawsuit. Calabro elaborated that positions funded by the frozen money — like instructional coaches, English language development staff, arts teachers, and school counselors — could be laid off or reassigned if the money is not restored in a timely fashion.
Calabro wrote that several union members have already missed out on planned professional development sessions this summer, which she wrote are important for the upkeep of teaching licenses as well as the improvement of teaching skills and curricula. 
The union also relies on dues revenue, Calabro wrote, which could lessen under the funds’ freezing. 
“This will diminish the organization’s ability to provide core representational services, including contract enforcement and member support,” Calabro wrote. “The reduction in bargaining unit size will weaken RIFTHP’s position in collective bargaining, limiting our ability to negotiate fair wages, working conditions, and staffing policies for our remaining members.”
The U.S. The Department of Education did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday.

A lawyer says her appointment was illegal. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)An Irvington man facing drug distribution and gun charges asked a federal judge to dismiss the case against him, arguing that last week’s reappointment of Alina Habba as New Jersey’s acting U.S. Attorney violated federal law and his constitutional rights.
The motion is the latest twist in Habba’s tumultuous tenure as New Jersey’s chief federal law enforcement official and threatens to upend hundreds of criminal prosecutions pursued by her office — if her tenure is to continue at all. New Jersey’s federal judges last week named Habba’s deputy, Desiree Grace, as U.S. attorney, but the Trump administration removed Grace and renamed Habba instead.
Thomas Mirigliano, who is representing the Irvington man, Julien Giraud, said in a Sunday court filing that he wants a judge to bar Habba “from exercising further prosecutorial powers in this matter.”
“The Attorney General’s dismissal of Ms. Grace and reinstatement of Ms. Habba constitutes unlawful executive interference,” the filing reads.
President Donald Trump in March named Habba, then a personal lawyer, as acting U.S. attorney and formally nominated her in June for confirmation by the U.S. Senate. But her nomination never advanced (New Jersey’s two senators, Cory Booker and Andy Kim, both Democrats, oppose Habba’s confirmation).
Federal law allows unconfirmed U.S. attorney nominees to run their offices only for 120 days before their district’s federal judges appoint a successor. Habba’s 120-day term ended Friday.
Last week, after New Jersey District Court judges selected Grace to replace Habba, the Trump administration fired Grace, Habba’s nomination was withdrawn, and Habba was installed as the office’s top deputy, a maneuver that administration officials said makes her the office’s leader. The Federal Vacancies Reform Act gives first-assistants elevated to lead their department up to 210 days in the job.
It’s not clear who ordered Grace’s removal. Department of Justice officials lack the authority to overwrite court orders, and while the U.S. Constitution may grant Trump the ability to fire judicially appointed U.S. attorneys, the question is far from settled and will likely be answered in court.
In Mirigliano’s filing, which was first reported by the New Jersey Globe, he argued Habba’s reappointment violates two portions of federal law that bar interim appointments of presidential nominees.
Though the Federal Vacancies Reform Act allows for first assistant U.S. attorneys to take helm of their departments in case of vacancies, it also bars those who were not top deputies for at least 90 days in the preceding year from serving.
It also bars individuals from being elevated to positions for which they were nominated but failed to be confirmed. Separate federal law bars the attorney general from appointing as U.S. attorney individuals to whom the Senate “refused to give advice and consent.”
“Ms. Habba’s nomination submission triggered this statutory prohibition. Thus, Ms. Habba’s re-appointment is invalid,” Mirigliano wrote.
This isn’t the first time Trump officials have sought to replace a judicially appointed prosecutor.
In 2020, then-Attorney General William Barr announced that Geoffrey Berman, then the Southern District of New York’s chief prosecutor, had resigned. Berman said he had not resigned and did not intend to.
The following day, Barr claimed Trump had fired Berman, though Trump said he was “not involved” in the firing. Berman only resigned when his top deputy was named to succeed him. Barr had sought to install Craig Carpenito, then New Jersey’s U.S. attorney, as the Southern District’s chief federal prosecutor.
About two months after Berman’s departure, district prosecutors secured a money laundering and wire fraud indictment against top Trump booster Steve Bannon, who was convicted on the charges and later pardoned by Trump.
The swirl around Habba’s appointment is likely to draw more controversy. Since she was installed in March, a federal judge has rebuked her office for lodging then quickly dismissing criminal charges against Newark Mayor Ras Baraka. The mayor has claimed the charges were politically motivated.
Habba has also filed criminal charges against Rep. LaMonica McIver (D-10), who likewise claims politics motivated Habba. Habba’s pledge to a podcast host that she would use her office to “turn New Jersey red” has spurred a complaint that she violated the Hatch Act, a law barring federal employees from engaging in political activities while they are working in an official capacity.

The Alabama Securities Commission has opened an 'inquiry' into the business, which federal prosecutors accuse of running a Ponzi scheme. (Jill Nolin/Georgia Recorder)The Alabama Securities Commission (ASC) has opened an inquiry into an alleged Georgia-based Ponzi scheme involving First Liberty Building and Loan and its owner, Edwin Brant Frost IV.
Amanda Senn, director of the ASC, said in a phone interview Monday that the move is not an investigation. The agency is actively monitoring the situation and coordinating with authorities in both Alabama and Georgia “to be sure Alabama investors are protected,” and that the agency will elevate the case to an active investigation if Georgia takes further action.
“It’s on our radar,” Senn said. “We’ve got personnel dedicated to monitoring the situation in its entirety.”

A lawsuit filed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on July 10 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia alleged that Frost and his associated investment firms raised at least $140 million between 2014 and 2025 through fraudulent means. The lawsuit further alleges that Frost used $570,000 of the misappropriated money for political donations. 
According to campaign finance records, Frost, members of his family or his businesses made at least $132,000 in contributions to Alabama politicians and political action committees (PACs).
Former Rep. Andrew Sorrell, R-Muscle Shoals, now the Alabama state auditor and a candidate for Secretary of State; Rep. Ben Harrison, R-Elkmont; and Alabama State Board of Education member Allen Long were among the Alabama politicians who accepted contributions either from Frost or one of his various investment firms.
Senn said that if the situation warrants, the ASC could “elevate” their case to a full investigation, which could involve issuing subpoenas.
“Should something in (Georgia’s) case cause us to need to elevate, file or launch an active open investigation, then we’ll do that,” she stated.
Senn said that they are prepared to launch their own active investigation, if necessary, but “if our Alabama investors are protected with the Georgia investigation,” the agency would avoid duplicating efforts by not launching its own investigation. She added that the ASC is assisting and providing information that may be “pertinent to other active criminal investigations right now.”
Alabama Secretary of State Wes Allen last week called for those who received political contributions from Frost or one of his investment firms to return the funds, saying he takes “allegations of financial fraud seriously, especially when that fraud bleeds into campaign finance.” The Alabama Secretary of State’s Office oversees campaign finance reporting but does not have the power to investigate or prosecute alleged violations of the law or compel the return of contributions.
Sorrell and his PAC, Alabama Christian Citizens, collectively received at least $71,000 in contributions from the Frost family and their investment entities. Harrison received over $21,000 in donations from Brant in 2022, and Long, a conservative member of the Alabama State Board of Education, received a $40,000 donation from First National Investments in December 2023. Sorrell and Harrison said in separate interviews earlier this month that they would return the contributions to the court-appointed receiver. Long has not returned requests for comment.
The number of Alabama investors affected by the scheme is still unclear, but Senn said “we know there are investors in Alabama.” A receiver has been appointed in Georgia to collect contributions made to politicians and gather more information about the investors.
Senn said that any decision to launch a public investigation by the ASC would be made public, as it is “something that people need to know.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/First-Liberty-Building-and-Loan-July-2025-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-28 17:56:57.546004

Built in 1771 by prominent Bennington resident and Revolutionary War Capt. Elijah Dewey, the Walloomsac Inn is the oldest lodging establishment in Vermont. 
After over 30 years as a private residence, the Walloomsac Inn had fallen into disrepair, but now the ramshackle inn at the heart of Old Bennington is set to be restored and opened to the public. 
The inn was purchased June 25 by Rafe Churchill and Casey Sunderland through a new joint venture called Place in Mind, which aims to restore historically significant properties in the Northeast and across the country. The co-founders are also part of the leadership team for the architecture and interior design firm Hendricks Churchill, and Churchill is an alumni of Bennington College. 
“Our mission is really to resurrect these historic structures,” Sunderland said. “Hospitality happens to be a really great backbone to do that on, because you can generate revenue and open up the experience to so many more people than if it were just a private residence.” 
The restoration project will be a “significant undertaking,” so there is no set timeline yet for opening, Sunderland said. However, the duo plans to honor the existing property structure during renovations and bring the Walloomsac Inn back to its original glory shown in old postcards and photos from decades past, he said. 
Along with the Walloomsac Inn, Sunderland and Churchill acquired the Mount Anthony Seminary, a former school in Old Bennington. The co-founders plan to rebuild the historic bell tower on the property and open the building as a smaller, six-bedroom lodging near the Walloomsac Inn, Sunderland said.

Old Bennington is a “beautiful little hamlet of Vermont that is, quite frankly, undiscovered in many ways,” Sunderland said. The duo hopes the projects will help make the Walloomsac Inn, the Mount Anthony Seminary, and, by extension, Old Bennington, into a destination where people can experience the history the area has to offer, he said.
“We’re just hoping that the town, the neighbors, the community continues to feel excited about being able to open up this to not only the Bennington community, but just travelers from far and beyond who want to come see this historic landmark,” Sunderland said. 
Shannon Barsotti, community development director for Bennington, said the Walloomsac Inn will benefit the economy of the town and region by providing a space for people to stay when visiting local notable spots, such as the Old First Church, its historic cemetery and the nearby Bennington Battle Monument — the most visited landmark in the state. 
Bennington Museum Executive Director Martin Mahoney said the Walloomsac Inn is a “long-standing staple of community life” in Old Bennington, and the restoration coinciding with the country’s 250th anniversary celebrations is fortuitous and welcome news for residents.

With a storied history, the Walloomsac Inn, known at the time as Dewey’s Tavern, served as a meeting place for the Vermont Legislature during the state’s time as an independent republic from 1771 until statehood in 1791, Mahoney said. 
The inn also hosted members of the Continental Army before the pivotal victory at the Battle of Bennington, said Jonah Spivak, the town of Bennington’s communications coordinator and chair of the Bennington Regional 250th Anniversary Committee. A member of the Dewey family, Mary Tilden Dewey, baked 80 loaves of bread to feed soldiers in the inn’s kitchens ahead of the battle, he said.
The inn was also visited by Presidents Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, Rutherford B. Hayes and Benjamin Harrison through the years. After the Deweys, the inn was acquired by James Hicks who added a third floor and ballroom to the second floor in 1893. After procuring the property in 1848, George Wadsworth Robinson changed the establishment’s name from Hicks Tavern to the Walloomsac House. Another former owner, Walter Berry, added a three-and-half-story extension to the building after acquiring it near the turn of the 20th century.
The 250th Anniversary Committee looked into acquiring the property for historic preservation through a community trust, Spivak said, but noted the project is a “heavy lift” that required people “with the resources and the knowledge to pull it off” — like Churchill and Sunderland.
Spivak said he is glad the restoration of the Walloomsac Inn will serve a “public purpose” going forward and be “an incredible enhancement to the historical experience in Bennington.”

(Photo by Ed Tibbetts)A legal organization focused on freedom of expression filed a new legal brief Monday asking the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals to keep the injunction in place blocking Iowa’s ban on books that are not “age appropriate” from K-12 schools.
PEN America, a nonprofit focused on freedom of expression, filed the brief in support of the legal challenge mounted by publishers including Penguin Random House, the Iowa State Education Association and several authors, including Laurie Halse Anderson, John Green and Jodi Picoult. The plaintiffs are challenging Senate File 496, a 2023 Iowa law that  prohibits books depicting sex acts from being available in K-12 school libraries, as well as banning programs, materials and instruction related to gender identity and sexual orientation for K-6 students.
U.S. District Court Judge Stephen Locher has ruled to block enforcement of multiple portions of the law, including the prohibition on books involving sexual or LGBTQ+ content. But that injunction could be overturned by the Eight Circuit Court of Appeals, which had ruled in August 2024 that Locher’s “analysis” of the case was not correct and returned it to the district court.

PEN America argued in its brief for the appeals court to keep the latest injunction in place, saying the law “undermines public education systems in violation of the First Amendment by denying students’ rights to receive information, infringing on authors’ free speech rights, and misapplying the obscenity doctrine.”
“The law requires the removal of hundreds of books from public school libraries  regardless of the age of the student reader or the books’ value as a whole — both of which considerations are required by the First Amendment,” the brief states.
Iowa public schools had removed 3,400 books from school shelves by the end of 2024, according to the Des Moines Register, including classic literature like “1984” by George Orwell, “The Bluest Eye” by Toni Morrison and “I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings” by Maya Angelou. Many school districts have expressed uncertainty about what books can be available in schools under the law, as the Iowa Department of Education had declined to respond to advocates asking for more clarification about “age appropriate” materials as defined by SF 496.
Locher wrote the law “places the burden on local school districts and school officials to determine whether a book is permitted,” and that the measure was “facially unconstitutional” when looking at previous court precedents on First Amendment cases.
In the Monday court brief, PEN America staff attorney Elly Brinkley echoed these concerns, writing that laws that target any and all descriptions of sex in literature have been “squarely condemned” by the U.S. courts in previous decisions, as it abridges students’ First Amendment rights to receive information.
Elly Brinkley, PEN America staff attorney, said in a statement: “This sweeping Iowa law robs young people of literary classics that have offered sustenance and meaning to generations of readers. These restrictions deprive Iowa students of books that help them understand the world in which we live. We cannot allow a vocal minority of censorship proponents (to) have the final say over what tens of thousands of students can read in school.”
In addition to the lawsuit filed by Penguin Random House, ISEA and authors, there is another challenge filed by Lambda Legal and ACLU of Iowa on behalf of students, teachers and the organization Iowa Safe Schools. The action is based on the law’s ban on books and material available in school libraries and classrooms, in addition to challenging the ban on “any program, curriculum, test, survey, questionnaire, promotion, or instruction relating to gender identity or sexual orientation to students in kindergarten through grade six.”
Locher ruled in May that parts of the law challenged by Lambda Legal and the ACLU are also unconstitutional, issuing an injunction in May ruling that K-6 students must be allowed to join Gender Sexuality Alliances (GSA) and other student groups related to LGBTQ+ identities and that school districts and teachers must be allowed to provide instruction and materials that contain references to gender identity and sexual orientation, though they cannot be focused on these topics.

“Despite Long Days, Stifling Heat, High Humidity and each member covering over 100 miles on foot…during the deployment…the opportunity to assist those affected by the deadly floods was an honor not taken lightly. Thank you for giving up your time with your own families to help bring closure to others,” the Indianapolis Fire Department posted on social media.
At least 135 people have been confirmed dead in the disaster, according to KXAN, while at least four others are still listed as missing.
Indiana Task Force One, composed mostly of firefighters, collectively has hundreds of hours of training in specialized rescue techniques for floods, structural collapses and more. It’s one of just 28 such squads across the country.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency first activated 49 members on July 8, several days after flash flooding rocked rural residents July 4.
A second, 35-member wave was ordered to join July 13, arriving about 12 hours later thanks to some chartered air travel help from the Texan CEO of a Hoosier lending software company.
While Indiana Task Force One members were away, Gov. Mike Braun launched an Emergency Alert Task Force to evaluate Indiana’s emergency systems and warning capacity. A report with recommendations is due to him by November 1.
However, Task Force One hasn’t received any state funding since 1992, though it’s busier than ever before responding to the ever-increasing number of weather-related emergencies.
The unit returned by ground. The drive takes about 18 hours without stopping.

“Vermont school districts will now be equipped to begin the school year knowing they have the resources to staff critical positions,"" the state's education secretary Zoie Saunders said in a statement.

Phil Scott’s weekly press conference held at the Central Vermont Technical Center in Barre on Tuesday, June 11. Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDigger
The Trump administration on Friday announced the release of the remaining $18 million in federal education funding for the Vermont’s Agency of Education and the state’s local school districts.
Vermont Education Secretary Zoie Saunders, in a press release issued on Friday, said the agency will begin their regular process for distributing the funds to school districts on Monday.
The U.S. Department of Education announcement comes less than a month after the agency first announced it was withholding more than $6 billion in funding for six federal grant programs nationwide. The federal government withheld roughly $26 million from Vermont school districts that help fund after-school and summer programs, and English language instruction.
A portion of those dollars also helps fund Vermont’s adult learning centers, institutions which offer residents a path to earn a high school diploma or GED certificate, as well as English language classes and workforce development programs.

In the statement, Saunders called the release of the dollars “a positive development for our most vulnerable students.”
“Vermont school districts will now be equipped to begin the school year knowing they have the resources to staff critical positions and provide the meaningful and tangible opportunities that these dollars represent,” Saunders said. “Vermont schools deserve to have confidence that they will be supported with resources that have been promised.”
The release of the funds ends weeks of uncertainty for the state’s school districts. School board officials set their fiscal year 2026 budgets assuming the federal funding would be in place. Then on June 30 — just hours before the start of the new fiscal year on July 1, when the funds have historically been made available to states — the Trump administration announced they were withholding the money pending a review.
The transfer of the money to the state also brings to an end a brief hiring freeze implemented in the state’s Agency of Education earlier this month. With the federal funding restored, the agency “now has the flexibility to begin hiring for vacant roles,” said agency spokesperson Toren Ballard. 
“Let’s be clear: Today the administration solved a problem of its own making by finally releasing funding for our public schools that it illegally and unconstitutionally withheld,” Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-VT, said in a release on Friday after the Department of Education’s announcement.
Two weeks after the funding freeze was announced, Attorney General Charity Clark joined 24 other states in a lawsuit against the Trump administration for “unlawfully freezing” those federal funds.
Last week, the U.S. Department of Education announced it was releasing some of the funding allocated for Vermont — roughly $6.5 million — specifically for afterschool programs.
But districts and adult learning centers were kept in limbo, with more than $18 million in funding still withheld. The Winooski School District, for example, relies on those federal funds as a high-poverty district.
Sarah Haven, the director of finance and operations for the Winooski School District, said the district was thankful the funding was being restored and was “once again supporting local budgets.”
“We’re relieved to move forward without disruption and hope that future decisions will protect the stability our educators, students, and families rely on,” Haven said. “We look forward to a wonderful school year.”

(Photo by Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images)Police officers may face hundreds of traumatic incidents over the course of their careers, but many still hesitate to seek mental health support when they need it.
Despite growing investments in wellness programs by law enforcement agencies across the country, a recent study of just over 100 surveyed officers  from the Fargo Police Department in North Dakota found that stigma remains a major barrier to mental health care for officers.
The study found that 60% of surveyed officers said most of their peers wouldn’t disclose a mental health condition to a colleague, and nearly three-quarters believed officers wouldn’t tell a supervisor. Slightly more than half agreed that most officers would expect to face discrimination at work if they disclosed they were experiencing mental illness.
Carol Archbold, the study’s author and a criminal justice professor at North Dakota State University, said officers may avoid disclosing mental health struggles because doing so also conflicts with societal expectations that they remain strong and unemotional.
‘A scarlet letter’: States aim to end stigma of doctors seeking mental health care

“The nature of [police officers’] work really, really makes it difficult and important for them to have services available and for them to actually utilize them,” Archbold told  Stateline, adding that departments also need to foster a culture where officers feel comfortable using the support available to them.
Departments across the country have expanded access to services like counseling, peer support, therapy, substance use programs, and on-site gyms in response to growing concerns about post-traumatic stress disorder or PTSD, depression, and suicide among officers.  The Fargo Police Department, for example, hired its first-ever health and wellness coordinator last year.
While the department offers a wide range of mental health-related services and programs, the study found that relatively few officers are using them.
Eighty-four percent of surveyed officers were aware of the department’s new health and wellness coordinator, but only 22 had interacted with them, and 19 found the interaction helpful. About 68% knew about the Employee Assistance Program; 20 had used it, with 17 reporting it was helpful. Awareness of the peer support program was higher at 93%, yet only 42 officers had used it, and 36 said it was helpful.
Still, stigma and fears about career repercussions may discourage some officers from using such services.
About half of all U.S. adults will experience at least one traumatic event in their lifetimes, though most will not develop PTSD, according to the National Institute of Mental Health. For police officers, the rate of exposure is significantly higher. Research suggests police officers may experience about three traumatic events every six months, or roughly 180 over a 30-year career.
Repeated exposure to traumatic events has been linked to a wide range of health issues in first responders, including poor sleep quality, depression, alcohol misuse and a heightened risk of PTSD.
In the Fargo survey, 53% of officers agreed that most police officers view being treated for a mental illness as a sign of personal weakness and would not seek professional help if they were experiencing mental health issues.
Forty percent believed that having a history of mental illness would negatively affect an officer’s chances for promotion. Many officers also disagreed with the idea that mental illness would lead to mistrust or social exclusion among peers. Sixty-four percent of officers disagreed with statements suggesting that most officers would avoid partnering with or think less of a colleague who had experienced a mental illness.
While agencies have expanded mental health resources in recent years, the study’s findings suggest that organizational culture remains a key factor in whether officers feel comfortable using those services.
The U.S. law enforcement system includes more than 17,000 federal, state, county and local agencies. While smaller and rural departments may be less likely to offer robust mental health services, Archbold said that does not reflect a lack of interest from leadership. Many departments — regardless of size — struggle to meet officer wellness needs within existing budgets and often must seek additional funding to support mental health programs.
“It’s likely that police chiefs would like to have these services available, but they just don’t have the money to be able to do that –– to provide those services,” Archbold said.

Almost half of the 63 million Americans who care for a family member say they struggle financially to do so. (Photo by Bruce Bennett/Getty Images)More than 63 million Americans are caregivers for a family member with complex medical needs, a 20 million increase over the past decade, according to a new report.
But state policies, workplaces, and the American health system haven’t kept up with this surge in family caregiving responsibilities, said Dr. Myechia Minter-Jordan, a physician and the CEO of the AARP, which released the report with the National Alliance for Caregiving, a nonprofit policy and research organization.
“Nearly half of caregivers say they face major financial consequences, draining savings, falling into debt or struggling to afford basic needs like food and housing,” Minter-Jordan told reporters on a call this week.
One of the biggest reasons for the surge in family caregivers is that Americans are living longer, yet they’re not necessarily healthier. There’s a 12-year gap between the average number of years that Americans live and the number of years they’re healthy.
The caregiving role typically involves helping a family member with daily tasks like bathing, dressing, and eating. But more than half of caregivers also perform more complex medical tasks, such as managing catheters or administering injections, the report found.
A growing number of caregivers are so-called “sandwich caregivers” — parents caring for their children as well as for an adult family member, such as an aging parent. About 17 million people are sandwich caregivers, compared with 11 million a decade ago. And most caregivers are also working a job.
And while the bulk of caregiving still falls on women, 40% of American caregivers are men.
Calls for action
Some states have heeded the growing calls for action.
Earlier this year, Maine lawmakers created a state program to provide respite care, which includes services such as adult day care that give family caregivers a temporary break.
Also this year, Tennessee extended its pilot program that provides respite care for Alzheimer’s and dementia patients, and also passed a bipartisan bill that directs the state Medicaid program to develop guidelines to allow family caregivers to be paid for their work.
Last year, Nebraska passed a tax credit for family caregivers; Oklahoma passed a similar law the year before. And while the United States is one of few countries that doesn’t mandate paid family leave at the federal level, 13 states and the District of Columbia have established their own paid family leave rules.
Meanwhile, the historic cuts to Medicaid enacted as part of the GOP’s Big, Beautiful Bill Act will shift health costs to states, leaving experts worried that family caregivers could lose Medicaid-funded services they rely on.

Lockhart,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/28/ceo-pay-disparity-executive-paywatch-ct/,"The report shows that 14 Connecticut S&P 500 CEOs earned an average of $19,511,538, while the median wage for workers in CT was $58,400.","In 2024, CEOs at America’s leading companies saw pay increases that outpaced the wage growth of employees, widening pay disparities across the country and in Connecticut, according to a new report released by the nation’s largest collective of labor unions. 
In its annual Executive Paywatch report released last week, the AFL-CIO found that CEO pay at S&P 500 companies increased 7% in 2024 to an average of $18.9 million in compensation, while median worker pay increased 3% over the same period. The report found that the average CEO pay was 285 times higher than national median worker pay of $49,500, up from the 268-1 ratio the report found last year. 
When it comes to executive compensation, the “average CEO pay is growing and fueling economic inequality,” the report notes. 
While the pay disparity between CEOs and workers differs by industry and region, disparities are seen nationwide, including in Connecticut, which has seen rising inequality as extreme wealth and poverty exist in close proximity, according to the report.  
The numbers in the report are not an apples-to-apples comparison, however. The report looks at average CEO compensation, which can include CEO salary, bonuses, stock options, and other incentives. For workers, the report uses data on median pay, not average pay, from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Average calculations can be highly swayed by extreme outliers, where median calculations are less susceptible to extremes.
A recent analysis by the Associated Press of 344 executives of companies in the S&P 500 and found a median CEO pay of $17.1 million.
Also, the worker data focuses on the annual median wage for workers across all occupations. This data does not include the cost of additional employee benefits like health insurance and retirement accounts, and it includes part-time workers. 
Still, the AFL-CIO argues that the report offers helpful insights into disparities between the country’s highest earners and people making far less. Other research into CEO and worker pay, including an annual study by the Associated Press, has also found evidence of a significant pay gap that has grown considerably wider since the 1980s. 
“These numbers only begin to scratch the surface of how runaway executive pay is fueling economic inequality,” Fred Redmond, the AFL-CIO’s secretary-treasurer, told reporters last Wednesday.
The federal budget reconciliation bill signed into law earlier this month could widen the gap even more, the report claims. Under the new law, tax cuts first enacted in 2017 will be made permanent. The law also cuts funding for social safety net programs like Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. 
The report estimates that, with the tax cuts, the average S&P 500 CEO could save around $489,000 a year. A worker making between $53,300 and $92,000 a year, meanwhile, would save roughly $1,510 a year under the tax cuts. 
“In order to give massive tax cuts for the wealthy, this budget increases the deficit, will kill jobs, make health care more expensive and create a long wake of economic pain for the rest of us,” Redmond said. 
CEO-worker pay disparities in Connecticut
The AFL-CIO report provides a range of data on CEO and median worker pay, including breakdowns by industry and by state. 
The report shows that 14 Connecticut S&P 500 CEOs earned an average of $19.5 million and a median of $17.9 million, while the median worker in the state made $58,400, creating a 334-1 ratio between the two. The 66 chief executives of all Connecticut companies listed in the report had an average salary of about $9 million and a median salary of about $6 million.
When the AFL-CIO broadened the numbers to include CEOs outside the S&P 500, it found that Connecticut CEOs in its data set collected an average of $8,516,044. The disparity between CEOs and the median worker decreased to 146-to-1. 
The AFL-CIO report adds another point to a growing pool of data highlighting income and wealth inequality in Connecticut, which despite having a higher median household income and higher median wage than many states, has still seen significant disparities between its highest earners and everyone else. 
Last week, a report from the nonprofit CT Voices for Children examined how the state’s stagnant job growth, high number of unfilled job openings and labor force declines could be boosted by making wages fairer and reducing wage inequality. The organization argued that increasing wages, especially for lower and middle class earners, could help make the state more affordable for working families.
Another report released earlier this month by the National Low Income Housing Coalition, which advocates for affordable housing across the county, offered insights into the growing gap between wages and rental housing costs in the state. 
In the 2025 edition of its annual “Out of Reach” report, the NLIHC found that many workers struggle to afford housing across the country, and that “resources for affordable housing remain insufficient to support the nation’s lowest-paid and lowest-income renters,” a group that is disproportionately likely to be female, Black, Native American or Latino.
This is also true in states with higher minimum wages like Connecticut, which raised its minimum wage to $16.35 earlier this year. 
Despite that being far higher than the federal minimum wage of $7.25, it still isn’t enough to afford a one or two bedroom apartment in the state. The NLIHC notes that a Connecticut worker would need to make $28.68 per hour to afford a one-bedroom at the HUD fair market rent rate of $1,491. To afford a two bedroom at a fair market rent of $1,842, the same worker would need to make $35.42 per hour — over two times the state minimum wage. 
The report finds that the difference between wages and housing costs make Connecticut the 11th most expensive state for housing in the country. Without higher wages or more affordable housing, single minimum wage and lower-income workers must work more hours, in some cases more than 80 hours a week, to afford housing in the state.
Chris DiPentima, president and CEO of Connecticut’s Business and Industry Association, did not directly respond to a request for comment about the wage disparities highlighted by the recent reports. But DiPentima noted in a statement to The Connecticut Mirror that while the state’s higher median wage and its educated workforce are an asset, it also faces a labor force decline that must be addressed.
For DiPentima, addressing that issue will require a multifaceted approach, one that includes improving affordability in the state. 
“The high cost of living is a significant impediment for Connecticut’s workforce,” he said. “It’s critical that public and private sector leaders work closely and identify creative, sustainable solutions for making this a more affordable and attractive place to live, work, and do business.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/IMG_5427-scaled.jpg,,,2025-07-28 16:56:44.570202

While officials say the machines can be used for legitimate purposes, red and blue states are increasingly imposing new regulations to protect consumers: AARP says 11 states have recently passed new laws or regulations of the machines.
“In state after state, AARP found lawmakers on both sides of the aisle and local law enforcement eager to work on commonsense rules that balance innovation and consumer safety,” Nancy LeaMond, AARP’s executive vice president and chief advocacy and engagement officer, said in a news release.
Last year, the FBI reported nearly 11,000 complaints of cryptocurrency ATM fraud. Those cases disproportionately affected older Americans and cost victims $246.7 million.
Cryptocurrencies are digital assets, including bitcoin, that offer an alternative payment or method without control of a central bank or government like other currencies. Crypto ATMs, sometimes called crypto kiosks, allow users to insert cash or use debit cards to convert currencies such as U.S. dollars into cryptocurrencies.
The Federal Trade Commission says crypto ATM scams often start with a call or text message warning of a supposed problem, such as unauthorized bank charges or suspicious activity on an Amazon account.
The FTC says consumers should contact banks or other institutions directly about any account issues. And it warns consumers not to believe anyone who says they must use a crypto ATM to address a financial problem.
“Real businesses and government agencies will never do that — anyone who does is a scammer,” the agency said.
After signing a bill with new regulations, Nebraska Republican Gov. Jim Pillen was clear that the state would continue to welcome cryptocurrency businesses as it aims to become a hub for the industry.
The Nebraska law requires ATM operators to acquire state licensure, warn customers of the potential for criminal exploitation and take “reasonable steps to detect and prevent fraud.” The law also limits transactions to $2,000 per day for new customers and $10,500 for existing customers, and requires operators to issue refunds for properly reported fraudulent transactions.
At least 40 states have introduced legislation regarding cryptocurrency, digital or virtual currencies and other digital assets in the 2025 legislative session, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Those measures include ATM regulations, prohibiting the use of digital currencies by governments and allowing state investment in digital assets.
Federal lawmakers are also taking action on the issue. The Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives declared the week of July 14 “Crypto Week,” when lawmakers considered several pieces of legislation.
At the end of that week, President Donald Trump signed into law the GENIUS Act, the first major law governing digital currency. It establishes a regulatory framework for the industry.
Trump hopes the bill will instill confidence in the industry that spent heavily to strengthen its legitimacy and political might, The Associated Press reported.
“This signing is a massive validation of your hard work and your pioneering spirit,” the president told crypto executives.
In state legislatures, new bills regulating crypto ATMS have enjoyed bipartisan support. AARP tracking shows new bills have been approved in Arkansas, Iowa and Oklahoma, as well as in more liberal states such as Maryland and Vermont.
In May, Arizona Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs signed Republican-sponsored legislation that sets daily transaction limits and mandates crypto ATM operators provide customers certain disclosures and warnings.
The legislation followed local news coverage of at least two dozen crypto scams, including one that cost an Arizonan $28,000.

(Miles Maguire | courtesy of the photographer)Republican lawmakers are proposing a state law to  limit tuition increases after the University of Wisconsin system approved another tuition hike earlier this month. 
The Board of Regents voted earlier this month to increase tuition by 5% at most UW campuses. UW-Green Bay is the exception with a 4% tuition increase after opting out of an additional 1%. UW-River Falls received a 5.8% increase in tuition to help support student success initiatives. 
According to the UW system, the increase will be an average of about $382. 
The draft bill, coauthored by Sen. Andre Jacque (R-New Franken) and Rep. David Murphy (R-Greenville), would prohibit the University of Wisconsin Board of Regents from increasing undergraduate tuition by more than the consumer price index increase in a given year. The authors said the latest increases were “roughly double the increase in the Consumer Price Index over the past year.” 
“Now more than ever, the Legislature must implement a common sense law placing controls on these types of skyrocketing tuition increases,” the lawmakers wrote in a cosponsorship memo. “That’s why we are again introducing legislation to cap tuition and fee increases for in-state Wisconsin undergraduates at levels no higher than the rate of inflation.”
UW spokesperson Mark Pitsch said in a statement responding to the bill that the UW is “among the most affordable across the U.S.” 
“It is critical that we have the flexibility to maintain the quality that students deserve and parents expect,” Pitsch said. 
UW President Jay Rothman proposed the tuition increases earlier this month following the signing of the new state budget, which provided a little over $250 million to the UW system — an amount that fell below the requests the system had said would be necessary to avoid tuition increases. 
“After a decade of a tuition freeze and lagging state aid, we believe we have struck a balance for students and families with this proposal and the recent state investments in the UWs as part of the 2025-27 biennial budget,” Rothman said in a statement at the time.
This is the third consecutive tuition increase since the end of the 10-year tuition freeze — a trend that comes as state funding makes up a smaller portion of the UW system’s budget.
State funding currently makes up about a fifth of the UW’s total revenue. In contrast, state general purpose revenue made up 41.8% of the UW System’s budget in 1984-85. 
Regent Ashok Rai said that even with the state investment, there continues to be a gap between the funding and the UW system’s ability to keep up with inflation and compensation increases for faculty and staff. 
“The proposed tuition rates will ensure that UWs remain affordable compared to our neighboring peers,” Rai said.
According to the UW, its tuition increased just 7.7% from 2015 to 2025 — a rate below the tuition increases for its peers in other states, which had tuition increases ranging from 21.7% to 28.8% over the 10 years.

Larry Rhoden speaks to reporters on July 28, 2025, at the Public Safety Administration Building in Sioux Falls. (John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)SIOUX FALLS — The state of South Dakota will spend more time and money in the coming months to police the streets of Sioux Falls, and to help federal agents deport immigrants who lack legal status.
The work will support the state’s fast-growing city, Gov. Larry Rhoden said, and help the state’s seven federal immigration agents add to their current arrest tally of 262 in the state since President Donald Trump took office.
Rhoden made the announcement Monday morning at the Sioux Falls Public Safety Administration Building.
The governor spoke from a podium that was adorned with a logo. The logo included a depiction of a buffalo, in sunglasses and a state trooper hat, and the words “Operation Prairie Thunder.”
Representatives of state, county, city and federal law enforcement agencies fanned out from either side of the governor in the center’s press room, alongside prosecutors, state Department of Corrections officials, Sioux Falls Mayor Paul TenHaken and Sioux Falls Republican state Rep. Greg Jamison.
“This is a comprehensive, targeted public safety initiative to protect South Dakotans,” Rhoden told reporters.
ICE support from prison system, National Guard
On the immigration side, Rhoden told the press he’d committed the prison system and state’s part-time military force to help federal agents deport people living in the country illegally.

Six members of the South Dakota National Guard will do paperwork on behalf of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a move Rhoden said would free up those agents to search streets and communities for people to detain and deport. Three will work in Sioux Falls, three in Rapid City.
The prison system, meanwhile, will move to sign what’s known as a 287(g) agreement with ICE for jail and detention, and offer transportation of detainees to and from the regional ICE headquarters in Minneapolis. Corrections Secretary Kellie Wasko said the state could continue to both move all the inmates it needs to and offer courier services to ICE – state officers would first need to complete federal training, she said – without adding additional transport officers.
The state has identified 11 people in DOC custody for likely removal, Rhoden said. Most are nonviolent offenders nearing the end of their prison terms, he said, “so it doesn’t make sense for us to continue to hold them.”
Each will first have their case reviewed by the state Board of Pardons and Paroles. Inmates facing possible deportation typically serve out their sentences prior to the commencement of deportation proceedings, and would need to be paroled to be released to ICE. For those among the 11 in state prison custody who committed violent offenses and have time remaining on those sentences, Rhoden said he hopes ICE will work with their home counties to make sure they’re detained upon arrival.
Sam Olson, field office director for ICE, said the moves from Rhoden are a welcome counterweight to the efforts of uncooperative “sanctuary cities” and jurisdictions across the U.S.
The initiative will help ICE “extend the reach we have,” he said.
The Highway Patrol signed a 287(g) agreement with ICE earlier this year, as did the South Dakota Division of Criminal Investigation. The Minnehaha County and Hughes County sheriff’s offices have 287(g) agreements at the local level.
Highway Patrol: Saturation patrols, extra troopers
On the Sioux Falls policing side of the initiative, South Dakota state troopers will perform two saturation patrols per month in the city and surrounding areas. The patrol will use its helicopter as necessary to aid in drug law enforcement, and help the prison system’s parole absconder apprehension team to find and detain parolees who’ve stopped checking in. 
South Dakota Attorney General clarifies scope of immigration enforcement agreement

The 10-15 additional saturation patrol troopers come on top of the eight additional troopers Rhoden stationed permanently in Sioux Falls in February, at a one-time cost of $1 million and an ongoing cost of $1.4 million a year. 
Sioux Falls officials and lawmakers have raised concerns – and proposed bills in Pierre – to address illegal street racing in the city in recent years. On top of targeting drug dealers and gang activity, Rhoden said, “this should also help with those efforts.”
Mayor TenHaken said violent and property crime in the city are at a five-year low, but said he welcomes the help to stay ahead of the city’s population growth. 
“About a third of the state’s population is now in the Sioux Falls metro area, so in Sioux Falls, we really value our partnerships,” the mayor said.
Rhoden said the Highway Patrol would absorb the additional cost. The state hasn’t calculated a dollar amount, he said, adding “I don’t think that’s significant enough to where we identified where that would come from, but I assumed it would be general fund dollars.”

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – The Oklahoma County Sheriff’s Office is investigating allegations that pictures of naked women were seen last week on a television in State Superintendent Ryan Walters’ office.
The Office of Management and Enterprise Services referred the matter to Oklahoma County Sheriff Tommie Johnson, said Aaron Brilbeck, a spokesman for the Sheriff’s Office, on Monday.
Last week, Senate President Pro Tem Lonnie Paxton, R-Tuttle, announced that an investigation was underway and that he had tasked the Office of Management and Enterprise Services with looking into the “bizarre and troubling situation” where two state Board of Education members reported seeing naked women on the television screen in Walters’ office during a July 24 executive session  
The Oklahoma County Sheriff’s Office has assigned an investigator to the case who will determine if anything illegal happened, Brilbeck said.
The probe is “very much in the preliminary stages,” he said.
An Office of Management and Enterprise Services spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
On Friday, The Oklahoman and NonDoc reported that State Board of Education members Ryan Deatherage and Becky Carson reported seeing the images. 
Board members have said Walters was confronted about the images during the closed door meeting and has not apologized.

Walters has been a vocal critic of pornographic materials and other sexualized content in public schools and sought to ban some books that he said contained it from school library shelves.
“Any suggestion that a device of mine was used to stream inappropriate content on the television set is categorically false,” Walters said in a statement released Sunday. “I have no knowledge of what was on the TV screen during the alleged incident, and there is absolutely no truth to any implication of wrongdoing.”
He has called the allegations “politically motivated attacks” by a broken establishment afraid of real change.
The board has questioned Walters’ actions in recent months, including his authority to require schools to provide free lunches to all students and about a controversial test he wants to require California and New York teachers to take.

Free.,European imports to see 15% tariffs after Trump strikes trade deal,Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/european-imports-see-15-tariffs-after-trump-strikes-trade-deal,,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump and European Union leaders announced a trade framework over the weekend, just days ahead of Trump’s self-imposed Friday deadline to increase import taxes and his emergency tariffs come under scrutiny in federal appeals court Thursday.Under the agreement, a 15% tariff will be applied to all products, with some exceptions, coming into the U.S. from the 27 member nations that make up the EU.The 15% rate will also apply to automobiles, down from the 25% levy on foreign vehicles that Trump ordered in April. Trump’s 50% sectoral tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum will remain unchanged for the EU. The deal exempts certain products, including aircraft, from tariffs altogether.Tariffs are import taxes paid to the U.S. government by businesses and other buyers that import foreign goods.“Fifteen percent is not to be underestimated, but it was the best we could get,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told reporters during a press conference Sunday.Similar to the deal Trump announced with Japan on July 23, the EU has agreed to invest $600 billion in the United States over Trump’s term. The bloc of nations has also agreed to purchase $750 billion in U.S. energy, including liquid natural gas, over the next three years as a way to wean off of Russian fossil fuels.‘Fundamentally rebalancing’The White House touted the deal as “fundamentally rebalancing the economic relationship between the world’s two largest economies,” in a press release issued Monday.The U.S. imported more goods from the EU than it exported by about $235.8 billion in 2024, according to Census data.Trump had threatened to raise what he describes as “reciprocal” tariffs — tariffs on products outside sectoral categories of steel, aluminum and vehicles —  to 30% by Aug. 1 on products from Europe, Japan and numerous other trading partners.Trump set the date as the new deadline for his “Liberation Day” tariffs to take effect. The president announced the tariffs in early April and then promptly paused them after markets plummeted around the globe. The episode triggered a trade war with China, during which U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods peaked at 145% before the two parties agreed to negotiate.Appeals case looms

On what the president described as “Liberation Day” on April 2, Trump heralded a universal 10% tariff on all foreign products, plus staggering additional so-called reciprocal import taxes on countries across the globe that carry trade imbalances with the U.S.Trump justified the steep duties by declaring trade imbalances a national emergency under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.In February, Trump became the first president to trigger tariffs under the 1977 emergency powers law when he increased import taxes on Canada, Mexico and China in response to illegal fentanyl smuggling.The emergency tariffs are at the center of a case that will go before the U.S. Appeals Court for the Federal Circuit Thursday.The case stems from two lawsuits, now consolidated, filed by a handful of businesses and a dozen Democratic state attorneys general who argued the president doesn’t have authority to impose tariffs under the emergency law.The U.S. Court of International Trade struck down Trump’s emergency tariffs as unconstitutional on May 28.Arizona, Colorado, Maine, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico and Oregon were among the states that brought the suit.V.O.S. Selections, a New York-based company that imports wine and spirits from 16 countries, led the business plaintiffs. Others included a Utah-based plastics producer, a Virginia-based children’s electricity learning kit maker, a Pennsylvania-based fishing gear company and a Vermont-based women’s cycling apparel company.Upon appeal from the White House, the Federal Circuit allowed Trump’s tariffs to remain in place while the case moved forward.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/themes/custom/sn/images/icons/No_image.svg,,,2025-07-28 16:56:44.570202

(Danielle Prokop/Source NM)In June of 2024 during the 118th Congress, House Republicans failed to renew the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA) despite two attempts by Senate Republicans, leaving victims of nuclear testing and uranium mining without compensation for related health conditions. As affected people in Utah and other Western states struggled to support themselves with their health conditions, communities rallied for RECA’s reinstatement, collecting hundreds of public comments and conducting meetings with Sen. John Curtis, R-Utah, and Rep. Blake Moore, R-Utah, to discuss the importance and positive impacts of RECA.
RECA was initially passed in October of 1990 and provides compensation for victims of nuclear weapons testing, known as “downwinders,” and people employed in the uranium industry who developed certain eligible diseases as a result of that exposure. However, compensation was limited to only a handful of Western states and downwind counties, and only covered a few health conditions.
In mid-June of this year, Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., announced that expansions to RECA would be included in the controversial Budget Reconciliation Bill — also known as “the Big Beautiful Bill” by members of the Republican Party. 
The Budget Reconciliation Bill focuses primarily on supplying  $4.5 trillion in tax cuts for the ultra-rich. It also takes aim at immigrants, providing billions for the U.S.-Mexico border wall, additional ICE agents and Border Patrol officers, and migrant detention facility beds. Notably, health care and other life-saving services are under attack by the bill, which will result in millions of Americans losing access to Medicaid and food stamps. The bill will also rapidly phase out Biden-era tax credits for wind and solar, driving up energy costs and making the energy grid less reliable. This bill will add $4.1 trillion to the national debt, something that directly clashes with the Trump administration’s stated goals. Overall the bill will harm everyday Utahns to pay for tax cuts for billionaires. The RECA expansion is a small but notable exception that will benefit Utahns and Americans across the West. 
The provision will expand areas eligible for compensation for nuclear downwind radiation to all of Utah, New Mexico, and Idaho, as well as to Arizona’s Mohave county; Nevada’s downwind coverage areas will remain the same. Exposure eligibility dates will be extended from 1958 through to November of 1962. Compensation for on-site participants and “downwinders” will also be increased to $100,000, from $75,000 and $50,000 respectively. Certain communities in Missouri, Tennessee, Kentucky, and Alaska impacted by radioactive waste will be provided coverage as well. For uranium miners, coverage is expanded to other mining roles and additional health impacts that were previously uncovered. It is also extended to workers affected between the years of 1971 and 1990 who were previously left without coverage under the prior parameters of RECA. 
These provisions will greatly benefit individuals affected by nuclear radiation and provide relief to many Utahns and others who have been left without compensation since RECA expired in June of 2024. The RECA expansions will particularly benefit residents of New Mexico, a primary location for nuclear weapons testing, which did not have downwinder coverage under RECA prior to the expansion. Native American residents of these areas have been disproportionately impacted by the effects of nuclear testing and have for long gone without proper reparations.
Though these provisions will be greatly beneficial, there is much that is left out of the RECA expansion that was desired by Utahns. Previous successful claimants are not eligible to receive the difference between their first claim and the updated $100,000 claim. As coverage is expanded to many impacted areas, Idaho, Montana, Colorado, and Guam are all left out of the downwind expansion. There is also no proposed study on the human and ecological health at the Amchitka nuclear test site in Alaska, where the U.S. government detonated nuclear weapons in the late 1960s and where the effects of nuclear radiation can still be seen.
The RECA expansion is a small positive in a very grim piece of legislation. It is ironic that this expansion, which Utahns and other communities have been fighting for so long to secure, is included in a harmful piece of legislation with the express aim of restricting health care from so many. It is one benefit for certain Americans while so many others suffer. This RECA expansion will benefit a handful of people who need the additional support that it would potentially provide; it is welcome that this RECA expansion has been passed, but it should not be forgotten that it arrives as so many Americans lose access to health care and other vital services.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Tina-Cordova_082124-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-28 16:56:44.570202

This is California’s 35th suit against the Trump administration.,"In summary
The Trump administration told states to provide the data by July 30 or risk losing federal funding to administer the program. This is California’s 35th suit against the Trump administration.



California, 18 other Democrat-led states and Washington, D.C. are suing the Trump administration to halt the U.S. Department of Agriculture from collecting sensitive information about people who receive federal food vouchers, known as SNAP.
The Trump administration told states to provide the data by July 30 or risk losing federal funding to administer the program. California receives $1.3 billion annually to distribute about $12 billion a year to 5 million residents who rely on the food vouchers, called CalFresh in California. About 13% of the state’s population receives the aid.“The purpose of what the Trump administration is doing here is to target immigrant communities,” said Michigan’s Attorney General Dana Nessel, during a press conference today. She said Trump’s actions “send a chilling effect to American citizens, and to tell them that if they apply for programs that they are perfectly entitled to under law, their most personal and sensitive data is going to be shared with all kinds of people, and it’s going to have the impact, and I think it already is, of scaring people away from seeking these increased incredibly important programs.”
Residents without lawful legal status in the U.S. are not eligible for SNAP benefits. However, during Trump’s first term, he proposed eliminating benefits even for “mixed-status” families where at least one person in a household lacks legal status. 
In another example of policies that put California at odds with the Trump administration’s effort to crack down on immigrants living in the U.S., the state has tried to expand food benefits to some immigrants without legal status. In 2022, California became the first state in the nation to offer about $165 a month in food benefits to about 35,000 immigrants, mostly to recent green card holders. That expansion was part of the California Food Assistance Program, or CFAP, a state-funded version of food stamps.
Advocates for that effort argued many farmworkers toil in fields for decades at low wages, providing food to the rest of the nation, and then are unable to buy enough to eat, especially when they become senior citizens. 
Why states are suing
Attorneys general that are filing the suit argue that the Trump administration’s policy is “arbitrary and capricious,” violates the 10th Amendment that protects states’ rights as well as various privacy laws.“We’re seeing a number of different cases recently where there’s this Spending Clause violation, where new conditions that Congress never put on the funding are being added by the executive branch after the fact,” said California Attorney General Rob Bonta. “They can’t do that.” 
The suit will be filed today in the federal Northern District of California. It is the 35th time in 27 weeks that California has sued the Trump administration. 
“SNAP applicants provide their private information on the understanding, backed by long-standing state and federal laws, that their information will not be used for unrelated purposes,” Bonta said.
The Trump administration has tried to tap several state databases to quickly amass troves of sensitive personal information about hundreds of millions of people. Using that information is part of Trump’s effort to fulfill his campaign promise of carrying out the largest mass deportation effort in U.S. history. 
His administration says collecting the data is aimed at preventing waste and fraud. Trump issued an executive order in March that ordered his administration to have “unfettered access to comprehensive data from all state programs that receive federal funding.” In May, NPR reported that the administration sought Social Security numbers, addresses and, for one state, citizenship data, for SNAP recipients. The orders came from the U.S. Department of Agriculture and DOGE, the previously Elon Musk-led White House office that sought to slash government spending and was met with numerous lawsuits.Bonta said the Department of Agriculture “has never once asked states to turn over private and sensitive data on such a massive scale.” Now, it seeks five years of data about recipients, according to the attorneys general.
California has already sued Trump for his administration’s efforts to collect personal data from people who rely on government services.

Nessel added that California and New York, the states leading the suit, contribute more in taxes to the federal government than they receive in federal services.

OKLAHOMA CITY — Oklahoma’s Republican governor was selected to become the chair of the National Governors Association for the next year.
Gov. Kevin Stitt was tapped by his peers during their summer meeting in Colorado Springs to lead the group, which represents the leaders of 55 states, territories and commonwealths. Stitt’s term will run from 2025 to 2026.
Maryland Democratic Gov. Wes Moore was selected to serve as vice chair and as the 2026-2027 chair-elect.

In a statement, Stitt said he will focus on “Reigniting the American Dream,” by highlighting stories from across the country. He said he plans to work with governors, policy experts, business leaders and philanthropists to “discuss best practices and policies that promote the American Dream for all.”

“The beautiful thing about the American Dream is that there are as many dreams as there are people,” Stitt said. “In a time where all we hear is about how divided we are, let’s remind them that we agree on this: the American Dream doesn’t need to be reimagined, it needs to be reignited. Governors are in a unique position to lead this charge. I’m grateful for the trust of my fellow Governors as we start this journey together.”
Stitt said he’ll prioritize creating economic opportunities, on-the-job educational experiences for youth and will focus on artificial intelligence.
“We all want to create a brighter future for our states, and the nation,” Moore said in a statement. “When we get together at the National Governors Association, we’re focused on whether an idea is good, not on where the idea came from. I’m looking forward to collaborating with my fellow governors to build stronger on-ramps to opportunity so every person in our states has a shot at success — no matter how they define it.”
The following governors were selected to serve on the group’s executive committee: Jared Polis, Colorado; Josh Green, Hawaii; Mike Braun, Indiana; Jeff Landry, Louisiana; Maura Healey, Massachusetts; Michelle Lujan Grisham, New Mexico; and Bill Lee, Tennessee. Polis is the immediate previous NGA chair.

Between 2016 and 2022, as congenital syphilis cases rose nationally and especially in the South, Mississippi saw a one thousand percent increase — from 10 to 110 — in the number of newborn babies who were hospitalized after contracting the disease, known to cause developmental issues, intellectual disabilities, and even death.
So in 2023, the state Department of Health mandated that all medical practitioners screen for the disease in pregnant mothers, and it has been running advertisements to spread awareness.
Annual congenital syphilis cases in Mississippi rose from 62 in 2021 to 132 in 2023, according to state data. The number fell to 114 last year. There have been 33 cases so far this year.

That work won’t stop despite potential budget cuts, Dr. Daniel Edney, Mississippi’s state health officer, said in an interview. “We’re going to keep doing what we have to do, you know, to keep it under control.”
State by state, public health departments take a similar approach: They monitor, treat and try to stem preventable diseases, alongside their host of other duties. But in the coming year, health department officials — with their agencies already strapped for cash — fear they’ll find it much more difficult to do their jobs.
President Donald Trump’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2026 would cut the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention budget by more than half, from $9.3 billion to $4.2 billion. The proposal serves as a wish list from the administration, a blueprint for the Republican-controlled Congress as it works through upcoming spending legislation.
If lawmakers hew to Trump’s vision, then state and county public health departments would be hit hard. States contribute to their own health departments, but a lot of them rely heavily on federal funding.
And around half of local public health department funding comes from federal sources, primarily the CDC, as noted in a 2022 report from the National Association of County & City Health Officials.

“The federal government provides a lot of funding, but the actual implementation of public health programs happens at the state and local level,” said Josh Michaud, associate director of global health policy at KFF, a health policy research group. “Each state has its own approach, in many ways, to how public health programs are overseen, how they’re funded, how they are implemented.”
In announcing his department’s share of the proposed budget, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said Trump’s goals align with “new priorities in reversing the chronic disease epidemic.”
But many local health leaders point to the longtime mission of state public health departments in preventing the spread of disease.
“Local public health is on the front lines preventing communicable disease, operating programs to prevent chronic disease, ensuring our septic and well water systems are safe,” said Dr. Kelly Kimple, acting director of North Carolina’s Division of Public Health within the Department of Health and Human Services.
“I’m very concerned,” Kimple said, “especially given the magnitude of funding that we’re talking about, as we can’t keep doing more with less.”

Clawing back COVID-era grants

Other federal budget cuts also have states worried.
Many state public health departments grew alarmed when the Trump administration announced in March that it would be clawing back $11.4 billion in COVID-era funding for grants that were slated to extend into 2026.
Twenty-three states and the District of Columbia sued. A federal district court in Rhode Island temporarily blocked the cuts, and the case remains tied up in court.
The court’s preliminary injunction may not protect temporary staff or contractors, though. Public health departments have been laying off staff, cutting lab capacity and reducing immunization clinics, said Dr. Susan Kansagra, chief medical officer for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.

Historically, public health departments receive funding in “boom and bust” cycles, meaning they tend to get more federal support during emergencies, said Michaud, of KFF. But “since the Great Recession of 2008, there was a general decline in public health support funding until the COVID pandemic.”
For example, KHN and The Associated Press reported that between 2010 and 2019, spending on state public health departments declined by 16% per capita and spending for local health departments fell by 18%.
Nationally, syphilis cases reached historic lows in the 2000s, thanks to robust prevention efforts and education from public health officials. By 2022, however, cases reached their highest numbers nationally since the 1950s.
“In the wake of the COVID emergency, you’ve seen a sort of backlash to what people had been calling the overreach of public health and imposing vaccination requirements and lockdowns and other public health measures,” Michaud told Stateline.

Smallpox, cholera and typhoid

Public health departments and officials go back to the 19th century, when there was a greater emphasis on sanitation efforts to prevent spread of diseases such as smallpox, cholera and typhoid, which were rampant at the time.
By the end of the century, 40 states had established health departments, which to this day are responsible for water sanitation, tracking the spread of disease, administering vaccinations, furnishing health education, providing screenings for infants and some prenatal care for moms at local clinics, offering family planning services, and tracking and treating sexually transmitted infections, among other things.










What we're seeing now is a complete upheaval of the funding going into public health.


– Josh Michaud, associate director of global health policy at KFF


Kimple pointed to measles as a current example of a disease that’s spreading fast. When North Carolina’s health department detected a case in the state, she said, the department “identified and contacted everyone who might have been exposed, helped people get tested, worked with doctors to make sure they knew how to respond.”
That’s the legacy of local public health, Michaud said.
“The federal government cannot decide, ‘This public health program will happen in this state, but not that state,’ that kind of thing. And cannot declare a national lockdown. The COVID pandemic tested a lot of those boundaries. It really is a state and local responsibility to protect public health. And that’s always been the case, since the beginning of our country,” Michaud said.
“And what we’re seeing now is a complete upheaval of the funding going into public health.”

A major cut in services

Kimple said she’s seen recent progress in her state in the support for funding public health.
“North Carolinians viewed our work as highly important to improving health and well-being in the state, and appreciated the local presence, the reliable information, the role in prevention and efforts to protect, in particular, vulnerable communities,” she said.
Similarly, Edney said that Mississippi state lawmakers were showing more support, despite some setbacks in 2016 and 2017. New federal cuts could throw a wrench in the health department’s economic plans and its ability to reach small communities.
“Now the federal rug is being pulled out from under us,” he said.
Edney said he expects the federal share of his department’s public health funding to fall from its current 65% to around 50%.
Edney said he’s been trying to strengthen Mississippi health department’s longevity by diversifying its revenue streams by, for example, accepting private donations.
The state will not stop doing its “core” work, he said, regardless of federal funding.
“We’re not going to cut back on services at the county health department, because what we do now is all mission critical,” Edney said.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-07-28 20:01:24+00:00,CT Mirror,Education Dept. says it will release billions in withheld school grant money,Associated Press,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/28/education-release-billions-school-grant-money-trump/,The Trump administration is releasing billions of dollars in grants it had withheld to schools for a wide array of programs.,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration is releasing billions of dollars in withheld grants for schools, the Education Department said Friday, ending weeks of uncertainty for educators around the country who rely on the money for English language instruction, adult literacy, and other programs.
President Donald Trump’s administration had suspended more than $6 billion in funding on July 1, as part of a review to ensure spending aligned with the White House’s priorities.
The funding freeze had been challenged by several lawsuits as educators, Congress members from both parties and others called for the administration to release the money. Congress had appropriated the money in a bill signed this year by Trump.
Last week, the Education Department said it would release $1.3 billion of the money for after-school and summer programming. Without the money, school districts and nonprofits such as the YMCA and Boys and Girls Club of America had said they would have to close or scale back educational offerings this fall.
The Office of Management and Budget had completed its review of the programs and will begin sending the money to states next week, the Education Department said.
Republican senators pressed the Trump administration to release the money
A group of 10 Republican senators on July 16 sent a letter imploring the administration to allow the frozen education money to be sent to states, saying the withheld money supported programs and services that are critical to local communities.
“The programs are ones that enjoy longstanding, bipartisan support,” U.S. Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., said Friday. She pointed to after-school and summer programs that allow parents to work while their children learn and classes that help adults gain new skills — contributing to local economies.
In withholding the funds, the Office of Management and Budget had said some of the programs supported a “ radical leftwing agenda. ”
“We share your concern,” the GOP senators had written. “However, we do not believe that is happening with these funds.”
School superintendents had warned they would have to eliminate academic services without the money. On Friday, AASA, an association of superintendents, thanked members of Congress for pressing to release the money.
Grants supported camps and other programs for working families
In Harford County, Maryland, some of the withheld federal money made up more than half the budget for the district’s annual summer camp for kids learning English. The money helps the district hire certified teachers to staff the camp, incorporating learning into children’s play for four weeks during the summer. The program helps kids keep their English and academic momentum over the summer.
The district serves roughly 1,100 students who are non-native English speakers. Many of them are born in the U.S. to parents who came to the area seeking job opportunities, often in the restaurants and warehouses that have popped up in the past decades in the region northeast of Baltimore. During the school year, the soon-to-be-released federal money pays for tutors for kids learning English.
On Thursday, more than 350 children filled the second floor of Bel Air High School for the second-to-last day of summer camp. Young learners crowded around an alphabet wheel, jostling with each other to push each letter button as they thought of foods starting with letters from A to Z.
Middle school students watched a robotics team demonstration, and a few sheepishly raised their hands when asked if they would be interested in joining. High school student volunteers, some of whom had been campers learning English themselves not many years ago, helped the youngest children with art projects.
The uncertainty around the funding was an unnecessary distraction for schools, said U.S. Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wa.
“Instead of spending the last many weeks figuring out how to improve after-school options and get our kids’ reading and math scores up, because of President Trump, communities across the country have been forced to spend their time cutting back on tutoring options and sorting out how many teachers they will have to lay off,” Murray said.
The grants that were under review included $2 billion for teachers’ professional development and efforts to reduce class size; $1 billion for academic enrichment grants, often used for science and math education and accelerated learning; $890 million for students who are learning English; $376 million to educate the children of migrant workers; and $715 million to teach adults how to read.
It added up to millions of dollars for the nation’s largest school districts. Data available from the Census for three of the grant programs — teacher development, academic enrichment, and bilingual education — shows the Los Angeles Unified School District, for example, received $62 million in the 2022-23 school year. Philadelphia’s school district got $28 million, while Miami’s got over $24 million.
Smaller districts got more modest amounts, but they still would have represented sizable gaps in their budgets. For example, schools in Burlington, Vermont; Pine Bluff, Arkansas; and Norristown, Pennsylvania, each got more than $300 per student from the same three grant programs.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/EDUCATION-TRUMP-FREEZE-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-28 16:56:44.570202

Robert Cameron Grant was initially charged with 21 crimes, including 14 counts of sexual exploitation of a child, connected to photos and videos of his 16-year-old girlfriend, court records said. 
Grant pleaded guilty to two counts of attempted sexual exploitation of a child. 
But in appeals, Grant said he wasn’t told about the Kansas statute, informally called the Romeo & Juliet law, that would have changed his plea. 
The law provides milder criminal penalties when two teenagers engage in voluntary sexual behaviors, provided the older teen is less than 19 years old and the age difference is less than four years, among other criteria, court records said. 
Grant appealed to the Sedgwick District Court, the Kansas Court of Appeals and finally the Supreme Court before winning the chance to argue that he didn’t receive proper representation.
The Court of Appeals in September 2024, with one dissenting voice from Judge Kim Schroeder, ruled that even if the Romeo & Juliet law had been applied to Grant’s case, it would not have affected the outcome. 
“If these defenses were not available to him, then his attorney could not have been incompetent for failing to advise him of them,” Judges Karen Arnold-Burger and David Bruns wrote. 
They added, “To correct manifest injustice the court after sentence may set aside the judgment of conviction and permit the defendant to withdraw the plea.”
However, they did not find that a manifest injustice had been committed. On the other hand, Schroeder said that if Grant did not receive notification about all options, he should receive an evidentiary hearing. 
“To be clear, I am not saying Grant received ineffective assistance of counsel; I am just saying he has sufficiently raised a fact question for the district court to resolve after an evidentiary hearing,” Schroeder said. “Thus, I would reverse and remand for an evidentiary hearing to determine whether Grant’s counsel discussed these matters with Grant prior to entering his pleas.”
The Supreme Court agreed with Schroeder that the Romeo and Juliet statutes could apply and could have “potentially reduced or eliminated his felony liability.”
The case will return to district court for an evidentiary hearing to determine whether or not Grant was told about the Romeo and Juliet law.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/sup-ct-grant-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-28 15:56:43.455855

(Photo courtesy Reno Fire Department)Hundreds of goats will mow down dead vegetation across hilly terrain in Reno over the next month in an effort to reduce wildfires in an area prone to burning.
Buildup of dead vegetation in Evens Creek, a wetland area bordered by homes, has created a wildfire hazard the Reno Fire Department hopes to mitigate by introducing 250 goats that will eat away dry brush for the next 45 days.
“They’re working all day long,” said Reno Fire Chief Dave Cochran.
The move comes as wildfire season approaches its peak this month. Wildfire season in Nevada typically lasts from late summer to early fall, but in recent years the season has lengthened due to climate change.
Last year, nearly 860 wildfires burned about 104,000 acres of land across Nevada, according to the Nevada Division of Forestry.
In northwest Reno, where thousands of houses have been built in the urban wildland interface, the impact of the fires can be especially devastating.
Northern Nevada experienced one of the most economically destructive wildfires in recent memory last year. About 20 miles south of Reno, the wind-driven Davis Fire rapidly burned through nearly 6,000 acres of land. The fire drove the evacuation of about 20,000 people and ultimately destroyed two commercial buildings and 14 homes.
With less precipitation than normal across much of Northern Nevada this spring, a prolonged heat wave, and fields of flammable grasses, the region is at greater risk of widespread wildfires this year.
“We are seeing a very high threat of wildfire, and it’s increasing every day that goes by,” Cochran said.
The goats, from High Desert Graziers in nearby Smith Valley, are bred to consume a wide variety of non-native grasses and weeds that fuel wildfires including bitterbrush, manzanita, and cheatgrass.
Those non-native grasses and weeds typically die off in the summer, unlike native species, creating dangerous fuel for wildfire.
It’s the fourth time the city has used goats for fire mitigation. Like other years, the goats will be corralled to specific areas by a temporary solar-powered electric fence, and under the watch of guard dogs.
Cochran said the dogs are also there to protect the goats from being eaten by animal predators, or stolen by humans.
“People love goats, so that’s a concern as well,” he said.
The goat grazing operation will cost the city about $67,500. It’s funded in part by state legislation passed in 2022 that allocates funding to the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources for wildfire prevention, restoration, and long-term planning.
“Targeted grazing is an environmentally friendly and sustainable option for managing noxious weeds and flammable vegetation,” said Reno City Ward 2 Councilmember Naomi Duerr. “We’re proud to continue this creative approach.”
Wildfire managers say it takes a suite of approaches to prevent wildfires, including manual brush clearing, herbicides, and prescribed burns.
Goats have proven to be a cost-effective way to clear dry vegetation in difficult to reach terrain like steep bluffs and cliffs near homes.
“It’s low tech, and it’s very cost-effective. They target exactly what we need,” Cochran said.
Studies looking at whether goats’ grazing can reduce the severity or impact of wildfires are scarce, but some research does suggest targeted grazing significantly reduces the grasses and weeds they goats were introduced to control.
In Arizona, some scientists have observed that land cleared of excess vegetation by goats acts as fire breaks and can stop wildfires in their tracks.
Anecdotally, Cochran said goats have had positive, long-lasting effects on previous areas they grazed.
“Goats are a great tool to do that. They work from dawn till dusk. They actually eat non-native and invasive species of plants. They just take it down to the dirt,” Cochran said.
Despite the positive impact of goats, Cochran emphasized the need for federal action when it comes to wildfire response and mitigation.
Ongoing cuts, funding freezes and hiring pauses brought on by President Donald Trump’s executive orders shrinking the federal workforce have weakened the nation’s already strained firefighting force by hitting support staff who play crucial roles in preventing and battling wildfires.
The Trump administration stated the U.S. Forest Service has reached 99% of its firefighting hiring goals, but documents obtained by ProPublica show a high vacancy rate, as well as internal concern among top officials responsible for wildfire response.
“There’s no department in the country that can handle these giant fires by themselves. You need local resources, state resources, but you also need a lot of federal resources, and if they’re not funded, that puts a dent in our ability to respond to these fires. We are keeping an eye on that. We’re very concerned,” Cochran said.

(Photo by Christine Sexton/Florida Phoenix)Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier announced Monday that his office is opening an investigation against the “climate cartel” for alleged violations of the state’s consumer-protection or antitrust laws.
In a press release, Uthmeier said his office has issued subpoenas to CDP (formerly the Climate Disclosure Project) and the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi), neither of which immediately responded to Florida Phoenix’s requests for comment.
“Radical climate activists have hijacked corporate governance and weaponized it against the free market,” Uthmeier said in the release. “Florida will not sit back while international pressure groups shake down American companies to fund their ESG grift.”
“ESG” is an acronym for  environmental, social, and corporate governance, criteria sometimes used in gauging whether to invest in a company. The theory is that social responsibility is good for business, but some conservatives consider the approach “woke.”
“We’re using every tool of the law to stop the Climate Cartel from exploiting businesses and misleading consumers,” Uthmeier said.
CDP is an international nonprofit the operates an independent environmental disclosure system that allows companies, capital markets, cities, states, and regions “to manage their environmental impacts,” according to CDP’s website. The organization boasts that 1,000 cities, states, and regions have disclosed environmental information.
SBTi, an acronym for science-based target initiatives, is a company that develops standards, tools, and guidance for companies to set greenhouse gas  emission reduction targets in line with what is needed to  reach net-zero by 2050. SBTi was co-founded by CDP, the United Nations Global Compact, We Mean Business Coalition, the World Resources Institute (WRI), and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF).
According to the SBTi 2023 Monitoring Report “any profits generated by SBTi Services Limited will be gifted to the charity.”
The AG’s press release says Uthmeier’s investigation will examine “deceptive trade practices” and potential antitrust violations, including whether coordination between CDP, financial institutions, and investment services constitutes unlawful market manipulation; and whether CDP’s efforts to pressure or punish companies that don’t participate is anticompetitive.

(Photo by Perry Beeman/ Iowa Capital Dispatch)My family has called Davis County home for 185 years, all the way back to when William D. Evans and William Henson climbed down from their wagons in 1839 and 1840, a half-dozen years before Iowa became a state.
Evanses, Hensons and their neighbors were on the town square in Bloomfield in 1877 when the cornerstone was nudged into place in the new county courthouse. Construction of the grand stone building with its soaring clock tower was a testament by those pioneers that this part of rural America, and the new county seat town, needed a home for local government and a fitting gathering space for meetings, speeches, elections and other civic events.
Voters demonstrated their faith in their local leaders when they authorized the building’s construction. The price tag came to about $60,000 — the equivalent of about $2 million in today’s money.
That courthouse is 148 years old this autumn. Davis County residents still go there to pay their taxes, get marriage licenses, record real estate deals, and make their way to the second-floor courtroom for trials and court hearings.
It is a tribute to successive generations of government officials that the picturesque building still serves the role our ancestors first envisioned in the years immediately after the end of the Civil War.
This commitment and loyalty is not unique to Davis County. You see this in places like Dubuque, Iowa City and Sioux City, too. No one has proposed — at least not seriously, and at least not lately — bulldozing the ornate Dubuque County Courthouse for a more “efficient” building, tearing down the distinguished Pentacrest buildings at the University of Iowa, or turning the eye-catching Woodbury County Courthouse in Sioux City into rubble.
But this commitment to long-term investment in government buildings hit a snag this year when the Legislature voted to demolish the Henry A. Wallace Building northwest of the Iowa Capitol. You may not recognize the building by its name. But you surely recognize the building by its signature design feature, a massive bank of gold-tinted windows that reflect the Capitol on the other side of Grand Avenue.
The office building is only 47 years old. The reason the state plans to spend about $7 million to bulldoze the building is a reflection — a poor reflection — of an all-too-common practice in our nation these days. We have become a disposable society that places more stock in acquiring, rather than maintaining, and that includes buildings as well as consumer goods.
It is one thing if corporations opt for this newer-is-better-and-less-expensive thinking. But government officials, when they ignore upkeep and maintenance, risk alienating taxpayers who pay for the courthouses, schools and office buildings.
State leaders from both political parties are guilty of this. They let Iowa taxpayers down in the name of saving money.
They ignored the Wallace building’s mounting issues, instead of dealing with them swiftly. The issues included heating and ventilation problems, air quality concerns, a leaky roof and lead contamination left from when the Department of Public Safety’s indoor shooting range was there.
The Wallace building was completed in 1978 at a cost of $10.4 million. Factoring inflation, that is about $55 million in today’s dollars.
The nonpartisan Iowa Legislative Fiscal Agency estimated it would cost $85 million to deal with the Wallace building’s maintenance issues and needed renovations. You could almost see the bulldozers approaching the building before the Legislature’s demolition authorization earlier this year.
In 2023, the state used federal Covid pandemic relief  money to buy a vacant office building on the southwest side of Des Moines, about 5 miles from the Capitol. The Department of Natural Resources and Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing moved there from the Wallace building soon after the purchase. The Department of Public Safety moved out of the Wallace building in 2007. This summer, the Department of Agriculture, the last Wallace tenant, moved to the Herbert Hoover Building southeast of the Capitol.
State officials have not decided whether to sell the Wallace land and an adjacent parking ramp after the building is demolished or hang onto the site for its long-term strategic value because of its proximity to the Capitol.
By this time next year, all that will remain of the Wallace building will be memories and photographs of its window reflections.
Of course, there also will be questions lingering whether state officials have learned any lessons from government’s failure to be a good steward of the taxpayers investment in the building through the decades.

Voters have a right to know who’s trying to influence our elections, our laws, and ultimately, our lives.
Yet despite overwhelming public support for transparency, a growing number of states are pushing so-called “donor privacy” bills that do exactly the opposite. North Carolina’s Senate Bill 416 – approved by the General Assembly and vetoed by Gov. Josh Stein — is one of them.
Senate Bill 416 is part of a nationwide strategy—backed by the corporate-funded American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC)—to make it harder for the public to track political money. ALEC is a powerful political group where corporations and conservative politicians work together to write laws—often behind closed doors. These cookie-cutter bills appear in statehouses across the country, often benefiting big business and harming everyday people.
Since at least 2018, ALEC and its network have quietly advanced “privacy” legislation that creates legal shields for dark money groups. These bills use the language of civil liberties to hide the real goal: protecting wealthy donors who want to influence elections from the shadows.
In North Carolina, this effort isn’t new. Governor Roy Cooper vetoed a similar bill, Senate Bill 636, in 2021, calling it a “solution in search of a problem.” Republican Governor Rick Snyder of Michigan said the same when he vetoed an ALEC-backed version in 2018. Now the same bad policy is back, rebranded but just as dangerous.
Senate Bill 416 would restrict public disclosure of donors not only to charitable organizations like 501(c)(3)s, but also to political nonprofits like 501(c)(4)s, labor organizations under 501(c)(5), and business leagues under 501(c)(6). These are the very groups most often involved in political advocacy and campaign-adjacent activities. Under this bill, wealthy special interests have more tools to keep their spending hidden from the public–even if they’re spending millions to sway elections.
Worse, the bill opens a major new loophole. Unlike its 2021 predecessor, Senate Bill 416 removes protections that require disclosure of donors to Legal Expense Funds—a serious red flag. Under current law, politicians must disclose who’s paying for their legal bills. But under SB 416, a candidate could set up a Legal Expense Fund as a 501(c)(4) and hide every single donor. That’s a gift to corruption and a threat to fair governance.
We’ve already seen how vital transparency can be. In the last election, Judge Jefferson Griffin attempted to throw out more than 65,000 votes in a Supreme Court race. Thanks to disclosure laws, the public learned that his legal fund received $5,000 from a sitting Court of Appeals judge. That raised real concerns about judicial bias and the need for recusal. Senate Bill 416 would’ve kept that donation secret—and kept voters in the dark.
Supporters of the bill argue it’s about protecting donor privacy and preventing harassment. But the legal system already accounts for that. The U.S. Supreme Court’s rulings in NAACP v. Alabama (1958) and Buckley v. Valeo (1976) guarantee protections for individuals at real risk of retaliation. Groups facing legitimate threats can—and do—receive exemptions. This bill goes far beyond those protections. It’s not about shielding vulnerable donors. It’s about shielding political influence.
This bill isn’t about mom-and-pop donors getting harassed. It’s about making it easier for deep-pocketed interests to anonymously fund elections, policy campaigns, and legal challenges without ever being held accountable. If lawmakers are truly concerned about protecting individuals from harassment, they should codify the legal standards already laid out in NAACP v. Alabama and Buckley v. Valeo. Instead, this bill creates a sweeping exemption that disables oversight, ties the hands of regulators, and protects the powerful.
And let’s not forget the stakes. Under Senate Bill 416, state contractors could anonymously fund the very lawmakers who award them contracts. That’s not privacy—it’s a recipe for pay-to-play politics. Voters deserve better than a system that invites bribery and blocks oversight.
This playbook isn’t new. After years of watchdogs exposing dark money networks, the backlash began. A front group with ALEC ties was formed in 2018 to push “donor privacy” laws, and they’ve since distributed toolkits to help legislators sell these bills to the public. It’s a carefully orchestrated campaign to keep political money hidden while pretending it’s about protecting everyday donors.
One night around a campfire during the pandemic, my teenage daughter asked her five-year-old sister, “Are we rich?” Without hesitation, our youngest shot back, “No—we have rules. Rich people don’t have rules.” That innocent observation cuts to the core of Senate Bill 416. Is our democracy designed to serve the wealthy—or to represent we the people?
North Carolina can and must do better. We need smart, targeted reforms that shine a light on dark money—not laws that deepen the shadows. Senate Bill 416 would take us in the wrong direction, putting voters last and secret donors first.
Let’s call this bill what it is: a shield for influence-peddlers and a setback for democracy. North Carolinians deserve a government that is accountable to the people—not one that bends to the will of hidden donors and special interests. Governor Stein was right to veto Senate Bill 416. Now, it’s up to the legislature sustain that veto. Lawmakers must stand with the overwhelming majority of voters who believe in transparency and reject efforts to hide political money in the dark. Our democracy depends on it.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_pac-dark-money.jpg,,,2025-07-28 15:56:43.455855

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)State corrections officials wrongly relied on old medical records to deny release to an incarcerated man with brain cancer, the New Jersey Supreme Court unanimously ruled Monday in a case that highlights problems in how officials vet requests from sick inmates hoping to get out of prison early.
The man, identified only as M.R. in court records, applied for compassionate release in February 2023, and two doctors consulted medical records that were 29 months old to conclude that he was neither terminally ill nor permanently incapacitated, according to the ruling. The man appealed, and an appellate panel ultimately upheld the denial.
The man died in custody in June 2024, a month after he asked the state’s top court to review his case. While his death technically made his case moot, the justices decided to consider it anyway, because “the issue raised is of substantial importance and capable of repetition yet evading review,” Justice John Jay Hoffman wrote.
Attorneys supporting M.R. had sought a decision declaring that compassionate release applicants must be examined in person for doctors to decide whether they are terminally ill or permanently incapacitated, conditions required for early medical release under the Compassionate Release Act. But the justices found that while the law requires “examinations,” it is silent on whether those evaluations must be in person, Hoffman wrote.
“If the Legislature intended that diagnoses be rendered solely through ‘physical’ examinations, it would have stated as much, as it has done on numerous other occasions,” Hoffman wrote, citing workers’ compensation and other laws that require “physical examination.”
Hoffman added that while reviewing medical records counts as “examinations” under the law’s verbiage, the law also requires such examinations to be timely. He pointed to a provision in the law that notes compassionate release requires a determination of “whether the inmate is eligible for compassionate release.”
“Due to the potential for dynamic and unpredictable changes in the condition of inmates suffering from rapidly declining physical or mental health … contemporaneity is essential, particularly for a statute written in the present tense,” Hoffman wrote.
Hoffman also knocked the doctors’ records, noting that their only explanation for deducing that M.R. wasn’t physically incapacitated was that he did not require 24-hour care.
The justices, consequently, decided the Department of Corrections’ denial of M.R.’s request was arbitrary, capricious, and unreasonable.

Hoffman quoted from a Murphy administration press release from 2020 to chastise the department for denying M.R.’s request.
“This Court cannot rubber-stamp agency decisions that rely upon conclusory findings that fail to comport with the contemporaneity required by the CRA. Nor can we ignore the basic underpinning of compassionate release: ‘Our treatment of those within our prisons is a reflection of our humanity,’” Hoffman wrote.
Daniel Sperrazza, a department spokesman, did not respond to a request for comment.
The state Office of the Public Defender represented M.R., and the Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers of New Jersey filed a supporting brief and also argued M.R.’s cause before the court.
Monday’s decision was one of several the state Supreme Court has issued in recent years seeking to clarify the Compassionate Release Act. The act, which went into effect in early 2021, replaced a similar law, passed in 1997, that was so restrictive hardly anyone used it.
In 2023, the justices decreed that judges can deny compassionate release in ‘extraordinary’ cases, such as those involving defendants who were convicted of particularly heinous, cruel, or depraved offenses, those whose victims were vulnerable because of disability or age, and those whose crimes targeted government or law enforcement.
In 2022, they clarified what “permanent physical incapacity” means, ruling that gravely ill people seeking freedom under the law don’t have to prove they are wholly, permanently physically incapacitated to get out of prison.

Democratic U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich and a Republican colleague are seeking a clearer picture of how wildfires affect homeowners’ access to insurance, as insurers in New Mexico and across the country increasingly cancel or refuse to renew policies. 
Heinrich of New Mexico and U.S. Sen. Tim Sheehy (R-Montana) introduced the “Wildfire Insurance Coverage Study Act of 2025” last Thursday, a bill that would empower the Government Accountability Office to conduct a wide-ranging study of wildfires’ effect on private insurers’ behavior over the last decade. 
“I’m hearing from more and more New Mexicans who’ve seen their insurance premiums skyrocket, lost coverage entirely or been priced out of protecting their homes. That is completely unacceptable,” Heinrich said in a news release.
The bill would require the GAO to create a detailed picture of wildfire risk across the country, as well as examine where and whether insurers’ have raised rates, declined to provide coverage or pulled entirely out of certain markets. It will also examine what state interventions, if any, have worked, according to the legislation.
NM GOP and Democrats say state needs to fix home insurance, as disasters upend private market

“Families deserve fair, transparent coverage they can count on,” Heinrich said. “We need a clearer picture of how worsening wildfires and climate risks are impacting insurance companies’ decisions to raise insurance premiums.”
The bill has been referred to the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. 
According to the state Office of the Superintendent of Insurance, which regulates and monitors insurance products offered across New Mexico, 13% of state properties are uninsured, which is the second-highest rate in the country, behind only Mississippi. An actuary at the OSI testified earlier this year that the state’s top 10 insurers increased premiums 60%, on average, since 2022.
The OSI has not reported any insurers pulling out of New Mexico entirely, but said in a news release earlier this month that the state’s top 10 insurers declined to renew more than 10,000 policies between Jan. 1, 2021 and July 1, 2024. The regulator observed a “significant jump” in non-renewals in 2023, a rate that remained high in 2024.
Fires making home insurance unaffordable, impossible, NM lawmakers say

Also, a recent, first-of-its-kind study from the Federal Insurance Office examined insurance data in about 200 of New Mexico’s roughly 260 ZIP codes. Among other findings, researchers discovered that in 2022 insurance companies chose not to renew insurance policies in the state at a higher rate than the national average in 152 of the 200 ZIP codes it analyzed.
In 2022, New Mexico suffered a historic wildfire season, with the two biggest-ever wildfires in state history, including the Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon in northern New Mexico and the Black in southern New Mexico. Each burned more than 300,000 acres. 
Ruidoso-area lawmakers have also said homeowners have increasingly complained about premium hikes and cancellations since the South Fork and Salt fires last summer.
The federal study also found that, in 21 ZIP codes across the state, private insurers paid out more in claims and other expenses than they generated in premiums.
During the most recent legislative session, several proposals aimed at revamping the state’s so-called “insurer of last resort,” known as the Fair Access to Insurance Requirements plan, were considered to make it cover more people and provide more coverage. Additional proposals would have shaken up the board overseeing the FAIR plan, which is now composed of insurance industry leaders, to require it to include a climate scientist and a disaster expert, among other changes.
The legislation did not pass, but the FAIR plan board did vote to increase coverage limits from $350,000 to $750,000 for private homes and up to $1 million for commercial properties, which is in line the failed legislation. 
Why the state’s insurance regulator thinks SB81 will save New Mexicans’ homes from wildfire

Increasing the coverage cap to $750,000 is expected to increase the number of FAIR plan holders from about 7,000 to about 11,000, state insurance officials have said.
OSI Superintendent Alice Kane has said she is seeking additional changes to the FAIR plan, which is only offered to homeowners who have been denied coverage in the private market. Changes include increasing coverage limits for commercial property owners and also implementing requirements that FAIR plan recipients mitigate wildfire risk to their properties. 
Kane will provide additional updates to an interim legislative committee Wednesday in Los Alamos at 12:45 p.m. Kendra Zacharias, the chair of the FAIR plan board, is tentatively expected to join her, according to a meeting agenda.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/IMG_0116-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-28 15:56:43.455855

Holstein was elected chairman during the summer meeting of the state executive committee in Morgantown Saturday. 
“It was an honor. It was obviously an honor,” Holstein told West Virginia Watch Monday. “I’m still humbled, but we worked hard and we had a lot of great discussions. 
“Folks, I think they see past age,” he said. “And they see willingness, drive and somebody that’s actually eager to make positive change. I’m very grateful to the members of the state executive committee for placing their trust in me.”
Holstein said increasing communication is one of his first priorities as party chair. 
“I think as a party, that’s where we failed in recent years,” he said. “Realizing and recognizing that our audience is on several different social media platforms, and people obtain news in many different ways now. Meeting people where they are, essentially, is what we’ve got to do,” he said. 
Holstein, of Ashford, is a graduate of Sherman High School and Marshall University, according to his biography from the House of Delegates. He runs an advertising firm and has a license to substitute teach. He was first elected to the House in 2020.
He joins the Republican National Committee as the youngest of its 168 members across the country, the GOP said in the news release.
Holstein said the party will also reach out to independent voters to let them know about changes to the Republican primary election next year. 
Beginning in 2026, the GOP primary will be open only to voters who are registered Republicans and will be closed to unaffiliated voters. The executive committee voted last year to close the primary as a way of encouraging voters to register as Republicans. 
Holstein said the party would also focus on county and municipal races, something that hasn’t been a major focus in recent years. 
Republicans hold the majority in both bodies of the state Legislature, the governor’s office, the state’s congressional delegation and the presidency. 
“We’re fairly dominant on the state and legislative level, obviously, but we still lack in municipal level races and on the county level,” he said. “So we’ll be focusing on that and working with our respective county chairs and senatorial district folks to accomplish those goals over the next few months.”
Holstein takes the place of former GOP chairman Matt Herridge, who stepped down effective Saturday. Herridge was appointed state commerce secretary in January.

Minnesota is expected to lose $1.4 billion in federal funding over the first four years of the law’s implementation. 
The budget law puts its tax breaks into effect this year while delaying many of its health insurance cuts until 2026, after the midterm elections. John Connolly, Minnesota’s Medicaid director, said at a press conference that the cuts and new eligibility requirements will be “a dramatic change for Minnesota.” 
“The bill specifically targets low-income adults without children, saddling them with additional paperwork, forcing more frequent administrative hoops, and imposing medical bills,” according to a DHS fact sheet on the cuts to Medicaid, which in Minnesota is known as Medical Assistance. 
The bill mandates new work reporting requirements and eligibility checks for low-income adults, which DHS says will cause some formerly eligible recipients to lose coverage —  while increasing administrative costs. 
Despite Republicans’ stated goal, the new Medicaid work requirement won’t have much of an impact on the number of enrolled people working; according to Urban Institute, 91% of people ages 19 to 55 enrolled under Medicaid expansion already meet the work reporting requirements or exemptions. The added paperwork, however, could trip up enrollees and force them off Medicaid — as many as 80,000 Minnesotans, according to DHS. 
The bill also creates new cost-sharing requirements for some adults without children; decreases retroactive coverage; prohibits funding for some family planning and reproductive health providers for a year; and restricts people with lawful immigration statuses — such as refugees — from Medicaid coverage.
One in four Minnesotans receive health care coverage from Medicaid or MinnesotaCare, the state’s health insurance program for the working poor. Children make up the biggest proportion of Medicaid recipients at 42% but account for a low percentage of spending. Adults 65 or older and people with disabilities represent 15% of enrollment but 60% of spending. Overall, Medicaid covers a larger proportion of nonwhite and rural populations. 
The bill will limit provider taxes, which are taxes on health care providers that states use to help fund Medicaid, as well as state-directed payments, which hospitals use to gain larger federal Medicaid reimbursements. 
Rural hospitals — many of which depend on Medicaid patients — are expected to be significantly affected by the changes, particularly the limits on state-directed payments. Although the Trump law sets aside $10 billion annually for five years for rural health services, DHS says this is unlikely to offset the cuts and new costs for providers.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Medicaid-1024x661.jpeg,,,2025-07-28 15:56:43.455855

“Last first day!” cheered Superintendent Errick L. Greene, prompting a smile from the senior striding past.
Across the city, students went back to school Monday for the start of the new year. For some, it was their first day in a classroom. For others, like Rakeem Burney, it would be the last time they celebrated the first day of grade school. 
“It’s my senior year, but it hasn’t really hit me yet,” he said, dressed sharply in sparkling white sneakers. “I’m just excited to meet all my teachers and embark on this journey and everything this year will bring. The fact that the superintendent came, too, means a lot to me.”
That was the goal, Greene said. By showing up on the first day, he wanted to show students his support and commitment to them.
“This is where the magic happens,” he said. “For all of the back of the office things I have to do, the most important thing is to be here, to observe what’s going on but also to be visible with scholars and team members. They need to know I’m part of this work on the ground.

As some students entered the high school with cell phone imprints clearly visible in their jean pockets, administrators warned them to put their devices in their backpacks, out of reach. 
Phones were already banned at JPS schools, but the board approved a stricter policy over the summer in an effort to curb bullying, violence and miscommunication with parents. 
It’s part of Greene’s vision for the school year — a safer, more scholastically successful and well-staffed district. He said academic excellence remains a top focus for JPS, but there’s also work to be done around district culture. That includes supporting teachers and strengthening communication with families.
And the work starts from day one, he said.
Just down the block at North Jackson Elementary School, preschoolers were learning for the first time how to behave in a classroom. Greene joined them later that morning, stacking rainbow blocks on a brightly colored rug, while principal Jocelyn Smith circled the classroom, troubleshooting and smiling at the young students.
Despite her cheeriness, by 9 a.m. on Monday, Smith had been awake for hours. 
“The first day for me is just like for the children,” said Smith, who’s been working in education for three decades. “I couldn’t sleep last night. I was too excited to see the children.”
For the elementary students, the first day is essential to the rest of the year, she said.
“They get an introduction to the curriculum … they learn our procedures and how to be safe,” she said. “But most of all, they start learning our expectations for them, and they start to build a relationship with their teachers.”
In a different classroom up the hall, Rakesia Gray was figuring out what her third graders would be interested in reading this year. She passed out a worksheet, and asked her students to circle the topics they liked best. 
“On the first row, tell me which one you’d rather read out,” she said. “Polar bears or penguins?”
The room was silent. Students shyly glanced at each other.
“Come on now,” Gray said, laughing. “Y’all have gotta talk to me!”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/28110528/3X0A9602.jpg,,,2025-07-28 15:56:43.455855

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)They may resemble other ATMs, but officials are increasingly warning about the potential for fraud with the expanding fleet of cryptocurrency ATMs popping up across the country.
The National Consumers League says the largely unregulated machines have become favored by scammers for their anonymity and irreversibility — once a user transfers or deposits funds, that money is essentially gone.
While officials say the machines can be used for legitimate purposes, red and blue states are increasingly imposing new regulations to protect consumers: AARP says 11 states have recently passed new laws or regulations of the machines.
“In state after state, AARP found lawmakers on both sides of the aisle and local law enforcement eager to work on commonsense rules that balance innovation and consumer safety,” Nancy LeaMond, AARP’s executive vice president and chief advocacy and engagement officer, said in a news release.

Last year, the FBI reported nearly 11,000 complaints of cryptocurrency ATM fraud. Those cases disproportionately affected older Americans and cost victims $246.7 million.
Cryptocurrencies are digital assets, including bitcoin, that offer an alternative payment or method without control of a central bank or government like other currencies. Crypto ATMs, sometimes called crypto kiosks, allow users to insert cash or use debit cards to convert currencies such as U.S. dollars into cryptocurrencies.
The Federal Trade Commission says crypto ATM scams often start with a call or text message warning of a supposed problem, such as unauthorized bank charges or suspicious activity on an Amazon account.
The FTC says consumers should contact banks or other institutions directly about any account issues. And it warns consumers not to believe anyone who says they must use a crypto ATM to address a financial problem.
“Real businesses and government agencies will never do that — anyone who does is a scammer,” the agency said.
States look at shoring up consumer protections as Trump hobbles federal watchdog

After signing a bill with new regulations, Nebraska Republican Gov. Jim Pillen was clear that the state would continue to welcome cryptocurrency businesses as it aims to become a hub for the industry.
The Nebraska law requires ATM operators to acquire state licensure, warn customers of the potential for criminal exploitation and take “reasonable steps to detect and prevent fraud.” The law also limits transactions to $2,000 per day for new customers and $10,500 for existing customers, and requires operators to issue refunds for properly reported fraudulent transactions.
At least 40 states have introduced legislation regarding cryptocurrency, digital or virtual currencies and other digital assets in the 2025 legislative session, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL). Those measures include ATM regulations, prohibiting the use of digital currencies by governments and allowing state investment in digital assets. In Pennsylvania, six bills are pending in the legislature according the the NCSL.
Federal lawmakers are also taking action on the issue. The Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives declared the week of July 14 “Crypto Week,” when lawmakers considered several pieces of legislation.

At the end of that week, President Donald Trump signed into law the GENIUS Act, the first major law governing digital currency. It establishes a regulatory framework for the industry.
Trump hopes the bill will instill confidence in the industry that spent heavily to strengthen its legitimacy and political might, The Associated Press reported.
“This signing is a massive validation of your hard work and your pioneering spirit,” the president told crypto executives.
In state legislatures, new bills regulating crypto ATMS have enjoyed bipartisan support. AARP tracking shows new bills have been approved in Arkansas, Iowa and Oklahoma, as well as in more liberal states such as Maryland and Vermont.
In May, Arizona Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs signed Republican-sponsored legislation that sets daily transaction limits and mandates crypto ATM operators provide customers certain disclosures and warnings.
The legislation followed local news coverage of at least two dozen crypto scams, including one that cost an Arizonan $28,000.

Deborah Ross (NC-02)We’re now six months into the second Trump administration and recent weeks, in particular, have been filled all kinds momentous and often disturbing news from Washington. Topping the list, of course, is the massive new budget reconciliation package – what supporters dubbed the “one, big, beautiful bill” that the president signed into law on July 4th.
Unfortunately, as recent reports and analyses from an array of nonpartisan experts have made clear, the impacts from the bill will be anything but beautiful. Among other things, the new law promises to end life sustaining health insurance coverage and food assistance for millions of people while bestowing huge new tax breaks on the nation’s wealthiest individuals. One of the most articulate critics of the legislation is North Carolina second district congresswoman Deborah Ross – and recently Newsline’s Rob Schofield caught up with Ross in her Washington office for a special two-part conversation on the mega-bill and several other recent developments.
In Part One of the  extended conversation with Congresswoman Ross, we discussed the massive new mega-bill signed into law recently by the president and the disastrous impacts that it’s all but sure to have throughout North Carolina.
In Part Two of our chat, we delved into some of the other issues roiling the nation’s capital at the six-month mark of the second Trump administration – including the political right’s war on public education, public broadcasting, and clean energy, and most recently, the deeply disturbing effort to hide law enforcement files regarding President Trump’s past longtime relationship with the late convicted sex trafficker, Jeffrey Epstein.

(Photo by Jnaiah Price)Twenty-eight-year-old Michaela Bonner has been working 12-hour shifts as an emergency medical technician in Norfolk, Virginia, for the past four years, while attending and paying for college to finish her prerequisites for medical school.
But now that President Donald Trump’s signature tax and spending law bars students from borrowing more than $50,000 annually in unsubsidized federal loans for medical school, Bonner is worried her dream of becoming a doctor is financially out of reach.
“I get told, ‘Well, we really need you. We have a physician shortage, and you’ve done all this work leading up to this point,’ and that’s true as well, and it’s not that I want to quit,” Bonner said in a recent interview. “But there are no systems in place that I can rely on to support me now that I can’t take out the full cost of living through loans.”
The tax and spending law includes provisions that significantly alter the student loan process for higher education. The law halts current student loan repayment plans for loans that are granted on or after July 1, 2026. On that date, the law also terminates Grad PLUS loans, which have helped people pay for their higher education degrees and total cost of attendance. Current borrowers will be grandfathered in.
The federal law gives current borrowers enrolled in loan repayment plans for students based on income — such as those plans known as SAVE or IBR — until July 1, 2028, to switch to a new plan. Interest collection will resume Aug. 1 for students enrolled in the Biden-era SAVE plan.
At the same time, medical or law school students hoping to get unsubsidized federal loans — in which the borrower is responsible for paying the interest at all times rather than the government — will only be able to borrow $50,000 per year, with a $200,000 lifetime cap. Those seeking advanced degrees in areas such as history or philosophy have a $100,000 lifetime cap.










There are no systems in place that I can rely on to support me now that I can't take out the full cost of living through loans.


– Michaela Bonner, aspiring medical student


The average yearly cost of medical school for the 2024-25 academic year ranged from around $42,000 to $72,000, depending on whether the school was private or public and whether the student was a resident or nonresident, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges.
Some congressional Republicans say students need to be working harder to pay for higher education, like medical school, on their own. Others say the caps put the onus back on colleges and universities to rein in the rising cost of tuition. But critics of this legislation say the loan caps are only going to harm students, especially from lower-income backgrounds, and will exacerbate physician shortages.
In recent years states have tried to ease physician shortages by implementing various policy solutions. Since 2023, at least nine states have made it easier for doctors trained in other countries to get medical licenses. States have also participated in interstate licensing compacts, allowing nurses and physician assistants to travel across state lines to work, so long as they are licensed in one state within the compact.
For student loan relief, more than 20 states have enacted legislation to address student loan forgiveness, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, a group that tracks states policies. Georgia passed a measure that will expand a cancelable loan program for physicians working in rural and underserved areas. Idaho also created the Rural Nursing Loan Repayment Program, offering nurses $25,000 in forgivable loans after three years of service in a rural area.
McKenzie Richards, a health care policy fellow at the conservative think tank Cicero Institute who has been studying the pace of physician shortages, told Stateline that the national physician shortage could potentially exceed 100,000 by 2034. At the end of 2024 that projected number was closer to 64,000 physicians.
Richards said states will be looking toward more policy solutions should the student loan changes exacerbate physician shortages.
“We know what’s going to be happening coming down the line in just five years, so I think policies that states can adopt to get out of this are really important to be looking at now,” she said.
“The hope is that by capping [federal loans], it will encourage schools to lower tuition prices,” Richards added. “Then maybe they need to be admitting more students, which would have a great downstream effect for getting more doctors through.”
Other students will be in the same boat, said Lesley Turner, an associate professor of public policy at the University of Chicago and an economist.
“This is going to hit some students worse than others,” Turner told Stateline. “Those [students] in more expensive programs tend to borrow more, and so for those students they will need to return to private student loans or other ways of financing their graduate education.”
Many students were already questioning their capacity to go to medical school before the student loan caps, said Shannon Jimenez, dean of the Arkansas College of Osteopathic Medicine.
“I expect that this bill, this cap, is going to push people out of primary care and into specialties to help pay off those higher interest rate loans,” Jimenez told Stateline. She added that caps will likely deter students from lower socioeconomic statuses from going into primary care — important in places like Arkansas, where she says there is a “maldistribution of physicians.”
“Many schools like us try to attract those students, because they’re more likely to go into primary care and serve in underserved areas. So it’s going to tie our hands in a lot of ways.”
Large states and more rural states will feel the gaps more deeply, said Richards, of the Cicero Institute. Louisiana, for example, is projected to be short almost 5,000 doctors from a variety of specialties by 2030, including close to 400 primary care doctors. Already more than a third of Louisiana physicians are close to retirement age — similar to the situation in neighboring Arkansas.
As for whether schools will just be able to lower tuition, Jimenez said, “it makes no sense.”
“We still function in a somewhat market-driven economy and have to compete with other schools around us, so our cost is based mostly on what we have to pay our faculty, and that’s not going to go down,” she said. The annual cost of attendance at her school is between $80,000 and $85,000.
Bonner, the EMT, holds a political communications degree from Regent University and now is studying biomedical sciences at Old Dominion University. She already has $20,000 in loans, she said, and for the rest of college tuition, she has paid out of pocket. Since she’s supporting herself, she hasn’t been able to save much.
She’d planned to take the medical school entrance exam next spring, but now worries about how she’d pay for living expenses while attending. “Medical school scheduling doesn’t allow for working, so you have to take out loans for living expenses,” she said.
“A lot of people, I feel, would be panicked if you had worked for eight to 10 years of your life and found out that all the systems that you were banking on in a really academically challenging space are disappearing,” Bonner said.
“I don’t see a path forward for certain, but I’m fighting to make one.”

Bruce Van Note will retire on Aug. 15 from his position after more than 30 years of a professional transportation career in Maine, according to a news release from the governor’s office Monday. 
Gov. Janet Mills nominated Van Note in 2019 to lead the department after more than a dozen years as deputy commissioner followed by five years as director of policy and planning for the Maine Turnpike Authority. 
“There have been many challenges to overcome including the pandemic, significant increases in construction costs, workforce shortages, extreme storms, and more,” Van Note said. “They made this one of the toughest jobs you’ll ever love, but finding solutions is what we do, and throughout it all, I’m proud of the smart and steady progress we’ve made for the people of Maine.” 
During Van Note’s tenure, MaineDOT completed construction of the Madawaska-Edmunston International Bridge, connecting the U.S. and Canada, as well as the opening of the I-395/Route 9 Connector to move freight traffic from streets in Bangor and Brewer to a more efficient route from Canada to points south. 
Van Note also led the department’s response to the severe winter storms in December 2023 and January 2024 that caused more than $90 million in damage to public roadways and infrastructure. 
Through 2024, the department completed 350 bridge projects, 362 miles of major highway improvements, more than 6,000 miles of paving and $500 million in multimodal capital investments, the release said.
“Commissioner Van Note has been a steady hand at the helm of MaineDOT, guiding the agency through critical investments in our roads, bridges, and infrastructure,” said state Sen. Brad Farrin, lead Republican senator on the Legislature’s Transportation Committee. 
MaineDOT Deputy Commissioner Dale Doughty will serve as acting commissioner following Van Note’s retirement. Doughty previously served as director of the Bureau of Planning and director of the Bureau of Maintenance and Operations.
The department’s commissioner position is a cabinet-level appointment, subject to a hearing before the Transportation Committee and confirmation by the Maine Senate.

“The suggestion that Wyoming is somehow shortchanging or harming students through inadequate funding is a premise detached from reality,” appeal reads. 
The post Citing a lack of evidence, state asks Supreme Court to overturn school funding decision appeared first on WyoFile .","A February ruling that Wyoming has been unconstitutionally underfunding public education brought major implications for the public school landscape across the state. Educators hoped it would result in better teacher salaries and more money for mental health counselors, school resource officers, school nutrition programs and safer buildings.
But in an appeal filed last week, Wyoming attorneys argued that courts should only intervene to compel increased state funding when evidence “clearly demonstrates measurable harm to students, inability to deliver some required aspect of the education program or meet state standards, or declining education quality.” 
That evidence, the state argues, was not presented at trial. 
Citing that lack of “substantial, objective” evidence, the state is asking the Wyoming Supreme Court to overturn Laramie District Court Judge Peter Froelicher’s decision. 
“The suggestion that Wyoming is somehow shortchanging or harming students through inadequate funding is a premise detached from reality,” reads the appeal, filed Thursday. 
In the 106-page filing, Wyoming’s attorneys also argue the case offers an “opportunity to finally lead Wyoming out of the thicket of endless litigation” that has dogged the state’s school funding model. 
However, the facts still stand, plaintiffs who filed the lawsuit say. 
“We believe the Wyoming Constitution is clear, and the state has not followed the funding model required by the Constitution for 15 years,” Wyoming Education Association President Kim Amen said in a statement. “Contrary to their filing, it appears that the state officials are truly the ones detached from reality when it comes to their arguments about education funding.”
The state’s appeal comes as school-choice advocates are anticipating an appeal in another education lawsuit. Judge Froelicher this month issued a preliminary injunction in a lawsuit filed against Wyoming’s new universal school voucher program, the Steamboat Legacy Scholarship Act. That injunction essentially bars the state from releasing any program funds — up to $7,000 per student for private school costs — until the judge determines whether the program is constitutional.

The Wyoming attorney general’s office filed a notice of appeal on July 17, signaling the state will challenge the injunction.
Taken together, the cases are poised to shape the future of Wyoming’s public school system, which serves 92,000 public school students and has historically ranked high nationwide.
The appeal also comes as Wyoming lawmakers have embarked on the 2025 recalibration, an exhaustive and tedious assessment of public education funding mandated every five years. Froelicher’s February order has already influenced the process. 
Litigation thicket
The education funding lawsuit is the latest in a string of court cases going back decades that have delineated the state’s obligations.
The latest suit was filed in August 2022. The Wyoming Education Association, an educator advocacy group with 6,000 members, filed the lawsuit, and eight school districts joined as intervenors to challenge the state.
The suit claimed the state violated its constitution by failing to adequately fund public schools and has withheld appropriate funding at the expense of educational excellence, safety and security. That has left districts to fend for themselves and divert funds from other crucial educational activities, which causes further systemic erosion, the suit contended. 
Article 7 of the Wyoming Constitution states that the Legislature “shall provide for the establishment and maintenance of a complete and uniform system of public instruction.” Landmark court cases further delineated the state’s obligations in the ‘80s and ‘90s.
The more recent of those, the Campbell cases, set the stage for Wyoming’s current school funding obligations. Those cases culminated in 1995 when the Wyoming Supreme Court ordered the state to determine the cost of a high-quality education, fund public schools, adjust funding at least every two years for inflation and review the components of the school funding model every five years to ensure resources are keeping pace with needs and costs.
But Wyoming hasn’t held up its end of the bargain, the WEA suit alleged. 
A six-week bench trial took place in 2024 to deliberate the issue, with plaintiffs bringing a parade of school staffers and education experts who testified on topics ranging from major maintenance projects to school lunches, campus security and staffing.

Judge Froelicher issued his ruling more than six months later, finding the Legislature failed to properly fund the “basket of quality educational goods and services” that the Wyoming Supreme Court in 1995 ordered lawmakers to set, update and fund every two years. 
The judge also found the state failed to properly adjust funding for inflation; failed to provide funding for adequate salaries for teachers and staff; and failed to provide sufficient funding for mental health counselors, school safety resource officers, nutritional programs and computers for students. Lawmakers have failed as well to properly assess school buildings for “educational suitability,” and have allowed inadequate facilities to exist for too long without repair or replacement, he ruled. 
“The State’s failures have affected Wyoming children’s right to a proper education,” the judge wrote. He ordered the state to modify its funding model in a manner consistent with his order “to assure the school financing system for operations and for school facilities are constitutional.”
His ruling has loomed large over the state’s 2025 school recalibration and is expected to factor heavily into the process. 
The state’s argument 
In the appeal, Wyoming attorneys portray a frustrating cycle of litigation.
“The Wyoming legislature has adjusted the current model over the years to improve efficiency and more closely reflect cost estimates,” it reads. “Unhappy with these choices, school districts and their allies again resort to legal action, filing suit to force further adjustments and compel more spending.”
The notion that Wyoming is shortchanging students, it continues, couldn’t be further from the truth. 
“For decades, the legislature has provided funding more than sufficient to provide an equal and high-quality education for all students,” the filing states. “Operational spending for Wyoming schools consistently ranks among the best in the nation. Expenditures vastly outpace every peer state in the region – in some instances by nearly twice as much per student each year. The idea that districts cannot educate children at this level of funding defies reason.”
Despite this “abundance, the demands of the education establishment remain insatiable,” it continues.

The district court’s willingness to oblige educators’ demands raises serious concerns about the “basis on which courts may nullify the actions of a co-equal branch to declare a constitutional violation and effectively force more spending,” the appeal concludes. 
The state’s filing contends plaintiffs did not present sufficient evidence at trial to compel increased education funding. 
“Appellees did not retain a single outside expert to support their claims, and offered virtually no evidence of measurable harm or system-wide impacts from alleged underfunding,” the appeal states. “Their case consisted almost entirely of their own employees’ personal perspectives on recruiting challenges, tightening budgets, things they felt would be helpful to students, and policy preferences for increased school funding.”
The state, meanwhile, responded with verifiable data and expert analysis, it says — evidence that indicated ample funding. The appeal also walks through the tangled history and complicated process of school funding, diving into the minutiae of cost adjustments, labor markets, landmark cases, inflation and other factors. 
Contrary to underfunding public schools, the appeal argues that the state has “spent lavishly” to address school facility needs. 
But the court did not recognize “indicators of overall abundance,” instead relying on a “nearly impossible standard” in Judge Froelicher’s decision. Thus, the appeal asks the higher court to correct the record by aligning with the state’s interpretation.

Mike Collins speaks at a Trump rally in 2024. File photo. Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderU.S. Rep. Mike Collins, a conservative firebrand who represents Georgia’s 10th Congressional District, has entered the GOP primary race for U.S. Senate, touting his MAGA credentials and taking shots at incumbent Sen. Jon Ossoff, a Democrat.
First elected to Congress in 2022 to represent a conservative district that spans east and central Georgia, encompassing Athens and part of the Atlanta metro area, Collins is also the founder and CEO of a trucking company. He is the son of former U.S. Rep. Mac Collins, who was a member of Congress from 1993 until 2005.
The Jackson Republican is entering a rapidly evolving and increasingly competitive Republican primary. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp is reportedly working behind the scenes to support former Tennessee football coach Derek Dooley, who is expected to launch his campaign for Senate soon. Days ago, Insurance Commissioner John King dropped out of the race after a conversation with Kemp, according to the Associated Press. U.S. Rep. Buddy Carter, who represents a coastal Georgia district, is also seeking the Republican nomination, branding himself a “MAGA warrior.”
Collins and Carter may soon be battling for President Donald Trump’s endorsement in the Republican primary, as each seeks to cast himself as the more Trump-aligned pick for the job. (Collins defeated a Trump-backed candidate for his House seat in 2022.) Though Trump and Kemp had reportedly been working behind the scenes to try and find a consensus candidate to endorse, no candidate has publicly emerged from those talks. 
In his announcement video, Collins emphasized his efforts to implement Trump’s agenda on issues like the federal budget reconciliation bill and immigration policy. Collins was the lead sponsor of the federal Laken Riley Act, which requires the expansion of mass detention for immigrants charged or arrested for property crimes. 
Laken Riley, a 22-year-old nursing student at the University of Georgia, was a resident of Collins’ district when she was killed in 2024, sparking a wave of state-wide and federal immigration proposals. Jose Ibarra, a 26-year-old migrant from Venezuela who authorities said entered the country illegally in 2022, was convicted of her killing in November.
Collins also took aim at Ossoff in his announcement video, promising to advocate for more conservative policies at the federal level and “steamroll the radical left.”
“We need a senator who works for Georgia, not the California crazies or New York nut jobs,” Collins said in a campaign video announcing his bid for Senate. “I don’t know who Jon Ossoff really works for, but it sure as heck isn’t Georgia.”
Like Trump, Collins is known for his social media presence, particularly on X (formerly known as Twitter). He has previously had his account temporarily suspended after a post where he appeared to advocate for killing immigrants who commit crimes after entering the country illegally. Last May, he also came under fire for retweeting a video of a group of University of Mississippi students mocking Black antiwar protestors with monkey noises and gestures, adding the caption “Ole Miss taking care of business.” He later backtracked his statement in response to the backlash.
The Democratic Party of Georgia criticized Collins’ bid for office, citing his past history of inflammatory social media comments and support for Trump’s policies.
“This already messy primary will expose just how out of step Collins is with Georgia voters as Republicans duke it out to prove who is more in line with Trump’s toxic agenda, deep Medicaid cuts, and economic chaos,” party chair Charlie Bailey said in a statement.

July 26, 2025 | ScreenshotEnvironmental advocates gathered Saturday in Battle Creek for a day of remembrance 15 years after the rupture of Canadian energy company Enbridge’s Line 6B pipeline, which spilled hundreds of thousands of gallons of oil into a tributary of the Kalamazoo River. 
Although the restoration effort that followed was largely considered a success, the situation caused one of the worst inland oil spills in U.S. history.
Attendees at Saturday’s gathering viewed the 2010 oil spill as a cautionary tale, demanding Enbridge shut down its Line 5 pipeline, which runs through the environmentally sensitive Straits of Mackinac where Lake Michigan and Lake Huron meet. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX“Without the tragedy and the sacrifice that happened here, I don’t know that we would be talking about Line 5 as much as we are today,” said Sean McBrearty, coordinator of the anti-Line 5 Oil and Water Don’t Mix coalition. “Line 6B became an unfortunate cautionary tale that birthed a movement, a movement that says, ‘Never again are we going to let major corporations like Enbridge spill oil into our rivers.’ A movement that says, ‘We’re going to protect our Great Lakes and make sure that the same company responsible for this oil spill does not strike again.’”
Between Michigan’s upper and lower peninsula, Line 5 diverges into a set of dual pipelines for 4.5 miles, with the pipelines transporting more than 22 million gallons of crude oil and natural gas liquids daily through the Great Lakes.
While the pipeline has operated in the straits for more than 70 years, the Kalamazoo River spill has spurred concerns over the consequences of an oil spill in the Great Lakes, which have grown since the discovery of gaps in Line 5’s protective coating. The dual pipelines have also been dented in three segments due to an anchor strike in 2018.
In 2018, Enbridge forged an agreement with the state to replace the dual pipelines with a new segment, housed in a concrete-lined utility tunnel buried within the bedrock beneath the lakes. 
However, environmental advocates argue the pipeline poses too great a risk to keep operating in the Straits of Mackinac, and that constructing the tunnel project carries environmental risks of its own. 
“Enbridge has allowed Line 5 to spill at least 33 times since 1953, releasing another 1 million gallons of oil into the environment,” said Denise Keele, executive director of the Michigan Climate Action Network. “The Canadian fossil fuel giant has an abysmal safety record, refuses to be transparent about its operations and continues to operate Line 5 in the Straits of Mackinac, despite being in violation of state orders.”

Speakers at Saturday’s event encouraged individuals to speak out against the tunnel project, calling on the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy to perform a full review of Enbridge’s proposed drilling area as required by the Great Lakes Submerged Lands Act.
“This is not just for the state of Michigan, anybody across the country, because the Great Lakes are held in public trust and are an international treasure, everybody can comment,” said Beth Wallace, director of climate and energy for the National Wildlife Federation. “And so we’re encouraging everybody from now until August 29 to require EGLE to do their job and fulfill their duty and take a full look at this project, because we know if they did, it would not move forward.”
If the state does not follow through with a full review, Wallace said the department will be facing legal action. 
A department spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment prior to publication.
Enbridge spokesperson Ryan Duffy, in a statement, acknowledged the 2010 oil spill, noting that the company takes responsibility for the incident. The Talmadge Creek spill has also informed the company’s approach to safety and environmental protections, he said.
“Today, because of the hard work of many people, the Kalamazoo River watershed has been transformed,” Duffy said. “As with any turnaround story, we wish the events that created the story had never happened in the first place. And as we move forward, working with Michiganders, we remain committed to protect and preserve the state’s natural resources.”
Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer in 2020 revoked the company’s permission to operate the pipeline on the bottomlands of the Great Lakes, but Enbridge brought legal action arguing Whitmer did not have the authority to invalidate its easement agreement. The move also has the potential to violate an international treaty agreement with Canada. 
Enbridge needs permits from three agencies to move forward with construction on the tunnel project. The company has already received permitting from the Michigan Public Service Commission, which regulates energy companies within the state. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is also considering a permit for the tunnel, moving forward under emergency processing procedures following an executive order from President Donald Trump.

The Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy issued permits for the company in 2021, but Enbridge is required to redo its water resources permit using new wetlands surveys as part of a 2024 agreement with the department and the Bay Mills Indian Community. 
The department opened public comment on the requests for Enbridge’s new wetlands protection and Great Lakes Submerged Lands permits on July 17. The comment period will remain open through Aug. 29. The department plans to host an information session on Aug. 12, and a formal public hearing on Aug. 19. Comments on the issue can also be submitted online.
As Enbridge seeks approval for the new permits, Duffy said the company remains committed to safeguarding the Great Lakes, natural resources, and communities, while welcoming public and stakeholder comment.
Wallace remained skeptical of the company’s motives.
“Who are the [permitting] decisions really serving? They’re not the people of Michigan,” Wallace said. “They’re not the tribes who have stewarded these waters for generations, and not the millions who rely on the Great Lakes. The only winner here is Enbridge, the company that has a cycle of abuse and deception for our communities. We cannot let them get away with this again, and we must demand accountability.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-28-at-1.01.53 PM-1024x552.png,,,2025-07-28 14:23:47.704194

(Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Gov. Ron DeSantis will roll out an approach for Florida to artificial intelligence “within the next few months,” he said Monday. 
The governor said he is not sure the matter will require legislation, “but we’ve got to be careful about how this all unwinds.”
DeSantis also likened the practice of technology companies hiring foreign workers legally to “indentured servitude” during a news conference Monday morning in Panama City Beach announcing the back-to-school sales tax holiday. 
“I’m not one to say that we should just turn over our humanity to artificial intelligence. I think it’s very dangerous, potentially. Obviously, technology is what it is, it’s not like you just put your head in the sand and hope it all disappears,” DeSantis said, predicting “major, major upheavals in jobs” as AI advances.
“I think this is, like, the biggest issue that’s facing our society. I think it’s the biggest issue that’s facing the economy,” DeSantis continued, predicting that advancements in technology will decrease the number of white-collar jobs “like processing claims or doing things in like a law firm.”
Trump’s AI Action Plan removes ‘red tape’ for AI developers and data centers, punishes states that act alone

Last week, President Donald Trump released an AI action plan designed to take a hands-off approach to safeguards. Trump’s plan calls for AI models to focus on “truth, rather than social engineering agendas.”
Trump has called for a “single federal standard” when it comes to regulating AI, States Newsroom reported.
DeSantis, though, seemed skeptical of freezing the states out of involvement.
“I don’t want our experience, our ability to live and pursue happiness, which is what the Founding Fathers intended, to be subordinated to the whims of these big tech guys who have maybe their different agenda,” he said. 
“If you wanted to manipulate and create false narratives, and you’re in control of one of these AI, you just put garbage in the data set — garbage in, garbage out,” DeSantis added. 
DeSantis pointed to Florida’s passage of Brooke’s Law this year, requiring social media platforms to delete AI-generated sexual depictions created without consent of the person depicted. 
DeSantis criticized the U.S. House for approving a version of the “Big Beautiful Bill” containing a provision preventing state-level artificial intelligence legislation. That language was removed before the bill became law.
Social media have proven a “net negative” for children, the governor said.
“How do we navigate this? How do we make sure that we’re protecting folks here so that they can live good, meaningful lives?” DeSantis said.
“Are students just going to have artificial intelligence write their term paper? You know, it’s like, do we even need to think? And at that point, when you’re taking that away, then it’s like, ‘Okay, you know, we’re not going to think, we’re going to rely on this,’” he said. 
Heavy reliance on AI paired with manipulated data fueling AI answers “can really change society in a lot of ways,” DeSantis said.

Immigration
On the topic of technology, DeSantis criticized tech companies that hire employees using H-1B visas.  
“I think that’s a total scam,” DeSantis said of the program, which allows companies to hire foreign workers for specialty jobs. “I don’t think that that’s good. Yes, it is legal the way they’re doing it. I acknowledge that they’re using something that’s on the books. But is that good policy for us as a country, to have Americans put out of work and then to bring in H-1B visa?”
H-1B visas are “almost like indentured servitude, because you can’t leave the company. And so these companies love it, because they save a lot of money off of it, but that’s not putting the American people first,” DeSantis said. 
The federal government allows that H-1B workers may work for a new employer after submitting a new application.
Back to school holiday
The primary purpose of the press conference was to announce the approaching August-long sales tax holiday on school supplies. Although its been occurring for years, the holiday was permanently enshrined into law this year. 
The holiday exempts certain products from sales tax, such as computers, tablets, computer accessories, backpacks, notebooks, clothing, and other school supplies.
The holiday has limits, providing the tax exemption to technology products like laptops and desktops priced at $1,500 or less, wallets and bags at $100 or less, school supplies such as binders and notebooks at $50 or less, and clothing, footwear, and accessories at $100 or less.
DeSantis said the law is written in a way that encourages retailers to drop prices, because if items are priced above the threshold, retailers must collect tax on the full amount, as opposed to just the amount that exceeds the threshold.
The governor’s family, he said, will take advantage of the holiday.

But now that President Donald Trump’s signature tax and spending law bars students from borrowing more than $50,000 annually in unsubsidized federal loans for medical school, Bonner is worried her dream of becoming a doctor is financially out of reach.
“I get told, ‘Well, we really need you. We have a physician shortage, and you’ve done all this work leading up to this point,’ and that’s true as well, and it’s not that I want to quit,” Bonner said in a recent interview. “But there are no systems in place that I can rely on to support me now that I can’t take out the full cost of living through loans.”
The tax and spending law includes provisions that significantly alter the student loan process for higher education. The law halts current student loan repayment plans for loans that are granted on or after July 1, 2026. On that date, the law also terminates Grad PLUS loans, which have helped people pay for their higher education degrees and total cost of attendance. Current borrowers will be grandfathered in.
The federal law gives current borrowers enrolled in loan repayment plans for students based on income — such as those plans known as SAVE or IBR — until July 1, 2028, to switch to a new plan. Interest collection will resume Aug. 1 for students enrolled in the Biden-era SAVE plan.
At the same time, medical or law school students hoping to get unsubsidized federal loans — in which the borrower is responsible for paying the interest at all times rather than the government — will only be able to borrow $50,000 per year, with a $200,000 lifetime cap. Those seeking advanced degrees in areas such as history or philosophy have a $100,000 lifetime cap.
The average yearly cost of medical school for the 2024-25 academic year ranged from around $42,000 to $72,000, depending on whether the school was private or public and whether the student was a resident or nonresident, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges.
Some congressional Republicans say that students need to be working harder to pay for higher education, like medical school, on their own. Others say the caps put the onus back on colleges and universities to rein in the rising cost of tuition. But critics of this legislation say the loan caps are only going to harm students, especially from lower-income backgrounds, and will exacerbate physician shortages.
In recent years states have tried to ease physician shortages by implementing various policy solutions. Since 2023, at least nine states have made it easier for doctors trained in other countries to get medical licenses. States have also participated in interstate licensing compacts, allowing nurses and physician assistants to travel across state lines to work, so long as they are licensed in one state within the compact.
For student loan relief, more than 20 states have enacted legislation to address student loan forgiveness, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, a group that tracks states policies. Georgia passed a measure that will expand a cancelable loan program for physicians working in rural and underserved areas. Idaho also created the Rural Nursing Loan Repayment Program, offering nurses $25,000 in forgivable loans after three years of service in a rural area.
McKenzie Richards, a health care policy fellow at the conservative think tank Cicero Institute who has been studying the pace of physician shortages, told Stateline that the national physician shortage could potentially exceed 100,000 by 2034. At the end of 2024 that projected number was closer to 64,000 physicians.
Richards said states will be looking toward more policy solutions should the student loan changes exacerbate physician shortages.
“We know what’s going to be happening coming down the line in just five years, so I think policies that states can adopt to get out of this are really important to be looking at now,” she said.
“The hope is that by capping [federal loans], it will encourage schools to lower tuition prices,” Richards added. “Then maybe they need to be admitting more students, which would have a great downstream effect for getting more doctors through.”
Other students will be in the same boat, said Lesley Turner, an associate professor of public policy at the University of Chicago and an economist.
“This is going to hit some students worse than others,” Turner told Stateline. “Those [students] in more expensive programs tend to borrow more, and so for those students they will need to return to private student loans or other ways of financing their graduate education.”
Many students were already questioning their capacity to go to medical school before the student loan caps, said Shannon Jimenez, dean of the Arkansas College of Osteopathic Medicine.
“I expect that this bill, this cap, is going to push people out of primary care and into specialties to help pay off those higher interest rate loans,” Jimenez told Stateline. She added that caps will likely deter students from lower socioeconomic statuses from going into primary care — important in places like Arkansas, where she says there is a “maldistribution of physicians.”
“Many schools like us try to attract those students, because they’re more likely to go into primary care and serve in underserved areas. So it’s going to tie our hands in a lot of ways.”
Large states and more rural states will feel the gaps more deeply, said Richards, of the Cicero Institute. Louisiana, for example, is projected to be short almost 5,000 doctors from a variety of specialties by 2030, including close to 400 primary care doctors. Already more than a third of Louisiana physicians are close to retirement age — similar to the situation in neighboring Arkansas.
As for whether schools will just be able to lower tuition, Jimenez said, “it makes no sense.”
“We still function in a somewhat market-driven economy and have to compete with other schools around us, so our cost is based mostly on what we have to pay our faculty, and that’s not going to go down,” she said. The annual cost of attendance at her school is between $80,000 and $85,000.
Bonner, the EMT, holds a political communications degree from Regent University and now is studying biomedical sciences at Old Dominion University. She already has $20,000 in loans, she said, and for the rest of college tuition, she has paid out of pocket. Since she’s supporting herself, she hasn’t been able to save much.
She’d planned to take the medical school entrance exam next spring, but now worries about how she’d pay for living expenses while attending. “Medical school scheduling doesn’t allow for working, so you have to take out loans for living expenses,” she said.
“A lot of people, I feel, would be panicked if you had worked for eight to 10 years of your life and found out that all the systems that you were banking on in a really academically challenging space are disappearing,” Bonner said.
“I don’t see a path forward for certain, but I’m fighting to make one.”

The state’s annual Tax Free Weekend starts Friday and ends Sunday. The tax holiday waives the state’s 6%​​ sales tax as well as local sales taxes, according to the state Department of Revenue.
All but three of South Carolina’s 46 counties have their own sales taxes for local projects. At 9% total, sales taxes are highest in Charleston County and the city of Myrtle Beach.
Non-taxable items include musical instruments, calculators, headphones, printers, computers, computer software and all types of clothing, as well as certain bed and bath items, including bed spreads, sheets, pillows, towels and shower curtains​​, the department lists as examples on its website. Items that are still taxed as normal include cellphones, digital cameras and video game consoles.
Last year, shoppers bought more than $22.3 million in tax-free items and saved more than $1.3 million in taxes, according to the state tax agency.
Per the law passed in 2000, the 72 hours of savings start at 12:01 a.m. the first Friday in August and continue until midnight Sunday. Online sales of eligible items are included.

(Courtesy of Ainsley Dye)Like many of my peers, while preparing to leave behind familiar routines after graduating high school and head to college, I’ve found myself reflecting on what experiences led me to where I am today.
My childhood was unique — though I grew up in Boulder, Colorado, I had a truly international experience. Over the course of 10 years, my family welcomed 12 au pairs to our home and they brought the world to our kitchen table by sharing cultures, perspectives and traditions. The cultural exchange I experienced through the au pair program has made me far more curious about the world and impacted my plans for the future, including what I hope to study as a freshman this fall.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The au pair program was established as part of the Fulbright-Hays Act in 1961 with the intention of improving international diplomacy and fostering cultural exchange. The program is regulated by the U.S. Department of State and facilitated by sponsor agencies that work to connect au pairs — 18-26-year-olds from other countries — with American families. As part of the program, au pairs come to live with host families for a year or two, providing limited child care support in exchange for room and board, a weekly stipend, and the opportunity to take classes an at American college.
Over the years, my family hosted a total of 12 au pairs. Many of them came from Germany and Switzerland, surrounding my siblings and I with new languages in a truly immersive environment. Some au pairs would label items in our kitchen in German, helping improve my family’s fluency over time. While in our home they had the opportunity to connect with my family in English — helping them brush up on their language skills while we shared stories and traditions. Today, I can comfortably speak German and Spanish, and recognize that those language skills have deepened my appreciation for my former au pairs’ cultures, as well as the cultures of others.
Our home often served as a meeting point for local au pairs and host families, through my mom’s work as a Local Childcare Consultant, where she provided support and guidance to families participating in the program. Our au pairs truly became part of our family, and I am still in touch with many of them today. In 2019, I travelled to Munich and had the opportunity to reconnect with some of my family’s past au pairs — those connections remain as strong as ever.
Through an internship with a sponsor of the au pair program, I heard perspectives from others who, like me, grew up getting to experience other cultures right in their home. One former host child shared that the au pair program was her first exposure to diverse cultures, ultimately leading her to choose a college and career where she felt at home learning and working alongside people from different walks of life.
These benefits aren’t only felt by host children and their families. I reviewed testimonials from hundreds of au pairs from all over the world, and more than half shared that they had evolved as a person during their time in the U.S., whether that was through a change in perspective, self-confidence and self-discovery, or stepping outside of their comfort zone.
Beyond this research, the value of international exchange is recognized widely. Studies show that many jobs today require skills that are strengthened through international exchange and studying abroad, such as communication, leadership and problem solving. In 2024, 87% of surveyed youth said they believe that travel experiences increase employability.
It is no coincidence that I want to study international relations in college and can’t wait to study abroad. Growing up with au pairs gave me a window to the world that I otherwise wouldn’t have found in my town, and I hope that helps me as I learn how different countries interact in the global arena. My experience growing up with au pairs has also taught me the importance of empathy, bridging gaps, and building relationships, values that I know I’ll carry with me – not only as I go off to college but throughout my life.
The au pair program helped shape my identity and influenced my future for the better. The countless host children and au pairs I’ve spoken with share my perspective and I can only hope that more families have the chance to experience these same incredible experiences and benefits that have shaped my worldview.

(Getty Images)The long and winding road to passing a new state operating budget concluded last month, marking the start of a new fiscal year.   
For many health care providers and stakeholders, including the community mental health system, the process brought a mix of progress and setbacks. As we look ahead, it’s clear that the landscape of funding and policy has shifted, and we are taking stock of where things stand.
As advocates, the New Hampshire Community Behavioral Health Association (CBHA) and the state’s 10 community mental health centers (CMHCs) remain committed to the principle that all Granite Staters deserve equitable access to quality mental health services regardless of geography or income. That commitment means advocating for a sustainable, community-based system, one that can weather inflation, workforce shortages, rising insurance premiums, and increasing technology costs. Most importantly, it means ensuring we can recruit and retain qualified mental health professionals who are fairly compensated, to deliver critical, safety-net mental health services to our communities. 
This year’s budget negotiations were difficult, but they brought some notable victories. Proposed cuts to Medicaid reimbursement rates and to overall mental health funding were ultimately avoided. We are grateful for the leadership of Gov. Kelly Ayotte and the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services, who recognized the essential role of CMHCs’ in advancing Mission Zero, a statewide initiative that has significantly reduced the number of individuals waiting in hospital Emergency Departments for psychiatric care. After years of struggle, this progress is measurable and meaningful.
Another important step was the governor’s inclusion of funding to partially offset uncompensated care costs borne by CMHCs. This appropriation was preserved throughout the legislative process, reflecting a shared understanding that community mental health providers need relief in order to maintain essential services. While this funding represents only a partial solution, it is a step in the right direction, and we remain committed to working with state leaders to develop long-term, sustainable approaches.
Still, some policy changes included in the final budget raise concerns. The addition of Medicaid work requirements, co-pays, premiums, and more frequent eligibility reviews may create barriers to care for many vulnerable individuals. We join other health care providers in urging caution and careful monitoring, to ensure these changes do not lead to unintended consequences such as coverage losses or increased administrative burdens for providers and patients alike. 
Additionally, several legislative proposals aimed at strengthening the mental health system failed to advance, despite our best efforts. The most concerning among them was Senate Bill 114, a modest proposal to address supportive and transitional housing for those in our state with mental illness. Current state and Medicaid housing programs do not provide sufficient reimbursements to the community mental health system to support the need for more housing, and CMHCs with these programs report losses of hundreds of thousands of dollars each year, or more. The ripple effects of closures of these programs will extend far beyond individual providers, straining local communities and contributing to the challenges of homelessness.
As many have said, a state budget is more than a financial plan; it is a reflection of our values. 
Investing in mental health is not only fiscally responsible, but a statement about dignity, equity, and our collective well-being. While this year’s budget leaves important work unfinished, it also affirms the strength and perseverance of our mental health workforce, the dedication of our CMHC board members, and the courage of the individuals and families who speak out and advocate for change.  
We move forward with gratitude for that collective effort, and with the continued determination to build a more accessible, better-funded community mental health system for all.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/bipolar-1024x708.jpg,,,2025-07-28 13:56:37.773081

According to them, it will benefit agriculture, industry and municipal services in the coming years.
Governor Mike Kehoe signed new legislation into law on July 14 that limits large-scale water exports from Missouri. The law, which takes effect Aug. 28, requires a permit for water exports and restricts withdrawals for export to within 30 miles of the state border. It also mandates annual reporting of water usage to the Missouri Department of Natural Resources.
David Borrok, dean of the College of Engineering and Computing at the Missouri University of Science and Technology, said that a number of other states in the U.S have been taking similar measures as demand for water grows.
“Missouri is a water-rich state, and I’d say, arguably, water is our most valuable resource as a state,” Borrok said. “It’s the engine that sort of underpins all economic development and things in the state.”
Missouri is home to more than 110,000 miles of rivers and streams. Each year, rainfall creates more than 15 trillion gallons of runoff that flows into these rivers, lakes and streams. About 38 trillion gallons come into the state through the Missouri and Mississippi rivers. It is estimated that the state has about 500 trillion gallons of usable-quality groundwater.
Daniel Downing, a water quality specialist with the University of Missouri Extension, believes the motivation behind this legislation is the preservation of Missouri’s abundant water supplies.
“On the state borders, especially the western border, there may be parties harvesting or considering harvesting water from Missouri and pumping it into Oklahoma and/or Kansas, where they have restrictive water allotments,” Downing said in an email.
Missouri has very few, if any, restrictions on the quantity of water one can harvest in compliance with Missouri’s Riparian Rights water law, Downing said.
“Missouri water law allows the use of reasonable amounts of water as long as it does not deprive others of what they need,” Downing said. “In the Western states, water quantity and use are regulated under allotment and/or appropriation systems that tightly control how much water they can access.”
The Ogallala Aquifer is a very important underground water source for many states, like Kansas, Nebraska and others. However, it does not extend into Missouri. Increased populations, development and droughts have created more demand for water in these states, Downing said.
Research shows that, due to pumping water for irrigation, the aquifer is now dangerously close to running dry. To mitigate that, there was a plan proposed to move water from the Missouri River in eastern Kansas, near Kansas City, to help refill the Ogallala Aquifer in western Kansas.
“The use and apparent gradual depletion of the aquifer has been a topic of research and discussion for many years, resulting in limitations on the use of water from it,” Downing said. “These circumstances, as well as other influences and restrictions, make it inviting to look across the state line and covet the abundance of water we have.”
Kansas Governor Laura Kelly signed a bill in July establishing a water conservation task force to tackle the state’s water issues. The task force will identify water-related risks, determine what constitutes a sustainable water supply and explore funding options for future water projects. Additionally, a Water Planning Work Group will work to update and modernize the State Water Resources Planning Act.
According to the Missouri Water Resources Plan, updated in 2020, the state’s residents and businesses use an average of 3.2 billion total gallons of water each day. Of that total, 78% comes from groundwater sources, while the remaining 22% is supplied by surface water.
Borrok emphasized that water security is essential for the state’s long-term economic growth.
“All the manufacturing that we might want to attract to the state,” Borrok said. “All data centers, all these sorts of things use massive, massive amounts of water, and no major company will move to a state that doesn’t have the water resources necessary to expand.”
Agricultural irrigation accounts for the largest share of the state’s consumptive water withdrawals at 65%. Major water systems contribute another 25%, while all other sectors combined make up the remaining 10% of annual withdrawals.
Tom Waters is a seventh-generation farmer from Orrick, Missouri and also serves as a consultant at the Missouri Water Center. He and his family raise corn, soybeans and wheat.
Although Waters doesn’t do any irrigation on the land he farms, he said that in southeast Missouri, particularly in the Bootheel area, the practice is quite common.
“Keeping that water to irrigate Missouri crops is important versus sending it to other states,” Waters said. “The difference between an irrigated crop and a non-irrigated crop always depends on the weather and drought conditions and those sorts of things. But, traditionally, the irrigation more than pays for itself.”
David Waller, board president and national director at the Missouri Rural Water Association, said every drop Missouri exports outside the state is lost.
“So a municipality that might need water within the state, if it was being exported in large quantities outside the state, they might not have water for their usage,” Waller said. “I don’t know that is happening anywhere, but that is one possibility.”
Waller said the Department of Natural Resources didn’t previously have a way of tracking water that was being transported outside the state, nor a way of regulating it.
“This at least gives the department the authority to monitor and make those decisions so that they know what’s going on,” Waller said.
In northern Missouri, the groundwater is very salty, so a lot of their water comes from surface water. Borrok said those municipalities need to keep their water for drinking purposes.
“It’s the same way as agriculture, you just want it not to overdraft your bank of water,” Borrok said. “Recreation-wise, that’s a huge one too. There’s gotta be massive amounts of tourism dollars coming in from Lake of the Ozarks, Table Rock Lake and the Scenic Riverways here and if you start taking water and pumping it somewhere else, you could potentially, over time, negatively impact some of those resources.”
Missouri’s statewide consumptive water demand is expected to rise by 18%, or by approximately 583 million gallons per day, by 2060, according to the Missouri Water Resources Plan.
While the law does restrict exports, Borrok said it doesn’t completely close the door to out-of-state water sharing. Now, exporting water would have to go through a permit process, evaluating potential financial benefits or losses.
“A small farmer could possibly export a little bit of water through a canal to another place, and maybe we don’t know about that,” Borrok said. “But the real impact that it’s trying to avoid is a massive export of water, like hundreds of millions of gallons a month, or three million gallons a day or some massive amount and that would be noticed in terms of the monitoring.”

The Michigan Library Association is behind the effort, which calls on officials to stand up for residents’ First Amendment rights and protect the freedom to read in libraries across the state.
Members of the association said in a news release that the Protect MI Right to Read petition is on track to be delivered to the Michigan Legislature and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer in October.
“Michigan’s public libraries serve everyone, not just the loudest voices,” Dillon Geshel, interim executive director of the association, said in a statement. “The Petition to Protect MI Right to Read was created to send a clear message to our elected officials that public libraries exist to reflect all of us, and every resident deserves the freedom to see themselves on the shelves.”
The petition asks state lawmakers and Whitmer to publicly affirm their commitment to the freedom to read in libraries, free of censorship, book bans or the sequestration of certain materials. It also asks officials to encourage local governments and library boards to resist censorship, support diverse collections, and champion First Amendment legal precedents protecting them.
Additionally, the petition asks for the appropriation of state funding, increasing allocations to libraries in the pending state budget. That would include annual spending support for the Michigan eLibrary and statewide catalog and other at-risk statewide library programs.
In the state House of Representatives-passed spending plan for the 2025-26 fiscal year, the chamber is proposing the same $16.5 million in funding to school libraries as the current fiscal year. The funding was in line with what Whitmer proposed in her executive recommendations issued earlier this year. The Senate has proposed funding school libraries at $15 million in its version of the school education budget.

“We’re seeing more organized efforts to control what people can read, and it’s happening right here in Michigan,” said Jenny Marr, Michigan Library Association board president and executive director of Capital Area District Libraries, in a statement. “This petition reminds us that libraries are places of curiosity, growth, and empathy, and they’re worth defending.”
In data provided by the association, a new EPIC-MRA poll from June 2025 shows that 79% of voters approve of the work libraries are doing, 75% trust librarians’ discretion on the materials in their collections, and 82% agree that access to materials for young people should be protected.
Another 84% said they support current library policies on age-appropriate shelving.

It’s all part of the state’s move to a closed party primary system for its congressional seats and certain state-level elected offices.
According to data from the Secretary of State, 150,654 voters registered as “Independent” will have their status changed to “No Party,” a designation currently given to 657,966. Affected voters will receive notice in the mail, including an updated voter information card. 
The legislature approved the change in Act 84 earlier this year. Louisiana did not allow the existence of an official Independent Party until 2015, after legislators chose the year before to end that prohibition in state law. 
Starting with next year’s elections, only party members and voters with “No Party” on their registration can vote in primaries for the U.S. Senate, U.S. House, Louisiana Supreme Court, Public Service Commission and Board of Elementary and Secondary Education.
“Many Louisiana voters who are registered as Independents mistakenly believe they are unaffiliated with any political party, when in fact they are members of the Independent Party,” Secretary of State Nancy Landry said Monday in a news release. “This proactive change will allow voters formerly registered as Independents to participate in Closed Party Primaries next year, preventing voter confusion while maximizing participation.” 
Landry encourages voters to check their voter registration on the state’s GeauxVote online registration system or GeauxVote app.
In 2024, state lawmakers approved the switch to closed primaries from an open or “jungle” system, in which different party candidates faced one another. An open primary could result in two members of the same party meeting in a runoff if no candidate claimed 50% or more of the votes cast, while a closed primary all but guarantees each party will have a candidate in a runoff.
As of July 1, there were nearly 2.98 million registered voters in Louisiana, including more than 1.09 million Democrats and almost 1.05 million Republicans.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Ballot-parties-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-07-28 13:11:45.543588

(Photo by Sarah Vogelsong/Virginia Mercury)The search is underway for the University of Virginia’s next president, but the timing of the process could put the school’s officials at odds with state lawmakers, who have asked the governing board to delay selecting its next leader until a pending lawsuit over college board appointments plays out.
On Friday afternoon, UVA leaders announced the formation of a special committee to nominate the institution’s next president, which will be responsible for guiding the process of identifying and recommending candidates to the Board of Visitors to serve as UVA’s 10th president. This action follows a similar vetting process currently being used by the Virginia Military Institute, after the governing board opted not to renew the contract of Ret. Maj. Gen. Cedric Wins, the school’s first Black leader whose term ended earlier this year. 


 Upcoming meetings

GMU – Aug. 1, 2025
UVA – Sept. 11-12, 2025
VMI – Sept. 22-24, 2025


Two days earlier before UVA’s announcement, House and Senate Democratic leaders urged UVA not to take any action, primarily because a gubernatorial appointee to the governing board—former Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli, a former deputy secretary of Homeland Security with the first President Donald Trump administration — was rejected by Democratic lawmakers. 
The Senate Committee on Privileges and Elections, composed of some members of the full Senate body, rebuffed Cuccinelli and seven others on June 9. Leaders are seeking a court order to prevent the eight rejected appointees from remaining on the governing boards at UVA, VMI, and George Mason University.
“These boards just don’t seem very interested in following Virginia law or listening to anything that the entity that controls them says,” Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, said on Friday outside a Fairfax County Courtroom after Circuit Court Judge Jonathan D. Frieden heard the Senate Democrats’ case against the rectors of the three institutions for allowing their rejected appointments to continue serving on the boards. Surrovell stated repeatedly that the board should refrain from finding a permanent president, considering the state of the board’s appointments.
 ‘Totally irresponsible’

UVA, in its announcement, said that the special committee would include students, faculty, staff, alumni, and former and sitting members of the Board of Visitors. 
Chief among the committee’s requirements is “inviting” and “incorporating a broad and inclusive range of perspectives from across UVA’s vibrant community.”
UVA created the committee following the departure of former President Jim Ryan, who stepped down after the U.S. Department of Justice, under the direction of the Trump administration, put pressure on the institution due to Title VI complaints and political scrutiny over its diversity, equity and inclusion efforts on campus.
Jennifer Davis, UVA’s chief administrative, business and operations officer, is serving as interim president.
House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, cautioned UVA against making any decisions on its next president during a joint press conference with leaders from the House and Senate on July 24, advising them that lawmakers could make changes in January. He said any such action would be “totally irresponsible” and an act of disrespecting and ignoring the General Assembly.
“They probably should put a freeze on any hiring because we will not support whatever it is that they do,” Scott said last week. “This is an illegitimate board right now that has been appointed and been told that they will not be appointed permanently. So if they go about selecting a president when they know they will not be there in January, that’s wrong.”
 Lawsuit background

Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration has supported all the rejected appointees serving on their respective governing boards until the entire General Assembly reconvenes, which is scheduled for January unless the governor calls a special session.
In the lawsuit, Democratic lawmakers are asking the court to bar the eight contested board members from continuing to serve and declare that any board member who permits them to remain is violating their legal duties. Among the rejected appointments were GOP stalwarts, including Cuccinelli and former state commerce and trade secretary Caren Merrick.
Representatives of the institutions argued that the case is “flawed,” is targeting the wrong plaintiffs and defendants, and that the nine senators failed to show irreparable harm.
Judge Frieden said he plans to have a decision by the end of the day on Tuesday. If a preliminary injunction is granted, a request is likely to be made to suspend any action with a judge’s decision by Friday morning.
 VMI, GMU also moving forward

VMI is continuing its search on Tuesday and Wednesday for a president after opting not to extend the contract of the institution’s first Black superintendent in February. 
George Mason’s board is scheduled to meet in closed session to “discuss the performance goals of the President” on Friday.
GMU President Gregory Washington has recently come under attack after the U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights (OCR) launched a federal civil rights investigation at the school. The investigation stems from a complaint filed by multiple professors who accuse GMU of giving unlawful preference in hiring and promotion to faculty from “underrepresented groups” in the name of anti-racism. 
OCR officials argue the university’s DEI practices, in place since 2020, constitute “pernicious and widespread discrimination” that runs afoul of federal law, a position the school vehemently denies.

The National Consumers League says the largely unregulated machines have become favored by scammers for their anonymity and irreversibility — once a user transfers or deposits funds, that money is essentially gone.
While officials say the machines can be used for legitimate purposes, red and blue states are increasingly imposing new regulations to protect consumers: AARP says 11 states have recently passed new laws or regulations of the machines.
“In state after state, AARP found lawmakers on both sides of the aisle and local law enforcement eager to work on commonsense rules that balance innovation and consumer safety,” Nancy LeaMond, AARP’s executive vice president and chief advocacy and engagement officer, said in a news release.
Last year, the FBI reported nearly 11,000 complaints of cryptocurrency ATM fraud. Those cases disproportionately affected older Americans and cost victims $246.7 million.
Cryptocurrencies are digital assets, including bitcoin, that offer an alternative payment or method without control of a central bank or government like other currencies. Crypto ATMs, sometimes called crypto kiosks, allow users to insert cash or use debit cards to convert currencies such as U.S. dollars into cryptocurrencies.
The Federal Trade Commission says crypto ATM scams often start with a call or text message warning of a supposed problem, such as unauthorized bank charges or suspicious activity on an Amazon account.
The FTC says consumers should contact banks or other institutions directly about any account issues. And it warns consumers not to believe anyone who says they must use a crypto ATM to address a financial problem.
“Real businesses and government agencies will never do that — anyone who does is a scammer,” the agency said.
State, federal governments are eyeing crypto legislation

After signing a bill with new regulations, Nebraska Republican Gov. Jim Pillen was clear that the state would continue to welcome cryptocurrency businesses as it aims to become a hub for the industry.
The Nebraska law requires ATM operators to acquire state licensure, warn customers of the potential for criminal exploitation and take “reasonable steps to detect and prevent fraud.”
The law also limits transactions to $2,000 per day for new customers and $10,500 for existing customers, and requires operators to issue refunds for properly reported fraudulent transactions.
At least 40 states have introduced legislation regarding cryptocurrency, digital or virtual currencies and other digital assets in the 2025 legislative session, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Those measures include ATM regulations, prohibiting the use of digital currencies by governments and allowing state investment in digital assets.
Only one of the six crypto bills introduced in South Carolina for 2025 gained any traction. With a 38-1 vote May 1, the Senate approved legislation sponsored by Sen. Danny Verdin, R-Laurens. It allows South Carolinians and businesses to pay for goods and services with cryptocurrency. It also bars state and local governments from adding taxes to digital sales. The House could take up the bill next year.
Federal lawmakers are also taking action on the issue.
The Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives declared the week of July 14 “Crypto Week,” when lawmakers considered several pieces of legislation.
At the end of that week, President Donald Trump signed into law the GENIUS Act, the first major law governing digital currency. It establishes a regulatory framework for the industry.
Trump hopes the bill will instill confidence in the industry that spent heavily to strengthen its legitimacy and political might, The Associated Press reported.
“This signing is a massive validation of your hard work and your pioneering spirit,” the president told crypto executives.
In state legislatures, new bills regulating crypto ATMS have enjoyed bipartisan support. AARP tracking shows new bills have been approved in Arkansas, Iowa and Oklahoma, as well as in more liberal states such as Maryland and Vermont.
In May, Arizona Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs signed Republican-sponsored legislation that sets daily transaction limits and mandates crypto ATM operators provide customers certain disclosures and warnings.
The legislation followed local news coverage of at least two dozen crypto scams, including one that cost an Arizonan $28,000.

The name of the person who died was being withheld pending notification of relatives and additional investigation, according to the release.
The investigation began after police said they received a call at around 8:15 p.m. Sunday from a Carver Street resident, who said a person at the house had died. 
“First responders arrived and confirmed the individual was deceased,” the police press release stated. “Investigators are treating the death as suspicious.”
Police said Monday morning the investigation was in the early stages, nobody was in custody and that there was no known threat to the public.
Additional information was not immediately available Monday morning.

(Photo: Southeastern Wind Coalition)On July 4th, Governor Josh Stein put North Carolina’s economic future first when he vetoed Senate Bill 266 “The Power Bill Reduction Act.” Despite the bill supporters’ enticing contention that the bill will lower your monthly electric bill, multiple independent analyses show that key provisions in the bill would actually put North Carolina’s electricity sector and economic future at risk. But, behind the promise of short-term savings lie risks that energy experts say could hurt our state’s grid and economy in the long-term.
SB 266 would reverse the interim carbon emissions reduction target that was established in House Bill 951, delaying, and potentially diminishing the deployment of wind and solar energy. What many don’t realize is that HB 951 didn’t just catalyze the state’s adoption of more renewable energy; it created a pathway to utilize some of the cheapest and most readily available resources to meet the record energy demand that North Carolina will experience over the next decade. Without that interim goal, experts are projecting an energy capacity shortfall of 12 GW as a direct result of delayed renewable energy deployment.
SB 266 would send a very dangerous signal to investors and developers in North Carolina’s renewable energy sector. Since 2021, the interim carbon emission reduction target has created investment certainty for the best tools available to get electrons on the grid quickly and in an affordable manner. Investment certainty is a key factor here because the industry has already invested $15 billion dollars and created over 10,000 in North Carolina according to the American Clean Power Association. This industry is poised for further growth, but according to a study published by BW Research, removing the interim target is estimated to cause a loss of 50,000 future jobs and billions of dollars in investments in the 2030s.
Those numbers may feel intangible, but a wind farm in rural northeastern North Carolina is responsible for a handful of jobs and approximately $1 million in local county tax revenue every year. As the largest taxpayer in the county, a predictable 30-year tax revenue is a game changer for local governments, schools, infrastructure, and emergency services. SB 266 could stall new wind energy projects and put at risk millions in long-term tax revenue that rural, economically distressed communities rely on to fund schools, emergency services, and local infrastructure.
What does any of this have to do with your electricity bill? Because wind and solar are fuel-free resources, their prices are predictable and steady even when the global fuel markets experience volatile price fluctuations. Without wind and solar on the grid, North Carolina customers would be much more vulnerable to extreme fluctuations that we see in fossil fuel markets, especially during extreme weather or times of increased electricity demand.
Just four years ago a bipartisan law enshrined the need to lower carbon emissions in a least cost manner across the state. This law provides investment certainty to utilities and companies looking to meet our energy needs, prioritize environmental and human health, and keep our state on a path to sustainable economic development. Now, it is up to our state legislators to put North Carolina’s economic future first by sustaining the Governor’s veto.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Wind-farm-SE-Wind-Coaltion-1024x683.webp,,,2025-07-28 11:57:17.197993

Attorneys baffled by federal judge’s order that lists incorrect parties, wrong quotes",Taylor Vance and Devna Bose,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/07/28/attorneys-baffled-by-federal-court-order-with-factual-errors/,U.S. District Judge Henry .T. Wingate filed a corrected order after attorneys raised concerns about factual errors in the first one.,"A ruling from a federal judge in Mississippi contained factual errors — listing plaintiffs who weren’t parties to the suit, including incorrect quotes from a state law and referring to cases that don’t appear to exist — raising questions about whether artificial intelligence was involved in drafting the order.
U.S. District Judge Henry T. Wingate issued an error-laden temporary restraining order on July 20, pausing the enforcement of a state law that prohibits diversity, equity and inclusion programs in public schools and universities. 
Lawyers from the Mississippi Attorney General’s Office asked him to clarify the order on Tuesday, and attorneys for the plaintiffs did not oppose the state’s request. On Wednesday, Wingate replaced the order with a corrected version.His original order no longer appears on the court docket, so the public no longer has access to it. The corrected order is backdated to July 20, even though it was filed three days later.
“Our attorneys have never seen anything like this,” a Mississippi Attorney General’s Office official told Mississippi Today, speaking only on background because the litigation is pending.
Some attorneys who have reviewed the ruling questioned whether artificial intelligence was used to craft the order. Wingate did not respond to repeated questions about the order or whether he or his staff used AI to prepare it.
The original order lists plaintiffs such as the Mississippi Library Association and Delta Sigma Theta Sorority Inc., who have never been involved in the pending litigation and who do not even have cases pending before the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi. 
Wingate’s original order also appears to quote portions of the initial lawsuit and the legislation that established Mississippi’s DEI prohibition, making it seem as though the phrases were taken verbatim from the texts. But the quoted phrases don’t appear in either the complaint or the legislation. 
Wingate’s corrected order still cites a 1974 case from the U.S. 4th Circuit Court of Appeals, Cousins v. School Board of City of Norfolk. However, when Mississippi Today attempted to search for that case, it appears that either it does not exist or the citation is incorrect. 
Christina Frohock, a University of Miami law school professor who studies the dangers artificial intelligence poses to the integrity of the legal system, said a common way attorneys are getting caught using AI is due to “hallucinations,” or instances where AI programs cite cases that don’t exist or use fabricated quotes. 
Frohock was hesitant to draw conclusions about the errors in the Mississippi ruling and attribute them to AI, but she was similarly perplexed by how basic facts from the case record were incorrect. 
“I actually don’t know how to explain the backstory here,” she said. “I feel like I’m Alice in Wonderland.”
Attorneys have an ethical obligation to make truthful representations in court, so when they are caught using artificial intelligence, judges have applied sanctions and demanded explanations. Just this month, a federal judge in Colorado ordered two attorneys to pay thousands in fines after they used AI to write a mistake-riddled court filing.
But there’s little recourse when the tables are turned. 
“If an attorney does this, a judge can demand explanations, but it’s not true in the other direction,” Frohock said. “We will probably never know what happened, unless an appellate court demands it.”
Parties in the case will meet again Aug. 5 to argue about a preliminary injunction in the case. 
Wingate, 78, was nominated to the bench by President Ronald Reagan in 1985. He was confirmed by the U.S. Senate that same year. He served as chief judge of the Southern District from 2003 to 2010.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/07041116/judge-Henry-Wingate-e1514409305395.jpg,,,2025-07-28 11:57:17.197993

Nick Deml plans to step down next month as commissioner of the Vermont Department of Corrections.
A familiar face is set to take over as interim commissioner: former Burlington Police Chief Jon Murad.
Gov. Phil Scott announced the leadership change in a press release Monday. 
“Serving alongside our correctional staff has been the honor of a lifetime,” Deml said in the release. 
Since November 2021, Deml has led Vermont’s six prisons. He took over from interim Commissioner Jim Baker at a tumultuous moment, shepherding a department rocked by scandal and the Covid-19 pandemic. 
Announcing Deml’s successor, Scott called Murad a “proven leader with a strong background in both managing and improving organizations.”
Murad attracted the limelight while serving as Burlington’s top cop, sometimes coming into conflict with the city’s progressive council members. He led the department during summer 2020, which saw nationwide protests against policing in the wake of George Floyd’s murder. He remained in the role after the Burlington City Council voted to reduce the city’s police force through attrition — a decision he strongly opposed. 
Murad announced his intention to leave the Burlington Police Department in November and left in the spring.
“After more than two decades in municipal public service, I’m excited to move to the larger stage of serving the great state of Vermont,” he said in the press release. 
Overseeing Vermont’s prisons has historically drawn scrutiny, and Deml’s tenure was no different. A spate of deaths in 2022 and 2023 at Southern State Correctional Facility in Springfield called into question the medical care provided by the prison’s health services contractor at the time. An investigation by Vermont’s Defender General’s Office later found that medical staff with VitalCore Health Strategies appeared to struggle to perform CPR and use a defibrillator. 
Wellpath took over the state’s prison health services contract in July 2023
Like facilities across the country, Vermont’s prisons have had acute staffing shortages since the pandemic, sometimes leading to mandatory 16-hour shifts. 
Under Deml’s leadership, the correction’s department focused on addressing substance use disorder among people in prison. The department prioritized providing medication for opioid use disorder and worked to expand peer recovery coaching and educational opportunities. 
Murad, who will serve as interim commissioner, requires the Vermont Senate’s vote to officially become commissioner. Deml’s last day is Aug. 15.

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Oklahoma’s Republican governor was selected to become the chair of the National Governors Association for the next year.
Gov. Kevin Stitt was tapped by his peers during their summer meeting in Colorado Springs, Colo., to lead the group, which represents the leaders of 55 states, territories and commonwealths. Stitt’s term will run from 2025 to 2026.
Maryland Democratic Gov. Wes Moore was selected to serve as vice chair and as the 2026-2027 chair-elect.
In a statement, Stitt said he will focus on “Reigniting the American Dream,” by highlighting stories from across the country. He said he plans to work with governors, policy experts, business leaders and philanthropists to “discuss best practices and policies that promote the American Dream for all.”
“The beautiful thing about the American Dream is that there are as many dreams as there are people,” Stitt said. “In a time where all we hear is about how divided we are, let’s remind them that we agree on this: the American Dream doesn’t need to be reimagined, it needs to be reignited. Governors are in a unique position to lead this charge. I’m grateful for the trust of my fellow Governors as we start this journey together.”
Stitt said he’ll prioritize creating economic opportunities, on-the-job educational experiences for youth and will focus on artificial intelligence.   
“We all want to create a brighter future for our states, and the nation,” Moore said in a statement. “When we get together at the National Governors Association, we’re focused on whether an idea is good, not on where the idea came from. I’m looking forward to collaborating with my fellow governors to build stronger on-ramps to opportunity so every person in our states has a shot at success – no matter how they define it.”
The following governors were selected to serve on the group’s executive committee: Jared Polis, Colorado; Josh Green, Hawaii; Mike Braun, Indiana; Jeff Landry, Louisiana; Maura Healey, Massachusetts; Michelle Lujan Grisham, New Mexico; and Bill Lee, Tennessee.

,Pennsylvania Capital Star,2025-07-28 15:11:36+00:00,Pennsylvania Capital-Star,"More Americans are family caregivers; states struggle to help them, report finds",Anna Claire Vollers,,,,,https://penncapital-star.com/health/more-americans-are-family-caregivers-states-struggle-to-help-them-report-finds/,Nearly 1 in 4 Americans now care for a family member with complex medical needs.,"An elderly couple wander through the Wakodahatchee Wetlands on May 27, 2024 in Delray Beach, Florida. (Photo by Bruce Bennett/Getty Images)More than 63 million Americans are caregivers for a family member with complex medical needs, a 20 million increase over the past decade, according to a new report.
But state policies, workplaces and the American health system haven’t kept up with this surge in family caregiving responsibilities, said Dr. Myechia Minter-Jordan, a physician and the CEO of the AARP, which released the report with the National Alliance for Caregiving, a nonprofit policy and research organization.
“Nearly half of caregivers say they face major financial consequences, draining savings, falling into debt or struggling to afford basic needs like food and housing,” Minter-Jordan told reporters on a call this week.
One of the biggest reasons for the surge in family caregivers is that Americans are living longer, yet they’re not necessarily healthier. There’s a 12-year gap between the average number of years that Americans live and the number of years they’re healthy.
‘A purpose in this world’: Older adults fear elimination of program that helps them find work

The caregiving role typically involves helping a family member with daily tasks like bathing, dressing and eating. But more than half of caregivers also perform more complex medical tasks, such as managing catheters or administering injections, the report found.
A growing number of caregivers are so-called “sandwich caregivers” — parents caring for their children as well as for an adult family member, such as an aging parent. About 17 million people are sandwich caregivers, compared with 11 million a decade ago. And most caregivers are also working a job.
And while the bulk of caregiving still falls on women, 40% of American caregivers are men.
Some states have heeded the growing calls for action.
Earlier this year, Maine lawmakers created a state program to provide respite care, which includes services such as adult day care that give family caregivers a temporary break.
Also this year, Tennessee extended its pilot program that provides respite care for Alzheimer’s and dementia patients, and also passed a bipartisan bill that directs the state Medicaid program to develop guidelines to allow family caregivers to be paid for their work.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Last year, Nebraska passed a tax credit for family caregivers; Oklahoma passed a similar law the year before. And while the United States is one of few countries that doesn’t mandate paid family leave at the federal level, 13 states and the District of Columbia have established their own paid family leave rules.
Meanwhile, the historic cuts to Medicaid enacted as part of the GOP’s Big, Beautiful Bill Act will shift health costs to states, leaving experts worried that family caregivers could lose Medicaid-funded services they rely on.

Josh Stein vetoed the measure earlier this month, but Senate Republicans are set to bring it back for an override vote on Tuesday.","It's expected that state Republican lawmakers will consider overriding Gov. Josh Stein's vetoes on July 29, 2025. (Photo of NC Legislative Building by Clayton Henkel) North Carolina lawmakers will return to Raleigh this week intending to override several — if not all — of Gov. Josh Stein’s vetoes on more than a dozen bills. When they do, it’ll be under the watchful eyes of numerous advocacy groups.
Among the overrides on tap: a controversial bill eliminating an emissions requirement for Duke Energy, another allowing permit-less carry of handguns for those over 18, and a wide-ranging bill defining gender in state law and restricting birth certificate changes.
Stein, a Democrat, has vetoed the bills over the past few weeks. Attempts to override them — in a Republican-dominated legislature — were all but inevitable. And in the weeks leading up to the anticipate override session, advocates on both sides of the aisle for multiple issues have pushed lawmakers to vote according to their preferences.
In order to override a veto, three-fifths of each chamber must approve. Senate Republicans will meet that threshold if all members are present and voting due to their 30-20 veto-proof supermajority.
Senate leader Phil Berger (R-Rockingham) said Stein’s vetoes indicate “he is out of touch with the people of North Carolina.”
“I look forward to leading Senate Republicans in overriding these harmful vetoes and putting North Carolina families first,” Berger said.
Over in the lower chamber, the GOP holds a 71-49 advantage. That’s one vote short of 60% by party lines.
Speaker Destin Hall (R-Caldwell) has said the override votes could be added to the calendar any time the House is in session.
Wide-ranging gender identity bill
House Bill 805, which began as a bill focused on preventing exploitation of women and children, was transformed into a conservative vehicle for several sections focused on gender.
Among its provisions: defining “male,” “female” and “biological sex” in state law; allowing parents to name library books their student cannot check out; banning state dollars from being used on gender-affirming care in prisons; and requiring the state to retain the original birth certificate when a transgender person changes the identified sex on theirs.
In the House, one Democrat — Rep. Dante Pittman (D-Wilson) — joined Republicans in favor of the bill. If Pittman remains in favor, it will be enough to override Stein’s veto. On Saturday night at a Democratic Unit Dinner, Pittman appeared to signal he would stand with Stein’s veto. “When I was sitting at my chair and I saw our governor come up on the screen, my resolve was hardened,” Pittman said before delivering the Salute to the Flag of North Carolina. “When it comes to the veto overrides,” he added, “we’ve got your back.”
Transgender and civil rights advocacy groups have voiced passionate opposition to the bill.
Christine Pontes, a social worker and advocate, wrote in an op-ed this month that the bill “targets the rights of transgender people and, in effect, seek to deny their existence.”
And activists on the other side of the issue, too, have urged Republicans to push it forward.
In a letter published in the conservative Carolina Journal, Payton McNabb — a former high school volleyball player who has emerged as a vocal opponent of transgender student athletes in North Carolina — called on lawmakers to “stand for common sense.”
“Turning this bill away is a betrayal of the young women he’s supposed to protect,” McNabb wrote.
Duke Energy emissions repeal
In the midst of the a sweltering summer, lawmakers will aim to lift an interim carbon reduction target for Duke Energy.
Under Senate Bill 266, dubbed “The Power Bill Reduction Act,” the utility would no longer need to meet a 70% reduction of 2005 levels in carbon dioxide emissions by 2030. The 2050 goal for carbon neutrality would remain in place. Both goals were set in state law as part of bipartisan legislation enacted in 2021.
Paul Newton, a former Duke Energy executive and state senator until he resigned in March, introduced related legislation that appeared to move through the chamber on a fast track.
“We remain focused on working with state leaders to power North Carolina’s continued success through smart investments and a reliable mix of energy resources while keeping costs as low as possible for our customers,” a Duke Energy spokesperson told NC Newsline.
With such quick movement, opponents say there wasn’t ample opportunity to provide input.
“It’s a great example of why an energy policy shouldn’t rush to make big policy decisions without having a much fuller opportunity for analysis and considerations of how there’s so many interrelated moving parts,” Southern Environmental Law Center senior attorney David Neal said.
Researchers at NC State University found that the bill could cost $23 billion in added fuel expenses through 2050 for ratepayers, according to a study released June 30.
Dan Crawford, North Carolina League of Conservation Voters’ governmental affairs director, said North Carolinians are working hard to keep food on the table and pay their bills.
“They’d be disappointed that lawmakers chose to put the profits of Duke Energy before them, and their short sighted decisions could lead to their power bills going up even more at a time when they can’t afford it,” he said.
Crawford noted there isn’t data at the moment on how many North Carolinians are aware of the legislation, but the group is working on its legislative scorecard to keep voters aware of which lawmakers voted to raise their electricity bills.
The NC Democratic Party, meanwhile, has urged supporters to email their lawmakers with a photo of their most recent power bill.
“Send it to your legislator with a clear message: ‘Do not raise our rates to line Duke Energy’s pockets,'” the party wrote in an emailed message to supporters. “Corporations should pay their fair share.”
In a statement explaining his veto on July 2, Stein made note of the rising temperatures and subsequent soaring utility bills that have plagued the summer months.
“This bill not only makes everyone’s utility bills more expensive, but it also shifts the cost of electricity from large industrial users onto the backs of regular people — families will pay more so that industry pays less,” he wrote. “This bill walks back on our state’s commitment to reduce carbon emissions, sending the wrong signal to businesses that want to be a part of our clean energy economy.”
Concealed handguns
Senate Bill 50 would allow North Carolinians over 18 to carry concealed firearms without applying for a permit. The measure, branded “constitutional carry” by conservative backers, is law in 29 other states. Supporters say the bill merely codifies a constitutional right.
The Senate approved the bill on a partisan, 26-18 vote, with all Republicans voting ‘yes’ and all Democrats voting ‘no.’ Six members were absent. In the House, the vote was 59-48, with two Republicans — Reps. William Brisson (R-Bladen) and Ted Davis (R-New Hanover) — joining Democrats in opposition. If Brisson and Davis remain opposed, it could make it much harder for Republicans to must the necessary three-fifths vote to override the veto.
In announcing his veto, Stein said:


        “This bill makes North Carolinians less safe and undermines responsible gun ownership. Therefore, I am vetoing it. The bill eliminates training requirements associated with concealed carry permits and reduces the age to carry a concealed weapon from 21 to 18 years old. Authorizing teenagers to carry a concealed weapon with no training whatsoever is dangerous. The bill would also make the job of a law enforcement officer more difficult and less safe. We can and should protect the right to bear arms without recklessly endangering law enforcement officers and our people.”     

 
The veto announcement also noted that the action had the support Sheriffs Charles Blackwood of Orange County and Clarence Birkhead of Durham County. The nonprofit group Moms Rising North Carolina issued a statement thanking Stein for vetoing what it termed “reckless legislation that would put us all in danger.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Legislature_RedCarpet_PhotoClaytonHenkel-1024x569.jpg,,,2025-07-28 11:57:17.197993

He was there as the Affordable Care Act marketplace came online, and as Missouri slowly expanded its Medicaid program, known as MO HealthNet.

He’s witnessed Missouri struggling for years to process benefits applications in a timely manner.
Now, under President Donald Trump’s new budget plan, Americans aged 19 to 64 who are enrolled in Medicaid will be required to show proof of 80 hours of work, school, caregiving or volunteering a month to be eligible for coverage.
Wehner worries about what new Medicaid work requirements might mean for the people he assists on a day-to-day basis.
“It’s going to directly affect the Medicaid expansion (group),” said Wehner, a benefits enrollment counselor at Missouri Connections for Health in Columbia. “I think tangentially, it will affect the other populations, just because of the amount of resources that will be needed to see if these people are putting in 80 hours.”
For years, Missouri has struggled to process social services applications in a timely manner, drawing the ire of advocates and the courts. Federal regulations require states to process Medicaid applications based on income in 45 days, but Missouri has repeatedly violated the time frame requirements.
Wehner anticipates more confusion with the new rules, which are slated to begin in December 2026, after the midterm elections.
Missouri struggles to administer safety net programs. Congress is proposing more red tape

Research in states that have put work requirements in place confirms that suspicion. Enrollees found it difficult to fulfill the requirements and submit the proper documentation, leading to people losing coverage.
“I imagine I’m going to get a lot of people asking for help,” Wehner said. “You get your yellow letter in the mail. It’s several pages. Even when I’m working with people, I get a highlighter and I go through and find, ‘OK, here’s what we need to do.’ It’s not really obvious what you need to do.”
New estimates from KFF found that the Trump administration’s budget package would reduce federal Medicaid spending by $911 billion over the next 10 years and increase the number of uninsured Americans by 10 million. The largest portion of savings would come from work requirements on the Affordable Care Act expansion group – totaling about $326 billion saved over the next decade.
In Missouri, that would amount to an estimated 130,000 people losing access to Medicaid as their form of health insurance.
 How the state may shift to handle increased eligibility checks 

For years, Missouri has looked to update its technology to better handle the administrative burden as advocates demanded solutions to the delays across Medicaid and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) applications.
“It really is going to be a new system to implement,” said Lucas Caldwell-McMillan, the chief of policy at Empower Missouri, an anti-poverty advocacy group. “Right now we’ve got a pretty outdated system that is struggling. I think the frontline agency staff are working their hardest to implement it now, but they’re falling short.”
Under the new framework for Medicaid, states will need to process proof of the 80 hours of work, school, caregiving or volunteering, and will need to check eligibility for enrollment twice a year, rather than the current standard of once annually.
“These are six-month eligibility checks, so essentially doubling the work there,” said Caldwell-McMillan. “Both on the participant, but also the agency. And instituting these work requirements in Medicaid will require a whole new system to verify information that’s never been verified by the Medicaid agency before.”
According to Timothy McBride, a health economist and professor at the Washington University School of Public Health, states and enrollees have struggled to keep track of the documentation required to track whether people are working.
“The recipient has to actually interact with the program and make sure they get the paperwork filled out and submitted and it doesn’t get lost,” McBride said. “And that’s where it has broken down in states like Missouri, and where this has caused problems in our past.”
The increased burden for the state could come at a high cost, with not much savings. Research shows that both in Missouri and at the national level, about 90% of adults on Medicaid already have a job or would be considered exempt from work requirements.
States like Arkansas and Georgia have looked to put work requirements in place for years, but both have struggled.
Arkansas briefly put 20-hour per week work requirements in place from 2018 to 2019 for childless adults aged 30 to 49. After a federal court blocked the requirements, Arkansas stopped the program.
But in the brief time those requirements were in place, about 18,000 enrollees in the state lost their coverage. The state spent more than $26 million in administrative costs on eligibility checks and to put the program in place.
A study found that half of those in Arkansas who had lost Medicaid as part of the requirements reported serious problems paying off medical debt, while 56% delayed some form of medical care due to the cost and 64% delayed medication due to the cost.
The study also found that the work requirements did little to increase the number of enrollees who were employed. More than 95% of those in the work requirement group were either already working or qualified for an exemption. There did not appear to be any significant upticks in employment as a result of the requirements.
In 2023, 44% of the adults 19-64 enrolled in Medicaid were working full time, while 20% were working part time. Another 12% didn’t work due to caregiving, while 10% didn’t work due to illness and 7% didn’t work because they were enrolled in school, leaving only 8% not working due to another reason.
In an interview with St. Louis Public Radio, Todd Richardson, the director of Missouri’s Medicaid program, said the state would look into using an online portal to streamline the process for enrollees.
“Our goal is to make sure that people who are eligible and entitled to be on the program have the easiest path to get access to those benefits, while at the same time ensuring that those who are not eligible for the program are not on the program,” he told the outlet.
“If they’re working and we can verify that they’re working through income data, then that’s a verification right there,” Richardson added. “Now, there are other exceptions to the work requirements that probably will require a participant to send some documentation or to involve a human. But I think there’s a lot of that income verification that can be done electronically.”
Reduction of federal support for the program and the ways that states can fund Medicaid will leave Missouri lawmakers with a tricky budget situation in the years to come. Because the state’s expansion came through a voter-approved constitutional amendment, lawmakers won’t be able to easily undo the expansion, and the state is on the hook to pay for the full cost of the program.
States may turn to other programs to find ways to recoup the costs.
Missouri offers benefits through Medicaid beyond what is required by the federal government. Things like dental coverage, some mental health coverage, long-term care or Missouri’s recent expansion of Medicaid for postpartum women could be targets for cuts.
“I imagine they’re pretty nervous about this,” McBride said. “Frankly, those of us who just want the state to function are nervous for them because we want them to be able to do this. It’s really potentially catastrophic for the state.”
Otherwise, McBride said, programs like education, roads or prison funding would be likely places for the state to turn.
“The other options are to cut spending elsewhere,” McBride said. “They would cut Medicaid in places where they can cut Medicaid, and I’m pretty sure the state would have to cut from all of the above.”
 How could work requirements look in rural Missouri? 

New work requirements pose hurdles in rural parts of the state that urban areas may not face. Completing the necessary paperwork with unreliable internet or technology access could add another layer of difficulty.
Things like access to transportation, or a job with enough hours, could set Missourians back from obtaining coverage, said Caldwell-McMillan.
“It’s finding a job, and finding a job that is going to give you enough hours all of the time when they’re checking eligibility requirements,” Caldwell-McMillan said. “Retail workers, cashiers, cooks, those shifts can change. All of those folks are very much at risk — although they’re working — of not exactly meeting the hourly requirements and at risk of losing coverage.”
Navigators like Wehner will have to consider ways to help people report their work or caregiving when they may not have much access to technology.
“A lot of people I work with live out in rural areas. They may not even have a smartphone and definitely not internet access,” Wehner said. “So just to report things online is going to be really burdensome.”
Other trickle-down impacts could also hit rural Missouri the hardest. Rural hospitals, for example, rely heavily on Medicaid reimbursements to keep their doors open. Most recent data show 44% of rural hospitals have negative margins.
The budget package includes $50 billion for a rural hospital fund, which is equal to about one-third of the estimated loss of federal Medicaid funding in rural communities. The budget provides $10 million a year for five years for the fund, but health economists and Medicaid experts say the federal spending will be finished before many of the losses to Medicaid funding are fully realized.
Coupled with cuts to SNAP, the potential loss of a hospital in a rural area could be damaging to local economies, Caldwell-McMillan said.
“Many of those counties are the folks who are facing perhaps a closure of a clinic or the closure of the closest hospital because of cuts to Medicaid,” Caldwell-McMillan said. “So it really is a perfect storm of folks — working families — who need the support, and then two big sources of support are going to be taken away.”
“There’s going to be really tough choices and really tough consequences.”

(Photo by Brent Stirton/Getty Images)Their cases were different. One faced a four-year prison sentence in a $675 million fraud case for marketing an electric truck that wasn’t drivable. Another tried to overthrow the government. A tax cheat avoided prison and $4.4 million in restitution after his mom donated $1 million to the president.
Their cases have two things in common. President Donald Trump pardoned them all in the early months of his second administration. And those pardons violated long-standing Department of Justice policies that reward people who show remorse, pay restitution and can contribute to society. Since returning to the White House, Trump has pardoned more than 1,600 people and at least two corporations in his first six months in office. Many of those pardons have violated standards designed to ensure fairness and to protect the public, attorneys and legal experts say.

This story is part of “Trump Two: Six Months In,” a Marshall Project series taking stock of the administration’s efforts to reshape immigration enforcement and criminal justice.

The changes began immediately. Hours after taking the oath of office, Trump pardoned more than 1,500 rioters who attacked the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. That included men who used bear spray, bats, batons and poles to assault police officers.
Past presidents have issued controversial pardons, usually in their last days in office: Bill Clinton pardoned financier Marc Rich, Joe Biden pardoned his son Hunter despite promising not to, and George H.W. Bush pardoned six prominent officials for their roles in the Iran-Contra scandal.
But legal experts say no president has started a term with so many pardons that violate long-standing policies and norms.
Lee Kovarsky, a University of Texas law professor, describes Trump’s Jan. 6 action as “patronage pardoning” — highly publicized actions that send the message that Trump will protect allies who break the law to advance his agenda. “It’s mafia stuff,” Kovarsky said. “They won’t break your legs, but they’ll publicly pardon the person who does.”
Article II of the Constitution gives the president the power to pardon anyone for federal crimes. The Supreme Court’s 2024 decision about presidential immunity made it clear that the president has broad leeway when exercising core powers of the office.
“The Supreme Court decision makes it hard to even get a grasp on just how blatantly corrupt presidential conduct would have to be to overcome immunity,” said Brandon Garrett, a Duke University law professor.
In her dissent in the immunity case, Justice Sonia Sotomayor specifically cited pardons when listing crimes that future presidents could commit without consequences. “Orders the Navy’s Seal Team 6 to assassinate a political rival? Immune. Organizes a military coup to hold onto power? Immune. Takes a bribe in exchange for a pardon? Immune. Immune, immune, immune.”
The Justice Department has housed the Pardon Attorney since 1894. Over the years, the practice of processing applications for pardons and commutations has been codified in the Justice Manual, which lays out how clemency is supposed to be administered.
One of the two main purposes of the Justice Manual is to ensure that all applications are judged by the same set of rules regardless of who you are or who you know, said Liz Oyer, who served as Pardon Attorney for three years. The second is to “ensure that it is granted to people who are truly deserving of a second chance and who will not present a danger to the community in the future.”

In March, actor Mel Gibson, a friend of Trump, sought to have his criminal record cleaned up so he could own a gun again. Oyer declined to recommend a pardon due to Gibson’s history of violence against women. She was fired several hours later, with no reason given. She is suing to get her job back.
The Justice Department issued a statement saying that it follows the Justice Manual in reviewing pardon applications and making recommendations.
One of the pardon office’s first tasks is to seek input from the people with a stake in the conviction: prosecutors, sentencing judges and crime victims. The office can request an FBI background check. The Jan. 6 pardons were announced hours after inauguration, so no input was solicited in the 1,500 cases.
Among the people Trump pardoned for Jan. 6 was David Daniel of Mint Hill, North Carolina. Had the rules been followed, the pardon office would have learned that Daniel faces charges of child pornography and the sexual assault of a preadolescent girl.
In serious crimes — violence or expensive white collar crime, for example — the Justice Manual recommends that a suitable length of time should elapse before a pardon is even considered to avoid denigrating the seriousness of the offense.
That stipulation didn’t apply to Stewart Rhodes, the leader of the Oath Keepers — a far-right anti-government militia — who was sentenced to 18 years for trying to overthrow the government. He served less than two years before Trump commuted his sentence to time served. Trump has also pardoned at least nine people before or shortly after they reported to prison, including one person before sentencing.
Another important policy in the Justice Manual on pardons is whether the person has accepted responsibility and is remorseful: “A petitioner should be genuinely desirous of forgiveness rather than vindication.”
Trump pardoned Enrique Tarrio, the leader of the Proud Boys and an architect of the attack on the Capitol, who had been sentenced to 22 years. Afterward, Tarrio and other Proud Boys sued the Justice Department for $100 million, claiming they were the victims of wrongful prosecution.
Another important condition for a pardon is restitution: Have the pardon seekers paid money to make their crime victims whole?
This brings up what Kovarsky, the Texas law professor, calls the “open for business pardon,” in which Trump grants pardons to people who have politically supported him or who may owe large sums in restitution.
A jury convicted Trevor Milton, the founder of electric truck startup Nikola, on fraud charges; a judge sentenced him to four years in prison. He notably had made a video in which a prototype truck that appeared to be driving down a highway was actually a nonfunctioning truck rolling down an incline.
In October, Milton and his wife each donated $900,000 to Trump political committees. In March, federal prosecutors urged the trial judge to order Milton to pay $675 million in restitution. Two weeks later, shortly before Milton was to report to federal prison, Trump granted him a pardon that eliminated his prison sentence and wiped away his restitution to the victims of his fraud.
Milton has maintained that he is innocent, that he was the victim of dishonest Biden administration prosecutors, and that his political contributions had nothing to do with the pardon. He said he donated to Trump out of opposition to Biden’s economic policy. “I just wanted some fiscal responsibility,” he told a Phoenix TV reporter.
In late 2024, Paul Walczak, a Florida nursing home executive, was sentenced to 18 months in prison and ordered to pay $4.4 million in restitution for stealing his employees’ tax payments. Just three weeks after Walczak’s mother attended a $1 million-a-head fundraiser for Trump at Mar-a-Lago, the president pardoned Walczak, wiping out the prison term and restitution.
Trump’s pardons have proved costly for taxpayers and crime victims. Besides the group pardons of Jan. 6 defendants and anti-abortion protestors, the president has pardoned 46 individuals. Of those, more than half have been freed of fines and restitution.
Oyer, the former pardon attorney, has set up a “pardon tracker” on her website that tallies the price of Trump’s pardons of people and companies that owed restitution and fines. As of July 23, the cost to taxpayers and crime victims is more than $1.3 billion.
Oyer’s tracker also shows a growing backlog of pardon applications from ordinary Americans. The queue was just under 5,000 when Trump entered office. The count on July 15 had more than doubled, to 11,664.

(Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)Members of a task force aiming to reduce the property tax burden for South Dakota homeowners are considering proposals to reduce or replace property taxes by relying on sales or transaction taxes.
The task force dug into two proposals and heard a new idea from a former lawmaker at its latest meeting in Rapid City earlier this month. The Legislative Research Council also prepared other options to reduce or replace property taxes.
“It takes a lot of courage to try and digest all of this,” said task force member and state House Majority Leader Scott Odenbach, R-Spearfish. “For too long, because it’s such a beast, people have had trouble getting their hands around property taxes, what they fund, and increased spending, until people get forced out of their homes.”

The Comprehensive Property Tax Task Force aims to recommend ways to cut the average South Dakota homeowner’s property taxes by at least 50%. Lawmakers already adopted Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden’s proposal earlier this year to slow property tax increases with multifaceted reforms including a five-year, countywide 3% cap on growth in owner-occupied home assessments.
Property taxes go to schools, counties, cities and other local taxing entities, such as water and fire districts. Sales taxes go to cities and the state. The state does not receive any property tax revenue.
The total, statewide amount of property taxes paid on owner-occupied homes grew by 64% from 2017 to 2024, according to state Department of Revenue data. A public outcry about rising tax bills led legislators to appoint the summer task force, which aims to propose legislation for the annual winter lawmaking session.
The task force has heard public comment not only in Rapid City but also in Sioux Falls and plans to meet three more times, including in Aberdeen and Pierre.
“I think we’re at a point where we need to start coalescing ideas and presenting them,” said the chairman of the task force, state Senate President Pro Tempore Chris Karr, R-Sioux Falls.
Task force hears new proposal
The newest proposal pitched to the task force this month would add a flat $1.50 tax on transactions of $15 or greater, and add a tax of 10% on smaller transactions. The new tax, said former state Sen. Julie Frye-Mueller, R-Rapid City, would replace property taxes entirely by generating $1.75 billion in revenue.
“Our ultimate goal is to remove the threat of government or others from taking our properties with a tax lien,” Frye-Mueller said.
A tax lien is a legal claim that local governments can place on a home when property taxes are delinquent. It triggers a process that can ultimately lead to the seizure and sale of the property.

The transaction taxes would be added on top of the state’s current sales tax structure, which includes the state 4.2% sales tax, up to 2% city sales taxes, and up to 1% additional city taxes on alcohol, restaurants, event admissions and lodging. 
With all of those rates applied, the current tax on a $15 purchase would be $1.08. With the additional flat transaction tax, it would grow to $2.58.
Frye-Mueller said the transaction taxes would also be applied to purchases that are currently exempt from sales taxes. She and other speakers said it would not be regressive since property taxes would no longer exist or be figured into monthly rental amounts.
The proposal uses a calculation relying on visitor spending from 15 million people, which made some lawmakers skeptical. The state Department of Revenue would collect the tax and distribute it among local governments, based on their budgeting needs, according to the presentation. The proposal would allow the Legislature to increase the flat rate by up to a nickel each year.
The group backing the proposal, Abolish Property Taxes South Dakota, plans to ask legislators to put the plan on the ballot for voters to consider. If that fails, they plan to submit it as a citizen-initiated ballot measure for the November 2026 election.
More details on governor’s proposal
Gov. Rhoden has proposed an optional county-level sales tax of a half-percent to offset participating counties’ property taxes on owner-occupied homes. A “homeowner tax credit” would be applied to property taxes from the revenue generated from the half-percent sales tax, according to proposal documents. A homeowner’s tax bill would show the amount of tax credits applied to the property.
If funds from the optional sales tax fully offset owner-occupied property taxes in a county, remaining funds would be used to lower property taxes for agricultural and commercial properties. The tax relief option could be referred to a public vote if residents don’t agree with their local county commission’s decision to impose it.
Some lawmakers worried that the sales tax idea would shift the tax burden from property to sales and South Dakotans wouldn’t see an overall reduction in taxes they pay. Bureau of Finance and Management Commissioner Jim Terwilliger and Sen. Randy Deibert, R-Spearfish, said homeowners would save money.
“I’d have to spend $50,000 before I matched my local county taxation with a 0.5% sales tax,” Deibert said. “That’s just in my district.”

Statewide, a half-percent sales tax would replace, on average, 94% of a county’s share of owner-occupied property taxes, according to estimates from the governor’s administration. The proposal would not affect the property taxes received by cities, schools and other local taxing entities.
In Minnehaha County, the half-percent sales tax would cover an estimated 98% of owner-occupied property taxes. The strategy would cover an estimated 76% in Pennington County.
Counties that share jurisdiction with tribal land would see the largest potential increase in funds to offset property taxes, largely because tribal land is not subject to property taxes. The counties that would see the lowest benefit, based on the estimates, would be Turner, Clay and Meade counties at 48%, 52% and 56% of owner-occupied taxes, respectively.
LRC studies other options
In a white paper prepared by the Legislative Research Council, eliminating the county portion of owner-occupied taxes would, on average, reduce homeowners’ property taxes by 20%.
South Dakota schools rely on three education levies collected through property taxes: general education, special education and capital outlay. Eliminating the special education and general education levies would reduce average owner-occupied property taxes by 25%.
Eliminating two education and the county levies would cost $430.8 million to counties and schools, unless the loss is replaced with different revenue sources.
The white sheet explored different ways to replace property taxes wholly or in part by increasing local governments’ other revenues or capturing more state funding for local use, including cutting state government across the board, raising sales tax rates, increasing the contractor’s excise tax rate, redirecting a portion of Future Fund economic development dollars toward property tax relief, increasing the state’s share of video lottery revenue, removing some sales tax and property tax exemptions, and placing a new tax on vaping. Each proposal would put some or all of the savings or gains toward local governments for property tax reductions.

The research also dug into a tax that state Senate Majority Leader Jim Mehlhaff proposed at a prior meeting. Mehlhaff, R-Pierre, proposed an additional 1% tax on all sales in the state including currently exempt sales, except for items intended for resale and items that, constitutionally, cannot be taxed. 
Originally, the proposal was thought to be able to replace education property taxes paid across all types of property, which was $928.6 million in 2023. Owner-occupied property taxes paid for $382.4 million that year. Based on the latest LRC estimate, the tax would generate about $698 million in revenue for education.
Odenbach, who chairs the task force’s school funding work group, said the revenue replacement would have to be “iron clad” and not allow local governments to increase budgets through property taxes later. He added that some exemptions in the state tax code could be repealed and cuts could be made across state government, among other things, to raise money that could be applied to reduce property taxes for South Dakotans.
“I think these things are all in the mix,” Odenbach said.
South Dakota homeowners paid about $792 million in owner-occupied property taxes in 2024. South Dakotans across all types of property paid nearly $1.8 billion in property taxes.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_2702-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-28 10:56:20.335256

(Photo by Cressandra Thibodeaux, with the background artificially expanded by Source for publication purposes).On July 29, New Mexico legislators on the interim Science, Technology & Telecommunications Committee are slated to meet in Los Alamos and hear testimony on “responsible artificial intelligence” from several experts, including Santa Fe Institute Professor Cris Moore.
A computer scientist, Moore’s interest in AI dates to at least 2016, when he noted an uptick in discussion about its rising use. Computer scientists, civil rights advocates, legal scholars and others were concerned about using algorithms to make decisions in the criminal justice system, he says, but also about their rising use for myriad “consequential decisions, things that really affect people’s fundamental rights, their lives, their livelihoods, their opportunities: hiring, loans, leases, home-buying and so-on.”
Moore had initially thought he’d contribute to that discourse as an academic, but conversations with State Sen. Peter Wirth (D-Santa Fe) connected Moore to the late state Supreme Court Judge Charles Daniels, who in turn put him in touch with New Mexico’s Administrative Office of the Courts. From there, Moore worked with the University of New Mexico’s Institute for Social Research to evaluate an algorithmic criminal justice assessment tool used widely in the state. That led to data-driven work published in 2022 assessing the potential outcome of ongoing proposals to expand pretrial detention. That research found those proposals would lead to a very high percentage of defendants being unnecessarily and unfairly detained.
In an interview with Source, Moore said decision makers and society need to consider both sides when thinking about the use of algorithmic tools in criminal justice.
“We need to think about the false positives — where we think that someone is dangerous even though they’re not — and we detain them, and the false negatives, where we release somebody, and then they do something really serious.”
As he’s worked on these issues, Moore said, he’s learned “just how complicated the system is, and the stakes of the debate…This started out as a question about mathematics and statistics, and it’s turned much more into a question about human beings and human systems, including the judicial system. How should the systems be run, and what does it mean for those systems to be fair? What does it mean for those systems to be transparent?
This week’s AI legislative hearing comes amid ongoing government discussion of AI, near and far. In May, New Mexico’s Public Education Department published its AI guidance for K-12 education. Last week, the Trump administration released its AI “action plan.”
The following interview has been edited for concision and clarity.
 
You delivered a presentation to lawmakers five years ago and listed four questions to help evaluate the fairness and transparency of AI. Does that list still hold? [The list, summarized: How does the algorithm work? Can we validate its performance independently? When should humans be in that process? And what does the data really mean?]
Cristopher Moore: Often now, what I lead with is: ‘What data does the algorithm use?’ Because that already raises a lot of issues. Is it using my social media? Does it know I’ve applied for a job? For an apartment? That gets into lots of questions, including privacy. I think I would like to know something about what it does with this data, which, in some cases, gets into more technical questions about its inner workings. And yes, I would like to know, ‘Hey, does this thing actually work?’ Has any independent entity tested the vendors’ claims?’ There are a lot of AI systems out there being used to make important decisions, or to advise human decision-makers about important decisions, that have never been independently tested by anybody— we’re just relying on the vendors’ claims, and I think that’s a pretty dangerous situation.
The good thing about AI is we can measure it and observe it and get a clear sense of what mistakes it makes. But again, that’s something vendors are not incentivized to advertise.
What do you plan to tell state lawmakers?
There are things that state legislatures can do to try to ensure that AI is used properly, that it is accountable, and that it has some degree of transparency. I’m not against AI, but I am against opaque systems that their users and the people affected by them don’t understand; [whose] vendors are not willing to open up and tell you how they work; and where they haven’t even been independently tested by anybody. 
I think it’s appropriate for state legislatures — and a lot of them are doing this — to draw some guardrails and to say, ‘Well, you know, if you’re going to make these so called consequential decisions about people, then you should be open to having some independent studies done.’ Or at the very least: You should make people aware that they’re interacting with an AI. One of the things that it would make sense to ask for is just disclosure. If you’re going to apply for a job, and the company you’re applying to is going to use an AI to screen the job applicants — maybe you’re applying for a job with particular skills and maybe they will use an AI to read your resume to try to certify you have those skills — at least let the applicant know that’s happening. That’s the least, to me, that’s the floor: Don’t hide the fact that an AI is being used to make a decision about you.
President Trump’s new AI ‘action plan’ intimates that states with burdensome AI regulation could lose out on federal funding. Is it worth it for New Mexico to lose funding to create those guardrails?
Well, of course, I’m strongly against that policy. You probably know that in the Big Beautiful Bill, [Republican Texas U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz] had proposed a 10-year moratorium on state AI laws and, after some back and forth with [Republican Tennessee U.S. Sen. Marsha Blackburn], that moratorium was removed by a 99-to-one vote. So I think the good news is: This is not a partisan issue, at least not yet. I’m worried that it’s becoming partisan, but it shouldn’t be partisan. In fact, some of the model laws we’re looking at come from Utah. Utah put together an AI policy office. A friend of mine works there, and one of the things that they were tasked to do is develop guidelines for mental health chat bots. So, it’s like: ‘We have a hideous shortage of mental health providers; Is this maybe a good kind of frontline thing to help people?’ Some people are like, ‘Yeah, that’s a great idea.’ And some people are like, ‘Oh, my god no.’ But it seems clear that if these things are going to be used, they should make it absolutely clear to the patient that they were talking to an AI and not to a human. And moreover, the AI should look out for things where [it will say]: ‘OK, this is above my pay grade. You really need to talk to a human about this.’
Trump’s AI Action Plan removes ‘red tape’ for AI developers and data centers, punishes states that act alone

Colorado’s law is considered one of the most comprehensive and requires developers to disclose information about their AI systems as well as its potential risks of discrimination. Would New Mexico benefit from a similar law?
Our House Bill 60 in the last session was inspired by the Colorado law, and the Colorado law is still on the books, although some people tried to get rid of it in their last legislative session. I think there are things we could do to make that kind of bill better. One of the objections to the Colorado law is that it puts some responsibility on the developers of these tools, but it also puts a lot of responsibility on the deployers — the users of these tools. I think there was some legitimate concern about, ‘What if I’m a small school district using some AI, or what if I’m a rural clinic using AI? Are you saying I need to do some big, complicated study that I don’t have the expertise to do?’ I think putting more of the responsibility on the developers is probably a good idea.
New Mexico’s Public Education Department recently published its K-12 AI guidance, which includes ethical awareness as one of its literacy points, but also notes the use of AI to help with building lesson plans and such. Is this potentially problematic given the degree to which some AI systems tend to fabricate information?
It’s vitally important for people to understand that these chat bots are not trying to tell the truth. They’re also not trying to lie. They’re not trying to be deceptive. They’re also not trying to say accurate things about the world. They are simply emitting strings of words that look statistically like the strings of words in their training data.
There are basic skills of writing a book report; or reading something and synthesizing it; or reading two opposing essays on a topic and synthesizing an understanding of the arguments.

Roy Cooper formally launched his campaign for U.S. Senate on Monday morning, making a long-rumored candidacy official and cementing himself as the all-but-certain Democratic nominee in 2026.
In a video announcement, Cooper says he “really never wanted to go to Washington.” But now, he’ll seek to head there as the successor to retiring U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis, a Republican — hoping to flip the seat blue.
“Right now, our country is facing a moment as fragile as any I can remember,” Cooper said. “And the decisions we make in the next election will determine if we even have a middle class in America.”
Cooper served two terms in the governor’s mansion, with prior stints as attorney general and a state senator. He’s a Nash County native and attorney. His launch comes just days after he teased his run in front of state Democrats at the party’s annual fundraising dinner.
He is currently joined in the Democratic field by former U.S. Rep. Wiley Nickel, who is reportedly set to suspend his campaign. And his Republican opponent will most likely be Michael Whatley — the Republican National Committee chairman and former head of the North Carolina GOP.
Early campaign messaging from Cooper and Democrats signal that he will lean on his reputation and accomplishments in elected office — including working with lawmakers to expand Medicaid and raise teacher pay.
North Carolin Democratic Party chair Anderson Clayton said in a statement she was “confident he will flip this seat in 2026.” And Senate Majority PAC, one of the main campaign fundraisers for Senate Democrats, said Cooper’s entry “confirms the state is a prime pick-up opportunity.”
Republicans, meanwhile, see him as a frequent target of criticism and controversy, which they’ll seek to capitalize on.
U.S. Rep. Richard Hudson, who chairs congressional Republicans’ campaign operation, said Cooper “spent decades dragging North Carolina left, and now he wants to do the same to America.”
Senate Republicans’ campaign arm called him a “wreck” in a digital ad criticizing his record. And the Senate Leadership Fund, a PAC for the Senate GOP, blasted him for the state’s hurricane response and key vetoes on transgender rights and immigration.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_9728-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-28 10:56:20.335256

Dorothy Barnett, executive director of the Climate + Energy Project, became interested in climate science and energy through working in community and economic development in rural areas. 


Reflector Podcast · Federal green energy u-turn, natural gas costs concern environmentalist

“I wanted to see how rural Kansas could really take advantage of the clean energy economy and how that could help the areas I had grown up in,” she said. “But as I learned more about climate change, about the environment, as I began to be a grandmother, much of the mission to equitably reduce greenhouse gas emissions resonated with me.”
Today, she’s watching with concern as federal policy encourages the country’s energy reliance on fossil fuels and reduces incentives to move toward green energy. 
“My primary concern about what’s happening is how the inaction we’re taking will impact climate change,” she said. “Every report that we read, every bit of scientific data, says this is the decade that we should be scaling up large-scale renewable energy projects and cutting greenhouse gas emissions if we’re going to stay within a reasonable amount of global warming.”
Barnett pointed to climate change effects, including recent flooding and heat waves. 
“I was reading an article yesterday that was talking about every degree it gets hotter is impacting crop yield, and that should concern every Kansan as the breadbasket of the world,” she said. “Climate change is an economic issue. It’s a health issue. It’s a resiliency issue.”
Along with those concerns, Barnett also highlights the pocketbook effect for most Kansans, who will be paying more for energy. The federal government changed or eliminated incentives to build large-scale wind and solar farms, which do a lot to help Kansans offset costs associated with gas and coal, she said. 
Barnett listed other changes that cut support for the federal weatherization program that helps people with low incomes make their homes more energy efficient and safe. 
Kansas Corporation Commission Chairman Andrew French at a hearing last week talked with Evergy officials about potential inequities in the energy system. 
“You’ve probably got a lot of higher-income folks that have newer housing stock, efficient appliances, their bills are on autopay, so they may be experiencing lower bills, even if they have a larger house,” French said. “And they’re not as price sensitive. Then you’ve got a pretty good segment of the population that’s lower income. They have less efficient housing stock, they have less efficient appliances and probably don’t have the means to upgrade those.”
French said that there’s an argument to be made that offering the same rates for such vastly different residential consumers could be seen as “not just and reasonable or unreasonably discriminatory.”
Such discussion isn’t a surprise to Barnett. 
“We’ve seen decades of disinvestment in marginalized communities,” she said. “Folks that are in those older homes oftentimes are dealing with really hard choices. Am I going to pay the electric bill so that I can maintain some sort of cooling in these high temperatures that we’re facing, or am I going to be able to buy some medicine and put some food on the table?”
 
Aging infrastructure
Keeping energy costs down is an important consideration for infrastructure expansions in the state. Evergy recently received KCC approval to build two natural gas plants and a solar plant. Barnett is concerned about the gas plants, which she refuses to call “natural.”. 
“That’s a fossil fuel talking point, so let’s call it what it is,” she said. “It’s fossil gas, and it may not be as bad from a greenhouse gas emission standpoint or from a carbon pollution standpoint as coal, but it does emit methane, which is a very strong greenhouse gas.” 
Climate + Energy Project intervened in the KCC docket about building the new plants, Barnett said. 
“We oppose them on two fronts,” she said. “Again, it’s completely against our mission to reduce greenhouse gas emissions equitably. From a more practical standpoint and going back to what I said about energy burden, we have some real concerns that fossil gas is a risky financial investment for Kansans.”
Barnett said the cost of gas has been “low-ish” for a decade, but according to predictions that won’t continue. Specifically, she said, the federal government is pushing for more gas use and is incentivizing exporting it to other countries, all of which are likely to drive up costs. 
She said she remembers talking with an executive in the utility industry early in her career who had begun investing in wind energy. 
“He was like, ‘We didn’t do this because we care about the environment, because we care about clean energy,’” she said, recalling his words. “‘We were really dependent on gas and our portfolio had a lot of gas and people couldn’t afford their bills. So we needed to diversify our fuel mix.’”
Energy future
Barnett said she hopes to see investment in battery energy storage systems and other innovative strategies to address utility needs. 
Battery technology and energy storage tax credits survived the federal government’s changes, she said. 
“What I’m hearing is we may begin to see a big investment in battery energy storage, while wind and solar are kind of on the back burner,” Barnett said. “Geothermal technology actually also fared well in the ‘big, beautiful bill.’”
Kansas has limited opportunities in geothermal, she said, because it uses so much water. 
“Kansas has such a robust wind resource that almost nothing can compare economically,” Barnett said. “For so many years, the mantra was, ‘Let’s let the market decide.’ Well, the market decided that wind and solar were the most cost-effective ways to generate electricity in the United States. And now, what market, right? It has been some of the most interesting times I’ve ever been a part of around wind and solar for the last almost 20 years.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Dorothy-Barnett1-1024x576.png,,,2025-07-28 10:56:20.335256

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)Between 2016 and 2022, as congenital syphilis cases rose nationally and especially in the South, Mississippi saw a one thousand percent increase — from 10 to 110 — in the number of newborn babies who were hospitalized after contracting the disease, known to cause developmental issues, intellectual disabilities, and even death.
So in 2023, the state Department of Health mandated that all medical practitioners screen for the disease in pregnant mothers, and it has been running advertisements to spread awareness.
Annual congenital syphilis cases in Mississippi rose from 62 in 2021 to 132 in 2023, according to state data. The number fell to 114 last year. There have been 33 cases so far this year.
That work won’t stop despite potential budget cuts, Dr. Daniel Edney, Mississippi’s state health officer, said in an interview. “We’re going to keep doing what we have to do, you know, to keep it under control.”
State by state, public health departments take a similar approach: They monitor, treat and try to stem preventable diseases, alongside their host of other duties. But in the coming year, health department officials — with their agencies already strapped for cash — fear they’ll find it much more difficult to do their jobs.
President Donald Trump’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2026 would cut the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention budget by more than half, from $9.3 billion to $4.2 billion. The proposal serves as a wish list from the administration, a blueprint for the Republican-controlled Congress as it works through upcoming spending legislation.
If lawmakers hew to Trump’s vision, then state and county public health departments would be hit hard. States contribute to their own health departments, but a lot of them rely heavily on federal funding.
And around half of local public health department funding comes from federal sources, primarily the CDC, as noted in a 2022 report from the National Association of County & City Health Officials.

“The federal government provides a lot of funding, but the actual implementation of public health programs happens at the state and local level,” said Josh Michaud, associate director of global health policy at KFF, a health policy research group. “Each state has its own approach, in many ways, to how public health programs are overseen, how they’re funded, how they are implemented.”
In announcing his department’s share of the proposed budget, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said Trump’s goals align with “new priorities in reversing the chronic disease epidemic.”
But many local health leaders point to the longtime mission of state public health departments in preventing the spread of disease.
“Local public health is on the front lines preventing communicable disease, operating programs to prevent chronic disease, ensuring our septic and well water systems are safe,” said Dr. Kelly Kimple, acting director of North Carolina’s Division of Public Health within the Department of Health and Human Services.
“I’m very concerned,” Kimple said, “especially given the magnitude of funding that we’re talking about, as we can’t keep doing more with less.”
Clawing back COVID-era grants
Other federal budget cuts also have states worried.
Many state public health departments grew alarmed when the Trump administration announced in March that it would be clawing back $11.4 billion in COVID-era funding for grants that were slated to extend into 2026.
Twenty-three states and the District of Columbia sued. A federal district court in Rhode Island temporarily blocked the cuts, and the case remains tied up in court.
The court’s preliminary injunction may not protect temporary staff or contractors, though. Public health departments have been laying off staff, cutting lab capacity and reducing immunization clinics, said Dr. Susan Kansagra, chief medical officer for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.

Historically, public health departments receive funding in “boom and bust” cycles, meaning they tend to get more federal support during emergencies, said Michaud, of KFF. But “since the Great Recession of 2008, there was a general decline in public health support funding until the COVID pandemic.”
For example, KHN and The Associated Press reported that between 2010 and 2019, spending on state public health departments declined by 16% per capita and spending for local health departments fell by 18%.
Nationally, syphilis cases reached historic lows in the 2000s, thanks to robust prevention efforts and education from public health officials. By 2022, however, cases reached their highest numbers nationally since the 1950s.
“In the wake of the COVID emergency, you’ve seen a sort of backlash to what people had been calling the overreach of public health and imposing vaccination requirements and lockdowns and other public health measures,” Michaud told Stateline.
Smallpox, cholera, and typhoid
Public health departments and officials go back to the 19th century, when there was a greater emphasis on sanitation efforts to prevent spread of diseases such as smallpox, cholera and typhoid, which were rampant at the time.
By the end of the century, 40 states had established health departments, which to this day are responsible for water sanitation, tracking the spread of disease, administering vaccinations, furnishing health education, providing screenings for infants and some prenatal care for moms at local clinics, offering family planning services, and tracking and treating sexually transmitted infections, among other things.










What we're seeing now is a complete upheaval of the funding going into public health.


– Josh Michaud, associate director of global health policy at KFF


Kimple pointed to measles as a current example of a disease that’s spreading fast. When North Carolina’s health department detected a case in the state, she said, the department “identified and contacted everyone who might have been exposed, helped people get tested, worked with doctors to make sure they knew how to respond.”
That’s the legacy of local public health, Michaud said.
“The federal government cannot decide, ‘This public health program will happen in this state, but not that state,’ that kind of thing. And cannot declare a national lockdown. The COVID pandemic tested a lot of those boundaries. It really is a state and local responsibility to protect public health. And that’s always been the case, since the beginning of our country,” Michaud said.
“And what we’re seeing now is a complete upheaval of the funding going into public health.”
A major cut in services
Kimple said she’s seen recent progress in her state in the support for funding public health.
“North Carolinians viewed our work as highly important to improving health and well-being in the state, and appreciated the local presence, the reliable information, the role in prevention and efforts to protect, in particular, vulnerable communities,” she said.
Similarly, Edney said that Mississippi state lawmakers were showing more support, despite some setbacks in 2016 and 2017. New federal cuts could throw a wrench in the health department’s economic plans and its ability to reach small communities.
“Now the federal rug is being pulled out from under us,” he said.
Edney said he expects the federal share of his department’s public health funding to fall from its current 65% to around 50%.
Edney said he’s been trying to strengthen Mississippi health department’s longevity by diversifying its revenue streams by, for example, accepting private donations.
The state will not stop doing its “core” work, he said, regardless of federal funding.
“We’re not going to cut back on services at the county health department, because what we do now is all mission critical,” Edney said.

Several states have passed new laws regulating these machines, which officials say are increasingly being used to scam consumers. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)They may resemble other ATMs, but officials are increasingly warning about the potential for fraud with the expanding fleet of cryptocurrency ATMs popping up across the country.
The National Consumers League says the largely unregulated machines have become favored by scammers for their anonymity and irreversibility — once a user transfers or deposits funds, that money is essentially gone.
While officials say the machines can be used for legitimate purposes, red and blue states are increasingly imposing new regulations to protect consumers: AARP says 11 states have recently passed new laws or regulations of the machines.
“In state after state, AARP found lawmakers on both sides of the aisle and local law enforcement eager to work on commonsense rules that balance innovation and consumer safety,” Nancy LeaMond, AARP’s executive vice president and chief advocacy and engagement officer, said in a news release.
Last year, the FBI reported nearly 11,000 complaints of cryptocurrency ATM fraud. Those cases disproportionately affected older Americans and cost victims $246.7 million.
Cryptocurrencies are digital assets, including bitcoin, that offer an alternative payment or method without control of a central bank or government like other currencies. Crypto ATMs, sometimes called crypto kiosks, allow users to insert cash or use debit cards to convert currencies such as U.S. dollars into cryptocurrencies.
The Federal Trade Commission says crypto ATM scams often start with a call or text message warning of a supposed problem, such as unauthorized bank charges or suspicious activity on an Amazon account.
The FTC says consumers should contact banks or other institutions directly about any account issues. And it warns consumers not to believe anyone who says they must use a crypto ATM to address a financial problem.
“Real businesses and government agencies will never do that — anyone who does is a scammer,” the agency said.
States look at shoring up consumer protections as Trump hobbles federal watchdog

After signing a bill with new regulations, Nebraska Republican Gov. Jim Pillen was clear that the state would continue to welcome cryptocurrency businesses as it aims to become a hub for the industry.
The Nebraska law requires ATM operators to acquire state licensure, warn customers of the potential for criminal exploitation and take “reasonable steps to detect and prevent fraud.” The law also limits transactions to $2,000 per day for new customers and $10,500 for existing customers, and requires operators to issue refunds for properly reported fraudulent transactions.
At least 40 states have introduced legislation regarding cryptocurrency, digital or virtual currencies and other digital assets in the 2025 legislative session, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Those measures include ATM regulations, prohibiting the use of digital currencies by governments and allowing state investment in digital assets.
Federal lawmakers are also taking action on the issue. The Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives declared the week of July 14 “Crypto Week,” when lawmakers considered several pieces of legislation.
At the end of that week, President Donald Trump signed into law the GENIUS Act, the first major law governing digital currency. It establishes a regulatory framework for the industry.
Trump hopes the bill will instill confidence in the industry that spent heavily to strengthen its legitimacy and political might, The Associated Press reported.
“This signing is a massive validation of your hard work and your pioneering spirit,” the president told crypto executives.
In state legislatures, new bills regulating crypto ATMS have enjoyed bipartisan support. AARP tracking shows new bills have been approved in Arkansas, Iowa and Oklahoma, as well as in more liberal states such as Maryland and Vermont.
In May, Arizona Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs signed Republican-sponsored legislation that sets daily transaction limits and mandates crypto ATM operators provide customers certain disclosures and warnings.
The legislation followed local news coverage of at least two dozen crypto scams, including one that cost an Arizonan $28,000.

He wanted to throw out votes cast by military and overseas voters, people he called “never residents,” and those he claimed did not provide identification numbers when they registered. 
A federal judge in May ruled Griffin’s attempt to throw out votes unconstitutional and represented an effort to change voting rules after the election. 
Riggs will talk Wednesday about the attempt to disenfranchise military voters, her experience as a judicial officer and as a former voting rights attorney, and protecting the right to vote, according to a news release. 
The forum will focus on voter suppression tactics nationwide and is the second in a series hosted by U.S. Senate Rules Committee Democrats on protecting the future of America’s elections, according to the release,
Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, Loyola Marymount University Law School Professor Justin Levitt, and Janessa Goldbeck, CEO of the Vet Voice Foundation. 
U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), and U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), will host. 
Riggs’ appearance will be the second time in two weeks that a recounting of Griffin’s attempt to overturn election results will reach Congress.

(Photo by Bruce Bennett/Getty Images)More than 63 million Americans are caregivers for a family member with complex medical needs, a 20 million increase over the past decade, according to a new report.
But state policies, workplaces and the American health system haven’t kept up with this surge in family caregiving responsibilities, said Dr. Myechia Minter-Jordan, a physician and the CEO of the AARP, which released the report with the National Alliance for Caregiving, a nonprofit policy and research organization.
“Nearly half of caregivers say they face major financial consequences, draining savings, falling into debt or struggling to afford basic needs like food and housing,” Minter-Jordan told reporters on a call this week.
One of the biggest reasons for the surge in family caregivers is that Americans are living longer, yet they’re not necessarily healthier. There’s a 12-year gap between the average number of years that Americans live and the number of years they’re healthy.
‘A purpose in this world’: Older adults fear elimination of program that helps them find work

The caregiving role typically involves helping a family member with daily tasks like bathing, dressing and eating. But more than half of caregivers also perform more complex medical tasks, such as managing catheters or administering injections, the report found.
A growing number of caregivers are so-called “sandwich caregivers” — parents caring for their children as well as for an adult family member, such as an aging parent. About 17 million people are sandwich caregivers, compared with 11 million a decade ago. And most caregivers are also working a job.
And while the bulk of caregiving still falls on women, 40% of American caregivers are men.
Some states have heeded the growing calls for action.
Earlier this year, Maine lawmakers created a state program to provide respite care, which includes services such as adult day care that give family caregivers a temporary break.
Also this year, Tennessee extended its pilot program that provides respite care for Alzheimer’s and dementia patients. The state’s legislature also passed a bipartisan bill that directs the state Medicaid program to develop guidelines to allow family caregivers to be paid for their work.
Last year, Nebraska passed a tax credit for family caregivers. Oklahoma passed a similar law the year before.
And while the United States is one of few countries that doesn’t mandate paid family leave at the federal level, 13 states and the District of Columbia have established their own paid family leave rules.

One of the most disturbing hallmarks of the Trump administration has been its relentless effort to defund public education – an effort that hit a new low earlier this month when Trump’s Department of Education announced suddenly and without warning that it would be freezing billions of dollars in essential funds – funds that Congress already appropriated and for which school districts had already budgeted.
Recently, in order to learn even more about this troubling action, Newsline’s Rob Schofield caught up with a national expert on education funding, the Project Director of the Education Funding Equity Initiative at the national nonprofit, New America, Zahava Stadler. And while federal officials have since backed down on the funding freeze much uncertainty remains, and as Stadler told Newsline, the damage that could be done to our schools is enormous.

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Last year, the Alaska Supreme Court ruled in a 4-1 decision that Eric Hafner, an imprisoned felon in New York state, could remain on Alaska’s U.S. House ballot despite a lawsuit challenging his eligibility.
On Friday, the court issued a 22-page opinion explaining that its decision came down to the definition of the word “fifth.”
When Alaskans approved 2020’s Ballot Measure 2, they installed an open primary election and a ranked choice general election. The top four vote-getters in the primary election, regardless of party, advance to the general election.
If one of those top four candidates withdraws after the primary, a section of that ballot measure says that the Alaska Division of Elections should replace the withdrawn candidate “with the candidate who received the fifth most votes in the primary election.”
But in 2024, two Republican candidates withdrew after the primary, seeking to consolidate support behind fellow Republican Nick Begich III, the eventual winner.
That meant the sixth-place candidate, Democrat Eric Hafner, was promoted to the top-four general election. 
Hafner had never lived in Alaska at the time of his candidacy and, if elected, would have been ineligible to serve in office because he was not a resident of the state at the time of his election, something required by the U.S. Constitution.
Alaska Democrats, fearing a split vote between then-incumbent Rep. Mary Peltola and Hafner, sued, arguing that the ballot measure allowed the Division of Elections to promote the fifth finisher to the top four, but not anything beyond that. 
The Division of Elections and the Alaska Republican Party disputed that interpretation. An Anchorage Superior Court judge and the Supreme Court sided with the division, preserving Hafner’s candidacy.
In the end, it didn’t matter — Peltola lost to Begich by a margin that was wider than the number of votes Hafner received. Even if every Hafner voter had gone with Peltola, she still would have lost.
Writing after that result, four of the Supreme Court’s justices concluded that the plain language of the Ballot Measure 2 law “is susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation” and is “ambiguous” about what happens if more than one winning candidate withdraws after the primary.
Given that, the justices relied on logic, prior case law and their view of voters’ intent when Alaskans approved Ballot Measure 2 in 2020.
Historically, the justices noted, they have issued orders that favor candidates’ access to the ballot.
Additionally, the language and context of Ballot Measure 2 support the idea that voters wanted to have four options in the general election.
“The language and purpose of Ballot Measure 2 favor the division’s interpretation: Allowing successive replacements aligns with the ballot measure’s goal of furnishing greater candidate choices for voters,” wrote Justice Jude Pate, an appointee of Gov. Mike Dunleavy, for the majority.
Under the Alaska Democratic Party’s interpretation of the law, the justices wrote, there could be a situation where three candidates withdraw after the primary election, leaving the remaining candidate unopposed in the general election, even if there were more candidates in the primary.
“We doubt that voters and the drafters would have intended such results,” Pate wrote of that hypothetical.
Writing in dissent was Justice Susan Carney, who said that the other four justices were wrong and that the plain language of the law is clear.
“It is hard for me to imagine plainer language than this statute uses to describe the candidate who will fill a vacancy on the general election ballot,” she wrote.
Carney wrote that “Ballot Measure 2 greatly increased Alaskans’ choices for representation” but that the plain meaning of “fifth” is clear and unambiguous.
Because of that fact, “the lengths to which the court has reached to conclude otherwise are unnecessary and unreasonable.”

One of California’s largest health care providers said it will stop providing gender-affirming surgeries for patients under 19 beginning Aug. 29 — a move that was criticized by members of the LGBTQ community and praised by parental rights groups.
Kaiser Permanente serves 12 million patients in eight states, including more than 9 million in California. In a statement, the health care giant cited actions by President Donald Trump’s administration to restrict gender-affirming care, including issuing subpoenas to doctors and clinics that provide care to transgender youth.

Kaiser: “After significant deliberation and consultation with internal and external experts including our physicians, we’ve made the difficult decision to pause surgical treatment for patients. … All other gender-affirming care treatment remains available.”

Kaiser’s move follows decisions by two other California hospitals to limit transgender health services: Children’s Hospital Los Angeles, which closed its health clinic for transgender youth last week; and Stanford Medicine, which paused services earlier this month.
Some members of the California Legislative LGBTQ Caucus expressed disappointment in Kaiser’s policy while slamming the federal administration.

Assemblymember Christopher Ward, a San Diego Democrat and chairperson of the caucus, in an email to CalMatters: “While we recognize the impossible position Trump’s threats have put Kaiser in, it’s devastating that yet another barrier now stands between families and the care they know their children need. … It’s simply cruel.”

Jonathan Zachreson, a Roseville school board member who led an unsuccessful campaign last year to require California schools to notify parents if their children identified as transgender, told CalMatters that Kaiser’s decision was “a win for California and the nation.”

Zachreson: “This is protecting kids from mutilation. … It’s been very positive and we’re grateful for the federal actions that have taken place.”

Trump withholds AmeriCorps funding

From CalMatters higher education and workforce reporter Adam Echelman:
AmeriCorps’ public service programs face yet another obstacle in California. Last week the state amended one of its lawsuits against the federal government, saying AmeriCorps is withholding millions of dollars in congressionally-appropriated funds for new projects that were scheduled to start this summer. 
It’s the latest development in a months-long saga. In April the Department of Government Efficiency, better known as DOGE, pushed the federal volunteer service agency to slash programs, effectively laying off more than 5,600 California public service workers and leaving the schools that depend on AmeriCorps in a lurch. 
A few months later, a judge ordered AmeriCorps to temporarily reinstate California’s programs until the lawsuit is concluded. Despite the court order, only about half of those workers have actually returned to finish their jobs, CalMatters reported.
Now, many of the new AmeriCorps programs, which typically start in July or August, are unable to access their next round of funding. 

California Attorney General Rob Bonta, in a statement: “Last month, I secured a court order stopping the illegal dismantling of AmeriCorps. … But now, President Trump is trying a different, yet similarly, illegal tactic to withhold funding.”

The federal government has yet to respond to the amended lawsuit.



Janitorial services company settles

From CalMatters economy reporter Levi Sumagaysay:
CleanNet USA sold janitorial franchises to Californians using unfair and deceptive practices, then misclassified janitors and denied them employment rights such as minimum wage and reimbursement for supplies, the state alleged last week after an investigation by the attorney general’s office. 
The national company and its four California operators in the Bay Area, Sacramento, Southern California and San Diego must pay $1.7 million in restitution to more than 200 workers and $150,000 in civil penalties under a settlement with the state. 
The company must change its franchising business model and will be prohibited from selling franchises to sole proprietors or entities with fewer than two employees. It will also be monitored by the state Justice Department for at least three years to prove it’s complying with the settlement, which is pending court approval. 
The settlement says CleanNet denies all allegations. Robert Erickson, national director for the company, said in an email that CleanNet was “pleased” that its talks with the state led to an agreement.

HOST: Jennifer Smith
GUEST: Todd Kaplan, senior attorney at Greater Boston Legal Services







AS MASSACHUSETTS BRACES for September, and the rush of apartment turnover that comes with the start of the university term, renters and landlords alike will be navigating a new law that changes the way the state handles broker’s fees. Starting on August 1, renters cannot be forced to directly pay the fee for brokers working for landlords, though there is still the possibility that the cost gets passed on to the tenant through raised rents or so-called “junk fees.” 
Licensed brokers act as middlemen between landlords and tenants, handling tasks for the landlord that could include showing the apartment or performing a background check or credit check on the would-be tenant.  
But groups like Greater Boston Legal Services and other advocates for low-income Bay Staters have long argued that the practice of having tenants pay these fees, even when the broker works for the landlord, is creating an additional hurdle for renters in an already squeezed market. 
“It is completely an imbalanced market, where the tenants have no bargaining power,” said Todd Kaplan, senior attorney at Greater Boston Legal Services, on an episode of The Codcast. “That is it in a nutshell.” 
Tenants paying broker’s fees for the landlord has never been required by law, Kaplan told CommonWealth Beacon reporter Jennifer Smith. But it’s become common practice to demand that renters shell out first and last month’s rent, plus a security deposit, and broker’s fees that often amount to one month’s rent. This can mean that renters would have to be able to hand over as much as $12,000 to secure an average one-bedroom apartment in Boston. 
The new law isn’t as simple as an outright “ban” on the fees, Kaplan noted, though lawmakers have used the word as shorthand for the changes. 
“I think in the vast majority of cases, if a broker continues to be involved, they will be paid for by the landlord,” he said. “But this law does not prohibit a tenant from engaging a broker. And it’s just a few people – the biotech person coming from out of town, the Harvard professor who’s going to be here for a semester. They can always go and hire a broker, and they should, because they have very particular needs. The rest of us need to find housing, and if the broker is working for landlord, really the landlord should pay.” 
In the episode, Kaplan discusses how costs can still be passed on to renters through other fees (6:45), why eliminating broker’s fees was a GBLS priority (13:00), and how the one-size-fits-all law could impact different types of landlords (18:40).

Diego Rendon
Diego Rendon is a student at California State University, San Bernardino, where he is student body president.



The Coachella Valley and Inland Empire region are home to one of the largest Latino populations in California, yet for many high schoolers here, college still feels like a foreign country that they don’t know how to navigate.
I’m a first-generation college student who grew up in Desert Hot Springs. In high school, I didn’t talk to my parents about SAT scores, internships, or what the next step of my life would look like during college or after. I still remember at the age of 17, feeling completely overwhelmed with college financial aid applications and applying to college during my senior year, while balancing a part-time job to help save money for college. 
I didn’t have a roadmap to follow, but I knew I wanted more for my future. That’s why I decided to stay local and attend CalState San Bernardino Palm Desert Campus, the Coachella Valley’s only four-year public university. That decision changed everything. 
I knew I wanted to help others who came from backgrounds like mine, hardworking and full of potential, but in need of guidance and mentorship. Overall, college has pushed me out of my comfort zone and taught me how to uplift others while continuing to grow myself. 
Through it all, my family has always been my biggest motivator. Both my parents are from Sinaloa, Mexico, and my grandpa had farming roots in the Imperial Valley dating back to the 1960s. 
My dad grew up in a small town called Holtville, CA, and today works in pool construction. My mom was a stay-at-home mom and caregiver. They’ve instilled in me the value of education and taught me to chase after what I want. Growing up, my mom would always say, “La única herencia que te vamos a dar es la educación,” which translates to, “The only inheritance we’re going to give you is an education.” 
That stuck with me and still drives me today. 
After transitioning to the San Bernardino campus, I found a second home. I’ve grown more than I ever imagined. 
As student body president, I represent my peers at CSUSB and am their voice in various committees and decision-making spaces. For example, earlier this year, other students and I traveled to Sacramento to advocate on behalf of the entire California State University system. 
We shared with legislators stories about our journeys, our challenges, and how much we value our education. We reminded them that we are a true investment in the future of California and, with the right support, we’ll keep building a state we continue to call home.
That trip to Sacramento was just one part of the bigger picture. The rest is happening right here at CSUSB, where students continue to face real challenges, such as financial hardships, long commutes, demanding work hours, and food insecurity, all while giving it their absolute best. 
They’re not just trying to earn a degree; they’re trying to leave CSUSB as stronger versions of themselves and be ready to enter the workforce and build meaningful careers. These students are the true backbone of our region, but too often, they go unseen. 
I see myself in them. There was once a time in my college journey when I was juggling three different jobs, working in student government, at In-N-Out, and serving as an orientation leader. It wasn’t easy, but those experiences taught me resilience, time management, and a sense of gratitude. 
Across the Coachella Valley and Inland Empire, there are thousands of students with similar stories, students who are not just the future of California, but the ones currently shaping it.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/042224-Inland-Empire-JAH-10.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-28 08:56:55.938548

What happens when you take high interest rates, unpredictable tariffs, a shortage of homes, a 50-year-old property tax law and mix them together? A housing market stuck in molasses.


The national housing market is stuck in a post-pandemic rut.
Prices and interest rates have stalled out at unaffordable highs, keeping buyers at bay. Sellers, unable to fetch the still-higher prices they want, are backing out of the market in droves. The result is a housing market stuck in molasses, with a slow down in new listings, stagnant sales and an uptick in deals cancelled at the last minute.
If the county as a whole is in the middle of a housing market drought, conditions look especially parched in California. 
New homes listed for sale fell by more than 17% in San Francisco, compared to the same time last year, according to online real estate broker Redfin. There were double-digit year-over-year declines in listings in San Diego, Riverside, Anaheim too. Of the 10 metros where new listings fell fastest, five were in California. 
“The number of transactions have absolutely slowed down,” said Amy Kong, a real estate agent who works in and around San Francisco. “As everyone knows, it’s because of the higher interest rates and the affordability, which is just really, really low.”
Part of the market slow down can be blamed on a nationwide financial pathology that dates back half a decade, said Daryl Fairweather, Redfin’s chief economist. As mortgage borrowing costs have whipsawed from ultra-low to harrowingly high over the last five years, the gap between what most current homeowners pay for their mortgage and what they would pay if they were to borrow and buy again has reached historic highs. That makes this an inauspicious time for most homeowners to sell.
But as with so many of the nation’s housing woes, things are even worse in California thanks to the specific “dysfunctions” of our market and the particularities of our property tax system that date back to the 1970s, said Fairweather. 
Taken all together, California homeowners “have extra reasons to stay put,” she said. 
That means fewer opportunities for aspiring homeowners, more pressure on the rental market as discouraged would-be buyers find themselves shunted there and prices that are likely to remain persistently high, despite high interest rates meant to cool things off.
California’s housing market has been in a kind of holding pattern for years, said Oscar Wei, economist with the California Association of Realtors. “I thought by now we would see sales coming back up a little bit more,” he said. 
Unanswered questions about the future of the economy, tariffs and what they might mean for inflation, the stock market and how all of the above will influence interest rates are likely holding both buyers and sellers back, he explained. 
And then there’s the persistent borrowing cost gap, which economists dub the “lock-in effect.”
In an effort to jump-start an economy that had ground to a halt during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve brought borrowing rates down to near-zero. Homebuyers tapped those low rates to buy homes. Existing homeowners scrambled to refinance to lower their costs. 
Two and half years later and facing the new crisis of rapidly rising prices, the Fed jacked borrowing costs back up. For homeowners who took out fixed-rate mortgages (most do) when borrowing costs were low, the sudden rate bounce made selling a home with plans to buy a new one — and in the process losing the coveted low rate in exchange for a high one — a losing financial proposition. 
An analysis by economists at the Federal Housing Finance Agency found that the majority of borrowers in mid-2024 had a rate below 4%. A typical new mortgage, on the other hand, is likely to come with a rate of more than 6.5%.
That difference comes with a steep financial price tag. If the average mortgage payer were to swap out their existing loan for one at the new rate, they would pay another $398 per month, the agency researchers estimated. 
The effect is even more pronounced in California, where property values are particularly high. The median sales price on a single family home across the state is just shy of $900,000, according to the state association of Realtors. 
Even small changes in interest rates on such a massive purchase add up.
A typical California borrower would pay an extra $675 every month if they were to take on the same mortgage at current rates, according to the Federal Housing Finance Agency report. In San Francisco, it’s an extra $915. That’s a compelling reason not to sell. 
California homeowners have even more reasons to hunker down.
Since 1979, when the prior year’s Proposition 13 went into effect, property taxes in California have been tied to the purchase price of a home and only allowed to increase at a modest rate. With real estate prices across the state trending upward ever since, that’s created yet another kind of “lock-in effect:” The longer that a person owns a home, the less they pay in property taxes compared to a new buyer. 
“When people are doing the math about how much money it would cost them to move and they look at the mortgage expense, and then on top of that, the property tax expense, it’s not worth it,” said Fairweather. 
Absent an influx of new listings, aspiring homeowners looking for the opportunity to buy will need to wait on new construction to deliver.

Fairweather said she isn’t optimistic that that’s likely to change soon — and the lock-in effect on property owners is one reason why.

The U.S. Department of Education says adult students without legal status are now banned from certain courses. Teens at public K-12 districts could see changes too. 


As President Donald Trump ramps up immigration enforcement, targeting immigrants at workplaces and street corners across California, his administration is turning its attention to adult students. 
In a memo earlier this month, the U.S. Department of Education said adult students without legal status must be banned from federally funded career technical education classes, English-language programs and high school equivalency courses. Adult schools offer these courses to anyone over 18 years old, including immigrants, and many school leaders say the new policy could lead to enrollment declines. California’s K-12 districts may also need to adapt since they use federal funding to offer numerous career technical education classes that teach skills such as welding and farming.  
The new policy poses administrative challenges for these schools, which don’t require students to prove their legal status. Many students, including U.S. citizens, lack the proper verification documents.  
“It’s going to perpetuate this atmosphere of fear,” said Randy Tillery, the director of economic development for the nonprofit WestEd, which helps collect data on behalf of the state. 
Last week, California Attorney General Rob Bonta said the state is suing over the new policy. 
The U.S. Education Department refused to comment on the new policy. In a press release, the department said it will enforce it starting Aug. 9.  
Adult schools ask students to voluntarily share their Social Security numbers, which are only available for those with a legal right to work in the U.S. Of the more than 500,000 adult learners taking classes in California, about 10% voluntarily share their numbers with their schools, Tillery said.
Schools across the state say that they are waiting for more guidance from state and federal agencies before barring students from any classes. 
‘What if you don’t return?’
V., a student at Huntington Beach Adult School, has been taking a beginner-level English-language class for the past two years, in-person, Monday through Thursday, for two and a half hours a day. V. agreed to be interviewed on the condition that CalMatters not identify her because she doesn’t have legal status and fears deportation. 
Her three children, who are U.S. citizens, couldn’t stand the idea of their mom going to school this summer as the threat of immigration raids loomed. “When I grabbed my backpack to go to school, my kids said, ‘Don’t go, mom. What if you don’t return?’” she told CalMatters in Spanish, her voice shaky, on the verge of tears. 
Last month, she sent a note to her teacher, saying that, because of “uncontrollable anxiety” she needed to take the class online. “I was, I am and I continue to be terrified to leave (my house),” she said later.
Normally her class has about 40 students, but this summer, it’s down to 24, according to her teacher. The class is livestreamed, and an increasing number of students are opting to take the course online, the teacher said. CalMatters is withholding the teacher’s name to ensure V.’s anonymity.
It was harder to focus while taking online classes, V. said — her kids often interrupted the livestream or something on the computer distracted her. After about two weeks of online school, V. returned to class in person, despite her kids’ fears.
Steve Curiel, the principal, said the school is allowing students without legal status to attend, at least for now, until the education department provides more guidance about its new policy.
For a month now, adult schools have been managing uncertainty over federal policy and funding. Federal funding for adult schools typically comes through on a yearly basis, with the fiscal year beginning July 1, and it provides as much as 30% of a school’s budget. The education department withheld the money for a month, leading California Attorney General Rob Bonta to sue Education Secretary Linda McMahon. On Friday, the department said it would begin releasing the money this week, but the lawsuit is still ongoing, according to Elissa Perez, a spokesperson for Bonta’s office.
“We’re feeling optimistic but we’re still holding our breath a little bit because we want to see the actual release of the funds,” said Curiel. He was about to begin making cuts on Friday to contracts at Huntington Adult School but said he will now hold off.
“It’s going to perpetuate this atmosphere of fear.” Randy Tillery, director of economic development at WestEd
Many states rely entirely on the federal government to fund English-language learning and high school equivalency programs for adults, whereas California has a financial cushion: The state provides over $650 million each year specifically for adult education, representing the bulk of funding for California’s adult schools. 
Turning teens away from classes
The education department’s new policy on adults without legal status could also affect high school students. Although much of the federal funding in question supports adults taking English classes and high school equivalency courses, career technical education is part of a separate pot of money, known as Perkins funds, and includes hundreds of high schools across the state. The education department memo says that funding for those programs should be restricted to students who are legal residents or citizens. 
An estimated 150,000 children between the ages of 3 and 17 live in California but lack legal status, according to the Migration Policy Institute. The vast majority are enrolled in school.
The U.S. Supreme Court case Plyer v. Doe requires K-12 school districts to provide all students, regardless of their legal status, with “a basic public education,” but in the memo, the U.S. education department said that career technical classes are no longer considered part of a “basic” education. The memo also says that children without legal status are now prohibited from taking college-level courses in high school.
To implement the education department’s new policy, public K-12 schools would need to tell certain students that they can’t take specific classes because of their legal status. It would create “an enormous problem for schools,” said Tillery, since schools don’t ask students about their legal status. Public schools would need to gather data about who is a legal resident and who isn’t, he said, which could deter some students from attending school at all.
The U.S. Education Department did not respond to CalMatters’ questions asking how schools should respond or what enforcement might look like. The Los Angeles Unified School District said it was “awaiting further guidance” from the state’s education department, which also declined to comment. 
For V., the English classes are about her family more than anything, she said repeatedly. Her daughter is about to be 11 years old and prefers to speak English over Spanish, though she has a speech impediment and struggles to communicate in either language. V. said she wants to be able to speak more English with her daughter, hoping it might help, despite the risks of going to class. 
“We’re not living our own lives,” said V. “We’re living for our children.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/10062023_San-Diego-Community-College-Older-Students_AH_CM_13.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-28 08:56:55.938548

Gavin Newsom was just given his first handgun. A pending California bill would ban selling new Glocks like the ones Kamala Harris owns. Will he sign it?,"In summary
Gov. Gavin Newsom was just given his first handgun. A pending California bill would ban selling new Glocks like the ones Kamala Harris owns. Will he sign it? 


The Democrats who control California’s Legislature are poised to ban the sale of one of the most popular types of handguns, like the one owned by arguably the state’s most recognizable Democrat, Kamala Harris.
Assembly Bill 1127 aims to prohibit gun shops from selling new Glock-brand handguns and various off-brand imitators, because the guns can become fully automatic if a criminal inserts a converter, commonly known as a “Glock switch,” into the weapon. The switches can be made illegally on a 3D printer.
Supporters say the bill targets only a narrow category of guns that are increasingly used in violent crimes. But critics argue the proposal opens the door to broader restrictions on all semi-automatic handguns. That, they say, potentially includes other popular models like the one Gov. Gavin Newsom recently got as a gift from a conservative podcaster. Newsom hasn’t indicated whether he’ll sign the measure.
Semi-automatic handguns require a shooter to pull the trigger to fire each round. Fully automatic weapons, sometimes called machine guns, will keep firing as long as the trigger is depressed. Automatic weapons are already illegal under state and federal laws for everyone except special permit holders.
Illegally modified, fully-automatic Glock-style handguns have been used in several high-profile shootings, including a 2022 gang gunfight outside a Sacramento nightclub a few blocks from the Capitol. The shooting killed six people and wounded another 12.  
But Glocks also are among the most popular handguns sold in California. Gun rights advocates say there are already more than 1 million in circulation in California – and only a tiny fraction of them have been illegally modified. As an example of how popular Glocks are, Harris, while she was running for president, told “60 Minutes” last year that she owned a Glock and that she had shot it. A Harris spokesperson didn’t respond to interview requests or to a question about whether she still owns the gun.
The pending proposal would not prohibit Harris or others who already own Glocks from keeping theirs. They could also sell used ones to others in private-party transactions. Californians just couldn’t buy a new one. It’s unclear how many Glocks are sold in California each year since regulators and gun manufacturers don’t publicly report statewide sales numbers. 
Police widely carry Glocks in California, but they would be exempt from the restrictions.
What about Gavin Newsom’s new gun?
The measure’s lead author, Assemblymember Jesse Gabriel, a Democrat representing the Encino area, told the Senate Judiciary Committee this month that if gun manufacturers don’t like the ban, they can redesign their weapons to make them less easy to convert to machine guns.
“Most handgun designs don’t have this issue, and this legislation is narrowly focused on a limited number of designs that are exceptionally easy to modify,” he said. “Sadly, certain actors in the gun industry have known about this issue for decades and have refused to do anything meaningful to address it.”

 Democrat, State Assembly, District 46 (Encino)



Gun rights advocates say Glock has already redesigned new models to be incompatible with the switches, but the California Department of Justice hasn’t included those weapons on its list of handguns that can be purchased in the state. 
More than two dozen states, including California, have already banned Glock switches, but California would be the first state to ban the gun. A similar bill introduced in New York has stalled in the state’s Senate.
The California bill, which has 12 Democratic co-authors and co-sponsors, has already passed the Assembly with only Republicans voting against it. It’s poised to do the same in the Senate, putting it on a path next month to go to the desk of the state’s newest high-profile handgun owner, Newsom.
This month, conservative podcaster Shawn Ryan gave Newsom a Sig Sauer P365-Xmacro handgun while the two recorded an hourslong podcast in Tennessee. 
The handgun wouldn’t fall under the provisions of AB 1127. The weapon’s mechanisms are designed differently than a Glock’s and switches made for Glocks don’t work.But Sam Paredes, the executive director of Gun Owners of California, which opposes the bill, said it’s possible someone could design an illegal converter for Newsom’s gun some day. Plus, many semi-automatic handguns can be converted to fully automatic with the right tools and know-how, if someone wants to risk a felony charge.
He said it will be up to the office of Attorney General Rob Bonta to decide what handguns to ban for sale in California, should Newsom sign Gabriel’s bill into law. Bonta supports the proposal. Bonta’s office didn’t return a message, but in a letter in support of the bill he wrote that “California has one of the lowest rates of firearms deaths in the nation and that is due to our strong common sense gun safety laws.”“These laws are effective and save lives,” Bonta wrote. “Prohibiting this dangerous design flaw is an integral step in keeping automatic weapons off our streets.”
Gun advocates don’t like Newsom 
Asked if he will sign the ban on new Glocks, Newsom’s press office said that his office doesn’t usually comment on pending legislation. 
“The governor left the firearm in Tennessee in Shawn’s possession,” said Newsom spokesperson Izzy Gardon. “He is working to ensure it is properly transferred in accordance with California law and will take possession once that process is complete.”
It would be the first firearm registered under Newsom’s name, according to The San Francisco Standard. 
If Newsom wants to legally keep the Sig Sauer, he’d have to ship it from a Tennessee gun dealer to a registered firearms dealer in California.

Once the gun arrives, Newsom would have to pass a background check, provide his fingerprints, take a handgun safety test, sign affidavits, provide a driver’s license and documents that contain his name and address, such as a current utility bill. He’d need to undergo a 10-day waiting period. Paredes said Newsom would also have to pay around $300 in fees and taxes on the $700 gun.
He’d have to do everything himself, as gun owners need to appear in person to do the paperwork. 
Paredes said he doesn’t expect Newsom to get a warm welcome if he goes to any California gun shop to make the transfer. Newsom is one of the nation’s most ardent advocates of firearms ownership restrictions, and he’s backed some of the laws that make acquiring his gun – and any ammunition he’d want to shoot – so challenging and costly. 
“I’ll bet you there’ll be 10,000 people (protesting) at that gun store the day he comes in to do that,” Paredes said.
When Ryan gave Newsom the Sig Sauer, Newsom told the podcaster that though he continues to support gun regulations that he said have made the state safer, he’s “not anti-gun at all.”
“The last thing people would expect is that I respect this gift,” he said, according to The San Francisco Standard. 
At least one gun shop employee isn’t buying it. 
Cassidy Maznio, assistant manager at Sacramento Black Rifle, a firearms dealer, said Newsom is welcome to come to the shop to process his gun transaction.
“Obviously, we’d talk trash to him the whole time,” Maznio said.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/041421-Handgun-Gun-Store-REUTERS-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-28 08:56:55.938548

The next superintendent will need to respond to President Donald Trump’s funding cuts and policy shifts, including the dismantling of the U.S. Department of Education and increased immigration enforcement.




As California intensifies its fight with the Trump Administration, the race for the state’s top schools job is becoming ever more crowded.
Today, former Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon formally entered the race to succeed Tony Thurmond as State Superintendent of Public Instruction. He joins a host of other state lawmakers and local school board members vying to replace Thurmond, who terms out in 2026 after eight years on the job.
The next state superintendent faces daunting challenges. The most urgent priority may be responding to President Donald Trump’s funding cuts and policy shifts, including the dismantling of the U.S. Department of Education and increased immigration enforcement. Those policies will have a deep impact on thousands of California’s 5.8 million K-12 students, at least 20% of whom have at least one parent who lacks legal status, according to the Children’s Partnership, a policy and advocacy nonprofit.
“There’s no question the Trump administration is going to continue to weaponize K-12 education,” said Morgan Polikoff, an education professor at the University of Southern California. “The state superintendent can serve as a buffer, helping districts navigate funding cuts and policy changes while continuing to push against the Trump administration. It’s important that California keeps fighting.”
From the classroom to the Legislature
Rendon, a Democrat from Lakewood, spent 12 years in the Legislature, the last eight as speaker. While he was speaker, the state nearly doubled its K-12 funding and introduced a new grade, transitional kindergarten – a particular priority for Rendon, who started his career as an early education administrator.
A former UC regent, Rendon said he’d try to protect California schools from Trump’s policies, particularly those related to immigration, but also work at the state level to advocate for more funding and accountability.
“California has the best public universities in the world,” Rendon said. “We need to have the best K-12 schools in the world, too.”
Vague job duties
California has a murky hierarchy when it comes to schools. The governor, Legislature, State Board of Education and superintendent all share duties, but the superintendent has the least amount of power. The superintendent oversees the California Department of Education, but California also has a system of local control, which means local school boards have plenty of latitude over day-to-day operations. Superintendents often find themselves balancing the needs of at least a dozen stakeholders, with not much power themselves.
In 2023, a bill by former Assemblymember Kevin McCarty would have banned state superintendent elections altogether, turning the position into a governor-appointed role, like it is in 41 other states.  
Still, despite very limited authority, state superintendent can be an important job, said Julie Marsh, a professor at USC and executive faculty director for Policy Analysis for California Education, a research center. Despite the obstacles, the state superintendent oversees the largest, most complex school system in the U.S. and has a wide platform to “do something good.”
“They can’t create policy, but they can help set the agenda. They can use their bully pulpit to defend the policies and values that Californians overwhelmingly support,” Marsh said.
Muratsuchi jumps in
Assemblymember Al Muratsuchi, chair of the Assembly education committee, is also running for superintendent. An adjunct professor at El Camino Community College and former school board president at Torrance Unified, Muratsuchi has a long history of advocating for schools.
He’s authored numerous school bills, including AB 49, which would make it harder for immigration agents to enter schools, and AB 477, which would increase state education funding and raise salaries for teachers and other school staff. He was also the lead author of Proposition 2, a $10 billion school facilities bond that passed last year.
As state superintendent, Muratsushi said he’d continue to push for more funding while standing up to the Trump administration.
“As California’s top elected education leader, the state superintendent should have a strong record of fighting Trump’s attacks on public education and our most vulnerable students,” said Muratsuchi, a Democrat from Torrance. “I believe I’m that person.”
Newman enters race
Muratuchi’s former counterpart in the state Senate is also running for superintendent. Josh Newman, a Democrat from Fullerton who served as chair of the Senate education committee from 2023-24, said that in addition to fighting Trump he’d focus on students’ physical and mental health, boosting civics education and revitalizing the Department of Education.
 Accountability and compliance should be a priority, he said.
“We’ve increased funding substantially in California for 20 years, yet we haven’t seen a corresponding increase in test scores or a narrowing of the achievement gap,” Newman said.
“That points to a systemic issue where the superintendent and Department of Education must play a bigger role.”
Shaw looks beyond Chino
Sonja Shaw, president of the Chino Valley school board, made national headlines for her attempts to require school staff to notify parents if a student identifies as transgender. Thurmond actually attended a Chino Valley board meeting to oppose the measure, and she had police escort him out.
Now, Shaw is running for Thurmond’s job, saying she wants to take her fight statewide.
“Parents want schools to focus on reading, writing and math, not social justice and LGBTQ ideology,” said Shaw, a Republican. “I feel like we can take this fight beyond Chino.”
Several other candidates have also filed initial paperwork with the Secretary of State, including two members of the Los Angeles Community College District: Nichelle Henderson and Andra Hoffman.

According to a statement from the Grand Traverse County Sheriff’s Office, dispatch began receiving calls at 4:43 p.m., Saturday, saying there was a man with a knife inside the Garfield Township Walmart stabbing people. 
Grand Traverse County Sheriff deputies arrived at 4:46 p.m. on Saturday and saw multiple citizens, including one armed with a pistol, confronting the suspect, and preventing him from leaving and harming other patrons.
Shea later identified the man as Bradford James Gille, a 42 year old from Afton, who was arrested and transported to the Grand Traverse County Jail where he would remain pending formal charges and an arraignment. 
The requested charges against Gille are one count of terrorism, and 11 counts of assault with intent to murder.
Grand Traverse County Prosecutor Noelle Moeggenberg said her office expects to authorize charges Monday, and that Gille will be arraigned either or Tuesday. 
The 11 individuals wounded in the stabbing were transported to Munson Medical Center for treatment. As of 3:30 p.m. on Sunday, Munson Healthcare said two patients remained in serious condition, eight patients were listed in fair condition and one patient had been treated and released, with all 11 individuals expected to survive their injuries.
Free mental health counseling for all individuals impacted will be available at Northwestern Michigan College Innovation Center Monday through Wednesday from 10 a.m. through 7 p.m. this week, with Moeggenberg noting those services may be extended depending on their use.
Twenty-four hour counseling is also available at the Grand Traverse Mental Health Crisis and Access Center at 410 Brook St. in Traverse City. Crisis services are also available by calling 1-833-295-0616.
Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel applauded the efforts of law enforcement, medical service providers and the individuals who intervened, in a statement released Sunday offering her thoughts and prayers to the victims, as well as the Grand Traverse Community. 
“Grand Traverse Prosecutor Noelle Moeggenberg is a dedicated, career criminal prosecutor, and I maintain full faith in her and her office in the handling of this matter,” Nessel said. “My department has been in touch and has offered our assistance wherever it may be valuable.”

(Photo by Stephen Ausmus/Agricultural Research Service, USDA)If it rains at your house, do the cereal boxes in your pantry get wet? Of course not – because they’re under cover, protected by roof and shingle.
And when it rains on a chicken farm, the chicken litter, or manure, on the farm stays dry, too. It is also kept dry under cover, whether that’s inside the well-protected chicken house or stored in a manure shed designed to Natural Resources Conservation Service standards.
Maryland chicken farms, in fact, must follow a “zero-discharge” permit which “does not authorize discharges of pollutants, including manure, litter, and process wastewater” in day-to-day operations. (Farmers don’t want their manure to go missing, anyway; as organic, slow-release plant food, chicken manure is too valuable in the crop production cycle to be treated as waste.)

These basic facts about how chicken farms have been built and operated for decades are well-known. But apparently, Food & Water Watch is oblivious to them.
The group’s July 21 commentary demanding new regulations and burdens be placed on Maryland farmers (insulting these family-owned operations as “insidious polluters”) asserts that farms “spew” chicken manure “directly into waterways.”
It’s frankly astonishing to see a claim so divorced from reality still being made in 2025, when the scientists who study our water quality have documented that nutrient contributions from agriculture to the Chesapeake Bay have declined by 45 million pounds since the 1980s.
That’s the result of conservation practices and technological advances chicken growers, crop farmers and others in agriculture have invested in: manure sheds, pollinator-friendly buffers, stormwater management systems, litter amendments, even tweaks to chicken feed.
It’s a shame Food & Water Watch is so determined to target Eastern Shore farmers, because they are the backbone of Maryland’s biggest industry – agriculture. Maybe that’s because they only see the Shore as a vacationland, its farms as nuisances glimpsed as they speed down Route 50, not as the cherished homes of its proud year-round residents.
Their op-ed trots out a tired, old “farmers versus tourism” trope, trying to imply that the Shore’s agricultural strength puts $19.4 billion a year in tourism spending at risk. Left unsaid: $4.7 billion of those tourism dollars are spent on food that draws tourists here, like seafood, craft beer – and chicken.
Don’t let anyone tell you farming and tourism can’t coexist. 100 years of chicken-growing history here say otherwise. Living on the Eastern Shore for 41 years, being a farmer’s daughter, and teaching my girls to fish on the Choptank River says otherwise.
And don’t let a group virulently opposed to a modern, conservation-minded chicken community – a group that believes it is “time to ban” our farms – deceive you about how farms today actually work.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/chickens.jpeg,,,2025-07-28 08:56:55.938548

(Photo: Jeniffer Solis/Nevada Current)A messaging war over President Donald Trump’s big tax and spending bill made its way to Las Vegas Friday – a metro area both sides of the political aisle described as the poster child for the measure’s impacts on working-class Americans.
House Republicans on the Ways and Means Committee gathered in Las Vegas to aggressively highlight tax cuts provided by the megabill, which has proven deeply unpopular in recent surveys. 
During the committee field hearing, Republicans focused on the bill’s more popular, if less consequential, aspects, namely a new tax deduction for seniors and provisions allowing workers to deduct their taxes on tips and overtime pay through 2028.
Democrats, including Ways and Means member and Nevada Rep. Steven Horsford, hammered the legislation’s cuts to Medicaid and food assistance programs, as well as a provision that increases taxes on professional gamblers. 
Trump first announced “no tax on tips” as a campaign promise in Las Vegas, making the city a prime location for Republicans to crow about its inclusion in the tax and spending bill as they head into a five-week summer recess. 
“This city leads the nation in the share of its workers who earn tips,” said Rep. Jason Smith of Missouri, the Republican chairman of the committee. 
“But what will happen here in Vegas will not stay just in Vegas, because America’s 4 million tipped workers will also benefit from no tax on tips,” he continued.
Smith said the legislation’s tax breaks would help working-class Americans and generate economic growth. He also cast Democrats as opponents of cutting taxes after they unanimously opposed the legislation.
The largest tax cuts in the bill are by far the extension of tax cuts passed during Trump’s first term in 2017, which overwhelmingly benefit the higher income earners and corporations. 
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office last week projected the measure’s tax cuts will add $3.4 trillion over a decade, mostly due to extending the 2017 tax cuts.
While Republicans hoped to use the Las Vegas hearing to kick off a victory lap for their legislation, Nevada Democrats used the hearing – held at an electric sign warehouse – to clobber the bill for hurting Nevada’s economy and Nevada households.
“Las Vegas is actually ground zero for the damage that Trump’s economy is doing to workers and families and small businesses,” Horsford said. 
One provision of the bill that has garnered bipartisan criticism limits how much professional and casual gamblers can deduct in losses, a tax increase that could hurt Nevada’s primary industry.
“Senate Republicans unilaterally thrust the gaming economy and its patrons into uncertainty with the unjust inclusion of the wagering loss penalty,” Horsford said.
Nevada Rep. Dina Titus joined Horsford at the hearing to push her Fair Accounting for Income Realized from Betting Earnings Taxation (FAIR BET) Act, a bill that would reverse the provision in the bill signed by Trump and restore the full gambling loss tax deduction.
Nevada’s hospitality industry is already facing challenges this year, as visitation numbers have fallen short of 2024 levels month after month.
“I hope that, since you care so much about Nevada families, y’all will spend some money while you’re here in some of our casinos. We would appreciate that,” Titus told committee members. 
Democratic Nevada state Senate Majority Leader Nicole Cannizzaro, speaking as an invited witness at the hearing, stressed the pain that will be inflicted on Nevadans by the legislation’s deep cuts to Medicaid and food assistance programs to help finance extending the Trump’s 2017 tax cuts.
Cannizzaro questioned the tax benefits of the legislation, emphasizing that deductions for taxes on tips and overtime pay are temporary while tax cuts for high-income households and corporations are permanent. 
“This temporary benefit will only help Nevada’s tipped workers if we continue to have tourists to tip them. That’s no guarantee, especially amidst a year-over-year decline in visitation from both domestic and international tourists,” Cannizzaro said. 
The six other witnesses who spoke at the closed hearing were invited by Republicans and testified about the benefits of the legislation, including a server, a DoorDash driver, a paint foreman, and a small business owner from Henderson. 
Democrats held a press conference at the Culinary Workers Union headquarters ahead of the hearing as counter-programming where union members described the negative impacts of the bill.
Health care advocates noted the legislation will cut Medicaid by nearly $1 trillion over a decade, a move that could place a major burden on Nevada, which relies heavily on the low-income health program. 
Nevada became the first state led by a Republican governor to expand Medicaid in 2012, reducing the uninsured rate from 22% to 8%. 
Stricter Medicaid eligibility requirements under the Republican megabill could cut health coverage for nearly 100,000 Nevadans, according to analysis from Nevada Medicaid. 
Premiums through the Silver State Health Exchange – which covers another 100,000 Nevadans – are likely to increase by roughly 75% next year, Cannizzaro said, leading to more uninsured individuals and increased costs for state and local health systems.
Stricter eligibility requirements under the Supplemental Nutrition Program under the megabill will cost Nevada $20 million per year, while denying thousands of people access to food assistance, she added.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/field-hearing-8-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-28 08:56:55.938548

Buildup of dead vegetation in Evens Creek, a wetland area bordered by homes, has created a wildfire hazard the Reno Fire Department hopes to mitigate by introducing 250 goats that will eat away dry brush for the next 45 days.
“They’re working all day long,” said Reno Fire Chief Dave Cochran.
The move comes as wildfire season approaches its peak this month. Wildfire season in Nevada typically lasts from late summer to early fall, but in recent years the season has lengthened due to climate change.
Last year, nearly 860 wildfires burned about 104,000 acres of land across Nevada, according to the Nevada Division of Forestry. 
In northwest Reno, where thousands of houses have been built in the urban wildland interface, the impact of the fires can be especially devastating. 
Northern Nevada experienced one of the most economically destructive wildfires in recent memory last year. About 20 miles south of Reno, the wind-driven Davis Fire rapidly burned through nearly 6,000 acres of land. The fire drove the evacuation of about 20,000 people and ultimately destroyed two commercial buildings and 14 homes.
With less precipitation than normal across much of Northern Nevada this spring, a prolonged heat wave, and fields of flammable grasses, the region is at greater risk of widespread wildfires this year.
“We are seeing a very high threat of wildfire, and it’s increasing every day that goes by,” Cochran said.
The goats, from High Desert Graziers in nearby Smith Valley, are bred to consume a wide variety of non-native grasses and weeds that fuel wildfires including bitterbrush, manzanita, and cheatgrass.
Those non-native grasses and weeds typically die off in the summer, unlike native species, creating dangerous fuel for wildfire. 
It’s the fourth time the city has used goats for fire mitigation. Like other years, the goats will be corralled to specific areas by a temporary solar-powered electric fence, and under the watch of guard dogs.
Cochran said the dogs are also there to protect the goats from being eaten by animal predators, or stolen by humans.
“People love goats, so that’s a concern as well,” he said. 
The goat grazing operation will cost the city about $67,500. It’s funded in part by state legislation passed in 2022 that allocates funding to the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources for wildfire prevention, restoration, and long-term planning.
“Targeted grazing is an environmentally friendly and sustainable option for managing noxious weeds and flammable vegetation,” said Reno City Ward 2 Councilmember Naomi Duerr. “We’re proud to continue this creative approach.”
Wildfire managers say it takes a suite of approaches to prevent wildfires, including manual brush clearing, herbicides, and prescribed burns.
Goats have proven to be a cost-effective way to clear dry vegetation in difficult to reach terrain like steep bluffs and cliffs near homes. 
“It’s low tech, and it’s very cost-effective. They target exactly what we need,” Cochran said.
Studies looking at whether goats’ grazing can reduce the severity or impact of wildfires are scarce, but some research does suggest targeted grazing significantly reduces the grasses and weeds they goats were introduced to control. 
In Arizona, some scientists have observed that land cleared of excess vegetation by goats acts as fire breaks and can stop wildfires in their tracks.
Anecdotally, Cochran said goats have had positive, long-lasting effects on previous areas they grazed.
“Goats are a great tool to do that. They work from dawn till dusk. They actually eat non-native and invasive species of plants. They just take it down to the dirt,” Cochran said.
Despite the positive impact of goats, Cochran emphasized the need for federal action when it comes to wildfire response and mitigation. 
Ongoing cuts, funding freezes and hiring pauses brought on by President Donald Trump’s executive orders shrinking the federal workforce have weakened the nation’s already strained firefighting force by hitting support staff who play crucial roles in preventing and battling wildfires.
The Trump administration stated the U.S. Forest Service has reached 99% of its firefighting hiring goals, but documents obtained by ProPublica show a high vacancy rate, as well as internal concern among top officials responsible for wildfire response.
“There’s no department in the country that can handle these giant fires by themselves. You need local resources, state resources, but you also need a lot of federal resources, and if they’re not funded, that puts a dent in our ability to respond to these fires. We are keeping an eye on that. We’re very concerned,” Cochran said.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/20250724_163319929_iOS-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-28 08:56:55.938548

(Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)Despite Trump administration rhetoric accusing Democrats of protecting violent criminals and drug-dealing immigrants, the administration’s arrests have been catching a smaller share of criminals overall, and a smaller share of people convicted of violent and drug crimes, than the Biden administration did in the same time frame.
While the Trump administration has caught more immigrants with convictions for drugs and violence, their share of the rising arrest numbers is smaller, as more people get swept up for minor traffic violations or strictly immigration crimes, according to a Stateline analysis.
Forty percent of the nearly 112,000 arrests by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) from Jan. 20 through late June were of convicted criminals. That’s compared with 53% of the nearly 51,000 arrests for same time period in 2024 under the Biden administration.

The share of people convicted of violent crime fell from 10% to 7% and drug crimes from 9% to 5%, according to a Stateline analysis of data from the Deportation Data Project.
The project, led by attorneys and professors in California, Maryland and New York, collects and posts public, anonymized U.S. government immigration enforcement datasets obtained through Freedom of Information Act requests.
Some Democratic states are among those with the highest share of violent criminals in this year’s ICE arrests: Hawaii (15%), Vermont (13%), and California and Nebraska (12%) — while some of the lowest shares were in more Republican states: Maine (2%), and Alabama, Montana and Wyoming (3%).
In Utah, the data shows ICE has made 1,579 arrests since Trump took office in January, compared to 493 arrests under Biden. Of this year’s arrests, 57% of immigrants who were detained carried violent convictions, while the percentage under Biden was 70%.
Immigration attorneys see an increased push to arrest and detain immigrants for any type of violation or pending charge as President Donald Trump pushes for higher arrest and detention numbers to meet his campaign promise for mass deportation. Trump officials have called for 3,000 arrests a day, far more than the current average of 711 as of June and 321 a day during the same time period under Biden.












The majority of recent ICE detentions involve people with no convictions. That’s a pattern I find troubling.


– Oregon Republican state Rep. Cyrus Javadi




Arrests have accelerated since about mid-May, when government attorneys began asking to revoke bail and arrest people who show up for court hearings after being released at the border, said Vanessa Dojaquez-Torres, practice and policy counsel for the American Immigration Lawyers Association, which represents more than 16,000 immigration attorneys.
“We’re not completely sure what the reasoning or the goal is behind some of these policies, other than they want detention numbers up,” Dojaquez-Torres said.
“They seem to have really been struggling to get their deportation numbers up, and so I think that’s one of the reasons why we see a lot of these policies going into effect that are meant to kind of circumvent the immigration court process and due process.”
Arrests of people convicted of violent crimes increased by 45% from about 5,300 to 7,700 compared with last year. For drug crimes, the increase was 21% — and they fell as a share of total arrests, from 9% under the Biden administration to 5% this year.
If Trump wants more deportations, he’ll need to target the construction industry

Arrests for those not convicted of any crime nearly tripled to about 67,000, and increased from 47% to 60% of arrests.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security defended ICE arrests Wednesday. Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that the agency was “targeting dangerous criminal illegal aliens and taking them off American streets. Violent thugs ICE arrested include child pedophiles, drug traffickers, and burglars.”
In Oregon, arrests during the first part of last year increased from 51 under the Biden administration to 227 under the Trump administration, with those not convicted of any crime increasing from 34 to 137. Those with convictions for violent crime increased from 3 to 16. Even some Republicans are concerned with the new emphasis on non-criminals.
“The majority of recent ICE detentions involve people with no convictions. That’s a pattern I find troubling, especially when it risks sweeping up people for things like expired tags or missed court dates,” said Oregon state Rep. Cyrus Javadi, a moderate Republican representing Tillamook and Clatsop counties.
Nationally, nonviolent crimes have risen as a share of immigration arrests. The most common crime conviction for those arrested this year is driving while intoxicated, which was also the top offense last year under Biden.
But this year it’s closely followed by general traffic offenses, which rose to second place from sixth place, surpassing such crimes as assault and drug trafficking.
More cities, counties join immigrant sanctuary lawsuit seeking to block Trump funding cuts

Traffic offenses, outside of driving while intoxicated and hit and run, rose almost fourfold as the most serious conviction on record for those arrested, the largest increase in the top 10. Those offenses were followed by increases in the immigration crime of illegal entry, meaning crossing the border in secret, which tripled.
The increase in traffic violations as a source of immigration arrests is a reason for cities to consider limiting traffic stops, said Daniela Gilbert, director of the Redefining Public Safety Initiative at the Vera Institute of Justice, a nonprofit devoted to ending mass incarceration.
“It’s an important point to consider intervening in so that there can be less interaction, and so ICE has less opportunity to continue its indiscriminate dragnet of enforcement,” Gilbert said.
The institute argues in general that traffic stops should be limited to safety issues rather than low-level infractions such as expired registrations or single burned-out taillights, both because they do not improve public safety and because they disproportionately affect drivers of color.
Such policies limiting stops under some conditions are in place in 10 states and in cities in six other states, according to the institute.
The most recent state polices took effect last year in California and Illinois, while a policy is set to take effect in October in Connecticut. The most recent city policies were in Denver and in East Lansing and Ypsilanti, Michigan. Six other states have considered legislation recently.

SELMA — Mason’s grandfather had recently taught him the family recipe for fried green tomatoes. And Mason wanted to show his classmates in the Better Basics program at Brantley Elementary School how to make them, using green tomatoes in the class’ garden.
“They did the batter, cut the tomatoes. We have safety kids’ knives, potato peelers, and they cut their tomatoes,” their teacher, Towanda Friday, said. “Mason showed them how to season it, and they season it all up. And so they watched us cook the tomatoes for them.”
Friday teaches fifth grade at Brantley Elementary in the Dallas County School system, and the Better Basics program in the summer. It was a grant program through a Birmingham organization that serves central Alabama to “advance children’s literacy” and also incorporates music.

Mason’s plans aligned with Friday’s, who along with reading and math teaches her students how to take care of a garden. She said in a recent school visit that they had tomatoes, squash, sunflowers, watermelon and red peppers. She teaches them how to make everyday lunches, and to stay away from the microwave.

“They’re not only going to do cooking and the garden. They’re bringing in instruments to play in a band,” she said. “They’re trying to help build Brantley up.”
Friday teaches in a system that is in the early stages of supervision by the state. Alabama State Superintendent Eric Mackey intervened in the system in March, his third intervention, saying that the system did not follow proper procurement processes in dealing with more than $12.1 million in federal funds. 
Alice Jackson, the system’s director of federal programs, said intervention is helping on the financial side. Part of why the system had so many federal dollars left, she said, was due to not having a streamlined system to process those funds.
“I’m very optimistic that with the transition of Mr. Sampson and the company of Dr. Boyd, that we’ll be able to get the system where it needs to be in a timely manner,” Jackson said of the system’s former superintendent, Anthony Sampson, and the state official in charge of the intervention, Daniel Boyd.

Why the state stepped in

Mackey intervened in Dallas County because of financial and board governance concerns, according to the show cause letter sent to the local board on Feb. 21. 
“This behavior erodes public trust in individual members and the Board as a whole. It also suggests that the Board is dysfunctional and ineffective in properly stewarding the funds awarded to the system for its students,” Mackey wrote in the letter. “Consequently, losing faith in the Board’s ability to govern could lead to a decline in engagement and support, making it more difficult for the DCSS to receive additional federal monies in the future.”
Mackey said in a June interview that the Dallas intervention is different from the Sumter County and Bessemer City interventions.

“It was not necessarily that the board couldn’t get together and get it done, but they just didn’t have it,” he said. “They literally don’t have the money and don’t have the capacity to handle the situation that was before them.”
One reason for that is a shrinking population base. Dallas County’s population shrunk 12% between 2010 and 2020. Public school enrollment has fallen even faster: Dallas County Schools had just over 3,300 students in the 2014-15 school year; it fell to 2,262 in the 2023-24 school year, a 32% decrease. Boyd said that the population decline is directly related to the intervention and the school closures.
“Our schools are a microcosm of the greater community,” Boyd said. “As our greater community gets smaller, the population of schools will decline.”
The district is already being reshaped by intervention. In an effort to get one month’s worth of expenses in reserve, two of the district’s 11 schools will close. Boyd, the state-appointed chief administrative officer for the Dallas and Bessemer interventions, said the system had 20% of a month’s expenses in reserve. He said in a phone interview Tuesday that a month’s expenses for the system is about $2.8 million.
“I feel that perhaps in 18 months or so, we’ll have that state minimum of one month reserve, maybe even before 18 months, which will be huge,” Boyd said. “It’s been years since the district had this one month reserve.”
The Dallas County Board of Education unanimously approved the closures of J.E. Terry Elementary School in Plantersville and Bruce K. Craig Elementary School in Selma on June 4. Like the district, Both schools had seen enrollment fall. J.E. Terry, which had 123 students in the 2014-15 school year, had 81 in the 2023-24 school year, according to the Alabama State Board of Education. Bruce K. Craig, which had 218 students enrolled in 2014-15, had 148 in 2023-24.
Boyd said the teachers at those schools were offered positions at other schools in the district and the students will consolidate to Valley Grande Elementary School, in Valley Grande. Both closed schools are about 12.5 miles from Valley Grande, in opposite directions.

“We don’t feel that it will make a lengthy trip for the students. Our transportation supervisor and transportation staff are working closely together to make sure that we’ve streamlined the routes as much as possible,” he said. 
Boyd did not rule out the possibility of further closures, but said he feels confident the two closures will help get the system’s finances back in line.
“Even though you have a plan in place, it’s not until school starts and you see how the routes run that you’re able to make additional modifications to improve efficiency,” Boyd said.

Academics

Academic achievement was not a reason for the state’s intervention, and former Dallas County Superintendent Anthony Sampson took pride in the kids’ achievements.
“I’m really proud that kids know where they stand academically on their own, not based on what somebody else is saying,” he said on June 30, his last day as superintendent. . 
 Sampson, who had served as superintendent since 2022, chose not to renew his contract in November so he could be closer to his family in Baldwin County.
“The last 100 days have been very busy, very fulfilling, and it just never ends. There’s always highs and there’s always lows,” Sampson said. 
Former DCS Superintendent Hattie Shelton has stepped in as an interim superintendent while Boyd searches for a permanent superintendent. She said in a phone interview Thursday that she will support the students and teachers to her best ability.
“I’m probably going to be praying very hard for things to turn around for us and turn around quickly,” Shelton said.

‘A lot of motivation’

  Brantley Elementary Principal Adrienne Lee speaks with students during a visit by Dallas County Superintendent Anthony Sampson on June 30, 2025,(Andi Rice for Alabama Reflector)
Brantley Elementary Principal Adrienne Lee values transparency in academics, and making the usually stressful tests fun for her students.
“We do a lot of motivation here. We’re very unorthodox,” Lee said. “We’re doing a lot of music, we’re doing a lot of activities to push and motivate you.”
The school got a 56 on the 2022-2023 state report card, a result that surprised Lee. She started posting graphs depicting the school’s performance on recent state tests on Brantley Elementary’s colorful hallways.
“Instead of us taking that 56 and saying that’s who we are, we said, ‘That’s exactly who we started from,’” she said. “And we started to build ourselves.”
The school’s score increased to a 67 for the 2023-2024 report card.
“That motivation does a lot, and we motivate our kids a lot,” she said. “We’re playing music, we’re getting in the hallway, we’re dancing.”
Although recent test score data is not available at the school and district level, the fifth and sixth graders in Friday’s class knew how they did on the state test. Of the six students in her class on June 30, the average proficiency score was 2.6 out of 4 for math and 2.8 out of 4 for English Language Arts. Students are scored from level one to level four, where levels three and four are considered proficient. Statewide, 68% of fifth graders are proficient in ELA, and 40% of fifth graders are proficient in math.
“When I tell you they go hard, they work really hard, and they listen to everything that I taught them or told them to do. They implemented it no matter what, no matter how much homework I give them to do, they actually did it,” Friday said. “I’m really proud of them, because they put their best forward at all times.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ALR_Selma_063025-20-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-07-28 08:56:55.938548

(Photo by Bruce Bennett/Getty Images)More than 63 million Americans are caregivers for a family member with complex medical needs, a 20 million increase over the past decade, according to a new report.
But state policies, workplaces and the American health system haven’t kept up with this surge in family caregiving responsibilities, said Dr. Myechia Minter-Jordan, a physician and the CEO of the AARP, which released the report with the National Alliance for Caregiving, a nonprofit policy and research organization.
“Nearly half of caregivers say they face major financial consequences, draining savings, falling into debt or struggling to afford basic needs like food and housing,” Minter-Jordan told reporters on a call this week.
One of the biggest reasons for the surge in family caregivers is that Americans are living longer, yet they’re not necessarily healthier. There’s a 12-year gap between the average number of years that Americans live and the number of years they’re healthy.
The caregiving role typically involves helping a family member with daily tasks like bathing, dressing and eating. But more than half of caregivers also perform more complex medical tasks, such as managing catheters or administering injections, the report found.
A growing number of caregivers are so-called “sandwich caregivers” — parents caring for their children as well as for an adult family member, such as an aging parent. About 17 million people are sandwich caregivers, compared with 11 million a decade ago. And most caregivers are also working a job.
And while the bulk of caregiving still falls on women, 40% of American caregivers are men.
Some states have heeded the growing calls for action.
Earlier this year, Maine lawmakers created a state program to provide respite care, which includes services such as adult day care that give family caregivers a temporary break.
Also this year, Tennessee extended its pilot program that provides respite care for Alzheimer’s and dementia patients, and also passed a bipartisan bill that directs the state Medicaid program to develop guidelines to allow family caregivers to be paid for their work.
Last year, Nebraska passed a tax credit for family caregivers; Oklahoma passed a similar law the year before. And while the United States is one of few countries that doesn’t mandate paid family leave at the federal level, 13 states and the District of Columbia have established their own paid family leave rules.
Meanwhile, the historic cuts to Medicaid enacted as part of the GOP’s Big, Beautiful Bill Act will shift health costs to states, leaving experts worried that family caregivers could lose Medicaid-funded services they rely on.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2154932283.jpg,,,2025-07-28 08:56:55.938548

We also see this conditional support for business when we talk about the state’s workforce participation rate. Our leaders say they want to address it. But only up to a certain point.
Alabama has long struggled to get everyone who can work to do so. In June, about 58% of those who could work or look for a job in Alabama were in the workforce, compared with 62.5% of the country as a whole.
This lag goes back to 1976, if not earlier. Lack of access to affordable child care burdens workers. So do gaps in education and training. Transportation is another obstacle. The absence of mass transit in many parts of the state means those who can’t afford automobiles are stuck.
It’s a particular problem in rural areas, in part due to infrastructure challenges. In the most recent list of county workforce participation rates, only one of Alabama’s major urban areas (Mobile) fell below the state average.
But another significant factor is the aging of rural Alabama. The state as a whole is slightly older (median age 39.6 years) than the nation (39.2 years). But in Perry County, where the workforce participation rate was 35.4% in May, the median age is 42.5 years. In Tallapoosa County, where less than 49% of the population is in the workforce, it’s 45.4 years.
Getting younger people in the state will help boost workforce participation rates. And there’s a pretty obvious way to do that.
Immigration.
Among Hispanic Alabamians, one-third of whom were born outside the country, the median age is 24. Among Black Alabamians, with an immigrant population of 1.2%, the median age is 35. Among white Alabamians, of whom 1% are foreign-born, it’s almost 43. (The median age among the smaller Asian communities in the state is 37; over two-thirds of people in those groups were born outside the country.)
This doesn’t mean immigration on its own will solve our labor issues. Alabama will not attract the jobs that would bring people into struggling areas if infrastructure problems persist.
But bringing immigrants here would help. Not only are their participation rates higher than the country’s as a whole, the groups with the largest percentage of immigrants are having more children, who will eventually enter the workforce.
And yet, we are not doing that. We are persecuting the foreign-born.
It’s not enough that Gov. Kay Ivey can cut ads shamelessly mocking Hispanic immigrants. Now we have law enforcement agencies, apparently with no serious crimes to address, signing up to harass people for the high crime of not being a native-born Alabamian.
According to al.com, authorities arrested nearly 2,000 immigrants in the state through the end of June, more than had been arrested through all of 2024.
This is called a crackdown on people with criminal records. That’s facetious. In most of these cases, “criminal record” does not mean murder, assault or robbery. Just 3% of ICE arrests in Alabama involve violent criminals. it means being in the country without authorization, even if you’ve abided by every other law and paid taxes.
These are not people causing chaos. They are men and women seeking opportunities and trapped in a system that makes it very difficult to come to the United States legally.
One would hope the horrific treatment of people detained under this regime would cause some reflection. Our leaders, though, have no problem with terrorizing and traumatizing people they dislike, particularly women and transgender youth seeking health care.
So let’s go back to business. Every state official from Ivey on down claims to want to improve the workforce participation rate. Immigration would be a useful way to do that.
But instead, we have a state government all but cheering attacks on immigrants and discouraging them from coming here.
It’s hateful and wasteful and destructive. We once again look like the unquestioning toadies of whatever conservative figure holds the throne at the moment. And we give young people, whatever their national origin, even more reason to leave our state.
Which only adds to our workforce participation problems. But that doesn’t matter to our state leaders. The only “pro-business” attitude they have is ensuring workers obey their employers. And they’ll happily terrorize large swathes of our population to do so.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/ALR_022225_Selects-40-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-07-28 08:56:55.938548

(Alander Rocha/Alabama Reflector)U.S. Sen. Katie Britt of Alabama is asking the White House to speed up the release of appropriated funds for the National Institutes of Health (NIH), a major source of funding for the University of Alabama Birmingham (UAB).
In a July 24 letter to Russell Vought, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, Britt and 13 of her Senate Republican colleagues asked the administration to fully implement the Fiscal Year (FY) 2025 Full-Year Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, which was signed into law by President Donald Trump earlier this year and allocates funding for NIH initiatives at the previous year’s funding level.
“Senator Britt has been a strong advocate for ensuring the NIH remains the gold-standard of research and innovation across the nation and the world. She has continued to express the need for taxpayer dollars to be spent efficiently, judiciously, and accountably, which includes funding life-saving, groundbreaking research at high-achieving institutions like those in Alabama,” Grace Evans, communications director for Britt’s office, said in an email Friday.

Senators raised concerns in the letter about the slow pace of NIH funding disbursement for fiscal year 2025, which ends on September 30. The letter said withholding or delaying these funds could undermine critical research; risk jobs supported by scientific research and delay Americans’ access to life-saving treatments.
“Suspension of these appropriated funds — whether formally withheld or functionally delayed – could threaten Americans’ ability to access better treatments and limit our nation’s leadership in biomedical science,” the letter stated.
Alabama received $380 million in NIH funding in fiscal year 2024, with 88% of those funds, or $334.4 million, allocated to UAB. As of July 21, Alabama has received $190.9 million in NIH grants during fiscal year 2025, with approximately $166 million allocated to UAB, which is about the same share as the previous fiscal year.
UAB relies significantly on federal funding. According to a 2023 press release, UAB was in the top 1% of all NIH-funded institutions, including private, public and international organizations, with $413.7 million out of $774.5 million in research grants coming from NIH.
Hannah Echols, a spokesperson for UAB, said in a statement Friday that UAB appreciated Britt’s “continued efforts to support critical NIH funding that improves and saves lives.”
“We continue to monitor, assess and address the developments regarding recent federal activity. Our government affairs professionals are actively engaged on the matter,” Echols said.
In a Senate Appropriations Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies Subcommittee hearing in June with NIH Director Jay Bhattacharya, Britt discussed her personal legislative priorities aimed at addressing the nation’s high maternal mortality rates, particularly in states like Alabama, which faces significant challenges with maternal care deserts, pointing to legislation she sponsored to providing funding a NIH initiative to research causes of maternal mortality.
“When you look at rural areas in Alabama, we have one third of our state’s 67 counties are actually maternal care deserts, meaning they don’t have access to birthing facilities or maternal care providers. It’s 2025. These numbers should be moving in the opposite direction,” Britt said in her line of questioning.
In a Senate Appropriations Committee hearing in April, she introduced Dr. Barry Sleckman, director of UAB’s O’Neal Comprehensive Cancer Center to the committee, where she asked Sleckman to describe the Cancer Center’s work and how it’s “investing in that will ultimately change lives in the future.”
Britt also asked Sleckman to tell the committee “why federal funding is unique in cancer prevention research.”
“Federal funding is unique in cancer prevention research, in part, because there are not a lot of other revenue streams for cancer prevention. This is not really a high priority, for example, for industry and pharma, and so federal funding, to understand how to develop cancer prevention approaches, is critical,” Sleckman said in the April hearing.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/DSC00579-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-28 08:56:55.938548

Where they’re located and why they’re unsafe,Andrew Brown,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/28/ct-lead-service-lines-what-to-know/,"There could be as many as 8,000 lead service lines connecting CT homes to the large water mains that run under the streets. What to know.","Lead plumbing was banned in the United States in 1986, but new data assembled by Connecticut’s water utilities show there may still be thousands of lead pipes carrying water into homes, apartments and some schools.
The Connecticut Mirror obtained hundreds of reports from the state Department of Public Health that show there could be as many as 8,000 lead service lines connecting people’s homes to the large water mains that run under the streets.
The state’s community water systems, which supply more than three-quarters of the state’s population with drinking water, began sending out notices late last year warning homeowners and renters that their service line could contain the toxic metal.
Every public water system across the country is now required to identify and replace all of the remaining lead service lines within the next 10 years. In the meantime, however, many utility customers are questioning how to protect themselves and their families from potential lead exposure. 
Here’s what you need to know.
What is a lead service line and what’s the concern? 
Service lines are the pipes that connect buildings to the larger water mains that run below many sidewalks and roads in Connecticut. Those lines can be made of all types of material, including plastic, copper, galvanized steel and lead. 
Between the late 1800s and the 1930s, it was not uncommon for homebuilders and water utilities to use lead to make those plumbing connections. And in many parts of the country, lead was considered a viable option until the federal ban in 1986. 
The issue with lead plumbing is that the metal can leach into the water that is running through the pipes. And that is a problem because no level of lead in the human body is considered safe. 
In adults, elevated levels of lead can affect kidney function and can contribute to cardiovascular problems, and in children it can cause developmental delays, learning difficulties and behavioral problems. 
How many lead service lines remain in Connecticut and where are they located? 
According to the data compiled by Connecticut’s community water systems, there could be nearly 8,000 lead service lines still in the ground — though that number is likely to change as officials continue to inspect homes and dig up old water lines.
Those lead lines are not distributed equally throughout the state, however. Some utilities are finding very little lead in their systems, while others are predicting that hundreds or thousands of homes, apartments and other buildings could be affected. 
The initial data provided to the Connecticut Department of Public Health shows that places like Bridgeport, Waterbury, Willimantic, New London, Middletown and Greenwich contain significant numbers of lead service lines. Some utilities, however, are just beginning to assess how many lead lines might remain in their systems. 
The number of lead service lines in a water system is largely dependent on what years the public water system was built and what materials the utilities used over their history to make service connections. 
How do I know if I have a lead service line?
Many utilities have created maps that allow water customers to search their address to learn whether they have a lead service line or not. Aquarion Water, Connecticut Water Company and many of the state’s larger municipal water systems, have links to those maps online. 
CT Mirror created a search tool for the 60 largest water systems in the state.

The new federal regulations required utilities to send out notices to customers if they suspected that the service line contained lead or if they were unsure what material the service line is made of.
Some utilities are also soliciting help from their customers in identifying lead service lines. Many utility companies have asked customers to take photos of their water lines where they enter the basement or crawl space.
And they’ve provided step by step guides, like this one, for how to investigate what material was used for their service line.
Why are officials investigating these lines now and what are they going to do about them?
While lead plumbing was banned in the mid 1980s, the push to remove older lead service lines did not gain traction until after the water crisis in Flint, Michigan, in 2014.
That crisis was created when officials in Flint changed the source of the city’s drinking water, and it resulted in service lines and other plumbing leaching significant amounts of lead into people’s tap water.
To try to prevent similar public health emergencies, federal officials adopted new federal regulations last year requiring every utility serving more than 25 people to identify how many lead lines they have and to replace all of those lines in the next 10 years.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimates there could be between 6 million to 10 million still in use throughout the United States. 
Replacing all of those service lines is likely to be an expensive and time-consuming process. In the meantime, most utilities will continue to treat their water with corrosion inhibitors — compounds that help prevent plumbing from leaching large amounts of lead into people’s tap water.
What precautions can I take if my home has a lead service line? 
The Connecticut Department of Public Health and many of the state’s water utilities are advising customers with suspected or confirmed lead service lines to take several precautionary steps to limit their potential exposure.
They are advising people to clean out the aerators on their sinks. Those are the small screens that are on the tips of most kitchen and bathroom faucets. 
They are also encouraging people to run the water for several minutes before using the water for cooking or drinking. 
The best way to protect against lead exposure, however, is a water filter that is certified to remove lead from drinking water. You can learn more about that filter certification here.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/LEAD-SERVICE-LINES-SR-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-28 07:57:23.627213

Sherman Smith/Kansas ReflectorDoes Atlanta value its public media outlets?
If this week’s funding drives offer any insight, that answer is a resounding yes.
WABE, Atlanta’s local NPR affiliate, raised half a million dollars in its first week of fundraising since Congress voted to claw back $1.1 billion in federal funding that had already been approved for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, according to president and CEO Jennifer Dorian. 

 



How to support Georgia’s public media organizations

GPB: Visit gpb.org/federal-funding
 




The CPB provides federal funds to organizations like National Public Radio, the Public Broadcasting Service, and local public media stations across the country. During the most recent fiscal year, Georgia received nearly $6.6 million in CPB grants. That money went to five different stations across the state: WABE, Georgia Public Broadcasting, WCLK, WJSP and WUGA.
The bill, which in addition to slashing public media funding also eliminates $8 billion in foreign aid, cleared the House last Friday by a 216-213 margin. All nine Republican members of the Georgia delegation voted in favor of the bill, and the state’s five Democratic House members voted against it. Georgia’s two senators, both Democrats, also voted against the legislation, which passed in a 51-48 vote in the Senate. President Donald Trump signed the bill into law Thursday.
But critics have warned about the devastating impact the funding cuts could have on rural Americans, particularly those who live in news deserts. Holes in local broadcast coverage could also become more glaring during severe weather events such as hurricanes, when prolonged power outages could restrict access to other types of news.
“Radio is one of the most effective and affordable means of communication that humans have,” Dorian said. “In a case of an extreme weather event or in any kind of emergency, people are super reliant on radio broadcasting.”
WABE, which serves 258,000 listeners per week, is now expecting a $1.9 million shortfall this year, which constitutes 13% of its budget. 
For GPB, which operates nine public television stations across the state and was slated to receive $4.2 million from CPB this year, federal funding accounts for 10% of their revenue. They also receive funding from Georgia’s state budget, as well as from donors.
“GPB leadership anticipated a rapidly changing federal funding environment and in response, has conducted careful scenario planning in preparation for multiple outcomes,” GPB said in a statement this week. “We are grateful to the Georgia General Assembly for providing level funding for this year and thankful for our many loyal donors across the state and beyond.”
Both outlets have launched emergency fundraising drives in response to the new law, hoping that Georgia residents will be able to help make up the remainder of the funds. GPB has not publicly disclosed how much their fundraising drive has raised.
Though the money raised by WABE is not yet enough to fill the organization’s $1.9 million funding gap, Dorian said it’s a strong start. 
“We still have a ways to go, as you can imagine, and we are counting on everyone in Atlanta to chip in, whether it’s a small amount or a large amount,” Dorian said. 
But amid all the chaos, she has found an unlikely silver lining.
“This is not going to be a public-private partnership anymore,” she said. “This is now going to be 100% community funded, which also makes us a 100% independent newsroom.”

,Maryland Matters,2025-07-28 11:20:19+00:00,Maryland Matters,"Advocates: Energy auction shows data center influence, grid operator’s deficits",Christine Condon,,,,,https://marylandmatters.org/2025/07/28/pjm-auction-shortcomings-maryland-advocates-data-centers/,"The auction by multistate power grid operator PJM will cause most Marylanders’ monthly electric bills to go up $2 to $5 next summer on top of other costs -- a ""death by a thousand cuts"" that points up the weaknesses in PJM, advocates say.","Transmission is just one of the costs going up in ratepayers' monthly bills, along with fuel and capacity charges, that add up to a ""death by a thousand cuts,"" advocates and analysts say. (Photo courtesy U.S. Department of Energy.)Last week’s energy auction by multistate power grid operator PJM will cause most Marylanders’ monthly electric bills to go up $2 to $5 next summer — but that’s on top of other costs, for transmission, fuel and more, that one advocate calls “death by a thousand cuts.”
It’s also the latest evidence, say ratepayer advocates and policymakers, that policies of PJM, the grid operator in a 13-state region that includes Maryland, are out of whack.
The latest of the “thousand cuts” is mostly the result of energy-guzzling data centers, David Lapp, the Maryland People’s Counsel, who is charged with representing state ratepayers. Predictions for their proliferation are largely behind inflated projections of energy demand in PJM states, pushing demand past supply in the auction process, sending the price skyward.
And ultimately, consumers pay the price.
“It’s fundamentally unfair,” Lapp said. “Why should residential customers be responsible for costs being driven by some of the biggest and wealthiest corporations in the world?”
At the same time, consumer advocates say PJM policies have restricted supply, with a backlogged queue for energy projects, many of them renewable energy proposals.
“Until there’s actual queue reform, there’s not going to be real relief,” said Emily Scarr, a senior adviser for Maryland PIRG, or Public Interest Research Group.
All eyes were on this year’s auction because last year’s was a blockbuster: The clearing price jumped 800% compared to the 2023 auction, setting a record for the most expensive such auction in PJM history.
This year’s auction surpassed that record, but it was offset by policies that consumer advocates — and some governors — pushed PJM to adopt.
Energy bills likely to tick up again in 2026 after electricity auction clears at maximum price

Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro (D) was behind a new cap on the auction’s clearing price. The auction hit the cap, saving consumers about $2.9 billion in total costs on their bills. Maryland Gov. Wes Moore (D) supported Shapiro’s appeal.
As various parts of energy bills increase, grid decision-makers don’t seem to be asking a key question, says Laurel Peltier, a low-income ratepayer advocate for the AARP: “Can people afford this?”
During a news conference Tuesday, Stu Bresler, a PJM executive vice president of market services and strategy, said that auction costs are a “small part of retail bills, and it also varies” how auction costs translate into rate changes for consumers.
But Peltier said that ignores key context.
“That’s like being in a bakery, and you know that the flour got more expensive, the butter got more expensive, the labor got more expensive, and you’re the egg maker, and your eggs are 800% more, and you’re like, ‘It’s OK. It’s just a little part,’” Peltier said.
When it comes to bill increases from the capacity auction, BGE customers are the exception. The segment of their bills tied to the auction will actually go down an estimated $3.36 per month, according to Office of People’s Counsel calculations.
But that’s really only because their rates soared so high after last year’s capacity auction at PJM.
PJM forced a Baltimore-area coal-fired plant, Brandon Shores, and oil-burning plant, H.A. Wagner, to keep running beyond their announced closure dates. But PJM’s rules kept that power out of the 2024 auction, suppressing expected supply at a time of surging demand.
This time, after urging from Lapp’s office and others, the rules were changed so that power from the two older plants was counted. And BGE customers will actually receive a credit for any revenue that the plants’ owner, Talen Energy, receives from the auction, Lapp said, lowering their bills, contrary to initial predictions from PJM.
But their monthly electric bills will still be up $16 from two auctions ago.
Changes inside PJM?
In a July 16 letter to PJM, a bipartisan group of nine governors in PJM’s 13-state territory — including Moore and Shapiro — said the moment presents an opportunity for change.
With the “abrupt termination of two long-standing members of the Board of Managers and the imminent departure of the CEO,” their replacements must “understand the concerns of ratepayers facing rising costs,” and create “a more collaborative and more effective ethos” at PJM, the governors wrote.










It’s fundamentally unfair. Why should residential customers be responsible for costs being driven by some of the biggest and wealthiest corporations in the world?


– David Lapp, Maryland Office of People's Counsel


“In the past, other regions looked to join PJM due to its many strengths; today, across the region, discussions of leaving PJM are becoming increasingly common,” read their letter.
In a July 18 response, PJM Board of Managers Chairman David Mills pushed back.
“Our operators are keeping the lights on through some of the most challenging circumstances that any grid operator, anywhere, has faced in its history,” he wrote. “We also continue the necessary function of operating regional markets as well as planning for a grid that is seeing an explosion of demand growth at the same time that state and federal policies have pushed a meaningful amount of generation capacity into retirement.”
He listed a number of changes PJM has made to its auction “to address concerns raised by our states,” including the “temporary” cap.
In a statement announcing the auction results Tuesday, PJM wrote that it “continues to focus on enhancing its process for connecting new generation resources onto the system, which includes clearing all the projects in its transition queue over the next 18 months, opening its new cycle process in spring 2026, and leveraging artificial intelligence through our partnership with Google to reduce processing time.”
Regime change may help, but some advocates warn that more transformative change may be necessary to lower prices. That includes changing how the organization is governed, Lapp said.
“We and the 13 other state consumer advocate offices in PJM — we get one vote. There are transmission-owning utilities that have more votes than us together,” Lapp said. “It’s the transmission owners that wield the most influence at PJM.”
Those same companies generally lose out when more power generation comes online, Scarr said.

“The legacy power plants lose out when that happens — but they’re the ones managing the ship,” Scarr said.
In a statement Thursday, Moore spokesman Carter Elliott IV wrote that Moore is “demanding reform and a meaningful voice for states in PJM governance, which is why a bipartisan group of governors’ staff met with PJM members” on Wednesday, including Moore’s staff.
A spokesman for PJM pointed to a fact sheet describing the grid operator’s governance structure, which highlights that PJM’s 10-member Board of Managers must not be financially tied to any PJM member. But on the member’s committee, which includes about 1,000 members, votes are divided between five industry sectors. State consumer advocates are the other voting members.
Data center debacle
When she hears ominous predictions for data center demand on the PJM grid, Del. Lorig Charkoudian (D-Montgomery) is skeptical.
The massive computing facilities have a sprawling footprint in Northern Virginia that has quickly inflated power demand in that region. But it remains an open question how widespread they will become, she said.
“You have the data centers that are sort of playing the field. There’s a real question right now about: Are we overcounting data center load? If the same data center is checking out five different locations, how are we sure?” said Charkoudian, who closely studies energy issues and is frequently behind energy legislation in the General Assembly.
It’s part of the reason she was dismayed to see Moore veto two bills that would have studied energy issues, citing their cost. One bill created a Strategic Energy Planning Office in Maryland, focused on predicting future energy issues without relying on PJM and utility companies; the second studied data centers specifically.
“Right now we’re continually caught flat-footed,” said Charkoudian, who added that she supports veto overrides for those bills.
Lapp said he also worries that data center projections are overblown because technology could be advancing to increase power efficiency at the facilities, which are full of computer servers that require immense amounts of energy to run and to keep from overheating.
That’s a major reason why data centers themselves should be footing the bill for their own power demand, and the upgrades to the power system they may require, Lapp said.
“If the data centers aren’t responsible for paying for all the costs that they are driving, they have much less incentive to find more computer chips, to operate more efficiently, to reduce their own costs,” he said.
It’s PJM’s job to change the paradigm, wherein ratepayers pay for enhancing the electric system, he said.
“It’s an unprecedented period of time in the industry, when you have city-sized demand being built up in just a few years,” Lapp said. “You can’t treat that the same as load growth gradually occurring over time.”

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)By Matt Dragon
While a lot of the focus has been on the chaos in Washington, DC over the tax bill that would represent the largest transfer of wealth to the ultra-wealthy in our history, New Jersey’s legislators and Gov. Phil Murphy are responsible for an equally unjust budget, written largely out of the public eye.
It’s easy to see why so many voters sit out elections, or say they don’t see the difference in their lives regardless of election outcome, when we see parallel stories playing out in Democratic-controlled New Jersey and in Republican-controlled D.C. The budget process in Trenton has long been criticized as “three white dudes in a room,” which needs to be addressed head-on. But it also doesn’t seem to yield very good results, with rushed votes right before the deadline, and multiple recent instances of “clean-up bills” needed to fix up mistakes no one had a chance to notice before the fast-tracked passage to meet the deadline.
In the few days before the vote, as the actual shape of the state’s new budget became apparent, there were several red flags. The affordable housing trust fund is being raided to plug holes elsewhere in the budget, continuing a long line of one-off budget “fixes” at the expense of much-needed programs. What could have been a moment of real celebration with the passage of a mansion tax to create a more equitable tax system has instead been undermined, potentially leaving affordable housing in New Jersey worse off than it started.
It’s not just the public that’s kept in the dark. Even Attorney General Matt Platkin, with whom I have my own disagreements, was shocked to find out that $45 million from the state’s share of the national opioid settlement was being diverted to four major hospital chains in the state. One of those hospital chains, RWJBarnabas Health, will receive $15 million, which definitely has nothing to do with the fact that longtime Murphy chief of staff, limited-time-only U.S. senator from New Jersey George Helmy fell into a high paying role at the health care giant when he departed the Murphy administration in 2023. A very Jersey career arc, but this simply isn’t how functional governments govern.
Unfortunately, New Jersey’s new budget and its process, cloaked in secrecy, intentionally devoid of meaningful public input, and inarguably rushed, is nothing new, nor limited to budget bills. In 2020, a bill to allow Horizon to convert to a for-profit entity was introduced in the last few days of the lame duck session before the end-of-year Legislative holiday. Horizon is the largest health insurer in New Jersey and the health insurance provider for the State Health Benefits Plan offered to state employees (also an option for municipal and county workforces). That bill was moved through committee with amendments that the public had never seen — and let’s be honest, the legislators probably never read them either.
Surprising no one, after the restructuring was approved, Horizon jacked up state plan premiums more than 20%, despite its new, “more competitive” for-profit form. In the three years after the misguided bill was rushed through the Legislature without transparency, Horizon paid out $35 million in bonuses, with just under $13 million going to the new CEO.
Flash forward to this year, and the governor and legislators have a plan to take $100 million from public employees. We could cover 10% of the $100 million in desired savings just from one Horizon executive’s bonus. Are our teachers, firefighters, and snow-plow operators getting bonuses like that?
To add insult to injury, the Horizon board has been a rotating clown car of former state legislators, which seems to have done nothing to protect the state’s or their former constituents’ interests.
The system is clearly broken, but the challenge is getting those who broke it — and benefit from its brokenness — to fix it. While voters are effectively locked out of the process, every state Assembly member and senator has the power to force change. It’s not about party, it’s about whether you were elected to represent — or to rule over.
So our legislators need to learn:

If you’re representing us, you can’t vote bills out of committee that we’ve never seen.
If you’re representing our best interests, you can’t vote bills out of committee that exist only as a few bullets on a napkin.
If you’re representing the people, you actually have to engage with and listen to those people, and you have to do that before you decide how to vote.

They need to slow things down and:

Hold actual public hearings, where you don’t give priority to retired lawmakers, and instead prioritize testimony from the actual public, not professional lobbyists.
Make those public hearings accessible, as most people can’t drive to Trenton and spend six hours sitting around waiting to testify during working hours.
Refuse to vote on things that weren’t on public committee agendas for at least a week before the hearing.
Refuse to vote on amendments that haven’t been released publicly for at least 72 hours.
Work with the legislative and technology offices to ensure that full bill text and amendment text are actually public on the New Jersey Legislature site before bills come before committees. 

Your chamber leaders will hate you, your committee chairs will despise you, but voters will support you. You have to reestablish trust, or election turnouts will continue to dwindle and more and more residents will, rightfully, feel like they’re on the outside, and that you’re not interested in representing them. Your chamber and committee leadership are not your bosses; your constituents are.

There has never been a case where restricting speech on a political matter to such a degree has gone well. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Habib Meiloud: Do not support bill H.310.","This commentary is by Habib Meiloud of central Vermont.


I recently learned about bill H.310 and find it troubling on multiple levels. Mainly, it’s a seemingly purposeful attempt to conflate anti-Zionism and critique of the State of Israel with antisemitism. 
Not only is this comparison false, but it is also extremely concerning when considered in the context of education. 
To be clear, I fully support mandating that the Holocaust be taught in every single Vermont school. I take issue with the attempt to infringe on students’ rights to critique a state. 
There is no other country in the world where the critique of its policies is so easily twisted into hate speech against its people. 
If I critique the state of Ethiopia for its slaughter of the Tigray people, am I considered to be racist? Of course not — because there is a difference between critiquing those in power and discrimination against people. 
Every Vermont student should be able to discuss openly their thoughts and opinions on Israel or any other country. Stifling warranted conversation is not the solution to the rise in antisemitism that we have seen. The way we fight that antisemitism and all hate is by education and discussion. 
There has never been a case where restricting speech on a political matter to such a degree has gone well. 
I recognize, however, that a discussion without a solid educational foundation can easily become hateful. So I would hope that supporters of this bill would also support having students have a full education of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and not starting on Oct. 7, 2023, but rather in 1917, the year of the Balfour Declaration. That way, students can understand the nuances of the conversation. 
However, H.310 does not accomplish that goal. All it does is start to set up Vermont’s students to become complacent in the face of national acts, out of fear of retribution. 
Is this the lesson we want to signal to our kids? Can that adversity only be solved by forceful legislation? If that is not what you want, then do not support H.310.

As anti-immigration rhetoric surges across Europe and the United States, it is vital that we look beyond the fearmongering and analyse what is really going on. While human mobility is often presented as a burden, the truth is quite the opposite. It is an essential driver of economic growth, demographic resilience and cultural cohesion.
Ignoring this fact is not just a miscalculation – it flies in the face of both empirical evidence and the democratic principles that modern societies claim to defend.
Migration is also not a 21st century anomaly. From the Mediterranean diasporas of antiquity to the mass migrations of the 20th century, human history has been defined by movement. City-states, colonial empires and modern nation-states have been built – and rebuilt – through the movement of people, languages, knowledge and goods. Presenting human mobility as a threat ignores this historical pattern, and tries to turn the exception – isolation – into the rule.
Any political discourse that presents migrants as intruders, rather than as potential citizens or economic agents, is a dangerous distortion, not only in moral but also in strategic terms.
 Migration drives economies

In 2016, an analysis by the McKinsey Global Institute drew some compelling conclusions. While migrants accounted for only 3.3% of the global population in 2015, they generated 9.4% of global GDP that year – about $6.7 trillion. In the United States alone, their contribution amounted to about $2 trillion.
More recent studies confirm this. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimated in 2024 that net migration flows to the eurozone between 2020 and 2023 – including millions of Ukrainian refugees – may raise the region’s potential GDP by an additional 0.5% by 2030. This is not a marginal amount, as it represents roughly half of all expected potential growth. Without migration, Europe’s economic horizon would be considerably more limited.
 Workers, innovation, growth

In the US, more than 31 million immigrants were part of the labour market in 2023 – 19% of the total, according to the Council on Foreign Relations. Their participation rate (meaning the percentage of the working-age population that is active in the labour market) was 67%, compared to 62% of native-born workers. This difference signals a disproportionate contribution to tax revenue, domestic consumption and economic dynamism in general.

  Labour force participation rate in the US: immigrants have been more active participants in the labour market than their native-born counterparts for nearly two decades. (Council on Foreign Relations)
Statistics also show that immigrants do not compete on a level playing field: they tend to work in physically demanding jobs, or in those that are not covered by locals. This reinforces the idea that they complement, rather than substitute, native-born workers. This role becomes even more significant in contexts of full employment or population ageing.

 Migration and innovation

Migration brings not only workers, but also new ideas. According to the World Economic Forum, immigrants to the US are 80% more likely to start new businesses than native-born people, and more than 40% of Fortune 500 companies were founded by migrants or their descendants.
This pattern is repeated in academia and technology: a significant proportion of patents filed in the United States have at least one foreign inventor. The country’s leading universities also depend on international students to sustain their science, technology, engineering and mathematics programmes. In other words, closing borders means closing the door to innovation.
In the European Union, their impact is no less significant. According to the 2024 IMF report, between 2019 and 2023, two thirds of new jobs were filled by non-EU migrants. These statistics refute the idea that migrants “steal jobs”. On the contrary, they fill structural vacancies that neither automation nor the internal market has been able to fill.
Moreover, the OECD warned in 2025 that if more women, older people and immigrants are not brought into the labour market, GDP per capita growth in member countries could fall from 1% per year (2000-2020) to a meagre 0.6% by 2060. Conversely, a more inclusive migration policy could add at least 0.1 percentage point to annual growth.
 Sending money home

The 2024 World Migration Report confirmed that global remittances – immigrants sending money to family members in their country of origin – reached $831 billion in 2022, a growth of more than 650% from 2000.
This far exceeds official development assistance and even, in many cases, foreign direct investment. However, they perform a similar function – remittances are mainly invested in health, education and housing.
They are, in effect, a global redistribution of wealth that does not pass through any multilateral system. For the people who receive them, their impact is stabilising, and profoundly humane.
 Looking forwards

This is not just a question of economics. When political and social rhetoric starts to exclude those perceived as outsiders, it undermines their capacity to adapt and change. Ignoring the evidence comes at a great cost, which can be summarised in three areas:

Economic losses: reduced immigration means giving up a structural source of growth, innovation and fiscal sustainability.
Social instability: anti-immigration discourse feeds the stigmas that fracture coexistence and weaken social cohesion.
Geopolitical weakness: less immigration means losing influence in a world increasingly defined by intense competition for talent and human capital.

The good news is that there are tried and tested solutions. From streamlining professional accreditation processes to regional migration coordination systems, there are already tools available to governments. The challenge is a political and, above all, narrative one. Public opinion – which is shaped by political rhetoric – needs to recognise and embrace the value of human mobility as part of our contemporary social contract.
As the World Economic Forum rightly points out, migration is not a problem to be solved, but a strategic asset to be managed intelligently and humanely. To underestimate it is to undermine the foundations of global development in the 21st century.

(Getty Images)The last Indiana biennial budget faced significant challenges, which seem certain to worsen. Still, it is not short-term fluctuations that challenge us, but rather the long-term changes to how we spend our state tax dollars. 
The economic forecast for 2025-6 turned sour because of the emerging trade war. That cut $2 billion from the state budget forecast over the next two fiscal years, and was followed by further belt-tightening steps in preparation for what is almost certain to be more bad economic news through 2026-7.
Hoosier lawmakers are obligated to balance our budget, and keep roughly $2.4 billion, a bit more than 5% of a biennium budget in reserve. That’s a healthy, but not excessive reserve. We saw nearly a 5% decline in Indiana’s gross domestic product in 2008, which combined with what is charitably described as a stochastic federal budgeting approach should worry state lawmakers.  
There are always issues to complain about in a state budget, but the bigger focus of interest should be on long-term budgeting issues. The question should be how much are we taxing and spending, and where are we allocating those dollars.  
Analysis: Latest Indiana budget drops spending 7% — with cuts ‘telling’

This is not as easy as it seems. The state government took over the last 15% of school operational funding in 2010, so comparisons in earlier years require some adjustment. At the same time, our local spending as a share of GDP and local government employment are both below where they sat two decades ago. 
Recent local tax cuts, primarily to businesses, are likely to push local spending back to 1990s levels by 2026. I note this, because lower local spending places more pressure on state services.  
State spending as a share of GDP dropped from 10.9% in 2004 to 9.6% in 2024, despite the 2010 takeover of school operational funding. But, the year-to-year variation has been significant. In 2014, the state spent only 8.3% of GDP, and in 2022-3 spent 10.7% of GDP.  
It is fair to say that without dipping into the reserves, state spending in the 2026-7 budget as a share of our economy is likely to be among the lowest of the past two decades. But the far bigger issue is how we are spending those dollars. 
The state budget fits nicely into some big categories – K-12 and higher education, food assistance, Medicaid, corrections, transportation and housing. The ‘other’ spending categories of environmental, economic development and a slew of miscellaneous funds has been fairly stable, with one exception – a rapid burst in economic development spending, primarily on the LEAP district.










if we spent the same share of GDP on education today as we did in 2010, K-12 and higher education institutions in the state would receive $3.2 billion more each year in spending.


I think it is helpful to place the ‘people focused’ budget items into two broad categories – those that help prevent poverty, and those that mitigate the effects of poverty. Transportation is best left by itself in this analysis. 
As of last year, Indiana spending on all transportation items – road maintenance and capital investment, along with safety and bridges was 0.31% of our GDP. That is well below the 21st century average of 0.50% of GDP, and near inflation adjusted lows.  
Even with the changes in gasoline taxes, our highway and road spending are deeply stressed. That is why the governor is pushing for more local spending via a wheel tax while also pursuing tolls on federal highways. He is right to pursue both of these.  
Helping Hoosiers
The bigger changes we’ve seen come in the allocation of funding between state government activities that help ensure prosperity, and those that treat poverty. 
The two big “pro-prosperity” programs at the state level are quite obviously, education. The programs that treat poverty are food assistance, Medicaid, corrections and housing.  
Our spending on pursuing prosperity is lower than in 2010, by every relevant measure. In 2010, we spent 2.77% of our GDP on education, today that figure is 2.16%. The biggest cuts have been in higher education, but in K-12 we are spending $100 less per student each year today than in 2010. Furthermore, if we spent the same share of GDP on education today as we did in 2010, K-12 and higher education institutions in the state would receive $3.2 billion more each year in spending.  
As a side note, all my data are in inflation adjusted dollars – the approach used by anyone who is honestly comparing spending across time. 
On programs that attempt to remediate the effects of poverty, our spending has grown substantially. Altogether, the share of our state’s economy we spend on these four big programs has risen by 0.34%.  This extra spending since 2010 translates into an additional $1.8 billion spent each year to mitigate poverty.   
The sole culprit here is Medicaid. In 2010 we spent 0.57% of our GDP on Medicaid. That rose to 1.12% in 2023-24.  
Today, Indiana has worse educational outcomes, and higher poverty spending than we did in 2010.  The challenge of the next decade is to reverse these trends.  That just won’t happen without more fiscal capacity aimed at education.

Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, D-Skamania County, who is bracing for a pitched fight to keep her seat representing southwest Washington, raised $904,000 in the most recent reporting period. 
Meanwhile, Rep. Dan Newhouse, R-Sunnyside, arguably the state’s most at-risk Republican House member, is stockpiling cash ahead of another tussle with MAGA Republican Jerrod Sessler in central Washington.
Here is a round-up of money raised by Washington’s incumbent House members and opponents between April 1 and June 30 as reported to the Federal Election Commission. 
Washington’s battleground district
Gluesenkamp Perez was first elected in 2022, capturing the 3rd Congressional District seat that Republicans had held for a dozen years. She spent nearly $12 million to win reelection in 2024.
It is not going to be easier in 2026. The National Republican Congressional Committee is already criticizing her with a drumbeat of press releases and ads, as at least two recognized Republicans have looked at entering the race. 
Two people have stepped up to challenge her – Republican Antony Barran and Democrat Brent William Hennrich. Barran raised $9,300 and Hennrich brought in  $7,400, according to their campaign disclosures.
With her haul of a little over $900,000, Gluesenkamp Perez had $1.1 million on hand June 30, according to her FEC filings.
Tim Gowen, campaign manager for Gluesenkamp Perez, said in an email last week the congresswoman “is ready to put her record of fighting our fentanyl crisis and leveling the playing field for everyday people up against anyone.”
A third round
In November, Newhouse secured a sixth term representing the 4th District by defeating Jerrod Sessler, a candidate backed by Donald Trump.
Newhouse has been scorned by MAGA Republicans since he voted to impeach Trump after the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol. But the congressman has defended his seat twice since that vote.
He raised $261,000 this last cycle and, after expenses, had $339,000 on hand.
Sessler, who also ran in 2022, is the lone challenger so far for 2026. The Prosser resident raised nearly $60,000 in the quarter and close to $184,000 for the election cycle. However, he’s spent most of it and had a little under $8,300 on hand June 30.
In a statement, Sessler expressed confidence, saying, “I’ve got President Trump’s support and all those who want to see Washington state return to sanity.”
A campaign spokesman for Newhouse said the congressman is delivering “positive results” and that if Sessler runs again, “the result won’t be any different than the last two times.”
Packed House
Rep. Adam Smith, who is getting challenged from the political left and right in the 9th District, collected $226,000 and had $659,000 banked at the close of the filing period.
Kshama Sawant, the socialist who served a decade on the Seattle City Council, may be his best-known opponent. Sawant formally kicked off her campaign in early June and raised $87,000 by the end of the month.
Melissa Chaudhry, a Democrat who lost to Smith in November, looks to be running again. She reported $107,000 in her campaign account, nearly all of it carried over from her 2024 campaign. 
Republicans Mark Greene, who ran unsuccessfully last year, and Janis Clark filed campaign committee paperwork this month. 
A rematch?
Republican Rep. Michael Baumgartner received 60.6% of the vote when he beat Democrat Carmela Conroy in November in the 5th District. The two Spokane residents could duel again next year.
The first-term congressman got $228,000 in contributions and ended with $435,000 on June 30, based on federal reports. Conroy had a little more than $73,000 on hand after a quarter in which she raised $68,000.
Ann Marie Danimus, a Spokane Democrat who ran in 2024, looks to be eyeing another bid for the seat as well as she registered her campaign committee in mid-June. 
The rest of the pack
Six Democratic House members, most without announced opponents, boosted their totals.
Rep. Suzan DelBene of Medina raised $581,000 and had $1.2 million on hand as she eyes another term in the 1st Congressional District. She also chairs the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, making her a point person in the party’s effort to recapture the House majority in next year’s midterms.
Rep. Rick Larsen of Everett, who first won his 2nd Congressional District in 2000, brought in $331,000 and ended with nearly $415,000 in his campaign account.
Rep. Emily Randall of Bremerton, in her first term serving the 6th Congressional District, collected $203,000 and closed with $128,000 banked as she eyes a reelection run.
In the 7th District, Rep. Pramila Jayapal of Seattle hauled in an impressive $609,000 and, after expenses, finished this cycle with $2.2 million on hand. The former chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus has been an unyielding opposition voice to the Trump administration.
In the neighboring 8th District, Rep. Kim Schrier of Sammamish reported nearly $466,000 raised and $2.5 million in her coffers. Earlier this month, Republican Bob Hagglund of Granite Falls filed as a candidate with the Federal Election Commission. Hagglund ran unsuccessfully for lieutenant governor in 2024.
Rep. Marilyn Strickland of Tacoma, looking to retain her seat in the 10th District, reported $295,000 in contributions and had banked $685,000 through June 30. No opponents had signed up a campaign committee as of Friday.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/money-rake-1024x680.jpeg,,,2025-07-28 07:57:23.627213

(Courtesy of Cooperative Energy Futures)More than 180 local households will see significantly lower energy bills after the solar array atop Abbott Northwestern Hospital’s new parking ramp powers up later this year. 
Abbot Northwestern — Twin Cities’ largest private hospital — will enjoy similar savings while hosting Minneapolis nonprofit Cooperative Energy Futures’ newest community solar garden for at least the next 25 years. 
It’s CEF’s second ramp-top solar garden — after the 3,760-panel installation at Ramp A in downtown Minneapolis — and one of its largest yet. Community solar garden subscribers typically save 20% to 30% on their monthly electricity bills, CEF says. Fifty-five percent of subscribers in the Abbott Northwestern garden qualify as low- or moderate-income. Canopy-style arrays like this one provide shade for people and cars in summer and reduce snow removal crews’ workloads come winter.
Perks like these helped CEF find long-term hosts for and draw nearly 1,000 subscribers to its 10 existing community solar gardens, a mix of rooftop and canopy arrays in the Twin Cities and ground-mounted installations farther out. CEF plans to energize at least three more gardens this year and has five projects in earlier stages of development, according to its 2025 annual report.
The future of projects like these are in doubt since the election of President Donald Trump, which has ushered in a federal government bent on making it harder for Americans to access affordable, non-polluting electricity.
Trump signed a partisan budget law on July 4 that sunsets federal solar tax credits years ahead of schedule while boosting already-generous fossil fuel subsidies, sending solar developers scrambling to grandfather as many projects as possible under the current rules. Days later, Trump made good on an apparent side deal with congressional conservatives and ordered the U.S. Treasury Department to take a hard line on those rules, possibly by increasing the amount of early investment projects need before they can qualify. Developers expect final guidance sometime next month, soon after Trump’s latest tariffs take effect (or not).
“Our lawyers are really trying to define our deadlines and we’re going to push as much as we can before we have to reorient,” CEF’s Dan Grantier told The Reformer at the Abbot Northwestern ribbon-cutting event.

The Abbot Northwestern project illustrates the potential for creative uses of a solar garden in an urban environment. Hospital owner Allina Health approached CEF in 2019 as part of a campaign to endear its Midtown Minneapolis neighbors to the new parking ramp it needed for a major campus expansion, Allina Vice President of Facilities Tony LaCroix-Dalluhn recently told The Reformer. 
“A parking structure is not exactly a welcome addition to the neighborhood, so we came up with a community solar garden to make it more appealing,” along with less conspicuous nods to sustainability, like a “maxed out” 200-stall bike parking area with showers and a pollinator garden along the Midtown Greenway, LaCroix-Dalluhn said. 
“There’s not much benefit for us, but it’s great for the community,” he said.
Minnesota helped kickstart the American community solar movement thanks in large part to legislation championed by the late State Rep. Melissa Hortman and the doggedness of homegrown developers like CEF, which began weatherizing older Minneapolis homes in the late aughts.  With more installed community solar capacity than all but three other states — more than 900 times the maximum output of the Abbott Northwestern system — Minnesota continues to punch well above its weight. 
Despite Trump’s war on decarbonization, states and municipalities that care about climate change and energy access will continue to support solar development. Minnesota needs to add a lot more solar panels — as well as wind turbines and other carbon-free sources and batteries to provide grid stability — to meet its mandate for 100% carbon-free electricity by 2040, giving developers like CEF and dozens of smaller rooftop solar installation businesses clarity on long-term demand. House Democrats gave the industry another boost in the June special legislative session when they killed a budget provision that would have ended Minnesota’s community solar program in three years. 
And despite tightening municipal budgets, some Minnesota cities offer generous incentives for residential and commercial solar projects. Businesses qualify for up to $50,000 and residential buyers’ groups up to $175,000 from the Minneapolis Green Cost Share program, for example.
“If you’re looking to build a parking ramp in Minneapolis, we want to talk to you,” Grantier said.
Even without federal subsidies, solar and backup batteries increasingly make financial sense for utility customers, said Michael Allen, cofounder and CEO of All Energy Solar. 
But the slow, cumbersome process of getting new systems approved and connected to the grid — typically a 40-to-60-day wait for Xcel Energy customers “if everything goes smoothly,” he said — scares some prospects off and raises costs for the rest. Larger arrays can take many months or years to get utility approval, though Grantier said urban neighborhoods like Midtown tend to have more slack in the grid.
“Where legislators and regulators can really make a difference is by holding (utilities’) feet to the fire and taking a stand to improve things for Minnesotans,” Allen said.
Otherwise, he warned, more utility customers may take matters into their own hands and look for ways to reduce their reliance on the grid.
 “The more we fight each other, the greater the desire there is to do something different,” he said.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/solar-garden-2-1024x578.jpg,,,2025-07-28 07:57:23.627213

Despite Trump administration rhetoric accusing Democrats of protecting violent criminals and drug-dealing immigrants, the administration’s arrests have been catching a smaller share of criminals overall, and a smaller share of people convicted of violent and drug crimes, than the Biden administration did in the same time frame.
While the Trump administration has caught more immigrants with convictions for drugs and violence, their share of the rising arrest numbers is smaller, as more people get swept up for minor traffic violations or strictly immigration crimes, according to a Stateline analysis.
Forty percent of the nearly 112,000 arrests by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) from Jan. 20 through late June were of convicted criminals. That’s compared with 53% of the nearly 51,000 arrests for same time period in 2024 under the Biden administration.



The share of people convicted of violent crime fell from 10% to 7% and drug crimes from 9% to 5%, according to a Stateline analysis of data from the Deportation Data Project.
The project, led by attorneys and professors in California, Maryland and New York, collects and posts public, anonymized U.S. government immigration enforcement datasets obtained through Freedom of Information Act requests.
Some Democratic states are among those with the highest share of violent criminals in this year’s ICE arrests: Hawaii (15%), Vermont (13%), and California and Nebraska (12%) — while some of the lowest shares were in more Republican states: Maine (2%), and Alabama, Montana and Wyoming (3%).
Immigration attorneys see an increased push to arrest and detain immigrants for any type of violation or pending charge as President Donald Trump pushes for higher arrest and detention numbers to meet his campaign promise for mass deportation. Trump officials have called for 3,000 arrests a day, far more than the current average of 711 as of June and 321 a day during the same time period under Biden.


The majority of recent ICE detentions involve people with no convictions. That’s a pattern I find troubling.


– Oregon Republican state Rep. Cyrus Javadi


Arrests have accelerated since about mid-May, when government attorneys began asking to revoke bail and arrest people who show up for court hearings after being released at the border, said Vanessa Dojaquez-Torres, practice and policy counsel for the American Immigration Lawyers Association, which represents more than 16,000 immigration attorneys.
“We’re not completely sure what the reasoning or the goal is behind some of these policies, other than they want detention numbers up,” Dojaquez-Torres said.
“They seem to have really been struggling to get their deportation numbers up, and so I think that’s one of the reasons why we see a lot of these policies going into effect that are meant to kind of circumvent the immigration court process and due process.”
Arrests of people convicted of violent crimes increased by 45% from about 5,300 to 7,700 compared with last year. For drug crimes, the increase was 21% — and they fell as a share of total arrests, from 9% under the Biden administration to 5% this year.

Arrests for those not convicted of any crime nearly tripled to about 67,000, and increased from 47% to 60% of arrests.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security defended ICE arrests Wednesday. Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that the agency was “targeting dangerous criminal illegal aliens and taking them off American streets. Violent thugs ICE arrested include child pedophiles, drug traffickers, and burglars.”
In Oregon, arrests during the first part of last year increased from 51 under the Biden administration to 227 under the Trump administration, with those not convicted of any crime increasing from 34 to 137. Those with convictions for violent crime increased from 3 to 16. Even some Republicans are concerned with the new emphasis on non-criminals.
“The majority of recent ICE detentions involve people with no convictions. That’s a pattern I find troubling, especially when it risks sweeping up people for things like expired tags or missed court dates,” said Oregon state Rep. Cyrus Javadi, a moderate Republican representing Tillamook and Clatsop counties.
Nationally, nonviolent crimes have risen as a share of immigration arrests. The most common crime conviction for those arrested this year is driving while intoxicated, which was also the top offense last year under Biden.
But this year it’s closely followed by general traffic offenses, which rose to second place from sixth place, surpassing such crimes as assault and drug trafficking.

Traffic offenses, outside of driving while intoxicated and hit and run, rose almost fourfold as the most serious conviction on record for those arrested, the largest increase in the top 10. Those offenses were followed by increases in the immigration crime of illegal entry, meaning crossing the border in secret, which tripled.
The increase in traffic violations as a source of immigration arrests is a reason for cities to consider limiting traffic stops, said Daniela Gilbert, director of the Redefining Public Safety Initiative at the Vera Institute of Justice, a nonprofit devoted to ending mass incarceration.
“It’s an important point to consider intervening in so that there can be less interaction, and so ICE has less opportunity to continue its indiscriminate dragnet of enforcement,” Gilbert said.
The institute argues in general that traffic stops should be limited to safety issues rather than low-level infractions such as expired registrations or single burned-out taillights, both because they do not improve public safety and because they disproportionately affect drivers of color.
Such policies limiting stops under some conditions are in place in 10 states and in cities in six other states, according to the institute.
The most recent state polices took effect last year in California and Illinois, while a policy is set to take effect in October in Connecticut. The most recent city policies were in Denver and in East Lansing and Ypsilanti, Michigan. Six other states have considered legislation recently.

Santiago/Getty Images)Federal immigration authorities have arrested increasing numbers of people suspected of being in Indiana illegally — but have yet to deputize officer nominees from at least two Hoosier counties in President Donald Trump’s deportation campaign.
And Indiana’s state police agency has no plans to seek such U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement duties for its officers, despite a directive from Gov. Mike Braun promoting participation.
Nearly 1,400 people in Indiana have been subject to ICE administrative arrest since Trump’s Jan. 20 inauguration, as of June 26. That’s almost an 80% increase over the same period last year, according to ICE records obtained by the Deportation Data Project and published July 15.

About a quarter of those apprehended in June had no criminal convictions or charges, prompting Braun to remark, “If that data is correct, I’d say that should raise eyebrows. Because I’ve been clearly on record: the worst, first. And there are many of them out there.”
The tally comes as the Hoosier State is tapped to bulk up the nation’s deportation infrastructure.
Amid a capacity crisis in federal immigration facilities, Camp Atterbury will be used to hold immigrant detainees. The federally owned military installation is licensed to and operated by the Indiana National Guard.
Meanwhile, the crusade has revealed cracks among Trump’s Hoosier backers and forced immigrant advocates to adjust.
Enforcement-boosting agreements idle
More than 866 state and local law enforcement agencies have entered formal partnerships with ICE to help identify and remove people in the U.S. illegally, particularly those with criminal histories — but only four are Indiana agencies.
The program, authorized in Section 287(g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, lets ICE delegate certain immigration enforcement powers to state or local officers. There are three active program models: jail enforcement, task force and warrant service officer.
Although available since 1996, the first memorandum of agreement wasn’t signed until 2002, according to a 2021 Congressional Research Service report. The total increased to 72 in 2011, declined to 35 by the end of former President Barack Obama’s administration, and shot back up to 150 in late 2020, near the end of Trump’s first term in office.
As of Friday, ICE’s records of 287(g) participants listed four Hoosier law enforcement agencies.
All signed up this year, after Braun issued an executive order in January directing Hoosier law enforcement agencies to “fully cooperate with ICE, and, to the maximum extent permitted, enter into (287(g)) agreements.”


They include sheriff’s offices in Hamilton, Jasper and Noble counties, as well as the town of Greens Fork’s police department.
But officers nominated by at least two of them haven’t yet been activated.
The Hamilton County Sheriff’s Office turned in a jail enforcement agreement dated Feb. 24. ICE signed it March 3.
Under that model, select officers would be able to serve and execute administrative arrest warrants for immigration violations; interrogate and process suspected arrestees; serve warrants of removal; prepare charging documents; transport arrestees to ICE-approved detention facilities; issue immigration detainer requests and more.
But before officers are conferred those powers, they must complete delegation of immigration authority training and score at least 70% on related exams. 
Five members were identified for training, which has been scheduled, Hamilton County Sgt. Bryan Melton said Thursday; they’re “waiting to attend.” ICE has also granted access to its systems and software.
“We have a good working relationship with ICE,” Melton added. His office has held 74 people for transfer to ICE custody so far this year, after holding just 77 across the entirety of 2024.
ICE signed the Jasper County Sheriff’s Office’s warrant service officer deal on March 17.
“To date, that training has not yet occurred,” Chief Deputy Jason Wallace said Wednesday. “As such, we currently have zero deputies/jail officers participating in the program, and it is my understanding that we are not considered active participants until the required training is completed.”
“I am unsure why the training has not yet taken place,” he added. “All necessary paperwork was submitted; however, we have not received any follow-up or communication from ICE regarding next steps.”
His agency has recorded 14 transfers to ICE custody so far this year.
The Noble County Sheriff’s Office and Greens Fork Police Department didn’t return requests for comment on their participation in the 287(g) program. They have memorandums of agreement effective March 25 and April 10, respectively.
ICE also maintains a log of pending partnerships. As of Friday, it listed no Hoosier agencies.
The Indiana State Police indicated that it won’t be among those seeking ICE powers.
“ISP has no plan to enter into a 287(g) agreement of its own,” Capt. Ron Galaviz said.
He directed the Capital Chronicle to Braun’s order, adding, “The Indiana State Police works very closely with all its law enforcement partners at the local, county, state, and federal levels.”
Conservative dissent
As the Trump administration pushes for a daily arrest quota of 3,000, splinters have emerged among the president’s supporters.
“I have people they call me. They’re like, ‘I’m not sure if my crew is going to show up for work Monday morning, because if there’s a raid, or something like that, right?” U.S. Rep. Marlin Stutzman of Indiana said last week, the Wall Street Journal reported.

“If you try to deport all of them, you’re gonna crash the economy,” Stutzman, a rancher, continued. He represents the Third District in northeast Indiana.
The House Freedom Caucus member later wrote on X that he’d “never support giving someone who crossed our border illegally citizenship, amnesty, or the right to vote.” Then, he quoted Trump: “If a farmer is willing to vouch for these people, in some way, we’re going to have to say that’s going to be good.”
Stutzman’s office didn’t return interview requests. But his remarks — and cosponsorship of a bipartisan immigration reform bill — prompted hundreds of critiques from conservative commenters and others.
Micah Clark, the executive director of the American Family Association’s Indiana chapter, called on Stutzman to “remove his name” from the bill while the “national security risks, criminals, traffickers, and other problems facing us from 4 years of an open border are addressed first.”
“This congressional majority should govern with the mandate voters gave them on this issue and set aside what some special interests seem to want — cheap labor,” Clark wrote in a Wednesday newsletter.
When asked about any impacts of the deportation push on Indiana Farm Bureau members, National Affairs Director Brantley Seifers emphasized the value of a temporary agricultural worker visa program, particularly to specialty crop growers.
“The workers our members employ via the H-2A program are essential to that goal, and INFB will continue to advocate against the overregulation that continues to burden farmers who participate in the program,” he continued.
The Indiana Farm Bureau “ha(s)n’t heard of any of our members being impacted by raids, but that’s not to say it hasn’t happened,” spokeswoman Heidi Gant added.
The Indiana Chamber of Commerce declined to provide an interview or comment.
State-level officials have largely applauded stepped-up immigration enforcement.
“For too long, Hoosier communities have borne the burden of open-border policies, facing increased crime, human trafficking, and strain on our schools, hospitals, and other taxpayer-funded resources,” Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita said in a statement last week. “Using Camp Atterbury to securely detain illegal aliens pending immigration proceedings or deportation sends a clear message: Indiana will not tolerate lawlessness.”
Rokita said his office “stands ready” to back up federal efforts.
Advocates mobilize
The Indiana Latino Democratic Caucus began as a way to encourage political participation but has pivoted to “coordinat(ing) a statewide response to the emergency needs of the Latinos,” according to organization President Karla Lopez-Owens.
“Everybody feels it: this is different,” she said. “It’s unforgiving. It’s cruel.”
The group published a bilingual “Find an ICE detainee” guide, she said, and in the weeks since, they’ve been printed out and distributed to churches, coffee shops and other community spaces.

Lopez-Owens is also a cofounder of the Indiana Undocumented Youth Alliance, which recently launched a rapid response team. About 250-300 volunteers have been trained on best practices when encountering or spotting ICE officers, she said.
The alliance also plans to publish a list of reputable immigration attorneys to combat scams. And it maintains a legal defense fund, which Lopez-Owens dubbed a “very small lifeline.”
“The need far exceeds what’s available, and it wasn’t like this before,” she said. “… It’s not even about preparation, because we’re way past that point. It’s about mitigation and supporting the needs on a day-by-day basis.”
The alliance isn’t the only group struggling to meet need.
Immigrant Welcome Center Executive Director Gurinder Kaur said some clients who are self-deporting have requested travel aid, but there is no funding to support them.

They also placed a question on the 2026 ballot rolling back abortion rights that voters enshrined in the state constitution in November. 
It’s not the first time the GOP-dominated legislature overturned voter-approved laws in recent years. But this time, the backlash could have long-lasting consequences.  
In the short term, proponents of the paid sick leave law are eyeing a new initiative petition to reinstate the benefit in the state constitution, while abortion-rights supporters expect to raise millions to fend off a new ban. 
But another coalition hopes to go even further. 
Respect Missouri Voters, a bipartisan constellation of organizations, this month submitted 38 versions of a new initiative petition seeking to undermine the legislature’s ability to overturn voter-approved measures. 
Most would require 80% of the legislature to agree before a law or constitutional amendment enacted by initiative petition could be revised or repealed. They also would prohibit the legislature from making the initiative and referendum process more difficult. 
The group’s PAC reported $200,000 cash on hand on July 1, with another $170,000 in large donations since then. That includes $10,000 from former Republican U.S. Sen. John Danforth. 
“This is our one shot,” said Benjamin Singer, CEO of one of the coalition’s members, Show Me Integrity. “If we don’t act now, they’ll succeed in silencing us forever.”
Missouri Gov. Kehoe signs bill repealing paid sick leave 

Republicans have taken notice, with some pondering a preemptive strike to change the initiative petition process before any campaign gets off the ground. But others worry it may already be too late and wonder if the GOP overplayed its hand with its recent moves.
“The legislature doesn’t really seem to understand, they’ve kicked the hornet’s nest,” said James Harris, a veteran Republican consultant in Missouri. “We may be about to cross the rubicon… where the legislature loses a lot of its power.”
The showdown is decades in the making. 
After Missourians approved a constitutional amendment to limit taxes in the 1980s, the Democratic-led legislature tried to make changes to the initiative petition process that were criticized at the time by GOP Gov. John Ashcroft as an attempt to silence voters. He ultimately vetoed the bill. 
In 1999, Missouri voters rejected a ballot measure that would have allowed concealed carry of firearms. Despite the defeat, the legislature revisited the issue after Republicans took the majority and ultimately passed a concealed carry bill in 2003.
Voters passed a ballot measure in 2010 called the “Puppy Mill Cruelty and Prevention Act” that specified appropriate living conditions for breeding operations with at least 10 female breeding dogs. It also capped the number of animals that a business could use for breeding at 50.
Soon after, lawmakers passed a bill that peeled back key parts of the new law, including the cap on the number of breeding dogs.
The puppy mill vote inspired advocates to forgo changes to state law and instead put their focus on putting policy changes in the state constitution — making it much harder for lawmakers to make changes because it would require another statewide vote. 
In subsequent years, voters approved constitutional amendments legalizing marijuana, expanding Medicaid eligibility,  creating a nonpartisan redistricting plan and repealing a ban on abortion. 
But the GOP supermajority wasn’t ready to quit without a fight. 
Lawmakers refused to fund Medicaid expansion until the Missouri Supreme Court said they had no choice. They pushed through a ballot measure of their own, approved by voters, that repealed the nonpartisan redistricting plan. 
Next year, voters will weigh in on an amendment passed by the legislature putting the state’s abortion ban back in place. The paid sick leave expansion was not a constitutional amendment, allowing lawmakers to repeal it without a new statewide vote. 
“I don’t understand the legislature’s strategy at all,” said Sean Nicholson, a progressive strategist who has worked on numerous initiative petition campaigns in Missouri. “A very pro-Trump electorate spoke very clearly on abortion rights and paid sick leave in November. And now we head into a midterm, and we’ve seen in Missouri and other states that shenanigans from politicians become part of the story. The legislature has given voters plenty of motivation to double down on what they’ve already said.”
Missouri Republicans shut down Senate debate to pass abortion ban, repeal sick leave law

Republicans, who held legislative super majorities as these progressive ballot measures have been approved by voters, have long complained that out-of-state money from anonymous sources have largely fueled these initiative petition campaigns. 
They’ve vowed for years to make it harder to change the constitution through the initiative petition process, but the push always fizzled amidst GOP infighting or other legislative priorities. 
The threat of an initiative petition that would weaken the legislature’s hand in the process has reignited calls for Republicans to take action quickly. The Missouri Freedom Caucus, a group of right-wing legislators who regularly quarrel with GOP leadership, is calling on Gov. Mike Kehoe to convene a special legislative session to change the initiative petition process. 
“Missouri’s Constitution should not be up for sale to the highest left-wing bidder,” the group said in a statement last week. “Without immediate reform, left-wing activists will continue to use this loophole to force their unpopular agenda on Missouri citizens with a mere 51% of the vote.”
Whether Missourians will get another chance to vote on paid sick leave is still up in the air. 
Missouri’s law allowed employees to earn one hour of paid sick time for every 30 hours worked, starting May 1. By the time it’s officially repealed, 17 weeks will have elapsed. That means someone working 40 hours a week could have earned 22 hours of paid sick leave.
If workers don’t use their paid sick leave before Aug. 28, there’s no legal guarantee they can do so afterward.
The sick leave expansion was a “job killer,” said Kara Corches, president and CEO of the Missouri Chamber of Commerce and Industry, adding that “one-size-fits-all mandates threaten growth.”
Richard Von Glahn, policy director of Missouri Jobs with Justice, which advocated for the paid sick leave ballot measure, noted 58% of voters approved the proposal. It was also upheld unanimously by the Missouri Supreme Court. 
“Now workers may again face the reality of having no paid sick time to take care of their families without losing out on a check,” Von Glahn said shortly after the governor signed the paid sick leave repeal earlier this month. “This move by the Missouri legislature sets a dangerous precedent for democratic processes in our state.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/GettyImages-618211822-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-28 07:57:23.627213

But there’s a catch,Feleecia Guillen,,,,,https://missouriindependent.com/2025/07/28/more-americans-can-get-compensated-for-nuclear-poisoning-but-theres-a-catch/,"This July marked 80 years since the U.S. government detonated the first atomic bomb in the desert of southern New Mexico, marking the start of the nuclear age — and an ongoing nightmare for the people who call the area home.

Thousands of tons of nuclear waste from the Manhattan Project were dumped there in the 1970s (Theo Welling/Riverfront Times).This July marked 80 years since the U.S. government detonated the first atomic bomb in the desert of southern New Mexico, marking the start of the nuclear age — and an ongoing nightmare for the people who call the area home.
That test, known as Trinity, blanketed rural communities in radioactive fallout. No one was warned. No one was evacuated. Families drank radioactive rainwater, breathed in ash, and were left to carry the burden in silence.
Now, for the first time in history, those communities will finally be acknowledged.
Earlier versions of the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA), originally passed in 1990, offered compensation to “downwinders” impacted by nuclear testing in Nevada and to others who’d worked as uranium miners before 1971. But New Mexicans and other long suffering communities were left out.
But now that law, which expired last year, has been renewed and expanded to include New Mexico’s Trinity downwinders, post-1971 uranium mine workers, and other affected communities in Missouri, Tennessee, Alaska, Kentucky, and beyond.
But this long-overdue justice comes with a gut punch: the RECA expansion is buried inside Trump’s so-called “Big Beautiful Bill,” the GOP budget that slashes Medicaid, SNAP, and rural health care — lifelines for the very people this bill claims to protect — to finance tax cuts for the wealthy.
This is not justice.
I come from generations of Nuevomexicanos who’ve lived and worked on these lands for decades. Both of my grandparents have battled cancer. And while we may never get a clear answer, we can’t help but wonder if it was because of exposure to the radioactive legacy that’s haunted New Mexico for generations.
These aren’t isolated stories. They’re echoed across our pueblos, acequias, and towns. From the Navajo Nation, where uranium miners were sent underground without protection, to the 1979 Church Rock disaster — the worst nuclear spill in U.S. history — our communities have borne the brunt of nuclear colonialism while being erased from the story.
When RECA was passed in 1990, it excluded us. Even as cancers and birth defects multiplied, even as we buried our elders and our children, we were told our suffering didn’t count. When the program expired in 2024, it slammed the door shut on new claims.
Now, with a revival of RECA on the table, it’s a historic moment. But the same bill that expands RECA also threatens to strip millions of people of their basic health care.
I crunched the numbers in a new fact sheet for the Institute for Policy Studies.
In the 16 RECA-eligible states alone, I found that this bill will rip health insurance away from over 3.9 million people — including 103,719 in New Mexico, the very state whose residents were sacrificed to build the U.S. nuclear empire.
The total figure includes over 1.4 million people losing Medicaid coverage and another 2.5 million losing Affordable Care Act coverage. On top of that, a total of 240 rural hospitals in these states are considered at risk of closing.
These are not just numbers — they are lives. Aging uranium miners. Downwinders living in remote, medically underserved areas. Elders in rural towns who have no alternative when their hospital closes.
This bill gives with one hand and takes away with the other. That’s not justice — it’s policy murder.
I welcome the long-overdue recognition of downwinders from New Mexico and other impacted communities in RECA. But what does that mean if those same people are losing access to health care? Many rely on Medicaid and rural hospitals. If those lifelines vanish, how will they get diagnosed, let alone treated?
Even this “win” is short-lived: RECA would only be extended until the end of 2028, far too little time to reach, enroll, and support impacted communities.
Justice must come with real care. We shouldn’t have to trade one harm for another. We deserve compensation without compromise. RECA should be expanded for longer — without compromising Medicaid or rural health care.
We demand justice without sacrifice.

Shelia Stubbs for her efforts calling attention to the violence Black women and girls face. (Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)For the third session in a row, State Rep. Shelia Stubbs (D-Madison) is calling on Wisconsin lawmakers to create a task force to examine the violence African American women and girls face and develop policy solutions to prevent others from going missing and being murdered.
The bill would establish a 17-member task force to produce a report on the issue. Members would include two Senators, two Assembly representatives and other stakeholders, along with law enforcement representatives and representatives from advocacy or legal organizations, including those that focus on Black women and girls. 
“This is my third time to try and get a critical piece of legislation passed into law,” Stubbs said at a press conference Friday. 
Stubbs, inspired by a similar task force in Minnesota and one focused on Indigenous women in Wisconsin, first introduced the proposal during the 2021-2023 legislative session, but it failed to gain traction. The second iteration of the bill, during the 2023-25 session, passed the Assembly but stalled in the Senate as former Sen. Duey Stroebel initially refused to allow the bill to move forward. It eventually received a public hearing and was approved by a committee but never advanced to a vote on the Senate floor. 
“Can anyone tell me why this critical legislation could not get scheduled? Can you tell these families why their loved one was not important enough to at least get a hearing?” Stubbs asked at the press conference. “It is not fair to these victims and their families that they have to continue to wait for this Legislature to do something.” 
Stubbs said Wisconsin has the “worst disparity in the nation” when it comes to Black women and girls being killed. A 2022 investigation by the Guardian found five Black women and girls were killed each day in the U.S. in 2020. Wisconsin was the worst in the country, with the rate doubling that year. 
Coauthors on the new bill include Rep. Pat Snyder (R-Weston), Sen. Jesse James (R-Thorp) and LaTonya Johnson (D-Milwaukee). 
“I’m demanding that we get an answer,” Stubbs said. “I am demanding that we get justice. How many more victims do we need in this state before we do something?”
Stubbs was joined at the press conference by Sheena Scarborough, mother of 19-year-old Sade Robinson, who was murdered last year.
“The things that we have gone through as a family,” Scarborough said. “They stand behind me knowing exactly what it’s like being a victim of a severe traumatic crime in the worst possible way… We are still dealing with ongoing trauma daily.” 
A jury found Maxwell Anderson guilty last month of murdering and dismembering Robinson, who had gone on a first date with him in 2024. Anderson’s sentencing is this week. 
Scarborough said there wasn’t enough support as she dealt with law enforcement and navigated the criminal justice system for the first time following her daughter’s murder. The lack of support  pushed her to start the Sade’s Voice Foundation, she said. The nonprofit was formed to advocate and provide  support for the families of missing Black women and girls.
“There weren’t many other supports through this time…. It doesn’t matter if you are Republican or Democrat. These are our babies. This was my daughter. She was a granddaughter. She was a sister. She had her whole life ahead of her,” Scarborough said. “The task force is definitely needed.”
The task force would examine several related issues. They include systemic causes of the violence Black women and girls experience, the appropriate methods for tracking and collecting data on violence against Black women and girls, government practices including policing related to investigating and prosecuting crimes against Black women and girls, measures that could reduce violence against them and ways to support victims and their families.
The final report, which would be due by 2027, would need to recommend policies and practices that would be effective in reducing gender violence and increasing the safety of Black women and girls and help victims and communities to heal from violence.
Angela Arrington, the social action coordinator for Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc., said that  the task force could help address the persistent violence that Black women and girls face. 
“They are more likely to experience homicide, sexual assault and other forms of violence than their white counterparts, and these cases often go unsolved or receive less attention,” Arrington said. “The epidemic of violence is a complex issue with deep-rooted historical and systemic causes requiring comprehensive and coordinated action to address.” 
Attorney General Josh Kaul said lawmakers are needed to establish a task force and that a state investment must be included.
Kaul and Gov. Tony Evers included creating a task force in their budget proposals, but the Republican-led Joint Finance Committee did not include it in the final proposal. 
“People are ready to step up,” Kaul said. “The problem now is not whether there is interest among folks in collaborating and working to identify solutions. What we need is legislative will. We need the legislators and the Senate and the Assembly to pass legislation that will help ensure we have this task force… It’s clear that there is a need not just for action, but for there to be an investment so that we can seriously consider these issues.” 
He alluded to the new budget approved earlier this month that was celebrated as a bipartisan compromise by legislative leaders and Gov. Tony Evers.
“The Legislature was so close to passing legislation that would help us move forward on this issue, but we’ve seen there’s an opportunity for some compromise in this legislative session,” Kaul said. 
The bill includes one position supported with state funding of $80,200 in 2025-26 and $99,500 in 2026-27. 
Kaul said the additional Department of Justice employee would be essential to coordinate the work of the task force, including gathering data that may be needed. 
A similar task force focused on Indigenous women and girls was formed in 2020 by Kaul after legislation failed. Kaul started that task force without state funding by using federal funding from the Violence Against Women Act. He said at the press conference that the agency doesn’t have funding  for a similar pathway for the proposed new task force. 
The 2023 version of the bill did not include funding when it passed the Assembly. 
“This is a really significant issue that takes the investment of time and resources, and I don’t want to see a group come together without having the resources they need to be successful,” Kaul told reporters. “I want to see this done properly and right and that’s what this bill would do.”

(Photo via U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement)Despite Trump administration rhetoric accusing Democrats of protecting violent criminals and drug-dealing immigrants, the administration’s arrests have been catching a smaller share of criminals overall, and a smaller share of people convicted of violent and drug crimes, than the Biden administration did in the same time frame.
While the Trump administration has caught more immigrants with convictions for drugs and violence, their share of the rising arrest numbers is smaller, as more people get swept up for minor traffic violations or strictly immigration crimes, according to a Stateline analysis.
Forty percent of the nearly 112,000 arrests by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) from Jan. 20 through late June were of convicted criminals. That’s compared with 53% of the nearly 51,000 arrests for same time period in 2024 under the Biden administration.



The share of people convicted of violent crime fell from 10% to 7% and drug crimes from 9% to 5%, according to a Stateline analysis of data from the Deportation Data Project.
The project, led by attorneys and professors in California, Maryland and New York, collects and posts public, anonymized U.S. government immigration enforcement datasets obtained through Freedom of Information Act requests.
Some Democratic states are among those with the highest share of violent criminals in this year’s ICE arrests: Hawaii (15%), Vermont (13%), and California and Nebraska (12%) — while some of the lowest shares were in more Republican states: Maine (2%), and Alabama, Montana and Wyoming (3%).
Immigration attorneys see an increased push to arrest and detain immigrants for any type of violation or pending charge as President Donald Trump pushes for higher arrest and detention numbers to meet his campaign promise for mass deportation. Trump officials have called for 3,000 arrests a day, far more than the current average of 711 as of June and 321 a day during the same time period under Biden.










The majority of recent ICE detentions involve people with no convictions. That’s a pattern I find troubling.


– Oregon Republican state Rep. Cyrus Javadi


Arrests have accelerated since about mid-May, when government attorneys began asking to revoke bail and arrest people who show up for court hearings after being released at the border, said Vanessa Dojaquez-Torres, practice and policy counsel for the American Immigration Lawyers Association, which represents more than 16,000 immigration attorneys.
“We’re not completely sure what the reasoning or the goal is behind some of these policies, other than they want detention numbers up,” Dojaquez-Torres said.
“They seem to have really been struggling to get their deportation numbers up, and so I think that’s one of the reasons why we see a lot of these policies going into effect that are meant to kind of circumvent the immigration court process and due process.”
Arrests of people convicted of violent crimes increased by 45% from about 5,300 to 7,700 compared with last year. For drug crimes, the increase was 21% — and they fell as a share of total arrests, from 9% under the Biden administration to 5% this year.
Arrests for those not convicted of any crime nearly tripled to about 67,000, and increased from 47% to 60% of arrests.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security defended ICE arrests Wednesday. Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that the agency was “targeting dangerous criminal illegal aliens and taking them off American streets. Violent thugs ICE arrested include child pedophiles, drug traffickers, and burglars.”
In Oregon, arrests during the first part of last year increased from 51 under the Biden administration to 227 under the Trump administration, with those not convicted of any crime increasing from 34 to 137. Those with convictions for violent crime increased from 3 to 16. Even some Republicans are concerned with the new emphasis on non-criminals.
“The majority of recent ICE detentions involve people with no convictions. That’s a pattern I find troubling, especially when it risks sweeping up people for things like expired tags or missed court dates,” said Oregon state Rep. Cyrus Javadi, a moderate Republican representing Tillamook and Clatsop counties.
Nationally, nonviolent crimes have risen as a share of immigration arrests. The most common crime conviction for those arrested this year is driving while intoxicated, which was also the top offense last year under Biden.
But this year it’s closely followed by general traffic offenses, which rose to second place from sixth place, surpassing such crimes as assault and drug trafficking.
Traffic offenses, outside of driving while intoxicated and hit and run, rose almost fourfold as the most serious conviction on record for those arrested, the largest increase in the top 10. Those offenses were followed by increases in the immigration crime of illegal entry, meaning crossing the border in secret, which tripled.
The increase in traffic violations as a source of immigration arrests is a reason for cities to consider limiting traffic stops, said Daniela Gilbert, director of the Redefining Public Safety Initiative at the Vera Institute of Justice, a nonprofit devoted to ending mass incarceration.
“It’s an important point to consider intervening in so that there can be less interaction, and so ICE has less opportunity to continue its indiscriminate dragnet of enforcement,” Gilbert said.
The institute argues in general that traffic stops should be limited to safety issues rather than low-level infractions such as expired registrations or single burned-out taillights, both because they do not improve public safety and because they disproportionately affect drivers of color.
Such policies limiting stops under some conditions are in place in 10 states and in cities in six other states, according to the institute.
The most recent state polices took effect last year in California and Illinois, while a policy is set to take effect in October in Connecticut. The most recent city policies were in Denver and in East Lansing and Ypsilanti, Michigan. Six other states have considered legislation recently.

The Senate and the House calendars call for them to be in recess between Aug. 4 and Sept. 1 – adequate time for at least one or two town hall meetings. Each member of our delegation – Sens. Steve Daines and Tim Sheehy and Reps. Troy Downing and Ryan Zinke – has a section of their official websites for scheduling requests. And each has local offices around the state one can visit or call for information. 
Good places to start. 
With House Speaker Mike Johnson shutting down that chamber a week early, we might expect Downing and Zinke to have even more time back home. 
But there are obstacles. Congressmen are under orders from Republican leadership not to hold in-person town hall meetings with their constituents. Our team has been avoiding them like the plague.
Call-in imitations of town hall meetings are now the standard where questions are screened and controlled in advance with no opportunity for follow-up. But not that they are plentiful. Downing, for example, has been able to spare three entire hours since taking his seat in January to speak at his constituents en masse.
Daines and Sheehy boast they are proud to meet with constituents one-on-one — thousands of them, they say. But how do ordinary Montanans figure out how to meet up with them? A chance encounter at a fund-raiser? 
All four of them are frequent guests of Fox television talk-show hosts, especially Laura Ingraham and Larry Kudlow on Fox Business. We might ask, what do those people have that the people who put our quartet into office don’t have? 
There is much to discuss, beyond question. 
I can understand the fear apparently being felt by the delegation, even by the three men who are so proud of their warrior status as SEALS and in combat search-and-rescue, and the fourth member who honed his skills with 28 years of private-sector business experience. 
But guys – give us a chance, would you? 
No member of our delegation provides their schedules publicly. Montana congressmen used to, you know, both Republicans and Democrats. Restricting schedule information began when Greg Gianforte and Daines sequentially held the single House seat, according to a long-time state political observer.
It is reasonable that during the recess each member will want to spend private family time, and have some commitments and fund-raisers already scheduled – the latter particularly for Daines and Downing who have started their 2026 reelection campaigns.
However, it is also reasonable to assume each one would have time available to accept an invitation to speak with a citizen group, even perhaps outside of their own perceived comfort zone. 
If our congressmen deem their constituents as deserving of interacting directly with them, it is important we commit ourselves to respectful and orderly events.
For the sake of our collective civic health in Montana, we cannot go on with the intolerable situation of our congressional representatives stiff-arming our requests to meet face-to-face with them. Somebody must blink – if our four representatives will not change their practices, then it is up to we citizens to make the effort to try to forge a better way forward for all of us.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/trump-sheehy-31-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-28 06:56:52.622386

Liz Brown, R-Fort Wayne, speaks against legislation making Indiana school boards partisan on Thursday, April 24, 2025. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Liz Brown has been called a lot of things. But liberal is a new one.
“I would say that might not be the name anyone that’s ever known me would pick for me. You could say outspoken, maybe loud occasionally … very passionate and strong about what I believe is right. But no, I don’t think I’ve ever been accused of being a liberal. That’s a stretch,” she told the Indiana Capital Chronicle.
Texts accusing “Liberal Liz” Brown of betraying her conservative values on the Second Amendment and transgender issues have been flying in northeast Indiana— funded by a dark-money “social welfare” nonprofit that no one knows about or isn’t willing to divulge.

Brown — a staunch pro-lifer — has been a fixture in the Senate Republican caucus since 2014. But now high-profile GOP Hoosiers like U.S. Sen. Jim Banks and Attorney General Todd Rokita have put her in the crosshairs for 2026.
And they appear to have found their man — former Allen County councilman and current Northwest Allen County Schools board member Darren Vogt, according to several Allen County sources.
Brown has known Vogt for more than 20 years. She defeated him in the 2014 primary for her current seat. Since then, he has supported Brown — hosting a fundraiser, endorsing her in a congressional run and even inviting her to his son’s wedding.
“It’s rather sudden,” she said.
Brown hasn’t had a primary since her 2014 run.
Vogt declined to talk to the Indiana Capital Chronicle, saying only “I’m strongly considering and will be making an announcement soon.”
Immigration
The focus started when Rokita called out Brown for not hearing a stringent immigration bill during the legislative session. As the chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, she has the power to choose which bills get heard. Ultimately, the legislation died.
On June 3, Rokita posted on X that Brown ignored “repeated warnings that sheriffs needed stronger statutory direction on their obligations to detain illegal aliens. She refused to hear (House Bill) 1531 and deprived her colleagues of the chance to do their jobs and vote on common sense immigration legislation.”
Brown, who is also an attorney, ultimately filed a disciplinary action against Rokita.
Banks – who Brown challenged for his old congressional seat in 2016 — replied, “Liz should be primaried.”

Brown told the Indiana Capital Chronicle that law enforcement came to her with concerns on that bill, which would have required them to honor immigration detainer requests. Detainers are not backed by a judicial finding like a warrant.
She supported a separate immigration bill that did become law.
Brown said the Rokita immigration bill had a lot of problems that weren’t fixable.
“I think what people need to understand is some of these issues are federal issues, and I would turn to anyone who is representing us at the federal level to say, ‘hey, why haven’t you fixed this problem?’
“I think it’s fair for local sheriffs and local law enforcement to say, ‘We will be happy to assist you,’ which they’ve been doing 100%, and I fully support, but you need to make sure the procedures are being followed so we know how we can back you up.”
Some think Vogt has a good chance at winning, despite the support she will likely have from the Senate Majority Campaign Committee and their coffers.
Brandon Seifert — a Huntertown councilman — said Brown has been around “Indianapolis liberals” for too long.
He noted she is still extremely conservative on the issue of life and abortion.
“But the other core conservative issues … she’s just lost her way. She has completely lost her way.”
He recently shared several text ads on his Facebook page questioning the immigration decision as well as two previous votes by Brown in recent years. They are paid for by Hoosier Leadership for America — a nonprofit that was established in 2024.
The group has a Huntertown P.O. Box. The incorporator is a man out of Virginia that the ICC could not locate.
Seifert said he is not behind the group and doesn’t know who is. But he said their points are valid.
He is disappointed that Brown is no longer the attack dog of the Republican Party that she used to be. He has supported her in the past and she is his senator.
“It’s gonna be a heck of a race. I’ve given my support to Darren 100% and am fully behind him, because we need a change, and he’s the one to be that change.”
Other issues
One of the ads takes Brown to task for her role in hearing a constitutional carry bill in 2021. She declined to give the legislation a hearing and instead the Senate removed permit fees.

Brown also voted against a bill to ban transgender Hoosiers from high school sports in 2022. She did support a college ban this year.
Browns’s conservative credentials have dipped recently, according to two GOP rankings.
The Conservative Political Action Conference issues annual rankings of lawmakers. In 2019, Brown’s score was 85% and has since dropped to 61% in 2023.
GOP-aligned Americans for Prosperity also issues scorecards. Her ranking in 2022 was 100 and dropped to 86 and 78 in the next two years.
Donors behind the Hoosier Leadership for America nonprofit are shielded under law — but if it were organized as a political action committee, they would be public.
The Internal Revenue Service says on its site that “The promotion of social welfare does not include direct or indirect participation or intervention in political campaigns on behalf of or in opposition to any candidate for public office. However, a section 501(c)(4) social welfare organization may engage in some political activities, so long as that is not its primary activity.”
But Marjorie Hershey, professor emeritus of political science at Indiana University, said there is no enforcement against these dark money groups. That means they can hide donor identities who might want to avoid the scrutiny of supporting a candidate or issue.
And she noted the U.S. Supreme Court has erred on the side of free speech, likening spending on campaigns as speech.
“All of this has been just a steady weakening of the original purpose of this stuff,” she said. “Because, you know, as they say, money will find a way.”
As for Brown, she is ready for a fight.
“I’m committed to running again. I have been a strong advocate for northeast Indiana and the conservative values of our district up here,” she said.

This story was originally reported by Barbara Rodriguez of The 19th.  Meet Barbara and read more of their reporting on gender, politics and policy.
A growing number of Americans — more than 63 million, or nearly 1 in 4 — have served as a family caregiver for a loved one in the past year. The figure is a jump of 20 million Americans compared to a decade ago, according to findings released Thursday by AARP and the National Alliance for Caregiving (NAC).
The surge is due to a confluence of factors, including Americans living longer but in some instances, in poorer health. That is requiring more people to engage in the work of family caregiving. There is also a growing recognition of who is a family caregiver — or a person providing care to an adult or child with a complex medical condition or disability, often without pay.
The report finds that these caregivers are managing financial risks, their own poor health and isolation. As in a previous iteration of the survey, roughly 60 percent of family caregivers are women. Women, LGBTQ+ caregivers, and those who felt they had no choice in becoming caregivers are significantly more likely to report feeling alone.
“We need systems that see caregivers, value them and support them — because they are not just helping families, they are holding up our entire health care system,” said Dr. Myechia Minter-Jordan, CEO of AARP. “This impacts all of us because most of us will be a caregiver or need one at some point in our lives. And too often, people don’t realize that they are a caregiver until they’re already overwhelmed and unsupported.”
Nearly half of caregivers say they face major financial consequences because of their growing responsibilities. They’re draining savings, falling into debt or struggling to afford basic needs like food and housing. One in 5 report that their own health is fair or poor.
The “Caregiving in the U.S. 2025” report, which surveyed nearly 7,000 caregivers nationwide, also finds nearly 1 in 3 family caregivers are part of the “sandwich generation” of caregivers who raise children while simultaneously caring for adults in their lives.
“This dual responsibility is a recipe for burnout and requires solutions that recognize caregiving happens across the lifespan,” said Jason Resendez, CEO of NAC. “It’s time to recognize and value this continuum of care that we all experience and benefit from, and the responsibilities themselves are becoming more complex and more intensive.”
During a media call Thursday, AARP and NAC shared the story of Alma Valencia, a woman from Pasadena, California, who has cared for her mother for the past 10 years. Valencia’s mother has dementia. Valencia said she eventually left her career to become her mother’s full-time caregiver. That meant losing a stable salary and benefits, and isolation.
“Like so many others, I didn’t plan for this,” she said. “I stepped into the role because someone I love needed me.”
The report shows 65 percent of family caregivers now help with at least one activity of daily living, including intimate tasks like bathing, dressing and feeding. Over half say they’re performing complex medical and nursing tasks that once primarily took place in clinics and hospitals, including administering injections and managing medical equipment. But only 11 percent of family caregivers say they’ve received training for basic caregiving tasks — and just 22 percent get any training for complex medical and nursing tasks.
Both AARP and the National Alliance for Caregiving are calling for federal policies that include national paid family and medical leave, a federal tax credit to bring relief to out-of-pocket costs and greater access to respite care, training and support services, as well as stronger workplace protections that recognize caregiving responsibilities.
These organizations have been advocating for these policies in joint reports for years, but now they come amid a changing federal landscape. President Donald Trump this month signed a tax and budget law that is estimated to cut federal Medicaid spending by more than $900 billion over 10 years. Nearly eight million family caregivers rely on Medicaid for their own health care coverage, according to Resendez.
Resendez said advocates are seeing progress at the state level, with several establishing paid family leave policies or advancing caregiver tax credits and long-term care insurance programs.
“This is an issue that continues to build strength and visibility, and this report helps to put numbers behind the urgency for that continuing, and for translating that into solid action,” he said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/long-term-care-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-28 06:56:52.622386

(File photo courtesy of Tracy Brooks/U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service)As Idaho changes to a totally new method for counting wolves, officials with the Idaho Department of Fish and Game have increased the state’s 2023 wolf population estimate they reported publicly last year.
Officials increased the 2023 wolf population estimate by 85 wolves, an increase of about 7%, state officials confirmed.
The change comes as Idaho is seeking to reduce the number of wolves in the state and as some outside researchers have stressed the importance of an accurate wolf count.
During the July 2024 Idaho Fish and Game Commission meeting, state officials estimated Idaho’s 2023 wolf population at 1,150 wolves as of Aug. 1.
Ghost wolves: As Idaho aims to reduce its wolf population, advocates worry counts aren’t accurate

But during an interview Wednesday at the Idaho Department of Fish and Game’s Boise headquarters, Wildlife Bureau Chief Shane Roberts and Wildlife Research Manager Matt Mumma told the Idaho Capital Sun officials are no longer using the 1,150 estimate.
Instead, they have increased the Aug. 1, 2023 wolf population estimate to 1,235 wolves.
The change was made after Idaho Department of Fish and Game officials added four additional measurements to the new method the state uses to estimate the wolf population, Roberts and Mumma said. 
“The new estimates are better and more accurate than the other ones, which were likely slightly off,” Mumma said Thursday. 
“Through simulation, we determined that the addition of these metrics improved the accuracy of the model,” Mumma added.
Jeff Abrams, a wildlife program associate for the Idaho Conservation League, said the state should be as precise and transparent as possible in its wolf estimates and use conservative figures for the number of nonbreeding wolves and the amount of lone wolves used in statistical models.
“Generally, we believe they should be more conservative – based on research previously cited in (the department’s) own wolf management plan,” Abrams said. “We believe folks should take a closer look at fundamental assumptions the agency is feeding into their new model.”

Roberts said the state’s new model for estimating wolves uses a wide range of options and does not rely on static assumptions. 
Even with the revision, Mumma said the state’s numbers are still well within a 95% credible interval and Roberts said the larger overall population trends reported since 2019 have not changed. 
“The overall trend since 2019 is down, but in the last three years of estimates, it’s fairly stable,” Roberts said.
Idaho Department of Fish and Game officials provided the revised 2023 wolf population estimate after the Idaho Capital Sun requested follow up information about changes to the new wolf population estimation method on July 18.
Officials estimate the wolf population in Idaho because wolves are too elusive and Idaho is too rugged and remote for the state officials to physically count every wolf.
Overall, the state says the wolf population is on a downward trend from 2019-2020, when more than 1,600 wolves were estimated. Last year, Idaho’s wolf population decreased by almost 100 wolves from 2023 to 2024, state officials said earlier this month. 
 Idaho officials also recently changed date they report the wolf population estimates

The change in metrics is part of a much larger overhaul of how Idaho counts its wolf population. From 2019 to 2023, the state used trail cameras to estimate Idaho’s wolf population. 
Then in July 2024, Roberts announced the state switched to a new method that uses age and genetic data taken from a tooth from every dead wolf checked by the Idaho Department of Fish and Game each year. State officials call the new method the ABC method, short for Approximate Bayesian Computation. 
After switching from trail cams to age and genetic data from teeth, the state also switched when it reported Idaho’s wolf population estimates. 

For years, Idaho reported its wolf population as of Aug. 1.
But last week when Idaho Department of Fish and Game officials presented the 2024 wolf population estimate, they switched the reporting date to May, the Sun previously reported. 
The change makes a difference because of wolf population dynamics. The new May numbers are likely to show higher wolf populations than the previous August estimates. 
For example, the state’s ABC method estimated the 2024 wolf population higher in May, at 1,235, but lower in August, when it was projected to be 1,140, according to data provided by the Idaho Department of Fish and Game.
The new May estimate sets the state’s wolf official population estimate at its highest point in the year, right after when the new pups are born in the spring. Throughout the rest of the year, the wolf population declines as wolves are killed by hunters and die of natural causes until the population reaches a low point in the spring just before new pups are born. That means a population estimate tied to May — when the state’s new wolf population data is reported — would always be expected to be higher than a population estimate tied to August, which was when the state’s previous estimate was based on.
Roberts said he understands moving the date from August to May may cause some confusion, but he said state officials moved the date to May because they believe the new ABC method is most accurate right after pups are born because one of the factors the ABC model estimates is new litters. 
On the other hand, Roberts said the state believed the old Aug. 1 date was the most accurate date to use for trail cams because state officials actually deployed the cameras during the months of July and August. 
Moving forward, Idaho Department of Fish and Game officials submitted their new ABC method for consideration for publication in a peer-reviewed journal. Roberts told the Sun Idaho that the Idaho Department of Fish and Game plans to consistently use the May numbers going forward.
 Idaho seeks to reduce the wolf state’s wolf population

These changes to how Idaho counts its wolves are happening as Idaho is in the middle of a six-year plan to reduce the state’s wolf population by more than 60%. The 2023-2028 Idaho Gray Wolf Management Plan calls for reducing Idaho’s wolf population down to an average of about 500 wolves, with a low of about 350 wolves, driven largely by human hunting of wolves.

Some outside researchers have questioned the state’s previous trail cam wolf population methods and told the Idaho Capital Sun the accuracy of Idaho’s wolf population is extremely important as Idaho reduces its wolf population. 
Abrams, a wildlife program associate with Idaho Conservation League, said Thursday he supports the Idaho Department of Fish and Game, which is commonly referred to as IDFG, switching away from trail cameras and trying to improve the way the state estimates wolf populations.
Idaho Department of Fish and Game estimates Idaho’s wolf population decreased to 1,235

“It’s helpful that IDFG wants to improve the way they estimate wolf abundance,” Abrams said. “This is something (the Idaho Conservation League) and many others have encouraged the agency to do in the past. Idahoans want wolves to be managed responsibly and not have populations jeopardized. It benefits everyone to have accurate estimates of how many wolves we have. It’s important that the public has trust in this process.”
Abrams said he is happy the state is submitting its new ABC method to a peer-reviewed journal. But Abrams said the state should be as precise and transparent as it can be in how it estimates the wolf population. 
“However, we do still have some questions on basic assumptions used in the new model about pack size,” Abrams said. 
Abrams also called for the Idaho Department of FIsh and Game to resume publishing wolf reports every year that include detailed data about wolf population characteristics, harvest and hunting data, livestock depredation and more. Abrams said he hasn’t seen the state release a detailed annual wolf report of this kind since the 2016 Idaho Wolf Management Report.
“The department could make another improvement by getting back to publishing an annual wolf report, so the public understands how close IDFG may be getting toward their management target,” Abrams said. “They haven’t done this in almost 10 years.”
Abrams said he is concerned about how close the state could be getting each year to its wolf population management goal and he wonders what the mid-winter population low-points are for wolves. Abrams said the new May population estimate the state releases doesn’t provide that information to the public because the May estimate reports Idaho’s wolf population at its highest point each year, right after pups are born in the spring. 
“The (Idaho Fish and Game) Commission itself also said just last year, the agency needs to be careful about overshooting their management goal,” Abrams said. 
Roberts said the reason the Idaho Department of Fish and Game switched to the new ABC method is because they want to be as accurate as possible and realized the old trail cam method would be less accurate as the number of wolves decreased.
“Part of the reason, as we mentioned in last year’s presentation, that we switched methods to the ABC is because our own research suggested that the camera method was going to become less reliable as we were able to get fewer pictures of wolves,” Roberts said. “So that was a big impetus for the switch.”

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)Ryan Walters and his merry band of administrative leaders should not be operating the State Department of Education like their own private fiefdom, oblivious to the laws that govern public access.
Yet our state superintendent and those leaders he’s entrusted to serve us appear to be happily doing just that in denying access to one of the most basic records that’s long been released through our state’s Open Records Act — resignation letters.
And Attorney General Gentner Drummond’s office, which is supposed to help enforce open records laws, has strangely — and inexplicably — been sitting on the sidelines like a stupified observer as this continues to play out.
Walters has seen a number of senior employees exit stage left for greener pastures. He also leads an agency whose administrators have proven that they’re not the strongest champions of laws that govern public access. After all, they lost a lawsuit that accused agency leaders of violating First Amendment rights related to public meeting access and face another that contends the Education Department is not complying with the Open Records Act.
The latest dustup involves a request Oklahoma Voice filed earlier this year seeking access to all employee resignation letters submitted since Jan. 1. The agency issued a blanket denial, citing a provision of law that it claims bars the release to protect employee privacy and one that allows public bodies to keep documents private if they pertain to an internal personnel investigation.
As far as we can tell, there’s no indication that any of these employees are subject to any investigation, and for any state agency to inaccurately cite a provision of law inferring such would be reckless and potentially damaging to someone’s reputation. One would also hope that there weren’t personnel investigations into multiple high-level employees because that would indicate Walters’ is making really bad hires.
Normally resignation letters are as dry as parched earth, and pretty much every other state agency I can think of typically releases them without issue. Even the State Department of Education used to do so without batting an eye. 
I’ve never seen a blanket denial like this.
That’s why it’s so odd that the Department of Education has chosen this hill to die on, and that Drummond’s office, which lawmakers have empowered to help the public fight for open records access, has sat idly by, seemingly wringing its hands.
A recently leaked scathing resignation letter may shine some light on why the Education Department is so reluctant to release them. 
The Education Department’s former chief compliance officer wrote in her resignation letter that the agency has “fundamental operational issues” and “senior leadership attitudes” that will need to be addressed in order to “achieve the outcomes that Oklahoma students deserve.”
She also leveled accusations of “manipulation of school accreditation and deleting employee review processes,” but did not include specifics.
In short, the letter portrays a very unflattering portrait of the inner workings of an agency that receives over $3.8 billion in annual state appropriations and raises questions about its operational integrity. 
That’s something the public deserves to know. And it’s why the access to resignation letters should be an undisputed right.
Our state is one that believes — or at least used to — that “people are vested with the inherent right to know and be fully informed about their government.” And that access to government records helps Oklahomans “efficiently and intelligently exercise their inherent political power.”
That’s straight from the state’s Open Records Act. It’s also why Oklahoma agencies have done the right thing and provided resignation letters without argument, particularly for high-ranking officials.
It boggles the mind that the Attorney General’s Office, which is supposed to have a public records ombudsman to fight for public access, has refused to intervene in this issue and insist upon their release. It’s even stranger because last year, Drummond took a swipe at Walters following what he called an “alarming number of complaints” of his agency’s poor compliance with the state’s records act and sent a sign he wasn’t going to stand for it.
But ahead of the publication of our story highlighting our records battle, the Attorney General’s Office and its “public access counselor” refused to comment or address our complaint because of a pending lawsuit involving a single resignation letter. 
I could see not releasing a single letter that’s subject to litigation, but to allow an agency to issue a blanket denial to withhold all undisputed ones is nuts. There seems to be no reason Drummond couldn’t have advocated to release the rest.
Unless, that is, his office wants to keep our government shrouded in secrecy or he doesn’t believe the public should view resignation letters written by public employees.
The fight over resignation letters at the state Department of Education proves why lawmakers need to further strengthen public access laws, not water them down. If there’s any lingering doubt that these are public, maybe they need to spell it out. 
This also highlights how critical strong advocacy from the Attorney General’s Office is in this realm.
Because it’s never a good idea to give a government bureaucrat absolute power to determine if the public is entitled to records. In the wrong hands that power can lead to unintended consequences, making government less accountable and accessible to the very people it is supposed to serve.

(Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)Despite Trump administration rhetoric accusing Democrats of protecting violent criminals and drug-dealing immigrants, the administration’s arrests have been catching a smaller share of criminals overall, and a smaller share of people convicted of violent and drug crimes, than the Biden administration did in the same time frame.
While the Trump administration has caught more immigrants with convictions for drugs and violence, their share of the rising arrest numbers is smaller, as more people get swept up for minor traffic violations or strictly immigration crimes, according to a Stateline analysis.
Forty percent of the nearly 112,000 arrests by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) from Jan. 20 through late June were of convicted criminals. That’s compared with 53% of the nearly 51,000 arrests for same time period in 2024 under the Biden administration.
The share of people convicted of violent crime fell from 10% to 7% and drug crimes from 9% to 5%, according to a Stateline analysis of data from the Deportation Data Project.
The project, led by attorneys and professors in California, Maryland and New York, collects and posts public, anonymized U.S. government immigration enforcement datasets obtained through Freedom of Information Act requests.
Some Democratic states are among those with the highest share of violent criminals in this year’s ICE arrests: Hawaii (15%), Vermont (13%), and California and Nebraska (12%) — while some of the lowest shares were in more Republican states: Maine (2%), and Alabama, Montana and Wyoming (3%).
Immigration attorneys see an increased push to arrest and detain immigrants for any type of violation or pending charge as President Donald Trump pushes for higher arrest and detention numbers to meet his campaign promise for mass deportation. Trump officials have called for 3,000 arrests a day, far more than the current average of 711 as of June and 321 a day during the same time period under Biden.
Arrests have accelerated since about mid-May, when government attorneys began asking to revoke bail and arrest people who show up for court hearings after being released at the border, said Vanessa Dojaquez-Torres, practice and policy counsel for the American Immigration Lawyers Association, which represents more than 16,000 immigration attorneys.
“We’re not completely sure what the reasoning or the goal is behind some of these policies, other than they want detention numbers up,” Dojaquez-Torres said.
“They seem to have really been struggling to get their deportation numbers up, and so I think that’s one of the reasons why we see a lot of these policies going into effect that are meant to kind of circumvent the immigration court process and due process.”
Arrests of people convicted of violent crimes increased by 45% from about 5,300 to 7,700 compared with last year. For drug crimes, the increase was 21% — and they fell as a share of total arrests, from 9% under the Biden administration to 5% this year.
Arrests for those not convicted of any crime nearly tripled to about 67,000, and increased from 47% to 60% of arrests.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security defended ICE arrests Wednesday. Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that the agency was “targeting dangerous criminal illegal aliens and taking them off American streets. Violent thugs ICE arrested include child pedophiles, drug traffickers, and burglars.”
In Oregon, arrests during the first part of last year increased from 51 under the Biden administration to 227 under the Trump administration, with those not convicted of any crime increasing from 34 to 137. Those with convictions for violent crime increased from 3 to 16. Even some Republicans are concerned with the new emphasis on non-criminals.
“The majority of recent ICE detentions involve people with no convictions. That’s a pattern I find troubling, especially when it risks sweeping up people for things like expired tags or missed court dates,” said Oregon state Rep. Cyrus Javadi, a moderate Republican representing Tillamook and Clatsop counties.
Nationally, nonviolent crimes have risen as a share of immigration arrests. The most common crime conviction for those arrested this year is driving while intoxicated, which was also the top offense last year under Biden.
But this year it’s closely followed by general traffic offenses, which rose to second place from sixth place, surpassing such crimes as assault and drug trafficking.
Traffic offenses, outside of driving while intoxicated and hit and run, rose almost fourfold as the most serious conviction on record for those arrested, the largest increase in the top 10. Those offenses were followed by increases in the immigration crime of illegal entry, meaning crossing the border in secret, which tripled.
The increase in traffic violations as a source of immigration arrests is a reason for cities to consider limiting traffic stops, said Daniela Gilbert, director of the Redefining Public Safety Initiative at the Vera Institute of Justice, a nonprofit devoted to ending mass incarceration.
“It’s an important point to consider intervening in so that there can be less interaction, and so ICE has less opportunity to continue its indiscriminate dragnet of enforcement,” Gilbert said.
The institute argues in general that traffic stops should be limited to safety issues rather than low-level infractions such as expired registrations or single burned-out taillights, both because they do not improve public safety and because they disproportionately affect drivers of color.
Such policies limiting stops under some conditions are in place in 10 states and in cities in six other states, according to the institute.
The most recent state polices took effect last year in California and Illinois, while a policy is set to take effect in October in Connecticut. The most recent city policies were in Denver and in East Lansing and Ypsilanti, Michigan. Six other states have considered legislation recently.

A draft bill that would make an exception to Wyoming's nuclear waste ban is intended to accommodate a California firm's plans to ""mass-produce"" microreactors near Casper.
The post Wyoming lawmakers consider nuclear waste storage as tensions rise over microreactor plant proposal appeared first on WyoFile .","Lawmakers will consider draft legislation this week that would allow manufacturers of “advanced nuclear reactors” to store high-level radioactive waste at their Wyoming facilities. It would be the second exception to a decades-long ban on nuclear fuel waste storage in Wyoming — removing a barrier to what nuclear energy proponents here say could become a lucrative new manufacturing and power production sector that also reinvigorates the state’s uranium mining industry. 
The measure faces significant public opposition, however, particularly in Natrona County, where Radiant Industries proposes to build a nuclear microreactor manufacturing plant on the outskirts of Bar Nunn. The company notes the location is “actually over a mile away from any home,” and meets the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s distance requirements. Many residents object to Radiant’s plan to house spent nuclear fuel waste on site — a location they say is too close to homes, schools and businesses.
“Bar Nunn does not want nuclear waste,” Midwest Republican Rep. Bill Allemand told a crowd of about 200 on Thursday evening in Bar Nunn, citing his own polling of constituents in House District 58. “We want manufacturing. We would love for Radiant to come here and manufacture and put the waste somewhere else.”
Such declarations earned raucous cheers and applause, lending credibility to Allemand’s claims that about 70% of respondents are against storing the waste.

Allemand organized the town hall, he said, because he believes state and local officials — along with Radiant — are rushing too quickly to change Wyoming law to accommodate the company’s plans. Bar Nunn residents, along with all Wyoming residents, deserve a longer conversation and an opportunity to learn about a complex and high-stakes industry before they can decide if it’s a good fit. How to impose limitations such as siting and whether to allow the industry’s radioactive waste warrant further examination, he said.
Both Allemand and Glenrock Republican Rep. Kevin Campbell urged the crowd to attend and speak up at the Joint Minerals, Business and Economic Development Committee’s hearing on Wednesday in Casper, when the panel will consider the “Advanced nuclear reactor manufacturers-fuel storage” draft bill.
Neither Allemand nor Campbell serves on the Minerals Committee.
A similar piece of legislation, Senate File 186, “​​Advanced nuclear reactor manufacturers-fuel storage,” was defeated during this year’s legislative session.
But not everyone in Bar Nunn has made up their minds about Radiant and its plans for the community. A smattering of attendees at Thursday’s event raised their hands in support of the project. Bar Nunn Mayor Peter Boyer, urged to the lectern by Allemand, gave a solemn and terse response to an apparent rumor in the community that his tentative support of the project is because he’s been bribed by Radiant.

“I’ve never taken money,” Boyer said. “I wouldn’t ever take money. I didn’t go to Iraq, serve my country for eight years, bleed, watch my friends die so I can be accused of bribery. That’s bullshit. And I’m pissed, and I’m tired of this. Everybody has been at everyone else’s throat, and that is unacceptable.”
Bar Nunn town council member Dan Sabrosky posted a comment on a Facebook post about Thursday’s event: 
“People were mad [including those] I spoke with that left early,” Sabrosky wrote. “They are tired of controlled Townhalls and being fed false information to try [to] scare them. People are educating themselves about this industry and realizing that reality tells them it’s the safest energy industry in the Country.”
Radiant and Wyoming’s nuclear waste ban
Bar Nunn, like most Natrona County communities, is well acquainted with industrial, manufacturing and tech companies. But nuclear energy is new to the entire state, where a ban on storing spent nuclear fuel has been in place for decades — despite repeated efforts to open Wyoming to commercial storage of the industry’s radioactive waste. 
Without a permanent repository in the U.S. — or an apparent path to one — critics of waste storage have long argued that if Wyoming were to allow “temporary” storage, the state would likely become a de facto permanent repository. 

This graphic depicts a tristructural isotropic (TRISO) fuel pellet. The pellets include several layers of carbon and carbide “that serve as the primary containment for radioactive material,” according to the Idaho National Laboratory. (Idaho National Laboratory)
But lawmakers managed to carve out an exception in 2022: “Temporary” storage is allowed, but only if the radioactive waste is associated with a nuclear power plant operating in the state. Wyoming still won’t accept even a pound of the estimated 86,000 metric tons that reside at dozens of nuclear power plants across the country.
The 2022 exemption, enshrined in House Bill 131, “Nuclear power generation and storage-amendments,” was made to accommodate TerraPower’s Natrium nuclear plant being built near Kemmerer. 
Similarly, the “Advanced nuclear reactor manufacturers-fuel storage” draft bill on the Minerals Committee’s schedule for Wednesday appears to have been drafted to accommodate another company’s ambitions.
California-based Radiant Industries, launched in 2019, proposes to build a microreactor manufacturing plant just outside Bar Nunn’s border. The town of 3,000 residents is located just a few miles north of Casper, home to 59,000. Radiant plans to build a 100-plus-acre campus where it will “mass produce” and fuel 1-megawatt Kaleidos microreactors, which are “designed for deployment anywhere it’s needed without the need to refuel for years,” according to the company.
Although Radiant may sell the microreactor units, it also plans to lease them, according to the company. When the units need refueling, the mobile reactors will be shipped back to Radiant’s Wyoming facility — from all over the world — and the spent fuel will be stored at the Bar Nunn campus, where it will remain until there’s a permanent federal repository to send it.
“Our microreactors will come back to our factory to have the spent fuel — which is about the volume of two Walmart gas grill propane tanks — removed and temporarily stored on site in dry casks until they can be shipped to a national repository as soon as it’s been selected,” Radiant Vice President of Communications and Marketing Ray Wert told WyoFile via email. “We’re very hopeful that the [Trump] administration will be standing up a national repository site shortly.”

Radiant also needs Wyoming lawmakers to make another exception to the state’s waste storage ban for its business plan to work here. The draft bill up for consideration this week would add “advanced nuclear reactor manufacturers” to the state’s short list of exceptions.
But critics say that’s no small departure from the 2022 exemption to the waste storage ban. 
Under the proposed legislation, Wyoming would accept radioactive fuel waste for the benefit of Radiant’s customers from across the nation and the world, giving the state’s residents an unequal portion of the burdens and risks that come with the industry, Rep. Campbell told WyoFile.
“If we do this with Radiant, we set a precedent to store nuclear waste from anywhere on the globe,” Campbell said, adding that several other companies have floated proposals to manufacture microreactors in the state.

The piecemeal additions of exceptions serve the end-goal for many longtime proponents of nuclear energy projects in the state, Campbell said: Namely, to open Wyoming’s doors for commercial nuclear waste facilities. House Bill 16, “Used nuclear fuel storage-amendments,” a measure to do just that, was also considered and defeated in this year’s legislative session.
“The next step is to go right back to where we were at with House Bill 16: ‘Oh, why don’t we just become the nuclear repository?'” Campbell said.
It doesn’t make sense, Campbell added, to change state laws for Radiant when the company hasn’t even submitted an application to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for the project. Radiant plans to file an application as soon as “we’ve finalized our location,” the company told WyoFile.
Political divides emerge
Wyoming’s congressional delegation, along with Gov. Mark Gordon and top energy officials in the state, staunchly support welcoming nuclear energy endeavors to the state while chastising an inept federal bureaucracy for not building a permanent, national repository for spent nuclear fuel waste.
But political lines are being drawn on the waste issue. 
The Wyoming Freedom Caucus posted a statement on its Facebook page on Thursday declaring the group’s opposition to nuclear waste storage: “Wyoming must continue to be a leader in proven energy production, not settle as a dumping ground for nuclear waste from other states. California billionaires insist on saddling our landscapes with their windmills, their solar panels, and now their radioactive casks.”
The group’s statement also criticizes efforts to secure a $25 million grant from the Wyoming Business Council to support the buildout of water, sewer and other infrastructure to help support Radiant’s manufacturing campus, calling it a subsidy.
“Fantastical promises of huge revenues to the State, overt gaslighting, and outright lies aren’t what we use to craft policy,” the group stated.
Meantime, Natrona County resident and Natrona County School Board Trustee Kyla Alvey has launched a change.org petition to “Support Radiant and bring new energy jobs to Natrona County.”The Joint Minerals, Business and Economic Development Committee will meet Tuesday and Wednesday at the Thyra Thomson State Office Building in Casper. It is scheduled to discuss the “Advanced nuclear reactor manufacturers-fuel storage” draft bill on Wednesday morning. The meeting will also be live streamed.

Ramaco Resources’ Brook Mine could become the second rare earth extraction operation in the U.S., but the minerals face an uncertain domestic market under President Trump.
The post Republican excitement for Wyoming rare earth mining contradicts the party’s disdain for renewables appeared first on WyoFile .","This article originally appeared on Inside Climate News (hyperlink to the original story), a nonprofit, non-partisan news organization that covers climate, energy and the environment. Sign up for their newsletter here.
At the foot of Wyoming’s Bighorn Mountains sits a mine potentially full of minerals crucial for renewable energy, yet capable of drawing praise from some of the United States’ most ardent supporters of fossil fuels. 
On July 11, the U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright, the former CEO of a hydraulic fracturing company, joined former West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin and Wyoming’s congressional delegation and governor, Mark Gordon, at the ribbon cutting ceremony for Ramaco Resources’ Brook Mine, which could one day become just the second source of rare earth minerals in the U.S. 
But the minerals, including but not limited to scandium, gallium, germanium, praseodymium, neodymium, terbium and dysprosium, are locked up in coal, according to Ramaco — and it is that coal that has driven Republican enthusiasm for the mine. 
Rare earth minerals are critical components in a long list of technologies, including solar cells, wind turbine rotors, batteries, magnets, missiles, motors, semiconductors and smartphones. A vast majority of the world’s known critical mineral deposits lie in Asia, particularly in China.
But as Ramaco looks to bring the Brook Mine online in 2027 — July’s ribbon cutting marked the opening of a pilot plant — some wonder what kind of domestic market it will find after President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans gutted federal incentives to boost the development and manufacturing of renewable energy technologies earlier this month. 
“I would argue that a large portion of the projected need [for rare earth minerals] is in clean energy,” said Steve Feldgus, former principal deputy assistant secretary for land and minerals management at the Department of the Interior. 
Despite his disdain for renewable energy, Trump has been eager to mine more rare earth minerals, signing an executive order in March expediting the permitting process for mines to extract the elements.  
Ramaco intends to sell some of the coal present in the mine, a costly form of energy and a major contributor to the climate crisis, but it should amount to less than 1% of all the coal exported from Wyoming, Jeremy Sussman, Ramaco’s chief financial officer, said in an email.
That small portion of coal didn’t stop Wright from touting the mineral as the mine’s major achievement. In a video posted on X, formerly Twitter, the secretary of energy said, “You’re going to see a lot more of big, beautiful, clean coal!” and noted that he was celebrating not only the opening of a mine for rare earth minerals, but also the first coal mine to open in Wyoming in 50 years.
Ramaco has analyzed one-third of the mineral deposit, according to a July letter to shareholders signed by CEO Randall Atkins, and Ramaco’s pilot project will test processing techniques for rare earths.
Broadly, “there is a rare earth element resource [in coal],” said Lauren Birgenheier, a professor of geology and geophysics at the University of Utah. In the Brook Mine’s case, “how excellent it is is still probably to be determined, but it appears excellent enough for them to feel like they can move forward.”

With only a third of the mine mapped and rare earth prices subject to change — Ramaco’s price estimate for scandium, a crucial component of fuels cells used in hydrogen-powered machines, was over 200% higher than the U.S. Geological Survey’s estimate of $1.2 million per metric ton — Feldgus said it was too soon to say for sure what the mine’s future holds.
“It’s still going to be a little bit longer before they can say that ‘this is actually what we’re going to mine,’” he said.
Sussman said Ramaco’s estimates were for 2028 and accounted for attempts from China “to manipulate pricing” by keeping rare earth values low, thereby “disincentivizing western projects.” He said he expects the market to improve as the U.S. tries to source rare earth minerals domestically, and pointed to a recent Department of Defense contract for neodymium at $110,000 per ton — twice the mineral’s typical spot price, according to Sussman — as evidence that the market for western critical minerals was improving.
Despite its support for policies that depress U.S. renewable energy markets, Wyoming’s congressional delegation, made up entirely of Republicans, lauded the effort to extract rare earth minerals in statements released after Ramaco’s groundbreaking ceremony.
Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso said the mine will “support American industries, and strengthen our supply chains.” Cynthia Lummis, the state’s other senator, added that the mine “will produce resources needed to achieve energy independence and grow our economy.”
But where the domestic demand for those minerals will come from is uncertain, as many of the industries they would supply face questionable near-term futures in the U.S. after Trump signed legislation earlier this month gutting many incentives for renewable energy technologies.
“The excitement over rare earths is sort of at odds with the destruction of demand for clean energy,” Feldgus said. “The magnets that a lot of these minerals go into, I mean, those are critically important for electric motors, for turbines, for anything that is built off the clean energy economy.”
The policy whiplash in the U.S. has left Sussman unfazed. “Our rare earth elements and critical minerals are vital to national defense,” he said. And those same technologies Feldgus outlined “are still projected to grow at a meaningful pace,” he said. “In fact, the [U.S. Department of Energy] projects wind capacity in the U.S. to grow from 113 [gigawatts] in 2020 to 404 [gigawatts] in [2050].”

I wasn’t always this jaded. As a photojournalist for the then-Wyoming State Tribune in the 1970s, I fully embraced my job covering Frontier Days, from pancake breakfasts and parades to afternoon rodeos and evening concerts.
I’d usually join local and traveling journalists at a bar to discuss the day’s events because, of course, we thought we knew everything. As I count down my most memorable good, bad and embarrassing moments, let’s start with one that could still get me pummeled by country music fans.

I am chagrined to confess it was future country superstar Chris LeDoux, a legendary rodeo competitor from Kaycee. Years later, I interviewed him and learned that he was also an amazing Western sculptor and probably the nicest man on the planet.
9 — Another faux pas, this time at the rodeo. Reporters watched for contestants leaving the arena, stopping them before they disappeared under the stands to shed their equipment.
A woman who was the Denver correspondent for the New York Times kept beating me to interviews. I’d stand around patiently to ask questions about their techniques, background, motivation, etc., while my new competitor always asked the same thing: “What’s the name of that horse (or bull) you rode?”
I couldn’t reconcile how someone writing for the nation’s most prestigious paper could ask such a lame question. The reporter was Molly Ivins, who became one of the premier political columnists and hellraisers in America. See a trend here?


8 — I’m glad Molly wasn’t around when the Frontier Days public relations committee convinced the livestock committee to name some of the bulls after local journalists. I was in the arena waiting to take a photo of my namesake busting out of the gate when I heard the confused announcer say, “Here’s so-and-so, today’s leader, riding Kerry Drake. [Long pause] Now why on Earth would someone name a bull Kerry Drake?”
Why indeed? A genuine WTF moment for everyone in the stands, the cowboy and the bull.
7 — This isn’t a “moment,” but a fashion statement. The newspaper’s mandatory dress code was a sport coat and tie, but the rodeo required us to wear a cowboy hat, long-sleeve Western shirt and cowboy boots, no exceptions. Why, Frontier Days could lose its authentic image if someone snapped a photo of us covering the event wearing a sensible T-shirt to avoid heat stroke!
But I really didn’t mind. Losing the tie was a big plus, because I still hate wearing one. And I learned that my Dad was right, a good pair of cowboy boots are indeed the most comfortable footwear ever. I just wish they gave us a clothing allowance, because even in the 1970s, all that Western garb was expensive.
6 — In high school, most of my friends were listening to Led Zeppelin and Jimi Hendrix, but I wore out my copy of “Johnny Cash at Folsom Prison” — again, Dad’s influence. So when the “Man in Black” held a press conference, I jumped at the assignment. While l should have been more professional, I followed him to the elevator, shook his hand and thanked him for all his music. I’d do it again.
5 — Speaking of music, I saw almost every major country star of the era because they loved playing Frontier Days. As long as we sat in a booth on the catwalk, people with media credentials could watch for free. I saw classic concerts by Cash, Merle Haggard, Charlie Daniels, Charley Pride, Dolly Parton, Waylon Jennings, Jerry Jeff Walker and Buck Owens. 
But hands down, the most unforgettable performance was by Kenny Rogers in 1978. Not my favorite singer, but it was during a deluge and he stood on stage wearing a soaked yellow slicker, playing his full show under the worst conditions I’ve ever seen.
4 — Reporters are often bumped up the editorial ladder, so eventually most of my Frontier Days writing landed on the opinion page, where I took up the cause of finally appointing women to chair the rodeo’s volunteer committees. It was one of the rare occasions when Cynthia Lummis — then-state legislator, now-U.S. senator — and I were fighting for the same thing.
Every year, we saw it rejected by men who hated the idea. But Lummis was rodeo royalty as a former Miss Frontier Days, and she eventually won them over.
But the guys who ran the show treated me as a traitor to my gender who ruined their world. Still, that was nothing compared to my decision to let PETA and other animal rights activists air their views about rodeo’s alleged cruelty to livestock. Burning me at the stake would not be enough punishment for that sin.
3 — Those guys could have exacted their revenge by tossing me in the legendary Zipper carnival ride. Despite fears of permanent damage, I willingly bought tickets when my future wife wanted to go for a few spins nearly 40 years ago. I’ve had a pain in my neck ever since, though she reminds me I’ve been a pain to her for just as long.
2 — Perseverance can pay off handsomely, as my friend Pete Laybourn proved when, after many years, he won the wild horse riding contest. It’s a fan favorite, and I’ll never forget the smile on his face when he claimed his prize.
1 — My chart-topper was the opposite of Laybourn’s experience. I loved taking photos in the arena because you can’t beat the action. But after a record rain drenched the rodeo grounds overnight, it was a sea of mud. I didn’t want to ruin my boots, so my father loaned me a pair of hip waders.
That worked fine until I drifted way too far from the fence and got literally stuck in the arena’s mud during the bareback event, making me an easy target for a stray horse. When I picked myself off the ground, I held my mostly dry, intact camera high in the air.
I didn’t expect cheers or gasps that I survived, but I also didn’t anticipate waves of laughter from thousands of spectators that kept growing louder as I trudged off, every inch covered in mud. Even my “friends” let me know it was the funniest thing they’d ever seen. It would have gone viral but YouTube hadn’t been invented. 
I’m sure I will get over the humiliation someday. Ask me in a couple of decades.

,Mississippi Today,2025-07-28 10:16:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,"Some hope, some worries: Mississippi’s agriculture GDP is a mixed bag",Katherine Lin,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/07/28/mississippi-agriculture-gdp-mixed-farmers-livestock-poultry/,"Ag was the largest contributor to state GDP growth in the first quarter of 2025, but agriculture GDP gains were largely due to $120 million in federal payments to Mississippi farmers.","It’s been a disparate few years for Mississippi’s agriculture sector. Even as natural disasters and trade wars have caused row crop prices to decline, record high beef prices, growing poultry production and hundreds millions of dollars in federal disaster payments have bolstered the sector.
Some farmers have reported that federal payments have been slower and lower than needed as they continue to feel the impacts of bad weather in 2023 and 2024 exacerbated by low prices, high costs and trade wars. In Mississippi, row crops, which include soy beans, cotton and corn, have been among the hardest hit.
“This is one of the worst years for row crops,” said Dr. Joshua Maples, an agricultural economist at Mississippi State University. 
Row crops, especially soybeans, are an important part of Mississippi’s economy with soybean production valued at over $1 billion. Farmers are still recovering from the effects of past severe weather conditions and the outlook for 2025 is not promising with higher than normal rainfall that may result in a lower crop yield.
The prices of row crops have declined since 2022 leading to smaller profits for farmers who are struggling to break even with high production costs. As a result of 2018 tariffs, China, the biggest importer of soybeans in the world, shifted to buying more from South America, a loss that the U.S. industry has not recovered from.
The bright spots in the agriculture industry have been the livestock and poultry industries. Poultry, the largest agriculture sector in Mississippi, grew by 10% according to data from the Mississippi State University Extension largely due to strong production.
But livestock saw the most growth, with a 14% increase.
“Livestock is the shining star of Mississippi,” said Mike McCormick, a cattle farmer and president of the Mississippi Farm Bureau Federation. Beef prices have soared due to historically low numbers of cattle in the United States. As of January 1, 2025, there were 86.7 million head of cattle in the United States, the fewest since 1951. 
While cattle farmers are currently seeing higher returns, they struggled for years with drought and weak profit margins leading to smaller herds. Farmers are trying to grow their herds but the process will likely take a few years, so beef prices will likely continue to be high.
In 2024, the state’s agricultural nominal GDP remained relatively unchanged with a decrease of 0.4% while the overall state GDP grew by 4.2%.

Agriculture GDP makes up around 2% of the state GDP. At the end of June, data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis showed that in the first quarter of 2025, Mississippi’s economy grew 0.7%.  The agriculture sector was the largest contributor to growth of any industry at 0.83%. This was the third straight quarter that agriculture had the largest GDP growth rate in the state.
But agriculture GDP growth in the first quarter of this year was largely due to $120 million in direct payments from the federal government to Mississippi farmers.
“It’s not reflective of the reality farmers are facing right now,” said Andy Gipson, Mississippi’s agricultural commissioner on a recent episode of Mississippi Today’s podcast The Other Side, of what would appear on paper to be robust growth in farming output.
These payments are part of the American Relief Act that was passed in December 2024 that set aside more than $30 billion in direct payments to farmers to help with losses from economic changes and natural disasters. The money is being paid out through multiple programs, including the Emergency Commodity Assistance Program, or ECAP, and the Supplemental Disaster Relief Program, or SDRP. The commodity program helps farmers impacted by increased production costs and falling crop prices while the disaster program helps those affected by severe weather in 2023 and 2024.
 “The $120 million is about 3.5% of the total GDP the state gained from ‘Agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting’ in 2024,” said Dr. Sondra Collins a Senior Economist at the Mississippi Institutions of Higher Learning. She expects to see the impact of these programs on GDP throughout the year as applications continue to be submitted and money is paid out. 
McCormick’s family has been farming in Mississippi since the 1820s and says this is one of the most challenging periods for farmers since the farm crisis of the 1980s. 
“Farming has always been a risky business,” said McCormick.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/06213500/IMG_0328.jpg,,,2025-07-28 06:56:52.622386

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Every Nebraska worker was set to have paid sick leave starting this fall, because voters approved it through a citizen-led initiative.
That change was part of a wave of ballot measures Nebraska voters embraced in recent years, including the legalization of medical marijuana that left lawmakers and a newly created commission to craft the framework of how the new medicine would be regulated. 
Voters also approved increasing the minimum wage and tied future annual pay bumps to inflation. And they rejected state funding to help pay some of the costs of students attending private K-12 schools.
But the officially nonpartisan, GOP-led Nebraska Legislature this session, often with gubernatorial support and the support of at least one Democrat, poked and prodded for changes that would have weakened or reversed those ballot measures. 
Some lawmakers argued that they wanted to make those measures more “workable.” Others sought to reimplement the school voucher law voters rejected.
Different groups of lawmakers resisted each time, often filibustering or arguing against the changes. Many accused the legislative majorities of going against the “will of the people.” 
  A new GOP supermajority 

Nebraska was one of several Republican-led legislatures nationally that sought to restrict or, in Missouri’s case, reverse ballot measures voters approved this year.
Majorities in Lincoln did so after having built a 33-member supermajority. With the new supermajority, conservatives could modify, weaken or repeal citizen initiatives without crossing the political aisle — if Republicans stayed in lockstep.
 Nebraska’s GOP lawmakers and Democratic State Sen. Jane Raybold of Lincoln did so on paid sick leave, weakening the voter-approved law’s blanket requirements for sick leave and adding new restrictions. 
Now employers will no longer be required to offer paid sick leave to young teens, ages 14 and 15, or to temporary workers, seasonal agricultural workers and workers at the state’s smallest businesses, those with 10 or fewer employees.
The larger majority also made the filibuster, a tactic long used in the Unicameral to stall or kill legislation that lacks consensus, less effective. 
Some lawmakers, often Democrats, lamented that the statehouse had become less pragmatic, while Republicans blamed them for using the once-rare stall tactic too often to resist a different will of the voters, conservative lawmaking majorities the people elected. 
Some Democrats said they were left little choice but to stall, as Republicans more frequently stuck together to pass their most controversial priorities.
On medical cannabis, lawmakers refused to establish a clearer framework of how the new laws should be implemented. 
The majority tried to slow down voter-approved minimum wage increases but failed after one lawmaker missed the final round vote. That proposal is already set to be reconsidered next year. Supporters of the slowdown had argued businesses needed more predictable increases. 
Throughout the session, worker advocates and union leaders spoke out against the proposed changes to citizen-led initiatives.

“I don’t understand how democratically elected senators can so easily go against these democratically supported initiatives,” said Sam Washburn, a student activist, in March.
One state senator, speaking privately, said during a last-ditch effort to slow the minimum wage increase that the statehouse is “not a serious place,” and that lawmakers are “not serious people.” 
As the Legislature pushes back against voter-approved laws, lawmakers are also asking voters to consider letting them run for a third term in 2026 via a constitutional amendment. 
Now, after the dust settles, both state parties will try to pick up seats by turning to the same voters. Republicans will try to gain more seats and strengthen their majority to the point that a handful of conservative holdouts would hold less sway. Democrats are trying to end the super majority and restore the filibuster’s strength. 
 The Never-Ending Culture War 

The Nebraska Unicameral, while it isn’t as loud or larger-than-life as some statehouses, also had its culture war spats this spring — from talk of stopping the “elitist” class from promoting lab-grown meat and other foods they call unnatural to restricting what high school and college sports team transgender students can join. 
The Legislature passed legislation that would require public school districts to adopt a policy so parents can see what materials are in school libraries, as book bans passed by school boards and states have drastically increased in recent years.
Nebraska also joined 26 states in having a law that restricts which sports teams transgender students can join. Transgenders people’s participation in sports has become a wedge issue in recent years. ​​Fewer than 10 transgender students have filed to participate in middle school and high school sports in the state over the past decade, according to the Nebraska School Activities Association.
State Sen. Kathleen Kauth of the Millard area continued proposing bills that affect transgender Nebraskans. In 2023, her bill passed restricting gender care for some minors. That year, her bill and legislative resistance to it sidetracked the session, as State Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha filibustered nearly every bill.
ACLU Nebraska Executive Director Mindy Rush Chipman said in a statement, “The constant targeting of LGBTQ+ Nebraskans must stop.”
Kauth, who had to limit her latest bill to high school and college sports to pass it this year, has said she would reintroduce a proposal to set similar sex-based legal restrictions on school bathrooms and locker rooms during next year’s legislative session. 
“The work is not done,” Kauth said. “We’re going to continue.”

 The governor’s future 
Gov. Jim Pillen claimed victory for the bill’s passage. He had identified Kauth’s sports restrictions bill as one of his priorities for the 2025 session. 
Pillen, who announced his 2026 bid for reelection as the session wound down, achieved most of his legislative priorities, including a law against foreign agents, age verification for future social media accounts, the ban on lab-grown meat and a merger of the state’s agencies in charge of overseeing water quality and quantity.
But Pillen fell short a second straight year at convincing some Republican holdouts to support a proposal to alter how the state awards Electoral College votes for president to a winner-take-all system, which every state but Maine and Nebraska use. 
President Donald Trump and campaign surrogates had expressed support for the change during his 2024 campaign, which some pundits thought might come down to the results in Nebraska’s Omaha-based 2nd Congressional District. In the end, former Vice President Kamala Harris won the “blue dot” in the Omaha area but lost Nebraska as a whole to Trump.
While the debate made national headlines, political observers had known the GOP holdouts for months. The bill’s sponsor, State Sen. Loren Lippincott of Central City, knew he was short votes. The governor still pressured lawmakers to debate the change.
The reason: Pillen might need Trump’s backing in 2026, as the Republican governor could face a GOP primary challenger with ties to Trump world. At worst, his team hopes to keep Trump from endorsing an opponent. It would like to earn the president’s backing.

Pillen might face questions about budget troubles slowing his momentum on his top priority, securing lasting property tax relief. 
A handful of Republicans joined most Democrats to oppose Pillen-favored changes to the property tax code, including broadening the sales tax base to cover more of the costs of funding public education that is currently covered by local property taxpayers. Three times now, enough senators have balked at Pillen’s push to tax more goods and services to pay for property tax relief.
He also could face scrutiny for mishandling line-item vetoes to the state’s two-year budget.
“What happened with the delivery of the vetoes is not a problem with the budget,” said State Sen. Rob Clements of Elmwood, chair of the Appropriations Committee.”
Clements said the budget was put together well, but that a majority of lawmakers would have supported all of Pillen’s intended line-item vetoes. Some Democrats disagreed with that assessment.
 A nation that needs help
Some state lawmakers, following the lead of cohorts in other states, tried and fell short at infusing more religion into public schools, testing the legal limits of the separation of church and state.
One proposal would have required displaying the Ten Commandments in every Nebraska elementary school classroom and in every middle or high school building. Another would have allowed school districts to employ unlicensed religious chaplains to counsel students. 
Neither made it out of committee. 
The lawmakers behind the bills say they aim to restore morality and character among Nebraska students, saying that they believe the nation needs help.
One of the four proposals, Legislative Bill 550, would have let K-12 students be excused during the school day for off-site religious instruction and coursework. That proposal was included in a broader education package that sidetracked the Education Committee for a month. 
LB 550 was married to a proposal that would have given Nebraska teachers more paid time off around significant life events. It fell to a filibuster on the floor after lawmakers from both sides of the aisle expressed concerns about the logistical challenges of letting students leave.

Some who backed the deal have said that parents can already sign out their kids for any reason and that they do not see it as a state endorsement of religion. Critics argued it could open the door to more controversial educational religious bills, including vouchers for private K-12 education and display of the Ten Commandments.
“I think in any normal course of a session, a bill like LB 550 would be seen as a radical piece of legislation,” said State Sen. Megan Hunt of Omaha during the floor debate. 
A “historically conservative” budget 
Beyond the culture war battles, Lawmakers balanced the budget mostly by using the state’s “rainy day” cash reserve fund and a series of cash transfers and spending cuts to fill budget holes, a budget Pillen touted as “historically conservative.” 
“I believe we are setting the Cornhusker State up for success,” Pillen said. 
Some Democratic lawmakers compared the budget to “The Emperor’s New Clothes,” a fairy tale where the ruler is naked but his subjects pretend he has extravagant clothing. They questioned the math behind it. 
Pillen, should he win reeelection, would face future budgets based on the limitations of the current one — less revenue than anticipated and increased spending over time — a budget already back in the red, facing a deficit of $95 million due to lower tax revenues. 
A vocal, ever-changing group in the Legislature’s minority spent much of the session filibustering. They lost most fights but scored a few wins.
State Sen. George Dungan of Lincoln expressed pride that they had blocked the proposal that would have slowed the state’s voter-approved minimum wage increases, for now. 
“I’m glad that we were at least able to fight for everyday working Nebraskan,” Dungan said.

Wes Moore and Westernport Mayor Judy Hamilton speak to reporters Sunday after a 90-minute meeting to discuss the recent FEMA denail of an request for areas hit by devastating floods in May. (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)A decision to deny federal emergency aid to areas of Western Maryland hit hard by flooding in May is being called petty, partisan and punishing by Maryland Gov. Wes Moore (D).
State, federal and local officials met for 90 minutes inside a Westernport restaurant Sunday to discuss last week’s denial by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the next steps they can take.
And while there is bipartisan agreement that the denial is a “gut punch” to the area, ant that there must be an appeal, there is disagreement on the motivations behind the decision.
Sen. Mike McKay (R-Western Maryland) said that while the reason for the rejection is not yet clear, he does not believe it was political. But Gov. Wes Moore blamed the denial squarely on President Donald Trump (R).
“His decision was a political decision,” Moore told reporters gathered under an awning next to the Port West restaurant Sunday. “There’s no other justification that could make where West Virginia had around the same amount of damage that was done” and had its application approved, while Maryland was rejected.
The comments to reporters are some of the strongest yet made by Moore as he continues to decry a denial of federal aid by the Trump administration.
Moore, McKay, Rep. April McClain Delaney (D-6th) and Westernport Mayor Judy Hamilton met at Port West Restaurant, which was hit hard by flooding that overwhelmed the town’s Main Street area in May. But on Sunday, it was reopepned and doing brisk business.
“Port West and the Subway are staples here,” McKay said, standing outside as a thunderstorm passed through.
Lawmakers call denial of disaster assistance for Western Maryland floods a ‘gut punch’

McKay said the two restaurants were beneficiaries of both a shovel brigade organized by area residents and local government aid that quickly provided some funding that allowed both to jumpstart their own recoveries.
The town and parts of Allegany and Garrett counties were inundated by storms in May. Westernport, which sits near the Potomac and George’s Creek, was among the flood damaged towns.
George’s Creek surged to more than 12 feet above major flood stage. Wills Creek in Cumberland rose 8 feet. The Potomac River also flooded. Areas of both counties were evacuated. Midland, Lonaconing, and Westernport were among the hardest-hit areas.
Moore declared a state of emergency in the area. In addition to providing some state aid, an application for federal recovery funds was also submitted.
Official damage estimates in that request approached $90 million, including damage to the George’s Creek Railroad and to exposed water and gas lines. Many of those damages were offset by insurance claims and further reduced through a “joint assessment” process in which FEMA agrees with some claims but denies others, until the damage estimate was reduced to $15.8 million.
In a letter sent to state and local officials last week, FEMA denied that funding even as it approved $11.7 million in aid for two West Virginia counties hit by a different storm in June.
Hamilton said the area is still struggling to recover. Half a mile away, Ross Street is still closed after part of the road was damaged by the flooding.
“That road alone leads down into town,” Hamilton said. “We have approximately 10 first responders from the fire department, EMS, that live on that hill. By that road not being open, it’s going to delay response. They’re going to have to go a little further out and down … that is going to be a major problem.”
The town of about 2,000 people has a $2 million budget. Damage to the municipality — excluding private property — is currently estimated at $10 million, including the loss of four city vehicles, Hamilton said.
“We lost a lot — the town itself — all of our equipment, our trucks … we lost four vehicles,” she said. “We were able to recently, through insurance money, to replace only three.”
The town has been renting additional equipment “because we don’t have the money to purchase that as well. So financially, it is affecting the town as well as all the citizens.”
With months left in the summer, Hamilton said she is already concerned about residents in the area come winter.

“Families here lost their furnaces. They have no money to replace those. So, we have families that will be cold this winter or will result to other means to heat their homes, which is a concern for the fire department as well,” Hamilton said.
“I’ve been a 25-year member with the fire department and usually homes that don’t have the capability of heating, they switch to kerosene, they switch to electric heaters, and it’s very scary for us to know that that’s probably what a lot of those families are going to do,” she said.
Hamilton said a lack of federal aid will hamstring recovery efforts.
“Honestly, I think we’re going to have to let the road set closed as it is right now,” she said of Ross Street. “You know, we’re only able to do what we can do.”
“There is money that the state has given us that right now we’re using for hot water tanks, looking to provide furnaces, those types of things for our residents,” she said. “People have to come first. The road is secondary to our residents.”
Still, Moore, Delaney and McKay said they hold out hope of reconsideration.
Moore said the state is appealing even though the denial letter offers little insight as to the reasons the state request was rejected. And while McKay and some others said they hoped the federal agency would elaborate on the reason for the denial, Moore was more cynical.
“I’ve stopped trying to do the mental gymnastics of trying to understand how this administration is making its decisions, or what to expect when it comes to partnership with them,” Moore told reporters. “What I do know is the decision that they made, it is petty, it is partisan, and it is punishing and is deeply unfair to the people of Allegany and Garrett County.”
McClain Delaney and McKay both said they have asked for meetings with Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.
“It’s important that they are forced to justify why … they rejected it so abruptly, because it does seem that any Democratic member who’s asked for help hasn’t received it,” McLain Delaney said.
“I believe that no matter what, your ZIP code doesn’t matter. You know, people over politics, so it’s horrific,” she said. “But the one thing I keep reiterating is this is the best of what recovery looks like — it’s when state, federal and local come together. They pool their resources, and they figure out ways to leverage them to, you know, lift up in the best and most economical way.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
McClain vowed to press the administration for funding.
“We’ll embarrass them,” she said.
When asked if she thought the Trump administration is susceptible to those tactics, McClain Delaney said that “if there is enough publicity and enough of an outcry, it does look embarrassing for them because it looks like they’re penalizing people.”
McKay said he still is not attributing the decision to politics and to punishing an area that voted for Trump even as the state overall did not in 2024.
“I tend to believe that it is not political,” McKay said. “I tend to believe, just from the simple fact … that I don’t believe that FEMA, those who are at FEMA, at that level, are playing politics with applications.”
McKay said he hoped state leaders could push for a reconsideration on the merits of the case.
“I believe that we have shown the metrics that we meet everything,” McKay said. “There is an appeal process. I disagree about trying to embarrass anybody. My grandma said you could always catch a whole lot more flies with honey than a baseball bat.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_9586-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-07-28 06:56:52.622386

Using conventional methods to measure the magnitude of small earthquakes in Yellowstone, however,[...]","This is the Kaleidoscope Geyser in the Lower Geyser Basin. George D. Marler and Donald E. White wrote in their 1975 journal paper that “In 1963, about 18 m northwest of Kaleidoscope Geyser, a violent eruption that may have been a single event scattered scores of blocks of sinter about a newly created crater about 3 m in diameter” but suggested that the event was either directly or indirectly related to the Hebgen Lake earthquake. (Photo by George Marler/ Yellowstone National Park in 1965)Although they mostly go unnoticed by humans, small earthquakes occur much more frequently than large earthquakes, and knowing more about these tiny seismic events can help us better understand the earthquake hazard and geological processes occurring in a region. Using conventional methods to measure the magnitude of small earthquakes in Yellowstone, however, can be challenging. But perhaps artificial intelligence (AI) approaches offer a solution. After all, AI is already helping to refine earthquake location procedures in Yellowstone.
Earthquake magnitudes are calculated from the energy released by the earthquake as recorded by a seismometer. In Yellowstone, the University of Utah Seismograph Stations (UUSS) operates a network of seismometers to monitor earthquakes in the area. Generally, magnitude measurements for a single earthquake are made at several stations in the network independently, and the estimates are then averaged into the final magnitude that is reported. Accurately computing magnitude values for small earthquakes becomes challenging when 1) there are not enough measurements, or 2) earthquakes are happening close together. This is a particular problem during swarms of small earthquakes because the signals from individual seismic events can overlap. Usually, this can be fixed by a seismic analyst after they locate the earthquake, but not always! About 2% of the earthquakes in the UUSS catalog do not have a magnitude computed, likely because of a combination of these issues, so the value is reported as -9.99. To solve this problem, let’s reach into our AI toolkit!
  Example of a Yellowstone seismic waveform recorded at station YMC (at Maple Creek in the northeast part of Yellowstone National Park) with earthquakes for which a magnitude could not be determined. The magnitude was therefore set at -9.99 in the University of Utah Seismograph Stations catalog. The gold area highlights one event, but there are several others close by. The entire window is ~1 minute long. The close occurrence of several earthquakes in such a short time window and their small magnitude values make it a challenge to calculate an earthquake magnitude for any of these events.
Most people are likely familiar with complicated “deep learning” models, like ChatGPT, that accept and output complex data like long text sequences and images. The deep learning models we use in processing small earthquakes are similar, and they take ground motion data from seismometers as the input. Deep learning models like these are a type of machine learning, which describes algorithms that learn patterns in a dataset to estimate values of interest for new data. The models learn the patterns during a training phase, in which the model is provided with examples — sort of like a test with an answer key. After training, the model can accept inputs it has never seen before and estimate the output, given what it learned from the training data.
There is also a somewhat simpler, though still powerful, type of machine learning that relies on human-defined features that describe the data instead of the more complicated, raw data to make predictions. In a recent study, UUSS scientists used this method to train models to calculate earthquake magnitudes based on short windows of data, so it won’t generally be a problem if earthquakes are close together.
In the new approach, the UUSS scientists trained one machine learning model for each station in the Yellowstone region using data from the UUSS earthquake catalog. Each model uses features describing the earthquake signal — such as the amplitude — and the location of the earthquake to estimate a magnitude value. The new method makes better use of the available data by accounting for multiple types of seismic waves, and the method also can take advantage of data from more seismic stations because of the rigorous training step. The net result is that there are up to 4 times as many measurements available to calculate a magnitude. Like in the conventional approach, these measurements are combined to determine a final magnitude.
  A map of the stations operating in the Yellowstone region between 2012 and 2024 shown as triangles with fill and edge colors indicating whether they are used to calculate magnitudes using traditional approaches, artificial intelligence methods, or both. Many more stations can be used with the AI magnitude method, allowing for more small-magnitude values to be computed. The black dots show the locations of the earthquakes cataloged by the University of Utah Seismograph Stations that were used to train the AI models.
The new method will ultimately complement, and not replace, the traditional approach for magnitude calculations. This is because traditional methods work very well most of the time (except for these small, nearby events), and because the machine learning approach does have its limitations, mostly because the models are only going to work well for earthquakes that are similar to the training dataset. So, for example, a model may fail to estimate the magnitude of an earthquake occurring near Hebgen Lake if it saw very few training examples from that area. Similarly, if most training examples were greater than M0.5, the model may perform poorly when applied to earthquakes with a magnitude less than 0.5. Combining predictions from multiple station models can help us to remove and identify poor magnitude estimates, but it can be challenging to know when the models are uncertain. In the future, UUSS scientists plan to expand the approach to not only provide a magnitude, but also an assessment of the confidence in that magnitude.
These machine learning methods are at the current cutting edge of seismology, and Yellowstone provides the perfect location to train and test the new approaches!

(Getty Image)A group of Tennessee electricity providers is taking early steps toward turning part of the West Tennessee Megasite into a power plant designed to generate extra power when demand peaks.
The cooperative has its eye on about 100 acres located near a new substation the Tennessee Valley Authority built to help power the megasite and its tenants, including Ford’s massive BlueOval City electric vehicle and battery manufacturing campus.
The group wants to resurrect the Tennessee Power Distribution Company, a nonprofit, tax-exempt electricity generation and transmission “co-op of co-ops” created in 1999 in case local electricity distribution became an open market. 
The power industry didn’t experience such a transition, so co-ops are considering other uses for the company, according to Mike Knotts, CEO of the Tennessee Electric Cooperative Association, a group of 23 nonprofit electric co-ops that serve more than 2.5 million Tennesseans. The co-ops purchase their energy from TVA and distribute it locally to customers, accounting for about 25% of the federally-owned public utility’s annual revenue, Knotts said.
“This started back at Christmas Eve of 2022 when we experienced a first for our area — which was rolling blackouts — where there was simply not enough capacity to produce energy in the TVA service territory,” said Knotts, who also serves as Tennessee Power Distribution Company president. “So we as local utilities were called upon to, in rolling increments … turn your power off.”
Affordable, reliable and sustainable: report compares utility performance

Winter Storm Elliott plunged much of Tennessee into single-digit temperatures that year, and mechanical failure combined with historically high electricity demand resulted in the rolling blackouts. The utility made multiple changes to its emergency communications procedures and fortified its facilities to try to withstand frigid conditions the following year.
Knotts told members of the West Tennessee Megasite Authority on Wednesday that the group sought to ensure this would never happen again and landed on the idea of building a “peaking facility” themselves.
Such facilities are intended to operate only when electric consumption needs reach extreme highs, running about 10-20% of the year, Knotts said. The site would generate power using simple cycle combustion turbines powered by natural gas. These turbines do not generate steam and as a result have little discharge water.
The Tennessee Power Distribution Company would then sell that power to TVA to be distributed where it’s needed. 
The long process ahead
The Tennessee Electric Cooperative Association, with TVA’s cooperation, completed a site selection study to determine how and where the cooperative could “build assets to produce energy that could complement what TVA does and not disturb the contractual relationship between our cooperatives and TVA,” Knotts said.
The study focused on the Megasite property adjacent to the TVA substation — it’s close to transmission infrastructure, the interstate and a natural gas pipeline installed to serve BlueOval City.
Knotts said the group has had “fruitful” conversations with state officials, and it’s time to move on to more formal arrangements. The cooperative is negotiating with TVA, he said, and will soon start the roughly two-year process of applying to connect to the power transmission grid. 
Ultimately, Knotts said the project would need a binding letter of intent and then a long-term lease agreement for the land from the Megasite Authority. The project also would need the blessing of the State Building Commission and must clear a federal interconnection study.
Several Megasite Authority board members posed questions about the proposed facility’s impact, including potential nitrous oxide emissions. Knotts said the facility would require an air quality permit from the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation. 
The Megasite Authority board did not take formal action on the issue Wednesday, but each member of the board expressed interest in learning more about the proposal at a September meeting.
Knotts said while he does not speak for TVA, the utility has “stated publicly that it has a deficit for capacity,” in addition to a debt cap set by federal law limiting how many new generation projects TVA can take on.
“Plants like this are going to be built, so our members decided, jointly, we would rather do this, given our service mission, given we are nonprofit entities … than outsource it to a for-profit company,” he said.

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Workers’ rights and the state budget were among the top themes of Nebraska’s 2025 legislative session as lawmakers tried to balance new voter-approved laws with legislative power, all while dealing with a major budget deficit.
State lawmakers had telegraphed their intent to adjust what Nebraskans passed in recent years, including votes to increase the minimum wage (passed by about 59% of voters in 2022) and mandate paid sick leave for all workers (passed by about 75% of voters in 2024).
The labor laws came into focus in the first contested vote of the 2025 session in January, the choice for chair of the Business and Labor Committee.

Both candidates for the post — Omaha State Sens. Kathleen Kauth and John Cavanaugh, a Republican and Democrat in the officially nonpartisan Legislature, neither of whom had yet served on the committee — hinted that the laws from Nebraska’s “second house” might need adjustments.
“We need to make sure that we honor the intent of those [voter-initiated] bills and get through the process successfully,” Kauth said Jan. 8. She would be elected committee chair 31-18.
Cavanaugh described the need for possible “technical updates and implementation” to some of the ballot-passed laws while stating the Business and Labor Committee should “be respectful of the will of the voters but also make sure that we are taking into consideration those very real concerns.”
The labor proposals worked their way through Kauth’s committee, and the fights spilled over like proxy wars into other labor measures and the budget.
If 2023 focused on health care and 2024 focused on education and taxes, in that year’s regular and special sessions, 2025 focused on the budget and labor, often a direct response to the “will of the voters” from recent elections.
‘Will of the voters’
The phrases “will of the voters” or “will of the people” were repeated throughout the session and became rallying cries for opponents of the labor bills. One example was the morning of March 26 when the phrases were said 44 times by 14 different senators during three hours of debate on proposed changes to paid sick leave, legislative transcripts show.
The proposed tweaks were panned as partisan and nearly divided the 49-member Legislature along ideological lines. One Democratic exception, State Sen. Jane Raybould of Lincoln, a grocery store executive, joined 32 of 33 Republicans on the labor-related, voter-passed laws.
  State Sens. Jane Raybould of Lincoln and Tony Sorrentino of the Elkhorn area. May 22, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
The result left 33 votes, which is the minimum threshold to overcome a filibuster but also change voter-approved laws as required under the Nebraska Constitution. However, the minimum wage proposal led by Raybould stalled procedurally but will likely return in 2026 and pass if all supporters hold.
Supporters defended the efforts to water down paid sick leave protections and slow minimum wage increases as necessary for businesses, citing fiscal and cost restraints.
“I don’t think we’re undoing the will of the people as much as we are contemplating what the financial impact may be,” State Sen. Tony Sorrentino of the Elkhorn area said in late March.
But opponents regularly questioned the message to “working families” and made the fight personal, especially for Raybould and other business owners.
“We can see by opening the door to undermining the will of the people under the auspices of so-called ‘technical corrections,’ it has opened a Pandora’s box to completely defy the will of the people,” State Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln said the same day Sorrentino spoke.
‘Nebraska: We do not like competition’
Two other labor fights moved more quickly, including a pair from freshman State Sen. Bob Hallstrom of Syracuse, and led to the gnashing of senators’ teeth early in the session.

Hallstrom’s first bill classified rideshare drivers for Uber, Lyft and Door Dash as independent contractors, locking workers out from some employee-based protections for discussing organizing into unions (Legislative Bill 229), while the other increased the legal threshold to sue companies after cybersecurity breaches, protecting businesses from lawsuits unless they showed “willful, wanton or gross negligence” in securing data (LB 241).
The fights repeatedly drove a wedge between some progressives in the legislative minority and Raybould, who also joined 32 Republicans on the rideshare and cybersecurity bills over filibusters.
Conrad and State Sen. Terrell McKinney of Omaha, both progressives, viewed the Hallstrom bills as part of an emerging theme of being hostile to labor as the pushes to change voter-led laws waited in the wings.

McKinney on March 4, during debate on a smaller fight over liquor licenses designed to help in-state distillers, said the state was reaching a new slogan: “Nebraska: We do not like competition.”
“It’s either competition or helping out corporations,” McKinney said at the time.
State Sen. Dan Quick of Grand Island, one of two Democratic lawmakers representing Trump-won districts, led the distillery measure that Raybould opposed to the point of seeking an attorney general’s opinion. She argued Quick’s proposal would have given “preferential treatment” to in-state operators and could entangle other liquor laws and lead to lawsuits. The bill passed 33-13.
Conrad on Feb. 4 called out “palpable disdain both for the voters of Nebraska and for working families,” and on March 6 she said “anti-worker legislation” was moving “at record pace.”
Legislature’s referendum power
Hallstrom, a former longtime lobbyist who had worked around the statehouse since 1981 when he graduated from the University of Nebraska College of Law, defended his legislation as helping protect “flexible work” for rideshare drivers. He said it would help working families. He said his other bill limiting lawsuits after data breaches would cut back on “speculative risks” that he argued could strain judicial resources or cost businesses.

Hallstrom said he doesn’t buy into the criticisms of him and others that they had advanced “anti-worker legislation” or pushed back on voters. 
Instead, Hallstrom and Raybould repeatedly pointed to the Nebraska Constitution, as amended by the voters in 2004, that gives the Legislature the ability to amend voter-approved laws with at least 33 votes. Voters set the 33-vote threshold that year, moving it up from a simple majority.
“Not only have the people spoken with regard to the specific statutory initiatives regarding minimum wage and paid sick leave, but they’ve spoken just as loudly to the authority of the Legislature to make revisions where deemed appropriate and necessary,” Hallstrom told the Examiner.
Finding a ‘balanced approach’
Raybould was among those who repeatedly said senators in the majority were standing up for a “balanced approach” to “good policy,” which she and others argued would better help keep Nebraskans safe, healthy and employed with benefits and competitive wages.
  State Sen. Jane Raybould of Lincoln. Jan. 9, 2023. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska News Service)
Her minimum wage proposal sought to slow the annual rate at which the state’s minimum wage increases beginning in 2027, rather than increasing it based on inflation as voters mandated. Raybould’s measure would also carve out teen workers, aged 14 or 15, for a “youth minimum wage.”
“You have to always balance it out to make sure that we maintain the economic vitality and vibrancy and economic growth in our state without falling off and creating a cycle of cost increases that are so much harder for Nebraska families to be able to afford,” Raybould said in April.
Raybould took barbs from colleagues she usually agrees with, including Conrad. In March, Conrad urged her “friends on the left,” primarily Raybould, to renege from what she called an “ongoing assault on working families and workers’ rights” that were “undermining your values.”
“You claim to support civil rights. You claim to support human rights,” Conrad said. “Yet, without economic justice, Nebraskans have no opportunity to be empowered to exercise those.”
Raybould has decided to not seek reelection in 2026. She said her decision was not related to the “rather brutal” 2025 session or her minimum wage bill.
‘Making it so that it will work’
The paid sick leave law voters passed required sick leave to be paid to all employees beginning Oct. 1. But before the law takes effect, legislative changes led to passage by freshman State Sen. Paul Strommen of Sidney this spring will leave out teens aged 14 or 15, agricultural workers, independent contractors and businesses of 10 or fewer workers from the new requirement.
  State Sen. Paul Strommen of Sidney meets with his staff on the floor of the Nebraska Legislature. March 26, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
The back-and-forth was similar to that of minimum wage but featured a seemingly brief compromise in Strommen’s proposal that would have allowed more employees to be entitled to paid sick leave, including requiring it of businesses with 6-10 employees and for 14 or 15 year olds who are parents.
Strommen had said his measure recognized the “will of the voters, while also avoiding a few serious detriments to small businesses and workers and the Nebraska economy.”
But at the urging of State Sen. Mike Jacobson of North Platte, lawmakers reconsidered the “compromise.” It returned to the new Strommen requirements.
The majority yanked the “compromise” partly because the floor fight over the bill continued even after the changes had been adopted.
“We’re not taking away what the voters said they wanted. We’re making modifications to it,” Jacobson said in May. “We’re making it so that it will work for small businesses and for employers.”

The “compromise” would have also reinstated the voter-approved right for employees to sue to enforce the law, rather than solely relying on the Nebraska Department of Labor. Some lawmakers hope to revive that provision in 2026.
Employers can still choose to offer paid sick leave to any employee before the law takes effect Oct. 1, and employers can pay any employee above the state minimum wage, for that matter.
The way the public can petition the state government could also change as Strommen introduced an interim study to examine Nebraska’s ballot measure process, including possible statutory or constitutional tweaks.
Medical cannabis
The labor fights also played at least a small role in the defeat of efforts to tweak medical cannabis laws to legalize and regulate the drug, which voters approved in November. 
But unlike the paid sick leave and minimum wage proposals, longtime advocates for medical cannabis, including those who led the 2024 campaign, had supported and asked for the legislative changes.
Cavanaugh was among those helping negotiate a path forward for the bill while Kauth worked with the Nebraska Attorney General’s Office on a hemp-related ban that some worried could ensnare the new legal framework for medical cannabis.

Some conservatives, including State Sen. Tanya Storer of Whitman, described the lawmakers’ efforts on medical cannabis as “political theater,” saying the proposal was meant to get around lawsuits, which have so far failed.
Storer and State Sen. Bob Andersen of north-central Sarpy County were among senators blasting progressives for embracing changes to the voter-approved medical cannabis legislation yet deriding conservatives for pursuing changes to the voter-approved laws on paid sick leave and minimum wage.
“This bill’s unnecessary, inappropriate, undermines the will of the people and implements recreational marijuana,” Andersen said at the time.

Progressives, including State Sen. John Fredrickson of Omaha, who similarly opposed the minimum wage and paid sick leave legislative bills, contended that cannabis would not “leap off the shelves” and corrupt Nebraska youths, as some opponents had suggested. 
He said senators, sometimes, needed to go outside and “touch some grass and just think about what the world is like outside of this room.”
“Let’s not get too concerned about ‘fighting against the will of the people,’” Fredrickson continued. “Let’s help shape it. Let’s help put in the right guardrails in place, and let’s help build a system that we can be proud of and puts our patients first.”
Ongoing budget balancing
Minimum wage, paid sick leave and medical cannabis could all return in 2026, as could major adjustments to Nebraska’s 2025-27 budget.
Lawmakers began the 2025 session trying to juggle a $432 million projected hole but needed to cover even more after an economic forecast in April estimated fewer state receipts for the next two years.
  State Sen. Rob Clements of Elmwood. Jan. 8, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Lawmakers juggled roughly $850 million in changes, such as creating new revenue streams, cutting state spending, scrounging for loose dollars in state cash funds and dipping into the state’s “rainy day” fund. In the end, they finished the session with $4.15 million to spare.
“It seemed like an insurmountable mountain to climb, but we did it, and we also did not cut essential services,” State Sen. Rob Clements of Elmwood, Appropriations Committee chair, said after the budget passed in May.
Still, the budget fight isn’t over. Just last week, revised fiscal estimates, including receipts coming $86 million short in May and June, returned the two-year state budget to a nearly $100 million deficit that will need fixing.
Speaker John Arch of La Vista identified the state budget as the top issue of 2025 before the session began, and he has said it again will be top of mind in 2026.
Arch had told his colleagues to prepare for and be mindful if there is an economic shift before 2026, notably in state receipts or via the federal government. 
Those urgings came before the latest state projections and before Congress passed President Donald Trump’s “one big beautiful bill” that could cut Nebraska’s share of Medicaid dollars and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits.
  State Sen. Wendy DeBoer of Omaha. Jan. 23, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Gov. Jim Pillen, who, along with all of Nebraska’s congressional delegation, supported the federal bill, has said the state is “prepared” if federal funding stalls or slows, which he called “our job.” But he has taken a different approach than recent GOP governors in trying to draw down “more than our fair share” of federal dollars.
Also likely to be considered as part of the 2026 budget debate will be Pillen’s attempted line-item vetoes from the end of the 2025 session, the official copies of which were delivered to the wrong office in May, which lawmakers said made the attempted vetoes null and void. 
Next year will also feature a new Pillen goal to state agencies under his control: Cut 10% from the just-approved $5.5 billion annual spending.
State Sen. Wendy DeBoer of Omaha had compared the budget state lawmakers approved in 2025 to the fairy tale “The Emperor’s New Clothes,” where the ruler is naked but his subjects pretend he has extravagant clothing. She said the budget, which she opposed, was “based on a number of sleight of hands.”
“It is not actually balanced,” DeBoer said in May. “We’re just making it look like it’s balanced.”



Oher 2025 items of note
Among other major legislation in 2025:

Property taxes — For the third time in a row, lawmakers rejected attempts to shift some of the burden from local property taxes onto currently sales tax-exempt goods and services. The governor has acknowledged that the failure to pass more property tax relief in 2025 could lead to increased property tax bills as lawmakers hope to address the perennial issue in 2026. In the meantime, a new School Financing Review Commission will meet and soon begin suggesting long-term solutions.
Social media and cellphones — Lawmakers approved age verification for all social media sites, beginning July 1, 2026; implemented new social media design features meant to protect children and required school districts to adopt policies with the goal of banning most student cellphone use on school grounds. The creation of child sexual abuse material using artificial intelligence will also soon be prohibited in the state.
Juvenile justice — A broad “public safety” package included a bill from State Sen. Merv Riepe of Ralston, at the request of Gov. Jim Pillen, to allow the detention of younger juveniles, as young as 11, down from 13. All temporary and alternative placement options must be exhausted before a child aged 11 or 12 can be detained.
Legislative oversight — A new legislative division and committee was created in a multiyear standoff with the executive branch over legislative oversight of child welfare and corrections.
School retirement — Questions over whether the state should continue contributing to public employees’ retirement funds when obligations are fully funded came to a head with the Governor’s Office fighting with the Nebraska State Education Association and a flareup among Lincoln lawmakers. In the end, school employees received a benefit if obligations are nearly or fully funded, leading to more take-home pay in the upcoming year and a smaller cost for the state.
A new state department — Beginning July 1, the Nebraska Department of Water, Energy and Environment was established from the merger of the former Nebraska Department of Natural Resources and the former Nebraska Department of Environment and Energy.

But now that President Donald Trump’s signature tax and spending law bars students from borrowing more than $50,000 annually in unsubsidized federal loans for medical school, Bonner is worried her dream of becoming a doctor is financially out of reach.
“I get told, ‘Well, we really need you. We have a physician shortage, and you’ve done all this work leading up to this point,’ and that’s true as well, and it’s not that I want to quit,” Bonner said in a recent interview. “But there are no systems in place that I can rely on to support me now that I can’t take out the full cost of living through loans.”
The tax and spending law includes provisions that significantly alter the student loan process for higher education. The law halts current student loan repayment plans for loans that are granted on or after July 1, 2026. On that date, the law also terminates Grad PLUS loans, which have helped people pay for their higher education degrees and total cost of attendance. Current borrowers will be grandfathered in.
The federal law gives current borrowers enrolled in loan repayment plans for students based on income — such as those plans known as SAVE or IBR — until July 1, 2028, to switch to a new plan. Interest collection will resume Aug. 1 for students enrolled in the Biden-era SAVE plan.
At the same time, medical or law school students hoping to get unsubsidized federal loans — in which the borrower is responsible for paying the interest at all times rather than the government — will only be able to borrow $50,000 per year, with a $200,000 lifetime cap. Those seeking advanced degrees in areas such as history or philosophy have a $100,000 lifetime cap.

The average yearly cost of medical school for the 2024-25 academic year ranged from around $42,000 to $72,000, depending on whether the school was private or public and whether the student was a resident or nonresident, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges.
Some congressional Republicans say that students need to be working harder to pay for higher education, like medical school, on their own. Others say the caps put the onus back on colleges and universities to rein in the rising cost of tuition. But critics of this legislation say the loan caps are only going to harm students, especially from lower-income backgrounds, and will exacerbate physician shortages.
In recent years states have tried to ease physician shortages by implementing various policy solutions. Since 2023, at least nine states have made it easier for doctors trained in other countries to get medical licenses. States have also participated in interstate licensing compacts, allowing nurses and physician assistants to travel across state lines to work, so long as they are licensed in one state within the compact.
For student loan relief, more than 20 states have enacted legislation to address student loan forgiveness, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, a group that tracks states policies. Georgia passed a measure that will expand a cancelable loan program for physicians working in rural and underserved areas. Idaho also created the Rural Nursing Loan Repayment Program, offering nurses $25,000 in forgivable loans after three years of service in a rural area.

McKenzie Richards, a health care policy fellow at the conservative think tank Cicero Institute who has been studying the pace of physician shortages, told Stateline that the national physician shortage could potentially exceed 100,000 by 2034. At the end of 2024 that projected number was closer to 64,000 physicians.
Richards said states will be looking toward more policy solutions should the student loan changes exacerbate physician shortages.
“We know what’s going to be happening coming down the line in just five years, so I think policies that states can adopt to get out of this are really important to be looking at now,” she said.
“The hope is that by capping [federal loans], it will encourage schools to lower tuition prices,” Richards added. “Then maybe they need to be admitting more students, which would have a great downstream effect for getting more doctors through.”
Other students will be in the same boat, said Lesley Turner, an associate professor of public policy at the University of Chicago and an economist.
“This is going to hit some students worse than others,” Turner told Stateline. “Those [students] in more expensive programs tend to borrow more, and so for those students they will need to return to private student loans or other ways of financing their graduate education.”
Many students were already questioning their capacity to go to medical school before the student loan caps, said Shannon Jimenez, dean of the Arkansas College of Osteopathic Medicine.
“I expect that this bill, this cap, is going to push people out of primary care and into specialties to help pay off those higher interest rate loans,” Jimenez told Stateline. She added that caps will likely deter students from lower socioeconomic statuses from going into primary care — important in places like Arkansas, where she says there is a “maldistribution of physicians.”
“Many schools like us try to attract those students, because they’re more likely to go into primary care and serve in underserved areas. So it’s going to tie our hands in a lot of ways.”

Large states and more rural states will feel the gaps more deeply, said Richards, of the Cicero Institute. Louisiana, for example, is projected to be short almost 5,000 doctors from a variety of specialties by 2030, including close to 400 primary care doctors. Already more than a third of Louisiana physicians are close to retirement age — similar to the situation in neighboring Arkansas.
As for whether schools will just be able to lower tuition, Jimenez said, “it makes no sense.”
“We still function in a somewhat market-driven economy and have to compete with other schools around us, so our cost is based mostly on what we have to pay our faculty, and that’s not going to go down,” she said. The annual cost of attendance at her school is between $80,000 and $85,000.
Bonner, the EMT, holds a political communications degree from Regent University and now is studying biomedical sciences at Old Dominion University. She already has $20,000 in loans, she said, and for the rest of college tuition, she has paid out of pocket. Since she’s supporting herself, she hasn’t been able to save much.
She’d planned to take the medical school entrance exam next spring, but now worries about how she’d pay for living expenses while attending. “Medical school scheduling doesn’t allow for working, so you have to take out loans for living expenses,” she said.
“A lot of people, I feel, would be panicked if you had worked for eight to 10 years of your life and found out that all the systems that you were banking on in a really academically challenging space are disappearing,” Bonner said.
“I don’t see a path forward for certain, but I’m fighting to make one.”

After months of  uncertainty and scrambling, we’re now told the funds are coming — but too late to avoid the  chaos caused by the delay. 
Most administrators I’ve spoken with in North Dakota were prepared to make things work  without these funds if they believed their students would still benefit. That’s the “we’ll make it  work” attitude that defines rural communities. However, with property tax caps imposed by state  law, declining enrollment, and the constant uncertainty surrounding federal funding, these same  administrators are bracing for a tough spring in 2026. The challenge is not just funding; it’s how  we attract and retain teachers in these conditions. 
US Education Department to unfreeze contested K-12 funds

Rural schools, students, and communities have always shown remarkable resilience in the face of  adversity. But this federal funding freeze and subsequent late reinstatement doesn’t just impact  the budgets — it undermines the stability that families in rural areas rely on. Schools in North  Dakota have been left trying to piece together plans without knowing if they would have the  funding to pay for essential services. Educators have had to delay hiring, adjust programs, and  scale back on services they knew were crucial for their students’ success. As Kirsten Baesler  notified us Friday at 10:56 p.m., these funds are now back in the mix, but how many late-night announcements do we need before we realize the impact of this uncertainty on our rural communities? 
Rural schools don’t run on “maybe.” We plan carefully and rely on these federal funds to provide  essential services, from migrant education to after-school programs. But when we’re told to wait,  then suddenly rush to use funds months late, it only makes the work harder and more uncertain. We need stability. It’s time for the federal government to recognize that rural schools can’t  function on last-minute decisions and delayed promises. Our kids deserve better than this.",https://northdakotamonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/GettyImages-115093584-scaled-1-1024x680.jpeg,,,2025-07-28 06:56:52.622386

(Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)This story was originally published by Stateline.
Despite Trump administration rhetoric accusing Democrats of protecting violent criminals and drug-dealing immigrants, the administration’s arrests have been catching a smaller share of criminals overall, and a smaller share of people convicted of violent and drug crimes, than the Biden administration did in the same time frame.
While the Trump administration has caught more immigrants with convictions for drugs and violence, their share of the rising arrest numbers is smaller, as more people get swept up for minor traffic violations or strictly immigration crimes, according to a Stateline analysis.
Forty percent of the nearly 112,000 arrests by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) from Jan. 20 through late June were of convicted criminals. That’s compared with 53% of the nearly 51,000 arrests for same time period in 2024 under the Biden administration.
 
The share of people convicted of violent crime fell from 10% to 7% and drug crimes from 9% to 5%, according to a Stateline analysis of data from the Deportation Data Project.
The project, led by attorneys and professors in California, Maryland and New York, collects and posts public, anonymized U.S. government immigration enforcement datasets obtained through Freedom of Information Act requests.
Some Democratic states are among those with the highest share of violent criminals in this year’s ICE arrests: Hawaii (15%), Vermont (13%), and California and Nebraska (12%) — while some of the lowest shares were in more Republican states: Maine (2%), and Alabama, Montana and Wyoming (3%).
Immigration attorneys see an increased push to arrest and detain immigrants for any type of violation or pending charge as President Donald Trump pushes for higher arrest and detention numbers to meet his campaign promise for mass deportation. Trump officials have called for 3,000 arrests a day, far more than the current average of 711 as of June and 321 a day during the same time period under Biden.










The majority of recent ICE detentions involve people with no convictions. That’s a pattern I find troubling.


– Oregon Republican state Rep. Cyrus Javadi


Arrests have accelerated since about mid-May, when government attorneys began asking to revoke bail and arrest people who show up for court hearings after being released at the border, said Vanessa Dojaquez-Torres, practice and policy counsel for the American Immigration Lawyers Association, which represents more than 16,000 immigration attorneys.
“We’re not completely sure what the reasoning or the goal is behind some of these policies, other than they want detention numbers up,” Dojaquez-Torres said.
“They seem to have really been struggling to get their deportation numbers up, and so I think that’s one of the reasons why we see a lot of these policies going into effect that are meant to kind of circumvent the immigration court process and due process.”
Arrests of people convicted of violent crimes increased by 45% from about 5,300 to 7,700 compared with last year. For drug crimes, the increase was 21% — and they fell as a share of total arrests, from 9% under the Biden administration to 5% this year.
U.S. Rep. Gabe Evans misrepresented family’s immigration history

Arrests for those not convicted of any crime nearly tripled to about 67,000, and increased from 47% to 60% of arrests.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security defended ICE arrests Wednesday. Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that the agency was “targeting dangerous criminal illegal aliens and taking them off American streets. Violent thugs ICE arrested include child pedophiles, drug traffickers, and burglars.”
In Oregon, arrests during the first part of last year increased from 51 under the Biden administration to 227 under the Trump administration, with those not convicted of any crime increasing from 34 to 137. Those with convictions for violent crime increased from 3 to 16. Even some Republicans are concerned with the new emphasis on non-criminals.
“The majority of recent ICE detentions involve people with no convictions. That’s a pattern I find troubling, especially when it risks sweeping up people for things like expired tags or missed court dates,” said Oregon state Rep. Cyrus Javadi, a moderate Republican representing Tillamook and Clatsop counties.
Nationally, nonviolent crimes have risen as a share of immigration arrests. The most common crime conviction for those arrested this year is driving while intoxicated, which was also the top offense last year under Biden.
But this year it’s closely followed by general traffic offenses, which rose to second place from sixth place, surpassing such crimes as assault and drug trafficking.
Traffic offenses, outside of driving while intoxicated and hit and run, rose almost fourfold as the most serious conviction on record for those arrested, the largest increase in the top 10. Those offenses were followed by increases in the immigration crime of illegal entry, meaning crossing the border in secret, which tripled.
The increase in traffic violations as a source of immigration arrests is a reason for cities to consider limiting traffic stops, said Daniela Gilbert, director of the Redefining Public Safety Initiative at the Vera Institute of Justice, a nonprofit devoted to ending mass incarceration.
“It’s an important point to consider intervening in so that there can be less interaction, and so ICE has less opportunity to continue its indiscriminate dragnet of enforcement,” Gilbert said.
The institute argues in general that traffic stops should be limited to safety issues rather than low-level infractions such as expired registrations or single burned-out taillights, both because they do not improve public safety and because they disproportionately affect drivers of color.
Such policies limiting stops under some conditions are in place in 10 states and in cities in six other states, according to the institute.
The most recent state polices took effect last year in California and Illinois, while a policy is set to take effect in October in Connecticut. The most recent city policies were in Denver and in East Lansing and Ypsilanti, Michigan. Six other states have considered legislation recently.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)A coalition of media groups, including the Tennessee Lookout, is challenging a new state law making it a crime to come within 25 feet of a law enforcement officer after being told to stay back.  
Tennessee’s so-called “buffer” law lays out scenarios in which reporters or others approaching police may be arrested and charged with a misdemeanor.
They include situations in which an officer is conducting a traffic stop, working the scene of an alleged crime or handling “an ongoing and immediate threat to public safety.” The law does not require an intent by journalists to disrupt police activity and gives officers discretion to decide when to order reporters and photographers to stay away. 
Bill expanding Tennessee law enforcement powers during protests draws pushback

The law has “grave implications” for the ability of journalists and news organizations to exercise their First Amendment rights, the lawsuit said. 
“The Act authorizes law enforcement officers to bar journalists (and the public) from reporting — for any reason and no reason — on a wide range of events of public interest, including a parade, a rally, and arrest or an accident scene,” the complaint said. 
“The Act applies with equal force to a reporter gathering the news in a park, standing on a sidewalk or lawfully present in other spaces open to the public,” it said. 
The lawsuit is seeking a judgment that the law violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments and an injunction blocking the law, which took effect July 1, from being enforced against the media organizations filing suit.
In addition to the Lookout, the Nashville Banner, Gannett, Scripps Media and TEGNA are plaintiffs in the suit, represented by Paul McAdoo and Grayson Clary of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press. The organization has successfully obtained preliminary injuctions against similar laws in Louisiana and Indiana.

Wisconsin Books to Prisoners and the Wisconsin Department of Corrections plan a second test of having books sent to incarcerated people. (Photo courtesy of Wisconsin Department of Corrections)  The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
The nonprofit Wisconsin Books to Prisoners told the Wisconsin Examiner that another pilot project involving the nonprofit and the Wisconsin Department of Corrections will take place in the next three to four weeks. 
The collaborations between the nonprofit and the department might lead to the books project being permitted to send used books to people incarcerated in prisons across the state. 
The department said last year that it could no longer accept used books from anyone, including the nonprofit. The DOC cited concerns about drug smuggling and alleged that some book shipments tested positive for drugs. This led to scrutiny of the department’s rationale for the used book ban. 
“We have hundreds of requests for books that haven’t been fulfilled since the only-new-books policy was established,” Camy Matthay of Wisconsin Books to Prisoners said over email. 
In an August 2024 email to the books project, a DOC official said the concern was not with the nonprofit but with people who would impersonate it. 
In late June, the books project organizers said they were able to send used and new books to Oakhill Correctional Institution in a pilot program. The books were added to the library collection, making them available for checkout by those who requested them. 
DOC communications director Beth Hardtke said the pilot program was designed to allow the DOC to test and refine its screening process for donated reading materials to ensure safety. 
Hardtke said that between 2019 and 2023, 20 incarcerated people died of drug overdoses in DOC facilities, while none have died of drug overdoses in 2024 or so far in 2025. She also cited a study about harmful effects that can occur when incarcerated people are exposed to drug-soaked paper strips. 
“The goal is to eventually allow WBTP to send reading materials to individuals at any DOC facility — safely,” Hardtke said in late June. 
Hardtke said at the time that starting July 1, WBTP would be able to send requested materials directly to individuals at Oakhill instead of the library.
Instead, the DOC has asked for a second pilot, Matthay said. For that, the books project will send books to a library at a second prison. Matthay said this pilot will take place in the next three to four weeks. 
“Should our books pass inspection without issues at prison number two, WBTP hopes to return to fulfilling our mission, i.e., sending books directly to prisoners who request books from us,” Matthay said. 
She said the group is not likely to return to sending books to prisoners directly before September. 
Matthay said that per the DOC’s request, the group will no longer fulfill requests for specific titles. Instead, prisoners are asked to request books by subject matter or genre. 
She said the group provides tracking numbers that will validate the source of the books, and that the nonprofit will also include embossed receipts. 
According to Wisconsin Books to Prisoners, in August 2024, the group asked the DOC if the organization could resolve the concerns about impersonation by providing a postal service tracking number for every package of books it ships. 
Hardtke said the department recognizes the importance of education and books as part of rehabilitation and maintains libraries at all institutions, offers books on electronic tablets and has educational partnerships with the University of Wisconsin System and the state’s technical colleges. 
Critics have raised questions about the quality of the selection on the tablets and whether the quality of the libraries varies by institution. 
Matthay said that when boxes of books have been returned to the nonprofit over the years, the cause was confusion in the mailrooms. 
In late June, the nonprofit said that many of the packages of new books sent to prisoners had been returned to the group. Sending new books to prisoners is not banned by the DOC. 
“We think this problem will resolve itself,” Matthay said, as the DOC establishes better lines of communication between the agency’s headquarters and the institutions that take in the books. 
“The DOC understands that this will improve security for WBTP as well as the DOC,” Matthay said. She added that “it is also understood that when these pilots are completed and if we get a greenlight, that the new policy — whatever that may be — needs to be clearly communicated to all employees (and prisoners too) to avoid confusion.”

While the Trump administration has caught more immigrants with convictions for drugs and violence, their share of the rising arrest numbers is smaller, as more people get swept up for minor traffic violations or strictly immigration crimes, according to a Stateline analysis.
Forty percent of the nearly 112,000 arrests by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) from Jan. 20 through late June were of convicted criminals. That’s compared with 53% of the nearly 51,000 arrests for same time period in 2024 under the Biden administration.
The share of people convicted of violent crime fell from 10% to 7% and drug crimes from 9% to 5%, according to a Stateline analysis of data from the Deportation Data Project.
The project, led by attorneys and professors in California, Maryland and New York, collects and posts public, anonymized U.S. government immigration enforcement datasets obtained through Freedom of Information Act requests.
Some Democratic states are among those with the highest share of violent criminals in this year’s ICE arrests: Hawaii (15%), Vermont (13%), and California and Nebraska (12%) — while some of the lowest shares were in more Republican states: Maine (2%), and Alabama, Montana and Wyoming (3%).
Immigration attorneys see an increased push to arrest and detain immigrants for any type of violation or pending charge as President Donald Trump pushes for higher arrest and detention numbers to meet his campaign promise for mass deportation. Trump officials have called for 3,000 arrests a day, far more than the current average of 711 as of June and 321 a day during the same time period under Biden.










The majority of recent ICE detentions involve people with no convictions. That’s a pattern I find troubling.


– Oregon Republican state Rep. Cyrus Javadi


Arrests have accelerated since about mid-May, when government attorneys began asking to revoke bail and arrest people who show up for court hearings after being released at the border, said Vanessa Dojaquez-Torres, practice and policy counsel for the American Immigration Lawyers Association, which represents more than 16,000 immigration attorneys.
“We’re not completely sure what the reasoning or the goal is behind some of these policies, other than they want detention numbers up,” Dojaquez-Torres said.
“They seem to have really been struggling to get their deportation numbers up, and so I think that’s one of the reasons why we see a lot of these policies going into effect that are meant to kind of circumvent the immigration court process and due process.”
Arrests of people convicted of violent crimes increased by 45% from about 5,300 to 7,700 compared with last year. For drug crimes, the increase was 21% — and they fell as a share of total arrests, from 9% under the Biden administration to 5% this year.
Arrests for those not convicted of any crime nearly tripled to about 67,000, and increased from 47% to 60% of arrests.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security defended ICE arrests Wednesday. Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that the agency was “targeting dangerous criminal illegal aliens and taking them off American streets. Violent thugs ICE arrested include child pedophiles, drug traffickers, and burglars.”
In Oregon, arrests during the first part of last year increased from 51 under the Biden administration to 227 under the Trump administration, with those not convicted of any crime increasing from 34 to 137. Those with convictions for violent crime increased from 3 to 16. Even some Republicans are concerned with the new emphasis on non-criminals.
“The majority of recent ICE detentions involve people with no convictions. That’s a pattern I find troubling, especially when it risks sweeping up people for things like expired tags or missed court dates,” said Oregon state Rep. Cyrus Javadi, a moderate Republican representing Tillamook and Clatsop counties.
Nationally, nonviolent crimes have risen as a share of immigration arrests. The most common crime conviction for those arrested this year is driving while intoxicated, which was also the top offense last year under Biden.
But this year it’s closely followed by general traffic offenses, which rose to second place from sixth place, surpassing such crimes as assault and drug trafficking.
Traffic offenses, outside of driving while intoxicated and hit and run, rose almost fourfold as the most serious conviction on record for those arrested, the largest increase in the top 10. Those offenses were followed by increases in the immigration crime of illegal entry, meaning crossing the border in secret, which tripled.
The increase in traffic violations as a source of immigration arrests is a reason for cities to consider limiting traffic stops, said Daniela Gilbert, director of the Redefining Public Safety Initiative at the Vera Institute of Justice, a nonprofit devoted to ending mass incarceration.
“It’s an important point to consider intervening in so that there can be less interaction, and so ICE has less opportunity to continue its indiscriminate dragnet of enforcement,” Gilbert said.
The institute argues in general that traffic stops should be limited to safety issues rather than low-level infractions such as expired registrations or single burned-out taillights, both because they do not improve public safety and because they disproportionately affect drivers of color.
Such policies limiting stops under some conditions are in place in 10 states and in cities in six other states, according to the institute.
The most recent state polices took effect last year in California and Illinois, while a policy is set to take effect in October in Connecticut. The most recent city policies were in Denver and in East Lansing and Ypsilanti, Michigan. Six other states have considered legislation recently.

(Photo Courtesy of Vibrant Health Products, Inc.)Canada-based baked goods company Vibrant Health Products will invest $48.5 million in its first U.S. manufacturing plant in Fayette County, pledging to create 394 jobs in the next five years, the company announced Friday.
Vibrant Health Products selected Rossville — a town of about 1,200 residents near the southwest border of Fayette and Shelby counties in West Tennessee — as its U.S. manufacturing location. 
The company will move into Rossville’s former Kellogg Company’s Eggo plant. Kellogg closed the plant in 2024, laying off 142 workers.
“This is a transformative moment for Rossville and our surrounding communities,” Fayette County Mayor Rhea “Skip” Taylor and Rossville Mayor Judy Watters said in a joint statement. “The acquisition of our former Kellogg facility by Vibrant Health Partners breathes new life into a vital part of our local economy while creating hundreds of quality jobs for our residents.”
The mayors also said the project “underscores the resilience and potential of our community.”
The company received incentives from the state, but the details of the deal are not immediately clear.
Vibrant Health Products will begin with bread production at the new site with plans to expand to other baked goods. 
The brand produces a variety of health-focused baked goods, including organic, gluten-free, grain-free, non-GMO, plant-based, paleo and keto options. Its main operations are located in Abbotsford, British Columbia, Canada.
“Our new bakery in Tennessee will help us increase production so we can welcome new customers and sustain strategic relationships, explore new possibilities for innovation, broaden our business in new product categories, create stable jobs on both sides of the border and pursue every opportunity to share our healthier products with the world,” Vibrant Health Products President and co-founder Stan Smith said in a Friday news release.

Nathan Toman, R-Mandan, chair of the Legislative Task Force on Government Efficiency, speaks during a subcommittee hearing of the Budget Section on June 25, 2025. (Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota’s version of DOGE is poised to begin work this week, but members say it won’t be just like the federal government version that inspired it.
“The federal thing seems to be ‘Gotcha. I caught you doing something wrong,’ instead of looking at what are our outcomes and how to do things better,” said Senate Minority Leader Kathy Hogan, D-Fargo.
North Dakota lawmakers this year established the Legislative Task Force on Government Efficiency, similar to the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency. The 10-member group meets for the first time Wednesday to begin looking for potential efficiencies in state government.
Rep. Nathan Toman, R-Mandan, who will chair the effort, said his goal for the task force is to work with state agencies to ensure they are running effectively. 
“We’re trying to view it as a partnership saying, ‘We want to help you guys succeed and we want the employees to succeed,’” Toman said. 
The first meeting will include presentations from the departments of Health and Human Services, Information Technology and Commerce. Joe Morrissette, director of the Office of Management and Budget, said those agencies, along with higher education and K-12 education, have some of the largest budgets.
“If the end result is going to be an impact on the overall state budget, you’ve got to look at those big areas,” Morrissette said.
  (Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)
North Dakota’s task force will not have Elon Musk’s chainsaw, with DOGE seeking out savings without the approval of Congress. The state version will submit a report before the 2027 legislative session that details possible cost savings, plus recommended legislation.
Toman also said the executive branch members of the task force may be able to take action to adjust some programs, if those changes are allowed under state law without needing additional legislation.
Lawmakers earlier this year approved a state budget of $20.3 billion for 2025-27, including federal and other funds. Toman said he believes the task force could find more than $1 billion in cost savings, though he said a more realistic goal would be saving hundreds of millions.
Toman said examples of efficiencies could include reducing funding allocated to programs, cutting staffing levels, reevaluating state partnerships with vendors and streamlining processes.
He added the task force will be looking at federal funding cuts to the state and their effects on state programs and agencies.
State Auditor Josh Gallion, one of the members, said he hopes the task force reduces redundancies and improves outcomes.
“But I also think we have to have a goal of reducing overall spending,” Gallion said. “Our state budget, the growth that we’ve had over the last decade is just not sustainable.”

Morrissette, also a member of the task force, said finding government program efficiency does not always mean finding things to cut.
“I hope the committee has an open mind when we look at things because there could be some opportunities where in order to do something better and be more effective, it may cost more resources,” he said. 
For example, he said his office recently hired a leasing agent for government facilities to take the leasing burden off of state agencies. The office also added a state construction supervisor so all state construction projects are handled under one roof, making it more efficient.
“I think long-term, we’ll save millions over time by having better negotiation on leases and better negotiation on construction managing fees,” Morrissette said.
Jonathan Casper, a former Fargo-area state senator and business owner, is the only person on the task force not currently serving in state government. He said he doesn’t expect the state task force will find misuses of programs and funds, but it can still look for efficiencies in government.
“North Dakota is constitutionally required to balance its budget. The federal government doesn’t,” Casper said. “Until such time as the federal government does, I think having something like DOGE on the federal level is different than on the state level.”
House Bill 1442, which created the task force, calls for the group to meet at least once every three months and operate until July 31, 2031.




Members of the Legislative Task Force on Government Efficiency are:

Rep. Nathan Toman, R-Mandan, chair
Sen. Chuck Walen, R-New Town, vice chair
Rep. Glenn Bosch, R-Bismarck

It also touched on where he stands on issues such as immigration, Medicaid expansion, “school choice,” and his affinity for President Donald Trump.","Thomas Duff has used his wealth from a tire empire he and his brother created to become a political power broker and sought-after philanthropist. 
Duff, of Hattiesburg, has been involved in state politics, but only peripherally or behind the scenes. Now, the tire baron is considering a political run of his own. His entrance into the 2027 Republican primary for governor could reshape a field of candidates likely to include several statewide officials. 
Duff served an eight-year stint on the state Institutions of Higher Learning Board, first appointed by former Gov. Phil Bryant. He has been a major contributor to many Republican campaigns in Mississippi, and earlier this year formed and funded a political action committee to help elect Republicans to city and legislative offices. He and his brother are major supporters of higher education and have donated millions to Mississippi universities.
As he mulls a run for governor, the billionaire businessman sat for a wide-ranging interview with Mississippi Today.
The conversation spanned his business philosophy, support for tariffs, concerns about Mississippi’s “brain drain,” and his investments in the state’s higher education system. It also touched on where he stands on issues such as immigration, Medicaid expansion, “school choice,” and his affinity for President Donald Trump.
The interview was conducted June 17 and has been edited for clarity and length.
Mississippi Today: Tell me about the moment when you knew that what you were building would grow far bigger than the family business your father had left you. When did you have a sense of the scale at which you were really working with? 
Thomas Duff: That’s a good question. Nobody’s ever asked me that before. When I got into our business, we were in very bad financial shape. Southern Tire Mart was a little company with about seven employees, losing money every month. My father was an attorney in Columbia. He loved business, but he was not active, he just liked to own them. I was finishing up a master’s degree in business, which I did not finish. So I was going to law school at Ole Miss and decided that I liked business much more than practicing law. So I said, ‘Can I stay on and just try to run this company?’ Because I grew up in high school working on tires, changing tires, retreading tires, being very involved in it. My dad said yes. And so I started, and that’s where we began. 
After I got involved in it and liked it, and frankly, started having some success in it, I would say, within about five to eight years after we began, I realized that this thing had potential. It’s really not a job, it’s an opportunity. And truthfully, I’ve never worked a day of my life because I’ve enjoyed being in business that much. 
Our business started with Southern Tire Mart. That has enabled us to be in other businesses and given opportunities. KLLM was a customer of Southern Tire Mart for many, many years, and it had undergone several ownership changes. It had gone public, it had gone back private. So we realized there were opportunities, and hopefully that it would be a profitable opportunity. And so we purchased other businesses that way, and that’s how we grew.
MT: Your core businesses require an integrated transportation ecosystem. Supply chain issues have now taken on a growing salience in our politics. Tell me about the evolution of supply chain issues, and your observations of debates surrounding onshoring versus offshoring that have come closer to the center of the political conversation. What has that been like to watch from your perspective?
Duff: We are uniquely affected by the supply situation. Also by the products that come from Asia and China, in particular. United States truck tire manufacturing only supplies about 70% of our needs in this country. So 30% have to come from outside the United States. So how do you deal with that? Where do you buy? What do you buy? Is it the right thing for customers to buy? 
It’s given us insights into how these foreign companies operate, and frankly, it’s not pleasing, because you see how so many of them have taken advantage of American laxity. Just being, frankly, lax in the way we operate in our supply management, it’s something that needs to be tightened up. We need more domestic manufacturing. There is the demand. There’s just not the manufacturing capacity. So our goal has been to try to increase that.

MT: With tariffs and trade policy being such a central element of political debate right now, what is your view on the trade-offs between free trade, getting products to market and protecting local industries? 
Duff: I think that’s a concern for a lot of people in Mississippi. I think we have watched American manufacturing be a serious problem for the last 25 years — it’s dissipated. We don’t have the trades and the things that we need. We are too dependent. 
But outside of supply chains, and we need to work on that, I have watched tariffs in the last few months be a good thing that’s happening. We approve of what President Trump is trying to do, because this mess existed long before he got here. He’s trying to correct it, and if we can correct it, which we will, it’ll take some short-term concerns, short-term hardships, but it’s going to be a long-term gain for our country. And I say that to you as a person who will probably pay more in tariffs, right? It will hit us hard. But is it going to be corrected? Yes, it will be. So, you know, we got into this mess over 20 or 30 years, it’s gonna take a little while to come out of it.
MT: What is your perspective then on short-term economic cost, let’s say, versus a longer-term structural fix in the economy. Mississippi is one of the poorest states in the country. How should people in a state like this who are working class perceive these sorts of trade-offs?
Duff: Obviously, it is a concern. The question is how much of a concern should it be to the average Mississippian? Again, this is a short-term situation. It will have great long-term benefits. And I think what President Trump is trying to do is appropriate, and it will be successful in the end. 
For example, when we had a 20% tariff here, the first time with President Trump’s presidency, our car prices went up three or four percent, what we found out was, in China, they’re more interested in employment and keeping those plants going than they are in profitability because they’re Chinese-owned anyway. It’s not like a normal company like I have that tries to show a profit. In China they’re trying to show employment. So when people talk about these tariffs and what they mean in pricing, we have no evidence that it’s going up that much. What we’re seeing is many manufacturers saying we’re reducing the amount of the increase and trying to work with the American consumer, that’s particularly true for the folks in Mississippi.
MT: You’ve said that retaining employees and attracting quality employees is a priority for you in business. As far as the labor market is concerned, how should Mississippians be thinking about immigration policy? How does reducing immigration impact the economy here in Mississippi?
Duff: You know, we value every person. Each is important for what they do and in their employment throughout our businesses, and frankly, throughout this state. Getting rid of people that have convictions, have problems that come from other countries, that should be one of the highest priorities of stopping the illegal immigration at the southern border. That is is very important, because we need that stability in our employment. 
We are doing well in finding qualified people to work, and I think that’s one of the reasons that we see a lower labor participation rate in our state, you’ve got to offer people good jobs. But you know what? You’ve got to do more than that. You’ve got to have appropriate child care. You’ve got to have good medical. You’ve got to have the things that attract people to say, ‘Hey, I desire to work.’ 
We need more Mississippians at work and we need to be more attractive in what we offer people. That’s very important, and that’s one of the greatest responsibilities that my brother and I have. Do we offer those types of opportunities? Employment wise, social wise. I mean, having proper nursery care, having proper health care is just as important as your wage in today’s world. 
MT: Sure. And to that end, let’s talk about the social safety net. Of course, private employers play an important role in providing access to health care, but there is a segment of Mississippians that may need to rely on the public benefits. Do you think Mississippi should expand Medicaid? 
Duff: You know, I think there are so many rules about Medicaid expansion, it’s hard to always say I’m in favor of it or not in favor of it. Do people need better medical care in the state of Mississippi? Yes, sir. Do more people need to be included in that? Yes, the health of our state is so important. So we have got to offer those things through businesses, through state assistance that helps all Mississippians have better health care. That’s got to be one of the top responsibilities that we all have. How it’s done in today’s changing political environment? I don’t know what to say, but I do know that it’s got to be of the highest importance, and we need to take care of all Mississippians.
MT: So what you’re saying is you’re neither wedded to expansion nor entirely against it? Are you saying you’re open to all options? 
Duff: I want to know the facts and the facts that are best for the people in Mississippi, and those facts have changed with a new president. So it’s hard to really say until we understand the changing political environment.  
MT: I want to ask you about your conception of “welfare” as well. It’s been a politically charged term for a long time, people have different ideas about what programs should be considered welfare. How do you think about welfare and how it relates to the safety net here?
Duff: Well, we need a safety net that’s appropriate and takes care of needs, especially for people who have those needs. We also need a system where people participate, where they’re paid adequately, where they can take care of their families and take care of themselves. 
So my definition of those things would be, if you can work, you need to work. And it’s not just working, it’s working at a higher level. Some people have jobs that they could easily go to someone else, and they could do higher-level jobs. Can you have a better education? Can you have workforce training? How can you maximize your potential in your job?
MT: You mentioned education and training. You and your brother have invested about $50 million in Mississippi universities. So higher education has been a focus of yours, and the issue of “brain drain” has been one of your central concerns. How would you propose that either yourself or others fix this brain drain issue in Mississippi?
Duff: The first thing we’ve got to do, and it’s not a simple answer, we need to have K-12 education that is excellent. And by having excellent education, you prepare people either for vocational jobs or for going into a four-year college route. But you’ve got to have the basics done. 
We have made rapid progress in that. The Mississippi Miracle is real, and we see that. But the real question is, as everybody else is getting better, can we keep our foot on the accelerator and continue to expand K-12? Now we go to vocational, which is so important. We were talking in a meeting this morning about the vocational needs and of some of our businesses, it’ll amaze you what we pay vocational employees, and I’m glad to see they do really well. They have great incomes, a good living. And I like seeing those things. And then we decide to go with the four-year college route, or however many years you decide to go to college, it is important that they receive a good education.

Education, I can tell you, having served eight years in the Institutions of Higher Learning, Mississippi provides a great education for the money spent, an excellent education. Now, the problem we have in our state is the fact that within three years, half of our college graduates are living somewhere else. That’s our problem. So we have got to start a development in our state of economic activity, and it’s going to come. 
Everybody thinks that we need to grow by hitting home runs and going and finding an Amazon or someone like that to come in. The best way to grow our economy is to take the small businesses and get to know them. There’s no one cookie cutter way for a person to go from seven employees to nine, right? I remember when I had seven employees. I’ve got 15,000 now. So you have to learn to adapt and grow. And if you grow your small businesses, you grow your communities. And if you grow your communities, you grow this state.
And you know, as someone who is one of those employers, we hire 50 college graduates a year in our training programs, in our companies, and it’s a great program. These people get great job opportunities, and frankly, our retention rate is excellent. But you know, it worries me when I have my meetings with these new folks and ask, “Where do you want to live? Why do you want to live there?” And the bulk of these students are from Mississippi colleges, and they say, I want to go to Nashville, Atlanta, Phoenix. I want to live somewhere else. And I’ve never had anybody come in and say, “I want to go live in Greenwood” or “I want to live somewhere around here.” And that concerns me, because we’re letting that problem happen. These are our best and brightest students, and we’re letting them go somewhere else. 
Shame on us for not having those opportunities. That’s what we’ve got to do to grow this state. Population wise, economic wise, social wise, when you have a state that’s prospering economically, you solve a lot of problems.
MT: Before we move on from K-12, do you think that taxpayer dollars should follow students to private schools? Do you think that undermines public education?
Duff: You know, the success of a community is its public school system and its school system, yet every parent deserves the opportunity to make sure their child has the best education that they can get. So is there a place for school choice? Yes, again, the definition of what school choice is goes from left to right, but the overriding consideration needs to be, every parent needs to have a very good hand in their child’s education. And whatever that means, we need to do. So we’re not scared of competing and having great schools, we want them. How does that need to be? I think that’s up to the community and the parent.
MT: Moving on to the Institutions of Higher Learning and politics. I know that most of the work of the IHL just relates to the functionality of the university system. But I want to ask you about your observations of higher education while serving in that capacity, because there’s no denying that college campuses have become a battleground for the culture wars in this state and in the country more broadly. Do you think the state government should play a more active role intervening and regulating the activity of campus life?
Duff: Mississippi pays a good part of the education of college graduates. They should have a say in it, but their say needs to be, how can this student receive the most comprehensive education? 
There’s certainly definitions between liberals and conservatives, what’s important, what’s not important. Some of that’s just part of growing up and learning how to operate. Overall, I would say that our schools present a wonderfully conservative balance of what to do. Two things that I think needs to be done is as I have watched students come in. 
When taxpayer dollars at four year colleges are having to be spent for math and reading and things like that to bring them up to a college level before they even start, that’s an indictment of our K-12 education, and we’ve got to do better in that. 
I (also) think it’s important that we learn more of our civic responsibilities. I don’t think that’s taught as much anymore. What it means to be an American, a Mississippian. What does it mean to be a future member of society, a citizen? The importance of voting. Those type of things need to be added into college curriculums. Learning our constitution, that type of stuff that makes you more well rounded and makes you a better student and adult.
MT: Is there a political thinker that informs your worldview? If you think to yourself, “Where should I come down on a certain issue?” Are there certain leaders or thinkers that you look to for guidance or knowledge?
Duff: I’m a voracious reader. I’m also an avid watcher of newscasts. I like to see all points of view. I’ve always believed if you only had one point of view, that makes you fairly narrow minded. So all points of view are important and you can learn from all of those things, even when you don’t agree. I go into many meetings with our folks and say this is a point of view that’s expressed. It might not be mine, but let’s debate it. Let’s take it apart. Let’s see what’s good about it, what’s bad about it, and we learn from that. So that’s what college is about.
MT: If I could just push you on that a little bit. I appreciate that you consider and take in all points of view. But you do have politics yourself, and you have created a political action committee with a priority to elect conservative candidates. So within the realm of conservatism, I suppose, what sort of conservative are you? Do you identify with a particular political figure? What to you makes a quality conservative leader that you would want to support?

Duff: I am a conservative. I believe that less government is better. I believe that each of us should have the ability to raise our families, to live our lives and to accomplish what our God given abilities are. So I am very conservative. I’m not trying to raise taxes. I’m not trying to have these social things that jump out there. I think that goes with being in families and being an individual.
The political leader that has affected us, certainly in the last 10 years, would be Donald Trump. He has revolutionized not only the Republican Party, but also the way that people view government, whether you like him or disagree with him, and I happen to like him. I think that what he’s doing in his administration is exactly what he said he would do. And I think 75 million people said ‘I like what he says he’s gonna do. I’m gonna vote for him.’ And he’s following through on that example. So he could probably be the one, if you were to ask me, that would have an influence. But his influence comes from vision and leadership. It’s not always his views, just the fact that he says, ‘I feel it should be this way, and I’m going to offer leadership through myself and the folks that I work with, and hopefully there’s buy in from the people that see it.’ 
MT: Yeah, and just jumping off that, I do want to ask directly about the PAC and the purpose behind it. What do you hope to achieve by potentially ushering in a new cohort of leaders in Mississippi?
Duff: That’s what it’s really for, to have conservative minded people take on these responsibilities because they’re very important economically in their communities and statewide. 
Are they the type leaders that will be exemplary moving forward? 
Mississippi has come so far. Our governor has done a great job, but it’s important for the future that we don’t take the foot off the gas pedal, that we move forward. And it will be different than it is today. The growth of things like AI, the growth of the political challenges that we have, you’ve got to have a person who is a leader, who can have a vision for being able to continue moving forward.
MT: Will you run for governor in 2027?
Duff: I love this state. This state has been good to me. I love being a part of this state. If I can assist and help in the leadership of moving forward in this state, I want to be a part of it. But as far as saying I have to have this as a stepping stone or something else, I don’t need that. 
If I can be of service, and enough people believe in that, then perhaps we can all together move Mississippi forward. So that’s where I stand now. This election is 29 months out. 
MT: I want to close by asking you what Mississippians might not know about you that you want them to know as you go and meet more of them and consider this run for governor? 
Duff: I think what I would want Mississippians to know is I’m just like them. I started out in menial labor, growing up in high school, throughout college, basically put myself through college, got involved in a business. I still work 50 to 60 hours every week. I love my family. I’m very devoted to them and involved with them. But we work, my brother and I work hard. We try to be fair and honorable with every person we deal with.
And you can take principles of business and apply it to certain aspects of government. I think that’s where it comes to vision and it comes to leadership. Those are the most important things that I think our state needs, where everybody is working together for a common goal. I don’t expect people to agree with everything I say, but I would hope that people would say ‘he cares, and I hope that’ll be a difference.’",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/24175319/Thomas-Duff-1-1.jpg,,,2025-07-28 06:56:52.622386

Today, thanks to the hard work of the Ways and Means Republicans, we will make those tax cuts permanent and prevent an end of the year tax hike.” — Rep. Carol Miller, R-W.Va.
Miller apparently believes that the government should run deficits that our children will pay off. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that the big, beautiful bill (or more accurately the budget buster bill) — even after accounting for the Medicaid and Affordable Care Act cuts in the bill which will leave countless West Virginia residents without insurance — will still increase budget deficits by $3.4 trillion over the next decade.
I am a proven fiscal conservative who wants a balanced federal budget. Otherwise, we are leaving our children and grandchildren a tremendous crisis which will blow up in their lifetimes, ruining the U.S. economy.
Yes, the national debt is out of control due to both parties. However, only one party currently controls the presidency and Congress — the GOP. Therefore, this column will look at their past spending and recently approved spending bill. Childishly saying, “but look at what the Democrats have done in the past” is unhelpful in analyzing the impact of Trump’s recently passed budget buster bill, which takes Trump’s 2017 temporary tax cuts and makes them permanent. The BBB also cuts Medicaid/ACA, contrary to Trump’s promises.
Trump is a known quantity; he had a first term. One of his 2016 priorities was to push through a package of historic tax cuts, which he did in 2017. In an interview back then with Sean Hannity, he declared that his tax cuts would stimulate the economy, contrary to what the Congressional Budget Office calculated when it estimated almost a $2 trillion increase in debt over a decade.
Trump stated that — due to increased growth — his 2017 cuts would lower, rather than raise, our national debt. So did his Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who said “at 3% economic growth this tax plan will not only pay for itself but in fact create additional revenue for the government.” The first Trump tax cut did exactly the opposite of what Trump and Mnuchin predicted. Here are the facts.
In 2016, the last year of Barack Obama’s presidency, our annual deficit was an unacceptable $585 billion. However, despite Trump’s promises to the contrary, it grew every year in large part due to his tax cuts. In 2019, prior to COVID-19, it was up to nearly $1 trillion. By 2020, it was over $3 trillion annually. These are the same tax cuts that Trump pushed to make permanent in his recently passed budget buster bill.
Here is who benefits from those tax cuts this year: 

The wealthiest 1% of households will get tax cuts averaging in excess of $60,000
For more normal working-class Americans (i.e. households in the bottom 60%), their tax cut will be less than $500

In 2017, as in 2025, Trump strong-armed Congress into supporting him, against their better judgment. For example, here is what Trump and the Senate’s GOP leader misleadingly stated at the time —

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell — “We are totally confident this is a revenue-neutral bill and probably a revenue producer.” 
President Trump —  “We have $21 trillion in debt. When this [tax cut] really kicks in we’ll start paying off that debt like water.”  

The GOP’s BBB increases budget deficits by $3.4 trillion, on top of an already outrageous national debt. The GOP is saddling West Virginia’s children with excessive debt and hypocritically covering it up. Remember this fact when you vote in 2026 and 2028.

(Photo from the CDC)After the U.S. Supreme Court ruled through its shadow docket earlier this month that President Donald Trump could move forward with plans to fire tens of thousands of federal workers, U.S. government employees across Pennsylvania braced themselves.
Philip Glover, the national vice president of the district of the American Federation of Government Employees that covers Pennsylvania and Delaware, says thousands of employees have likely been laid off around the country since the ruling, though exact numbers haven’t been shared with unions yet.
But for employees at the Pittsburgh-area campus for the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), a division of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which is under the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the ruling only added to a sense of uncertainty that workers say has become a constant of employment under the Trump administration. 
“It’s been the entire range of human emotion,” Suzanne Alison, a steward at the local chapter of the American Federation of Government Employees and a NIOSH employee, told the Capital-Star after the ruling. “I haven’t talked to a single person who feels like their job is safe.” 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
While the Supreme Court ruling allowed the Trump administration to move forward with thousands of previously stalled layoffs, the U.S. Health and Human Services Department (HSS) is tied up in a separate lawsuit moving through a federal District Court in Rhode Island.
Filed by Democratic attorneys general in 19 states and Washington, D.C., the suit argues that layoffs at key divisions of the Health Department, including NIOSH, are being conducted illegally. The judge in that case, Melissa DuBose, has ordered that, for now, the department has to keep those workers until the case moves forward.
The state of Pennsylvania is not part of the lawsuit.
The NIOSH facilities in Allegheny County house two key teams, whose impacts are felt across the country. There’s the coal mine safety division, which houses researchers and scientists studying how to prevent fatalities and injuries in coal mines. And there’s the National Personal Protective Technology Lab, which certifies the nation’s respirators, from the N95 masks that became ubiquitous during the COVID-19 pandemic to specialized devices used by firefighters and Marines.
Federal officials call miners’ health a ‘priority,’ but are cutting a Pa. team studying mine safety

Employees on both teams, with more than 160 federal workers between them, now feel stuck in a holding pattern.
“It feels a lot more precarious.”
For Pennsylvania-based NIOSH employees, nothing has been normal since the beginning of the Trump administration’s efforts to slash the federal workforce. There were the layoffs of probationary employees (workers who have been with the agencies less than one or two years), buyouts and offers of early retirement, and the reduction in force notices, which alerted employees across both divisions that many jobs would be terminated this summer.
A series of lawsuits held up various parts of the downsizing efforts. And federal lawmakers from both parties raised alarms about the impacts of cuts to divisions ensuring the safety of miners.
At a hearing on Capitol Hill in May, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. assured lawmakers that “work on mine safety will continue.” Yet employees of the Pittsburgh mine safety team largely remain on administrative leave, and notices that their jobs will be terminated July 2 remain in effect, though layoffs have been held up by lawsuits. Until the Rhode Island judge rules or HHS reverses course, no one can be laid off.
There were other decisions that impacted their ability to work too. The department, for instance, instituted a communications freeze and a block on work-related travel earlier this year, and credit cards were frozen that were typically used to purchase necessary research materials.
With so many people remaining on administrative leave, many affected mine safety workers are coming into work on a voluntary basis. Brendan Demich, chief steward of the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) local chapter that represents the Pittsburgh-area NIOSH employees, and an employee of the coal mine safety division, says morale has dropped.
“It’s really hard to do anything,” he said. “It feels a lot more precarious right now.”
Federal cuts threaten to close Pennsylvania lab that certifies N95s and other respirators in June

Still, some are continuing their work.
Demich’s own team, which is working on a virtual reality training program for mine safety teams, has cut its ambitions and is winding down their work. Now, they’re getting what they can to industry partners in the hopes it can still prove useful.
“These are all people who have been laid off, told they can take administrative leave—basically a paid vacation—and there are still people going into work, essentially voluntarily,” he said.
Employees at the National Personal Protective Technology Lab have had a slightly different experience. In April, many were preparing for their lab — the only one in the country certifying respirators for NIOSH — for permanent closure. Yet, following a May ruling on a class action lawsuit in West Virginia, they learned that the decision to shutter the division had been reversed.
But even those workers have not been able to feel a sense of security. That same month their layoffs were reversed, HHS released a proposed budget for 2026 which listed their division among those having their funding cut.
The coal mine safety team employees, who are still subject to layoffs pending a court ruling, found the opposite. The broader mine safety division would remain funded under the proposed 2026 budget
Job cuts reversed at Pittsburgh lab that certifies nation’s respirators

Employees in both NIOSH divisions in Pittsburgh, as well as their union representatives, say they’ve sought clarification from leaders at the U.S. Health and Human Service Department, NIOSH, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). But they’ve been met with silence.
Spokespeople for HHS and the CDC did not respond to questions from the Pennsylvania Capital-Star seeking clarity.
“We haven’t had anything communicated to us through official channels,” said Demich. “Our division leader is communicative with what they know, but there’s a breakdown of communication from the higher levels of HHS. Our division leaders are finding things out about the same time our front line employees are.”
Democratic congressmen from Pennsylvania have also weighed in, with all seven in the 17-member House delegation signing onto a letter last month asking the agency to reverse its decision to lay off people in the mine safety division.
In recent weeks, lawyers for Health and Human Services moved to have the case blocking layoffs across NIOSH dismissed, arguing the U.S. Supreme Court ruling allowing the Trump administration to fire thousands of federal workers applied to them as well. The judge shot down the argument.

HHS lawyers also argued earlier this month that layoffs should be allowed in states like Pennsylvania that are not a party to the lawsuit. They argue the current court-ordered pause is too broad following another recent Supreme Court ruling effectively ended nationwide injunctions.

(Getty Images)A group of lawyers who defend people facing capital punishment has asked the Pennsylvania Supreme Court to take extraordinary action to restrict a prosecutor’s use of the death penalty.
Washington County District Attorney Jason Walsh filed notices of his intent to pursue sentences of death in 11 out of 18 homicide cases his office has prosecuted since he took office in 2021, according to a petition the Atlantic Center for Capital Representation filed this week.
Listen to Peter and Emily’s audio recap: 

https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/27eppkWASCOweb.mp3
 
The filing alleges that in two pending cases, Walsh is pursuing the death penalty without evidence to support it. And it outlines a pattern in which Walsh’s office has allegedly held other defendants for trial for capital murder without establishing the basic facts required to support their charges.
Earlier this month, a Washington County judge dismissed criminal homicide and other charges against a Donora woman who was held for nearly four years while Walsh pursued the death penalty against her. In dismissing the charges, the judge stated the prosecutor’s theory was “based wholly on speculation.”
The Atlantic Center made the request on behalf of two clients, Jordan Clarke and Joshua George, who are charged separately in the deaths of their infant children. It alleges Walsh is seeking the death penalty against them despite scant evidence that the deaths were intentional or especially cruel, heinous or depraved warranting the ultimate punishment.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Walsh, who became district attorney after his predecessor’s death and was elected as a Republican in 2023, called the Atlantic Center’s filing a “liberal smear campaign” by an anti-death penalty group. 
“I pursue the death penalty consistently in cases where the death penalty fits,” Walsh told the Capital-Star. “The petition is false, misleading and untrue.”
Marc Bookman, executive director of the Philadelphia-based center, said prosecutors are entrusted with the discretion to seek the death penalty, but must provide evidence to establish certain elements of the crime before doing so. Bookman said Walsh is abusing that discretion. 
“We’re not offended by him because he’s tough on crime,” Bookman said. “I have a problem because he doesn’t appear to know the law and he’s seeking the death penalty viciously when it doesn’t apply.”
Under Pennsylvania law, the death penalty may be applied only when the killing at issue was intentional and there is at least one aggravating factor, Jules Epstein, a professor at Temple University Beasley School of Law, said.
Aggravating factors can include when the victim is a police officer or other first responder, murder for hire, torture, killing in the commission of another felony and more than a dozen other circumstances. 
Epstein, who has reviewed hearing transcripts, said the cases are indicative of problems in Washington County’s criminal justice system that extend beyond the district attorney’s office. He noted that magisterial district judges, who conduct preliminary hearings, have a responsibility to determine whether prosecutors have enough evidence to support the charges. 
To support a first-degree murder charge required for the death penalty, prosecutors are required to show evidence that the defendants’ had a criminal intent before the killing, such as an action or statement beforehand. 
Without such evidence, “The only proof is that it’s a tragic accident,” Epstein said. “And that district judge should say, ‘The proper charge here is third-degree murder.’”
In the cases at issue in the petition, that didn’t happen.
“Why a prosecutor, in a case that is so clear, would seek the death penalty when the law says you can’t do it … is a problem,” he said. “And if it happens more than once, … as someone who’s been involved in capital case work a long time, that’s a system breakdown.”
The petition asks the Supreme Court to employ its “King’s Bench power” to intervene in the cases and prevent Walsh from pursuing the death penalty. It also asks the court to establish supervision over the Washington County District Attorney’s Office by a special master and prohibit it from pursuing the death penalty without approval from an out-of-county judge.
It also asks the court to order the office to consult with the Pennsylvania Attorney General’s Office before seeking the death penalty and to appoint a judge from another county to review every death penalty case charged since 2021. 
In the case of Clarke, the petition alleges, Walsh filed homicide charges and notice of aggravating factors to pursue the death penalty before the manner of his two-month-old son’s death had been determined. It also claims Walsh attempted to improperly influence the death investigation.
Prosecutors allege Clarke killed Sawyer by shaking him in their McMurray home. Clarke, who lives with mobility issues as a result of a car crash when he was a child, told detectives he had tripped over a plastic bag and fell on his son. Clark’s grandfather and aunt were in the house at the time of the incident and called 911, the petition says.
Sawyer was taken to Children’s Hospital in Pittsburgh, where he ultimately died on May 24, 2022. The Allegheny County medical examiner determined the cause of death to be bleeding on the brain and the manner of death was undetermined. Walsh, however, obtained a court order from Judge John DiSalle directing that an autopsy be performed by a Washington County coroner’s office pathologist, despite the child’s death in Allegheny County.
The Washington County Coroner’s Office determined the cause of death was blunt-force trauma to the head and torso due to “shaken baby syndrome/abusive trauma” and declared the death a homicide. Although Allegheny County issued a death certificate, Coroner Timothy Warco filed a second certificate listing the death as a homicide, which the state Department of Health rejected.
Clarke was held on criminal homicide and related charges after a preliminary hearing where Warco testified that the results of Sawyer’s autopsy were still pending. A physician testified the injuries were consistent with shaken baby syndrome, despite not having reviewed medical records prior to the child’s fatal injury, the petition says.
The Atlantic Center alleges the testimony was insufficient to establish that Clarke intended to kill his son. It also argues that the aggravating factors, including torture, are also not supported by the evidence. 
George also faces the death penalty for the death of his son Oliver, who died after becoming ill in December 2021. Prosecutors allege George killed Oliver by shaking him and causing head trauma.
Oliver did not show indications of illness or injury until several hours after George had left him and his two other children at their grandmother’s house. The petition alleges that the district attorney’s office withheld the testimony of the pathologist who conducted Oliver’s autopsy and ultimately testified that the child would have shown signs of trauma immediately after suffering the injury.
Although the petition requests that the district attorney’s office be barred from pursuing the death penalty in the case of the Atlantic Center’s two clients, it also details the cases of three others who were held in jail for years awaiting capital murder trials.
According to the petition, Walsh’s office sought the death penalty for Jah Zhanee Inifi Sutton in connection to the murder of a man at a Donora convenience store. 
Prosecutors alleged that Sidney McLean and Devell Christian shot and killed the man in February 2021. Based on the discovery of Sutton’s DNA on a bullet casing at the scene of the killing and her alleged relationship with McClean, the district attorney’s office charged Sutton with conspiracy to commit homicide and possession of an instrument of crime.

At a preliminary hearing, a state police trooper testified Sutton was not at the scene of the killing and that it was likely her DNA on the casing. Pressed by Walsh, who asked if it was possible Sutton was waiting in a car outside during the shooting, the trooper testified “anything’s possible.” 
Sutton was held on the charges and Walsh filed a notice that he would seek the death penalty. When Sutton’s attorney notified Walsh that none of her charges qualified for a death sentence, Walsh simply added criminal homicide to her charges.
Nearly four years after her arrest, Judge Traci L. McDonald dismissed the charges after finding the trooper’s speculation about Sutton’s whereabouts during the killing was insufficient to sustain first-degree murder charges, particularly when the death penalty was on the table.
“Four long and fearful years after the Commonwealth improperly (and absurdly) sought the death penalty based on virtually no evidence, the Washington County courts finally held the Commonwealth to its burden. This was cold comfort for Ms. Sutton,” the Atlantic Center’s petition says.
The filing also outlines the cases of James Riley May IV and Shannon McKnight, who faced capital punishment for the drug-induced death of their three-month-old daughter. The couple called 911 after finding the baby unresponsive and an investigation found she died from ingesting fentanyl.
In a preliminary hearing, Walsh presented testimony that there was drug paraphernalia scattered in the bedroom where the couple slept with their children. According to the petition, their one-year-old son was also found to have indications of cocaine in his system.
“There was no testimony establishing any particular actions that either defendant had taken, how the baby had been exposed to the fentanyl, or any fact that would show that either of them had the intent to kill,” the filing says.
After 2½ years under the threat of the death sentence, May and McKnight each pleaded guilty to drug delivery resulting in death.
“If DA Walsh is allowed to continue abusing his discretion in seeking death sentences, other defendants facing capital trials in Washington County will give up their right to trial to avoid an illegal threat of death,” the petition argues. 
Walsh said the age of the victims in the challenged cases alone constitute an aggravating factor that supports the death penalty and their injuries leave little doubt about intent.
“When babies have fractured skulls and are beaten to death, that’s intentional,” he said.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/gavel-bang-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-07-28 05:56:12.160985

(Photo by Janine L. Weisman/Rhode Island Current)The American Civil Liberties Union of Rhode Island says the state’s Division of Motor Vehicles (DMV) gave inadequate notice to nearly 30,000 Rhode Island motorists who received late renewal forms for vehicle registrations set to expire in July.
Vehicle registrations that were originally scheduled to go out June 11 were all sent by July 14 after “a failed computer file transfer” halted their mailing by about a month, said DMV spokesperson Paul Grimaldi.
As a result of the delay, 29,145 affected vehicle owners now have through Aug. 31 to renew their registration — which can be done online.
The delay was announced via a news release on July 11 and is featured at the top of the DMV’s website.
“We appreciate our customers’ patience and understanding as we worked quickly to resolve this issue,” DMV Administrator Walter “Bud” Craddock said in the July 11 statement.
In a July 17 letter to Craddock, ACLU of Rhode Island Executive Director Steven Brown commended the DMV for the extension but said he believed most of the affected drivers were likely unaware of their forms getting sent out late.
“Absent receipt of a timely notice sent out by the vendor, they may not realize that their registration is expiring, much less that this extension has been granted,” Brown wrote. “The same lack of knowledge may hold true for police departments across the state.”







Drivers caught operating with an expired registration face an $85 fine. Registrations that have been suspended because of lapsed insurance or expired inspection can be reinstated for a fee of $253.50, Grimaldi said.







Brown asked what steps the DMV took to ensure police don’t pull over drivers next month still awaiting their updated tags.
In his response Wednesday, Craddock wrote that a notice was sent to the Rhode Island Police Chiefs Association and that Rhode Island State Police were tasked with posting it on the National Law Enforcement Telecommunications System.
“While this is considered ample time for individuals to renew their registrations, the decision was made to extend the renewal period in case some were out of state for summer vacation,” Craddock wrote.
Sidney Wordell, executive director for the Rhode Island Police Chiefs Association, confirmed via text message that notices were received and distributed to all municipal police departments. Rhode Island State Police Lt. Col. Robert Creamer also confirmed that agency posted the required notice to the national system.

Weisman/Rhode Island Current)Anyone who has tried to buy or rent a home lately in Rhode Island has seen firsthand the impacts of the state’s housing shortage, including bidding wars to access homeownership or significant yearly rent increases for tenants. The median sales price of a single-family home in Rhode Island rose to $520,000 as of June, 2025, according to the Rhode Island Association of Realtors, and rental costs in the Providence metro area climbed at one of the fastest rates in the nation, reflected in a median asking rent of $2,145.
A root problem is that Rhode Island is building fewer homes per capita than any other state in the nation. We need 24,000 homes just to meet today’s needs. With an average household size of 2.4, and a lower median household income than our neighboring states, new housing production must include smaller and more affordable options. 
A recent Stateline story in Rhode Island Current detailed the impacts of the lack of homes for sale that are affordable options for teachers, highlighting that the housing crisis does not discriminate. Workers across all sectors and all educational backgrounds are impacted. The lack of homes in Rhode Island prevents teachers, child care workers, and retail workers from living in the communities they serve. 
There is a profound irony in the fact that even builders of homes are priced out. Consider that someone earning the average income of a skilled trades worker with four-plus years of experience — $68,717 — is unable to afford most homes on the market in Rhode Island. A family of four now needs an annual income of $151,067 to purchase a home. This is dispiriting news for our state’s hardworking residents trying to secure a future for themselves and their families.  










With an average household size of 2.4, and a lower median household income than our neighboring states, new housing production must include smaller and more affordable options. 


The status quo has consequences; it pushes young people out of the communities they grew up in, as they move away in search of more affordable housing options. The lack of home choices stops older adults from downsizing into a more accessible home, putting them in a situation of maintaining a home that is too large, too expensive, or too difficult to move around in. 
Allowing more types of homes can help address this shortage. That’s why we are thankful to the Rhode Island General Assembly for passing 10 housing-related bills. Neighbors Welcome! Rhode Island championed five in particular that will allow more homes — and more naturally affordable home types, such as townhomes or apartments in mixed use areas — to be built.
Among them is a new law that removes obstacles for townhomes and another law that allows smaller residences to be developed above retail spaces. 
Townhomes are a great option for a first-time home buyer, or an older adult seeking to downsize. Slightly smaller, with less yard to take care of, these attached homes are often less expensive due to their smaller size and the sharing of land costs across multiple households. Legalizing townhomes in communities across Rhode Island will put more homeownership opportunities within reach of teachers, young adults just starting their families, and older neighbors who are looking to downsize. 
State lawmakers also passed legislation to make it easier to build what are now called mixed-use developments to replace empty office buildings or aging strip malls with the kind of homes on walkable main streets so many people want to live in, with spaces for living and spaces for commerce together in one area. 
These policies are popular with voters. Neighbors Welcome! Rhode Island recently conducted polling showing 88% public support for the state to do more to expand housing choices. We found that 70% of voters support allowing townhomes to be built anywhere other homes are built, and 87% support allowing homes to be built near jobs, shopping centers, in aging strip malls, or near transit. 
These are policies and strategies we can use to build more home types so that every Rhode Islander has a choice about where they live, and what type of home they live in that isn’t solely dictated by cost. But they’re not the only ways we can give more choices to Rhode Islanders looking to find the homes they need here in the Ocean State. We made progress this legislative session, but there is much more to do. We look forward to more collaboration with the General Assembly next year.
 



5 legislative wins for new housing production in Rhode Island
The Rhode Island General Assembly passed these bills championed by Neighbors Welcome! Rhode Island in the 2025 session. Gov. Dan McKee signed them into law in late June and early July.
Mixed-Use Zones: H5800 | S1090A
Underused commercial land served by public infrastructure, aging strip malls and vacant commercial lots are an opportunity to build new homes and mixed-use neighborhoods while preserving the state’s farmlands and forests. This law allows cities and towns to apply mixed-use overlays in commercial zones where appropriate, ensuring new homes are not built near heavy industry or other environmental nuisances.
Electronic Permitting: H5803Aaa | S1087
Rhode Island has made significant progress in reducing delays by creating a new online permitting system, but many state and local permits remain to be added to the platform. This law empowers the Department of Business Regulation to continue expanding e-permitting, speeding up new home construction and creating cost-savings that can be passed on to residents.
Oversized Lot Splits: H5794B | S1086Aaa
This law allows double lots to be subdivided for new homes as long as the newly created lots resemble nearby parcels, maintaining neighborhood character. For example, a 10,000-square foot lot surrounded by 5,000-square foot lots could be divided in two.
Townhomes: H5798Aaa/S1083A
Townhomes offer a path to homeownership at a more affordable price point and are significantly easier for builders to finance compared to condominiums. This law allows for townhomes in residential zoning districts at reasonable levels of density, depending on the type of community, while allowing cities and towns to retain control over key design characteristics.
Building Code Changes: H5804A | S1089Aaa
New triple-deckers or other small multifamily buildings in Rhode Island have had to meet the same commercial building code requirements as high rises, shopping malls, and hospitals. That’s cost-prohibitive. So this law reclassifies three- and four-family homes as residential, making these homes more cost- effective to build while maintaining the high safety standards of modern construction.

The North Dakota Department of Agriculture last week announced the award of a $300,000 grant for drone scouting in the 2025 and 2026 growing seasons. The project aims to help weed control officials respond to new infestations quickly.
Grand Farm, a research organization with a campus near Casselton, is taking the lead on the project.
Grand Farm celebrates first building to foster ag innovation

Nathan Marcotte, senior program manager of technology and innovation at Grand Farm, said the state grant helps continue a first phase of the project that involves teaching an artificial intelligence system what a weed looks like by feeding it hundreds of photos of the plants at different growth stages and other variables, such as different times of the day. 
Marcotte said researchers will be working with farmers and weed officers in five southeastern counties — Barnes, Cass, Richland, Steele and Traill. The project will focus on soybean and sugar beet fields.
Marcotte said an initial phase of the project targeted Palmer amaranth, an herbicide-resistant weed with a limited presence in North Dakota but with the ability to spread quickly. The next phase will build on that work, he said. 
“The focus is, within those five counties, to build up a weed image library and model so it can detect more than just Palmer amaranth,” Marcotte said. 
Fields found to have weeds will remain confidential and identified at the county level only, the Ag Department said. 
The funding for this program was approved during the 2025 North Dakota legislative session. 
Grand Farm is leading the research project partners including Thales, an aerospace company, iSight Drone Services that provides the drones, and North Dakota State University. 
Marcotte said landowners will be advised of any drone flyovers before they take place. Farmers and property owners interested in participating in the project can email info@grandfarm.com.

(Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)Despite Trump administration rhetoric accusing Democrats of protecting violent criminals and drug-dealing immigrants, the administration’s arrests have been catching a smaller share of criminals overall, and a smaller share of people convicted of violent and drug crimes, than the Biden administration did in the same time frame.
While the Trump administration has caught more immigrants with convictions for drugs and violence, their share of the rising arrest numbers is smaller, as more people get swept up for minor traffic violations or strictly immigration crimes, according to a Stateline analysis.
Forty percent of the nearly 112,000 arrests by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) from Jan. 20 through late June were of convicted criminals. That’s compared with 53% of the nearly 51,000 arrests for same time period in 2024 under the Biden administration.


The share of people convicted of violent crime fell from 10% to 7% and drug crimes from 9% to 5%, according to a Stateline analysis of data from the Deportation Data Project.
The project, led by attorneys and professors in California, Maryland and New York, collects and posts public, anonymized U.S. government immigration enforcement datasets obtained through Freedom of Information Act requests.
Some Democratic states are among those with the highest share of violent criminals in this year’s ICE arrests: Hawaii (15%), Vermont (13%), and California and Nebraska (12%) — while some of the lowest shares were in more Republican states: Maine (2%), and Alabama, Montana and Wyoming (3%).
Immigration attorneys see an increased push to arrest and detain immigrants for any type of violation or pending charge as President Donald Trump pushes for higher arrest and detention numbers to meet his campaign promise for mass deportation. Trump officials have called for 3,000 arrests a day, far more than the current average of 711 as of June and 321 a day during the same time period under Biden.










The majority of recent ICE detentions involve people with no convictions. That’s a pattern I find troubling.


– Oregon Republican state Rep. Cyrus Javadi


Arrests have accelerated since about mid-May, when government attorneys began asking to revoke bail and arrest people who show up for court hearings after being released at the border, said Vanessa Dojaquez-Torres, practice and policy counsel for the American Immigration Lawyers Association, which represents more than 16,000 immigration attorneys.
“We’re not completely sure what the reasoning or the goal is behind some of these policies, other than they want detention numbers up,” Dojaquez-Torres said.
“They seem to have really been struggling to get their deportation numbers up, and so I think that’s one of the reasons why we see a lot of these policies going into effect that are meant to kind of circumvent the immigration court process and due process.”
Arrests of people convicted of violent crimes increased by 45% from about 5,300 to 7,700 compared with last year. For drug crimes, the increase was 21% — and they fell as a share of total arrests, from 9% under the Biden administration to 5% this year.
Arrests for those not convicted of any crime nearly tripled to about 67,000, and increased from 47% to 60% of arrests.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security defended ICE arrests Wednesday. Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that the agency was “targeting dangerous criminal illegal aliens and taking them off American streets. Violent thugs ICE arrested include child pedophiles, drug traffickers, and burglars.”
In Oregon, arrests during the first part of last year increased from 51 under the Biden administration to 227 under the Trump administration, with those not convicted of any crime increasing from 34 to 137. Those with convictions for violent crime increased from 3 to 16. Even some Republicans are concerned with the new emphasis on non-criminals.
“The majority of recent ICE detentions involve people with no convictions. That’s a pattern I find troubling, especially when it risks sweeping up people for things like expired tags or missed court dates,” said Oregon state Rep. Cyrus Javadi, a moderate Republican representing Tillamook and Clatsop counties.
Nationally, nonviolent crimes have risen as a share of immigration arrests. The most common crime conviction for those arrested this year is driving while intoxicated, which was also the top offense last year under Biden.
But this year it’s closely followed by general traffic offenses, which rose to second place from sixth place, surpassing such crimes as assault and drug trafficking.
Traffic offenses, outside of driving while intoxicated and hit and run, rose almost fourfold as the most serious conviction on record for those arrested, the largest increase in the top 10. Those offenses were followed by increases in the immigration crime of illegal entry, meaning crossing the border in secret, which tripled.
The increase in traffic violations as a source of immigration arrests is a reason for cities to consider limiting traffic stops, said Daniela Gilbert, director of the Redefining Public Safety Initiative at the Vera Institute of Justice, a nonprofit devoted to ending mass incarceration.
“It’s an important point to consider intervening in so that there can be less interaction, and so ICE has less opportunity to continue its indiscriminate dragnet of enforcement,” Gilbert said.
The institute argues in general that traffic stops should be limited to safety issues rather than low-level infractions such as expired registrations or single burned-out taillights, both because they do not improve public safety and because they disproportionately affect drivers of color.
Such policies limiting stops under some conditions are in place in 10 states and in cities in six other states, according to the institute.
The most recent state polices took effect last year in California and Illinois, while a policy is set to take effect in October in Connecticut. The most recent city policies were in Denver and in East Lansing and Ypsilanti, Michigan. Six other states have considered legislation recently.

Haaland, a member of the Pueblo of Laguna and a former U.S. congresswoman, served as Interior Secretary during the Biden Administration.She will be presented with the award during a ceremony Oct. 13 — Indigenous Peoples’ Day — at the Lied Center for Performing Arts in Lincoln.
The award is given annually by the Chief Standing Bear Project, a nonprofit group founded in 2022 to recognize those who embody the spirit of Ponca Chief Standing Bear. It was Standing Bear’s legal fight with the U.S. government that led to the recognition of Native Americans as “persons” under the law.
A Project official said that Haaland, a 35th generation New Mexican, is being recognized for overcoming financial hardship as a single mother to earn a law degree and become the first Native American woman to lead a state political party, one of the first Native American women elected to Congress and becoming the first Cabinet Secretary,
“Former Secretary Haaland’s life and leadership reflect the many forms that courage can take — quiet resilience, determination in the face of hardship and the willingness to lead, even when the path is uncertain,” said Katie Brossy, board president of the Chief Standing Bear Project.
As Interior Secretary, Haaland addressed the epidemic of missing and murdered indigenous people and helped the nation confront the painful legacy of federal boarding schools.

(Photo by Nancy Lavin/Rhode Island Current)Woonsocket City Councilor James Cournoyer wasn’t shocked to see Fitch Ratings pull its credit ratings for the city on July 14 for failing to turn in a fiscal 2023 audit, among other financial statements. 
“The only surprise was that it took them as long as it did,” said Cournoyer.
Moody’s Ratings yanked its bond ratings in October for the same reason; S&P Global Ratings lowered its rating of city water bonds the next month. 
Without bond ratings, the northern Rhode Island city with the sixth largest population in the state can’t borrow any money to pay for future capital projects like schools or infrastructure upgrades — not an immediate concern for Cournoyer since the city isn’t planning to issue bonds. Much more distressing is the disarray of city finances, including the still-incomplete fiscal 2023 audit, now more than 18 months overdue.
A newly hired city finance director and promise of near completion on the overdue report offer a glimmer of hope. Not that the problem ends there.
“We’re digging ourselves out of a hole, a deep hole,” said Cournoyer, who works as a finance director for Textron, Inc. “We’re grappling with 10 years of a Lisa Baldelli-Hunt regime. She basically destroyed the financial organization in the city of Woonsocket. Now, we’re left to clean up.”

Baldelli-Hunt, Woonsocket’s former mayor, resigned on Nov. 9, 2023 in the wake of a land purchase that violated the city charter’s rules around notice to the council, and appeared to be a sweetheart deal with her former boss. The deal was uncovered and reported by WPRI-TV 12 in October 2023. No criminal charges have resulted. But her specter continues to haunt city hall, as city officials grapple with the fallout from her decade of leadership. 
Baldelli-Hunt’s resignation came less than two months before the Dec. 31, 2023 deadline by which all cities and towns across Rhode Island are required under state law to turn in an audited financial report to the Rhode Island Office of the Auditor General. 
Punctuality is not a new problem, nor one isolated to Woonsocket, as municipalities nationwide struggle to turn in financial reports amid staff vacancies and the rapid decline of accounting firms able and willing to perform local government audits, said David Bergantino, the state auditor general.
A year ago, in July 2024, two other municipalities, East Providence and Coventry, had also failed to submit their fiscal 2023 audited statements to the auditor general, according to the office’s compliance report. Both have since turned in the reports, Bergantino confirmed Thursday. Woonsocket, on the other hand, has not.
The price of paperwork problems 
Its lack of timely financial reporting doesn’t just risk bond ratings. It also compromises the city’s ability to form an accurate spending plan for the current fiscal year — risking major deficits if it underestimates expenses or overshoots revenue, Bergantino said.
“At this point, we’re in fiscal 2026,” Bergantino noted. “When you don’t have the prior fiscal year done, or the last two, it impacts current operations.”
Not to mention the separate but also overdue audited statements to the federal government on how the city spent federal pandemic aid and routine grant funding. Baldelli-Hunt’s land deal relied on $1.1 million in federal funding to buy a five-acre plot of vacant land for use as affordable housing.
 The city has since reversed the deal and commissioned a $15,000 investigation — later forwarded to law enforcement — that detailed her negotiations with her former boss, who owned the land, on the purchase price, as well as her concerted efforts to keep the transaction secret from staff and the city council — violating the city’s charter, according to news reports. But the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development grant funds Baldelli-Hunt tried to use to buy the land could leave the city vulnerable to federal repercussions for misusing its money, said John Ward, former city council president who unsuccessfully ran for mayor in 2024.










We’re grappling with 10 years of a Lisa Baldelli-Hunt regime. She basically destroyed the financial organization in the city of Woonsocket. Now, we’re left to clean up.


– Woonsocket City Councilor James Cournoyer


Ward, who retired after 17 years as finance director for the town of Lincoln in 2023, made the city’s financial state a key part of his campaign. He lost the November 2024 nonpartisan mayoral race by 3 percentage points to Mayor Christopher Beauchamp, who took over the mayoral post after Baldelli-Hunt resigned in 2023.
Leading into the election, Woonsocket’s paperwork problem took a turn for the worse after the accounting firm hired to audit its financial statements abruptly quit, also first reported by WPRI. 
In a May 28, 2024 letter to the council, Mary Sahady, principal for Hague, Sahady & Co., listed five reasons for the decision, including continued rescheduling of meetings, missing reports and untimely and incomplete responses to the firm’s requests for information. Sahady also referenced an accusation made by some council members at a May 22 meeting that Baldelli-Hunt swayed the firm’s prior audit reports.
Ward and Cournoyer blamed the firm’s resignation squarely on Baldelli-Hunt, even though she had left city hall six months before.
“The issues surrounding their resignation all related to the games and misinformation and delays occurring under the Baldelli-Hunt administration, without question,” Cournoyer said. “I don’t care who the next mayor was, they would be in the same position after inheriting the mess they got from her.”
Beauchamp declined to answer any questions for this story.

The blame game
Baldelli-Hunt pointed the finger back at the city leaders still in office.
“How many years do I need to be gone before they start to realize I am not the problem?” she said in an interview Thursday. 
Baldelli-Hunt touted the city’s financial accomplishments under her tenure as mayor, from the brink of receivership when she started in 2013 to a balanced budget, less debt and strong ratings from the major credit ratings agencies. 
“I turned the city of Woonsocket around,” she said. “I took the bond rating from junk to stable and positive. I did a hell of a job in this city and I am proud of it.”
She continued, “Maybe, potentially, they’re just ill-equipped to handle things.”
Sahady’s letter reinforces Baldelli-Hunt’s final point, noting that insufficient city financial staff has led to inadequate tracking of its money. When Beauchamp became mayor in November 2023, he immediately fired the city’s finance director. The city has since struggled to hold on to a permanent replacement, relying on a longtime finance department employee Christine Chamberland to serve as interim finance director for a majority of the next 20 months.










How many years do I need to be gone before they start to realize I am not the problem?


– Former Woonsocket Mayor Lisa Baldelli-Hunt


Meanwhile, Sahady’s surprise resignation sent the city scrambling to find a new accounting firm to audit its financial statements. Sahady had already completed more than 80 hours of fieldwork and meetings on the fiscal 2023 audit — with a $8,554 cost, according to the bill included with the resignation letter.
The subsequent contract with CBIZ forced the city to start the process over with the new, more expensive firm. Cournoyer estimates the city has spent more than $300,000 for CBIZ to audit its fiscal 2023 statements based on the agreed-upon hourly rate.
In May 2025, CBIZ submitted a draft audit report to the City Council for review, with the caveat that the report remains unfinished, awaiting major updates including lengthy and detailed financial disclosures from the lawsuits filed against the city, which continue to multiply. The cases are mostly unrelated to the land deal, spanning disputes over allegedly inaccurate property tax assessments, the environmental and health effects of improperly treated sewage flowing into the Blackstone River, and the wrongful arrest of an unhoused person. The fired former finance director, Cindy Johnston, has also sued the city, alleging her termination violates anti-discrimination laws related to her disability, The Valley Breeze reported. 
“As every day goes by, any new lawsuit or new activity also has to be disclosed,” Cournoyer said.
The draft audit has not been made public, but a copy was obtained by Rhode Island Current. The 200-page report shows the city ended fiscal year 2023 $165.5 million in the red, due to $248.1 million overspent through its general, government spending account, partially offset by revenue gains in its separate funds for water and wastewater treatment services. 
CBIZ does not include any commentary on the city’s fiscal 2023 financial performance, which saw a $5.6 million decline in its net position compared with the prior year.
But Cournoyer fears that even after the audited report is finally finished, and resubmitted to Fitch and Moody’s, the city’s new credit rating will not be as strong because of its deficit.
Fitch rated Woonsocket’s bonds at an A+ in July 2024, while Moody’s upgraded its assessment of the city’s bonds to “Baa2” in October 2023. Both are considered investment-worthy grades, though not the strongest possible ratings.
Calling in financial cavalry 
One spot of rare good news is the city’s newly hired finance director, James Lathrop, who started on July 21. Some might not view the $145,000-a-year job of putting the city’s broken financials back together as worth the headache. Lathrop was unfazed.
“This is no more difficult than anything I’ve done in Chester and Lansdale,” Lathrop said of his most recent two jobs resuscitating a pair of Pennsylvania municipalities from receivership and multimillion-dollar bank statement discrepancies, respectively. 
A former 2022 Republican state general treasurer candidate and Bryant University graduate, Lathrop has made a career of helping cities and towns escape difficult financial situations, including others in Rhode Island. He expects Woonsocket’s fiscal 2023 audit to be finished and ready to submit in the next two weeks, with plans to immediately begin the also overdue fiscal 2024 audit. 
Ward still has his doubts.
“This is not just about being a good bookkeeper,” he said of sorting through the tranche of mismatched and missing reports spanning three or more years. “This is about, can you play chess?

Residents gathered Thursday night in the community center of a Baptist church in the rural town of Mineral. Many said they felt lighter knowing one project is, at least for now, off the table. Some people passed out stickers that read “Don’t Loudoun my Louisa” — a reference to the proliferation of data centers in Northern Virginia — and yard signs urging the board of supervisors to say “no” to more data centers..

“We’re letting or even entertaining the idea of a billion dollar corporation coming around and messing with our drinking water. I think it’s pretty humiliating,” Louisa resident Brittany Carroll said.
Loudoun County has one of the highest concentrations of data centers in the state. Conversely, winding roads cut through pockets of forest and farmland that stretch far and wide in Louisa. Some Louisa residents fear Loudoun’s level of development would destroy the rural nature of their community.
The county has been open to the digital industry since 2018 when the Technology Overlay District was developed, Lousia County Supervisor Duane Adams said.
A few dozen community members attended the informal meeting about the data centers already in the works, one of multiple held since the third AWS application was announced. The crowd audibly grumbled during discussion of the AWS campuses already approved with by-right permits.
AWS proposed the third data center to be one of the largest in the area by far. The 1370-acre plot near the Northeast Creek Reservoir prompted concerns about construction near schools in the area and how much water would be needed to cool the systems inside the building. The land is currently zoned for agricultural use and is used for timber production, adding to concerns of losing the rural land.

After the latest application was filed, community members took to social media and local meetings to share worries and debate over possible sound pollution, loss of agricultural land, and the rapid rate of development. Some people went so far as to say they felt betrayed by the board of supervisors for agreeing to the initial two AWS sites. Adams sees the tension as an opportunity for community collaboration.
“We threw the nets out, we went fishing and we landed two big fish. So we accomplished our goal. [We shrank] the technology overlay district,” Adams said. “Then let’s be very deliberate as we move forward with this, and that’s when we added the CUP process, which is why you see the engagement with the community. I think that’s really positive.”
AWS already has two data centers in the works in the county’s Technological Overlay District (TOD) that allowed the facilities to be permitted by-right, meaning the public had less of a say in the project. In 2024, the county Board of Supervisors revised the TOD to be smaller and to add the conditional use permit for future projects to allow the public to be part of the process.
Amazon has invested $35 billion into the commonwealth, with $11 billion of that being in Louisa county for the two AWS data centers. 
Adams has been very supportive of the two data centers in the county. A third proposal is being considered as EdgeCore recently purchased 697 acres in the Shannon Hill business park to build a 3.9 million square foot facility. However, that proposal includes a closed loop cooling system and does not have as heavy of impacts on community water sources. Some at the public meeting felt the project was far enough away from residences that light and sound would not be a major concern.
“We’re going to see one of the data centers on the existing campuses come online (by the end of the year). So we’re going to see some of the things that we’ve talked about in the abstract actually become hard base facts, and that’s water usage, employment opportunities, tax revenue …I’m taking a long view of this. I don’t think there’s a rush,” Adams said.
The town Council of Mineral, which lies to the east of the TOD,  published an opposition to the new proposed AWS project in June over concerns of traffic from construction, noise pollution, water use, and other concerns brought to their attention by residents.
The Piedmont Environmental Council, who presented facts about data centers at the meeting, acknowledged the draw of building data centers is the tax revenue for the county through personal property tax and real estate taxes. But the computers inside of data centers rapidly depreciate, decreasing that revenue for the county.
“More folks need to be concerned about putting all their eggs in the data center revenue basket because it can be a really risky move. Loudoun County at the height of the pandemic had a $60 million budget shortfall because two of their data centers were not able to refresh their computing equipment as scheduled due to supply chain issues,” said Sarah Parmelee, land use field representative with the Piedmont Environmental Council.
Parmelee went on to say while data centers are essential for internet use, the demand has exploded due to the growth in AI technology. There are now questions about how long that demand will last and if all the proposed data centers will come to fruition. Microsoft recently canceled two gigawatts worth of data center leases across the U.S. and Europe, claiming their existing data centers have them on track to meet the current demand. It leaves Parmelee and other Virginians with more questions.
“We need to slow down, we need to start really looking at these things and asking how many of them do we actually need?  How many of them can we actually support without throwing away everything that makes Virginia an awesome place to live, work and play?” Parmelee said.
Louisa resident Savannah Walker works in the data center industry with nearly 20 years of experience. She said the third AWS site was too large of a facility without the proper infrastructure in the county in place to support it. She had taken charge in the community effort to get educated on the project and speak out about concerns.
“We have to have them. It is what it is. It’s today’s world. However, there’s a time and a place for them,” Walker said.
Some residents floated the idea of putting a moratorium on data centers in Louisa County. 
Adams said with the revisions to the TOD that now required a conditional use permit and heavy public involvement, it will already be more of a challenge for future proposals to get through. He said it is a positive thing to see the public involved in the process and that residents get to have more of a say in what is allowed to be built.
The letter from the attorney representing AWS didn’t specify if the company would ever come back with a future application in the county. Some residents are gearing up for another round.
“They’re going to be back; we have to control how it happens,” Walker said.

Virginia consumers probably noticed it for the first time when they saw pop-up notices while they were shopping online. 
Senate Bill 754, the Virginia Consumer Protection Act, put protections in state law from having an individual’s health information sold or shared with third parties without that person’s consent. That was particularly welcome for women in an age when draconian assaults on reproductive rights in some states includes vacuuming up the most private of data, from menstrual cycles to birth control preferences.
The legislation passed by a 21-17 Senate vote on Jan. 24. One Republican joined 20 Democrats voting for the bill; all 17 nay votes were Republican. One Democrat and one Republican did not vote.
New Va. law protecting reproductive health data prompts Walmart’s online data collection pop-ups

Three weeks later, it cleared the House on a 52-43 vote. Two Republicans broke ranks and joined 50 Democrats in support. Four of the five delegates who did not vote were Republicans.
On this one, Gov. Glenn Youngkin differed from most in his party and, in March, chose the greater good, signing the bill patroned by Senate Democrats Barbara Favola of Arlington and Scott Surovell of Fairfax. It took effect on July 1, the start of Virginia’s new fiscal year.
O happy day!
Alas, Virginia, no good deed goes unpunished.
On the bill’s effective date earlier this month, customers shopping their favorite online retailers started seeing notices pop up on their computer monitors. They vary, but in essence they inform consumers that they must consent to have their online data harvested if they wish to continue shopping.
Some were quite up-front about it, such as the one initially posted by Walmart. The world’s largest retailer was remarkably straightforward in describing limitations that Virginia’s brand-new VCPA applies to consumer data about sexual and reproductive health merchandise. It explained that by clicking the “Continue shopping” button and proceeding to browse the site, users consent to Walmart using their data to complete the purchase, provide the requested feature and for general analytics, operations and fraud prevention.
Janet Peyton, a McGuireWoods attorney* who advises clients on data privacy issues, noted that Walmart’s advisory isn’t proposing to provide the data to third parties, only for its own internal use. Virginians have more robust data privacy protections under a slightly older state law, she said, and nothing in Walmart’s disclaimer waives those.
  A July 2025 screenshot of an automatic pop-up when visiting Walmart.com. (Screenshot by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)
“It doesn’t say anything about your other privacy rights under the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act and, in fact, there are lots of other (rights),” she said. The Walmart pop-up, she said, constitutes “a very limited consent specific to this health information that they’re gathering.”
Walmart has significantly pared down its pop-up since early July, dropping the references to the family-planning and intimate products.  
Other big chains that offer those products are far less conspicuous in letting Virginians know about the newer privacy law.
The CVS drugstore chain, for example, has a small, obscure disclaimer at the bottom of its landing page under the curious heading “Improving your site experience.” It says in miniscule type that by continuing to shop on the site, you give the pharmacy giant the right to share your data with “trusted third parties, including our marketing, analytics and research partners.”
Its rival apothecary chain, Walgreens, similarly requires users to do a lengthy scroll downward to find its privacy link nestled in the sub-basement of its webpage. There, one finds a “Your Privacy Choices” link that jumps to a consumer rights box outlining non-specific rights afforded customers in Virginia and 15 other states. In that box, there are links to pages that allow consumers to access, correct and delete their data, and to opt out of the sale, sharing or use of their data for targeted advertising, rights Virginians have had since the VCDPA took effect Jan. 1, 2023.
  After the passage of a new privacy law in the 2025 General Assembly session, pop-up notice now greets Virginia customers shopping online at Walgreens and other retailers. (Screenshot by Bob Lewis)
Those pages ask users to jump through multiple hoops just to verify their identity and, after that’s done, opt out of sharing, selling or bartering your data.
I undertook the exercise on several big chain retailers’ websites, including the aforementioned. I had to confirm unsettlingly specific personal information, including an approximate range for my mortgage payments, which of several random home addresses was once mine, banks where I held accounts decades ago, names of relatives and more. It’s precisely the sort of info you don’t want out there. With that completed, I was informed that I would be updated on the progress of the request or, in one case, get an email I could use to complete the process within a couple of weeks. I’m not holding my breath.
Creepy? Sure felt that way.
Confusing? Yes, on any number of levels, not the least of which is a state-to-state patchwork of statutes that even legal professionals find challenging because there’s no nationwide data privacy law.
Burdensome? Sure.
“It can be done. It is a little bit cumbersome — not particularly consumer friendly — but it’s not saying anything here about waiving your right to make a data access request or opt out of those other things,” Peyton said, referencing the Walmart disclaimer.
Data in large-scale retailing is money. Huge money. Ask Jeff Bezos, the founder of the all-online Amazon, the planet’s second-largest retailer after Walmart.
E-commerce retail sales ballooned from $5.6 billion in the first quarter of 2000 to $300.2 billion in the first quarter of 2025, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.
Data are essential to that. As Charlotte Rene Woods explained in her reporting on July 8, pop-ups informing users about “cookies,” or other data that websites collect and store aren’t uncommon in online transactions. Some are necessary to complete them.
That’s been true for more than 30 years, back in the phone-modem days when many folks of a certain age got their first excursions into cyberspace via America Online with its cheery “You’ve got mail!” log-in greeting. The age of Amazon, Google and Meta is built on data.
It’s no mystery, then, that there’s no incentive other than the law’s baseline requirements for retailers to make it as easy as allowing consumers to click one icon to keep their private data private.
On the other hand, some of them have made relinquishing at least a slice of your privacy exactly that easy.
*(Point of personal disclosure: From my years at McGuireWoods, I have known Janet as a top intellectual property/data privacy and security lawyer with a long list of national accolades.)

(Courtesy of Natalie Emmerson)In January 2024, Bowdoin freshman Natalie Emmerson collected signatures for U.S. Sen. Angus King’s re-election campaign. Frequently, she was asked by voters, “isn’t he already on the ballot?” 
That’s when she realized that by working on the campaign she was learning information about how elections and democracy work that most people didn’t know.
That lesson prompted Emmerson and classmate Larsen Van Horn one year later to create a podcast called “Pine State Politics: In Session,” where they learn and educate listeners about basic civic processes, like how a bill becomes a law, the difference between state and federal government, the role of lobbyists and much more from some of the biggest names in Maine politics: former Congressman and U.S. Secretary of Defense Bill Cohen, current Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, and King himself.
“A lot of young people want to get involved, but don’t know how,” Emmerson said of the political process. “That’s exactly what the point of the podcast is. We’re digging into the mechanics of how everything works.”
Van Horn, who is from out of state, said the podcast is a way for her to learn more about how Maine’s government and elections work, for instance, concepts like ranked-choice voting and clean elections funding. He said this is especially important because, like other college students, he is able to vote in Maine elections. 
Next year, the podcast could be played in high school classrooms across Maine as part of a newly offered curriculum that Emmerson and Van Horn are partnering with the Maine Department of Education to develop. 
For example, in the first episode, the hosts asked Bellows and Washington, D.C. lobbyist and University of Maine adjunct professor Peter Madigan which issues are handled locally and which are federal: Who do you call about a road that needs paving? Which office handles disability payments?
That segment will help prompt classroom discussion questions, Emmerson said, such as “What issues can your congressperson help you with? What is a district office and what do the people who work there do?”

“Some of these questions will require the student to look some information up for a complete answer,” she added. “The conversation in the snippet will help point them in the right direction. That way students stay engaged and are required to ask questions and think critically about the systems they’re learning about “
The department hopes the collaboration will make the democratic process more accessible and engaging for young people, particularly because it’s a resource developed by other young people. 
“They’re a great example of youth voice in civic education, which is something we want to be promoting because … there is very low youth engagement nationwide in civic life,” said Beth Lambert, chief teaching and learning officer at the Maine Department of Education.
The podcast breaks down complex government processes in a non-partisan, approachable manner, Lambert said, which was another reason the partnership appealed to the department.
“They’re not diving into polarizing policy debates in these podcasts,” she said. “It really emphasizes how democracy works and encourages understanding across the political divides, which is key in our classrooms.”
The lesson plans, which will be available this fall, will allow high school teachers to use specific segments in civics, U.S. history, and current events classes. Since Maine allows local districts to control curriculum, teachers in each district will be able to decide whether to use the lesson plans. 
But the initiative reflects the department’s broader commitment to promoting youth-driven learning experiences that encourage students to understand and actively participate in democratic processes. 
Next year, the department will be rolling out another learning opportunity for elementary students — interactive town halls. These day-long events, developed in partnership with the Secretary of State and local municipalities, will immerse young students in democratic processes such as town council meetings. Students will participate in various roles, such as reporters, candidates, and voters, learning about local government, the role of the media and policy through hands-on activities. 
These new initiatives are part of “broader efforts to support interdisciplinary, inclusive and relevant learning experiences,” Lambert said, which are a department priority.

Kelly Ayotte this month, allows K-12 schools to hire faculty from New Hampshire’s colleges and universities to teach up to 20 hours a week of classes. (Photo by Dana Wormald/New Hampshire Bulletin) For 26 years, the Community College System of New Hampshire has offered a proposal to public high school students: Take a college-level course taught by a faculty member, earn college credit, and use that credit to save time and money in college.
That program, originally known as Running Start, has ballooned in popularity. What started with 25 participating high schools has grown to more than 100, serving around 11,000 students, according to Chuck Lloyd, the vice chancellor of the community college system. Each year, more schools are seeing examples of that interest: high school seniors graduating with full associate’s degrees. 
Now, a new state law could help expand that system. House Bill 90, signed by Gov. Kelly Ayotte this month, allows K-12 schools to hire faculty from New Hampshire’s colleges and universities to teach up to 20 hours a week of classes. 
To Lloyd, the bill will empower community colleges to expand their high school dual enrollment partnerships. It allows the school district to pay the community college faculty member directly, and for the faculty member to better divide their time. 
“We loved our partners so much, we wanted to make it work, but it really wasn’t scalable,” he said in an interview. “We couldn’t take our automotive instructor and do it for three or four different high schools, because they wouldn’t have the bandwidth to come teach our college students.” 
But the bill applies to all courses — not just dual enrollment courses for college credit — meaning it also allows a school to hire the faculty members for standard math or English classes. Democrats, public school advocates, and teachers have heavily criticized that piece, arguing it will allow schools to cut corners to save money and potentially lower pay to teachers, and that it could degrade the quality of instruction. 
Republicans say the bill is a simple change that provides schools a tool to help with persistent staffing shortages.
“The way I see it is, if there is an open space and there’s a teacher who has passed a background check, they have experience teaching at a college, and they’re more than willing to teach at the high school, I would much rather that teacher be in the classroom than nobody at all, and the class doesn’t get offered, and the students can’t learn that subject,” she said. 
HB 90 allows any full-time or contracted faculty member of the University System of New Hampshire or Community College System of New Hampshire to work part time in a public school without obtaining a credential. To do so, they must have “expertise or significant professional experience” to teach in the schools, and pass a criminal background check from the Department of Education. 
The law requires the faculty members to abide by the state’s code of conduct that applies to K-12 teachers, even though they have no credentials that could potentially be revoked. And it excludes former K-12 teachers whose licenses have been revoked. 
Rep. Rick Ladd, a Haverhill Republican and the bill’s prime sponsor, said the bill is meant to help schools, not take away teachers’ jobs.
“This bill is attempting to aid schools that do not have the staff in place or are encountering scheduling difficulties to ensure all students have an equal opportunity to receive a dual and concurrent education,” Ladd, who is chairman of the House Education Funding Committee, said in testimony to senators earlier this year.
Rep. Valerie McDonnell, a Salem Republican and co-sponsor of the bill, said the law’s main aim is to build partnerships for career and technical education. Salem has a CTE center, where high school students can go for classes to prepare them for professions or trades that are not always taught in high school, and the new law could help more high schools in her area contribute to that program, she said.
“It’s specialties, maybe automotive or cosmetology,” McDonnell said in an interview. “So having a CTE center, Salem has found that (the new law) would be helpful.”
But McDonnell also noted the law could be used to help high school administrators fill spots when hiring teaching help is difficult.
“The way I see it is, if there is an open space and there’s a teacher who has passed a background check, they have experience teaching at a college, and they’re more than willing to teach at the high school, I would much rather that teacher be in the classroom than nobody at all, and the class doesn’t get offered, and the students can’t learn that subject,” she said.
But teachers have protested.
“I am insulted that this would even be considered for the education of our college (bound) students,” wrote Jamie Bolduc, a teacher of 24 years from Fremont, in written testimony to the House. “Our certifications show that we have demonstrated the skills required to educate others; it would be like going to have surgery with someone who has never been to medical school”
Kate Griffin, of Hooksett, agreed, arguing in her own testimony that the law would “dumb down” teaching. “Education is a multifaceted and complex job,” she said. “We need certified professionals who are up to the task, not those who do not also understand the complexities of child development and how children learn.”
The National Education Association of New Hampshire, the state’s largest teacher’s union, has also opposed the bill. 
“While New Hampshire’s inadequate and inequitable school funding system has exacerbated teacher shortages in property poor and lower-income communities, lowering  the standards for who can teach is an inappropriate response,” said NEA-NH President Megan Tuttle in a statement earlier this month. “For school districts with fewer resources, this law could incentivize administrators to hire uncertified and untrained temporary fill-in educators rather than licensed teachers who are invested in the school community and their students.”
For now, it’s not clear whether public schools are interested in hiring part-time teachers from colleges. 
Mark MacLean, the executive director of the New Hampshire School Administrators Association, said in an email he has not heard anything this summer from his member school districts. And a spokeswoman for the University System of New Hampshire said the university was unaware of any public school that has reached out to faculty seeking to hire.
Any moves by schools to hire faculty as part-time teachers would most likely occur on an individual, case-by-case basis, and might not be known to college administrators, Lloyd said.
Lloyd said he is unsure how much interest there is among community college faculty to teach standard classes in K-12 schools. 
And he stressed that the community college system does not take any stance on whether its members teach non-college courses; the organization is only seeking to promote the law’s role toward dual curriculum courses. 
But when it comes to those courses, Lloyd is hopeful the partnerships will continue to increase.
He pointed to one area in which HB 90 could help community college faculty members: working hours. Under the current system, faculty are paid by their community college for the work they do with high schools, and any hours they work at the K-12 school are subtracted from the hours they can spend teaching their courses to college students. Under the new law, if hired by a school district, a faculty member can move forward with two separate contracts and two separate hourly limits, Lloyd said.

(Photo by Shauneen Miranda/States Newsroom)School districts in Ohio and across the country will now be receiving billions of dollars that were being withheld by the Trump administration, funds local public education workers and supporters said are critically needed as the new school year approaches.
The Trump administration halted distribution of $6.8 billion in funds allocated by Congress in March, though $1.4 billion was unfrozen for one of the U.S. Department of Education’s grant programs earlier this month. On Friday afternoon, the White House reportedly announced it will release the rest of the funds due to schools.
The news comes after Ohio school districts, pro-public education organizations and hundreds of individuals signed on to a letter on July 21 urging state and congressional leaders to help release federal funds.
Led by the coalition Honesty for Ohio Education, the letter was directed at Attorney General Dave Yost, the U.S. Department of Education and Ohio’s congressional delegation, expressing “deep concern” over the freezing of federal funding for the state’s public schools.
The funds for Ohio amount to about $185 million for the 2024 fiscal year, according to Honesty for Ohio Education, the absence of which the group said has been “causing widespread disruption and panic to district planning and school operations.”
“This funding is not hypothetical – they are federal dollars already allocated by Congress,” said Dr. Christina Collins, executive director of Honesty for Ohio Education, in a statement. “The withholding of these necessary funds harms children, educators and school communities every day it is delayed, undermining educational progress.”
The federal monies can be used for school districts with low-income families, after-school programs and other educational services, to provide students with “significant opportunity to receive a fair, equitable and high-quality education, and to close educational achievement gaps,” according to the Ohio Department of Education & Workforce website.
“Ohio schools rely on these federal Title funds to support critical services and programs for students,” the letter from the public school supporters stated. “The continued delay in releasing these funds has created uncertainty, disrupted district planning and jeopardized the academic and social supports that many of our students depend on.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXThe money is allocated based on “accountability systems to identify and support schools with academically struggling students” and the funds must be used “to improve student outcomes, including academic achievement,” according to the state education department.
The groups wrote in their letter that the funds “are essential to ensuring equitable access to education for all students, especially those with the greatest need.”
Cleveland Heights-University Heights and Shaker Heights school districts both signed on to the letter, along with the Shaker Heights Teachers Association, retired members of the Ohio Education Association and the Ashland County Community Academy.
Organizations such as the Boys & Girls Clubs of Northeast Ohio, the Lake County NAACP and the Ohio Council of Churches also joined in on the letter.
The districts, groups and individuals asked for specific things of each entity to whom they sent the letter. They called on Yost to “take all legal and administrative steps necessary to secure the immediate release of these funds,” and asked Ohio’s members of Congress to “publicly and forcefully advocate for the prompt distribution of these federal dollars to our school districts.”
Of the U.S. Department of Education, the letter asked for a partnership with state and federal officials “to ensure these funds are delivered swiftly and equitably, as intended by law.”

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)Between 2016 and 2022, as congenital syphilis cases rose nationally and especially in the South, Mississippi saw a one thousand percent increase — from 10 to 110 — in the number of newborn babies who were hospitalized after contracting the disease, known to cause developmental issues, intellectual disabilities, and even death.
So in 2023, the state Department of Health mandated that all medical practitioners screen for the disease in pregnant mothers, and it has been running advertisements to spread awareness.
Annual congenital syphilis cases in Mississippi rose from 62 in 2021 to 132 in 2023, according to state data. The number fell to 114 last year. There have been 33 cases so far this year.
That work won’t stop despite potential budget cuts, Dr. Daniel Edney, Mississippi’s state health officer, said in an interview. “We’re going to keep doing what we have to do, you know, to keep it under control.”
State by state, public health departments take a similar approach: They monitor, treat and try to stem preventable diseases, alongside their host of other duties. But in the coming year, health department officials — with their agencies already strapped for cash — fear they’ll find it much more difficult to do their jobs.
President Donald Trump’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2026 would cut the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention budget by more than half, from $9.3 billion to $4.2 billion. The proposal serves as a wish list from the administration, a blueprint for the Republican-controlled Congress as it works through upcoming spending legislation.
If lawmakers hew to Trump’s vision, then state and county public health departments would be hit hard. States contribute to their own health departments, but a lot of them rely heavily on federal funding.
And around half of local public health department funding comes from federal sources, primarily the CDC, as noted in a 2022 report from the National Association of County & City Health Officials.
Medicaid cuts are likely to worsen mental health care in rural America

“The federal government provides a lot of funding, but the actual implementation of public health programs happens at the state and local level,” said Josh Michaud, associate director of global health policy at KFF, a health policy research group. “Each state has its own approach, in many ways, to how public health programs are overseen, how they’re funded, how they are implemented.”
In announcing his department’s share of the proposed budget, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said Trump’s goals align with “new priorities in reversing the chronic disease epidemic.”
But many local health leaders point to the longtime mission of state public health departments in preventing the spread of disease.
“Local public health is on the front lines preventing communicable disease, operating programs to prevent chronic disease, ensuring our septic and well water systems are safe,” said Dr. Kelly Kimple, acting director of North Carolina’s Division of Public Health within the Department of Health and Human Services.
“I’m very concerned,” Kimple said, “especially given the magnitude of funding that we’re talking about, as we can’t keep doing more with less.”
Clawing back COVID-era grants
Other federal budget cuts also have states worried.
Many state public health departments grew alarmed when the Trump administration announced in March that it would be clawing back $11.4 billion in COVID-era funding for grants that were slated to extend into 2026.
Twenty-three states and the District of Columbia sued. A federal district court in Rhode Island temporarily blocked the cuts, and the case remains tied up in court.
The court’s preliminary injunction may not protect temporary staff or contractors, though. Public health departments have been laying off staff, cutting lab capacity and reducing immunization clinics, said Dr. Susan Kansagra, chief medical officer for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.
No one knows whether Trump’s $50B for rural health will be enough

Historically, public health departments receive funding in “boom and bust” cycles, meaning they tend to get more federal support during emergencies, said Michaud, of KFF. But “since the Great Recession of 2008, there was a general decline in public health support funding until the COVID pandemic.”
For example, KHN and The Associated Press reported that between 2010 and 2019, spending on state public health departments declined by 16% per capita and spending for local health departments fell by 18%.
Nationally, syphilis cases reached historic lows in the 2000s, thanks to robust prevention efforts and education from public health officials. By 2022, however, cases reached their highest numbers nationally since the 1950s.
“In the wake of the COVID emergency, you’ve seen a sort of backlash to what people had been calling the overreach of public health and imposing vaccination requirements and lockdowns and other public health measures,” Michaud told Stateline.
Smallpox, cholera and typhoid
Public health departments and officials go back to the 19th century, when there was a greater emphasis on sanitation efforts to prevent spread of diseases such as smallpox, cholera and typhoid, which were rampant at the time.
By the end of the century, 40 states had established health departments, which to this day are responsible for water sanitation, tracking the spread of disease, administering vaccinations, furnishing health education, providing screenings for infants and some prenatal care for moms at local clinics, offering family planning services, and tracking and treating sexually transmitted infections, among other things.











What we're seeing now is a complete upheaval of the funding going into public health.


– Josh Michaud, associate director of global health policy at KFF



Kimple pointed to measles as a current example of a disease that’s spreading fast. When North Carolina’s health department detected a case in the state, she said, the department “identified and contacted everyone who might have been exposed, helped people get tested, worked with doctors to make sure they knew how to respond.”
That’s the legacy of local public health, Michaud said.
“The federal government cannot decide, ‘This public health program will happen in this state, but not that state,’ that kind of thing. And cannot declare a national lockdown. The COVID pandemic tested a lot of those boundaries. It really is a state and local responsibility to protect public health. And that’s always been the case, since the beginning of our country,” Michaud said.
“And what we’re seeing now is a complete upheaval of the funding going into public health.”
A major cut in services
Kimple said she’s seen recent progress in her state in the support for funding public health.
“North Carolinians viewed our work as highly important to improving health and well-being in the state, and appreciated the local presence, the reliable information, the role in prevention and efforts to protect, in particular, vulnerable communities,” she said.
Similarly, Edney said that Mississippi state lawmakers were showing more support, despite some setbacks in 2016 and 2017. New federal cuts could throw a wrench in the health department’s economic plans and its ability to reach small communities.
“Now the federal rug is being pulled out from under us,” he said.
Edney said he expects the federal share of his department’s public health funding to fall from its current 65% to around 50%.
Edney said he’s been trying to strengthen Mississippi health department’s longevity by diversifying its revenue streams by, for example, accepting private donations.
The state will not stop doing its “core” work, he said, regardless of federal funding.
“We’re not going to cut back on services at the county health department, because what we do now is all mission critical,” Edney said.

(Photo by Bruce Bennett/Getty Images)More than 63 million Americans are caregivers for a family member with complex medical needs, a 20 million increase over the past decade, according to a new report.
But state policies, workplaces and the American health system haven’t kept up with this surge in family caregiving responsibilities, said Dr. Myechia Minter-Jordan, a physician and the CEO of the AARP, which released the report with the National Alliance for Caregiving, a nonprofit policy and research organization.
“Nearly half of caregivers say they face major financial consequences, draining savings, falling into debt or struggling to afford basic needs like food and housing,” Minter-Jordan told reporters on a call this week.
One of the biggest reasons for the surge in family caregivers is that Americans are living longer, yet they’re not necessarily healthier. There’s a 12-year gap between the average number of years that Americans live and the number of years they’re healthy.
‘A purpose in this world’: Older adults fear elimination of program that helps them find work

The caregiving role typically involves helping a family member with daily tasks like bathing, dressing and eating. But more than half of caregivers also perform more complex medical tasks, such as managing catheters or administering injections, the report found.
A growing number of caregivers are so-called “sandwich caregivers” — parents caring for their children as well as for an adult family member, such as an aging parent. About 17 million people are sandwich caregivers, compared with 11 million a decade ago. And most caregivers are also working a job.
And while the bulk of caregiving still falls on women, 40% of American caregivers are men.
Some states have heeded the growing calls for action.
Earlier this year, Maine lawmakers created a state program to provide respite care, which includes services such as adult day care that give family caregivers a temporary break.
Also this year, Tennessee extended its pilot program that provides respite care for Alzheimer’s and dementia patients, and also passed a bipartisan bill that directs the state Medicaid program to develop guidelines to allow family caregivers to be paid for their work.
Last year, Nebraska passed a tax credit for family caregivers; Oklahoma passed a similar law the year before. And while the United States is one of few countries that doesn’t mandate paid family leave at the federal level, 13 states and the District of Columbia have established their own paid family leave rules.
Meanwhile, the historic cuts to Medicaid enacted as part of the GOP’s Big, Beautiful Bill Act will shift health costs to states, leaving experts worried that family caregivers could lose Medicaid-funded services they rely on.

(Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate)Ann Cornwell has been the soundtrack of the Arkansas Senate for decades.
Standing behind a lectern in the well, Cornwell has read thousands of bills, resolutions and governor’s letters and recited senators’ names as they cast their votes.
The first and only woman to be Secretary of the Senate and its director, colleagues describe Cornwell as a committed public servant who’s led with grace and a commitment to excellence while directing staff and legislators through the intricacies of creating state law.
After 45 years in the Senate, Cornwell plans to retire in December.
During the waning days of her final legislative session in April, a staged argument erupted between two senators. The distraction allowed staff to slip into Cornwell’s hands a resolution honoring her years of service. 
Cornwell began to read the text aloud but paused when she saw her name. Lawmakers laughed and applauded, while family and friends hiding in side rooms spilled onto the Senate floor. 
The surprise was a welcome one, perhaps the first for a woman who’s had her hand in the meticulous details of running the Senate for years. 
“I was totally shocked, especially with the kids coming in from out of state. It was a big surprise, it really was,” she said. 
Overcome, Cornwell handed the resolution to a colleague to read. 
“For forty-five (45) years, Ann Cornwell has been the heart and soul of the Senate because of her dedication to the institution and its processes, loyalty to the first branch of government, unmatched work ethic, affection for each senator, and support of Senate and legislative staff,” the resolution read, in part. 
While Cornwell feels fortunate to have a job she absolutely loves, she’s looking forward to spending her retirement visiting family, traveling with legislative colleagues from around the country who’ve become close friends and learning to play Mahjong. 
“I love the Senate, I always have. I still love it and I know I’m going to miss it, but it’s time,” she said. “I’m ready, and I think the Senate’s in a good place right now for me to leave.”
Origin story
Sabrina Lewellen said she has one of the world’s best jobs as deputy director and assistant secretary to a “superhero.”
Having worked alongside Cornwell for two decades, Lewellen said she’s blessed to have learned from a “fearless, dedicated public servant” who’s committed to the details. 
“Her grace, her unmatched dedication to all things Senate…I have had the honor to be in the presence of true greatness, and I am going to miss her.”

Though she’s now synonymous with the Senate, politics was not Cornwell’s obvious destiny. Growing up in Russellville, she was an athletic child who loved swimming and diving. She also studied physical education at Arkansas Tech University where her dad coached.
“I dropped out of that when they plopped a rat in front of me I had to dissect and I said, ‘I’m out of here.’ So I changed to business,’” Cornwell recalled with a laugh. 
While in college, Cornwell married her husband and gave birth to their son. She had twin girls two years later, and the young family moved to Tennessee and Texas before ultimately settling in North Little Rock. 
Cornwell cared for her children, played tennis and bridge, and was active in Junior League. One day friends suggested Cornwell join them at the Capitol for session work because “it’s fun,” and she did. 
She began her career in the Senate in 1981 as a journal clerk. Cornwell became assistant Secretary of the Senate in 1991 and the full-time Secretary and fiscal officer in 1995. She’s served in her current role since 2009. 
When she started four decades ago, did Cornwell think she’d still be here? “Absolutely not,” she said with a hearty laugh. 
Cornwell, who loves being in session and busy, has seen lots of change during her time in the upper chamber. Women are now elected to Senate seats instead of serving temporarily after their husband’s death. Technology has evolved. Many things are now digital, but the process remains the same so staff can still run a session if the computers go down, Cornwell said. 
Institutional legislative staff are the “indispensable facilitators of democracy,” according to Lewellen, who said she’s grateful for Cornwell’s  “legacy leadership.” 
“It’s quite a machine and it doesn’t happen by accident, and the Anns of the world who help construct it, it’s just true brilliance,”  Lewellen said.

During Lewellen’s first day in the Senate in 2003, Cornwell taught her some important lessons. One is “this is a very big deal and never treat it less than that,” Lewellen said. 
Another, Cornwell said, is “there’s no job that you’re too good for,” including taking out the trash.
“Everybody works together and helps each other, and that’s what you’ve got to understand: is that if something needs done, you’ll help somebody, you’ll do it,” Cornwell said. “I don’t expect anyone to do something that I would not do, and I’ve done everything.”
Lewellen remains in awe of her hero, who’s “touched hundreds of thousands of pages of history.” 
“There is some real strength and intelligence and integrity and intentionality, commitment and sacrifice that goes on behind the scenes, and she is one of those warriors whose strength has just been unmatched,” Lewellen said. 
Like family
In 2010, Missy Thomas Irvin, a newly-elected Mountain View Republican, was lost in the Senate chamber the first time she met Cornwell.
“She just immediately embraced me with a hug and just said, ‘Welcome to the Senate,’ and then directed me to the office I needed to go to…I’d still never forget her demeanor of…you are now in the Senate and you’re a part of the Senate family,” Irvin said. 
The following summer, Fayetteville Democrat Greg Leding, a new House representative, was wandering around San Antonio alone during a legislative conference. Cornwell spotted him and insisted he join her and other legislators on a riverboat tour. 
“I just always remember that because I was still very much a new member of the House, I wasn’t even in her chamber, but still made me feel incredibly welcome,” Leding said.

Cornwell is a warm and pleasant person who loves to socialize, according to Leding, who grew to know her better after joining the Senate in 2018. 
“Even if you’ve never met her, she can make you feel like you’ve been friends for years within minutes of meeting her,” he said. 
Lt. Gov. Leslie Rutledge said working with Cornwell provided “a great deal of relief” when she began presiding over the Senate in 2023. 
“She is a selfless leader, she enjoys life, she has an incredible, witty personality, hardworking, someone you want to be around,” Rutledge said. 
Irvin said she also appreciated Cornwell treating all lawmakers equally. 
“What you do for one senator, you do for the next one…doesn’t matter if it’s the number one in seniority or if it’s the 35th in seniority, you treat them all the same. It’s totally nonpartisan,” Cornwell said. 
The Senate stalwart’s mark on the body is “indelible and it’ll never be the same,” Leding said. 
Never one to sit idle, Cornwell said she’s exploring volunteer opportunities during her retirement, and can provide assistance behind the scenes at the Capitol if she’s needed. 
As she prepares for this next chapter, Cornwell hopes she’s remembered as someone who worked hard and always tried to do her best.
“And that I was fair. That I’ve always been fair and tried to uphold the institution…45 years is a long time to be up here…it’s been a good ride,” she said.

Ohio Reps. Sean Brennan, D-Parma, and D.J. Swearingen, R-Huron, once again introduced a bipartisan bill that would make the  walleye Ohio’s official state fish. 
“I’m optimistic that we’re going to be able to reel this one in and finally make the walleye our state fish,” Brennan said. “We are the walleye capital of the world, and Ohio is open for anglers from all over the place to come here and experience what Ohio is all about.”

The lawmakers introduced House Bill 312 at the end of May and it had sponsor testimony last month in the House Arts, Athletics and Tourism Committee. Ohio, Indiana, and Iowa are the only states without a designated state fish. The walleye is the state fish in Minnesota, South Dakota, and Vermont. 
“By having an official state fish, it allows the state of Ohio to market that to folks in other states,” Brennan said. “I’ve talked to environmentalists who said that having a state fish can help them on their grant applications with different levels of government and with other nonprofits that make donations.”  
There are 72.1 million walleye in Lake Erie at least two years or older, meaning they are ready to be caught and kept, Brennan said in his testimony. For comparison, there are about 600,000 white-tailed deer in Ohio, he said. 
The Walleye are the nickname of Toledo’s professional minor league hockey team and Port Clinton celebrates the annual Walleye Festival as well as the Walleye Drop on New Year’s Eve.
Brennan — who grew up fishing on Catawba Island — and Swearingen introduced the same bill during the previous General Assembly and it easily passed the House with only four dissenting votes, but it ran out of time in the Senate and died. 
“It’s not really controversial,” Brennan said. “I mean, we passed almost unanimously last year.” 
Having the walleye become the official state fish would help show off Lake Erie, Swearingen said. 
“There’s a lot of people that come into the district just to fish for that fish on Lake Erie,” he said. “The economic impact is pretty large.”
Jason Fischer runs three competitive walleye tournament series in Ohio — the Lake Erie Walleye Trail, the Walleye Fall Brawl, and the Ohio Walleye Federation. 
“Ohio is the walleye capital of the world,” he said. “No questions asked, it is just astronomical.” 
People from more than 20 states and Canada come annually to compete in the Walleye Fall Brawl. 
“You come to Ohio to fish for walleye because it’s the best place in the world to do it,” Fischer said. 
Ohio fishing has an economic impact of $5.5 billion per year, according to the Ohio Department of Natural Resources. 
“Just because somebody comes here to fish doesn’t mean that the restaurants don’t benefit, the fuel stations don’t benefit, the hotels don’t benefit,” Fischer said. 
For Ohio Marine Trades Association President Michelle Burke, naming the walleye the official state fish is no brainer. 
“This shouldn’t even have to be brought up again,” she said. “It should just be a full vote. We love eating perch. Perch tastes great, but I think what the walleye does for Ohio far exceeds any other fish.”

Mike DeWine’s new property tax reform working group met on Thursday to discuss relieving the burden homeowners are facing. The group has not been well received by some Republican lawmakers, who are not obligated to act upon the group’s suggestions.
The working group has 60 days to attempt to solve what business leader Pat Tiberi and former state Rep. Bill Seitz say is the most challenging issue in Ohio: property tax relief and reform.
“Our objective is to provide as much meaningful property tax relief as we can, particularly to those who need it most, and do it in a way that does not break the bank of the state of Ohio,” Seitz said during the meeting.
DeWine assigned the pair to co-chair the new group, which is made up of local officials and school superintendents. The group has a report deadline of September 30, when the state budget bill goes into effect.
The governor created this group as a way to discourage overrides to his vetoes.
House Speaker Matt Huffman (R-Lima) and the GOP have passed one override.
In the two-year state operating budget, DeWine vetoed restrictions on the ability to put emergency levies on the ballot or request an increase to a current levy. That provision eliminated levy replacements on property taxes for all political subdivisions. For schools, it would have prohibited them from imposing a fixed-sum emergency levy, a substitute emergency levy and a combined school district income tax and fixed-sum property tax levy. But the House narrowly passed an override on the provision, 61-28, just clearing the threshold of 60 votes.
The speaker also wants to override two other vetoes. However, he was unable to get the votes to override them.
DeWine removed a provision that would have allowed county budget commissions to unilaterally take money away from passed school levies if they find it “reasonably necessary.”
He also vetoed another that would have required that emergency and substitute tax levies, incremental growth levies, conversion levies, and the property tax portion of combined income tax and property tax levies be included in the 20-mill floor calculation for school funding purposes.
“Transparency, clarity — gives the opportunity for voters to know what they’re voting on, for locals to control taxes,” Huffman said.
The governor’s working group isn’t necessary, he said.
“The legislature has studied and acted … I’m not interested in participating in that,” Huffman said.
Neither is state Rep. David Thomas, who has been leading the override charge. He sighed when I brought it up to him.
“I don’t know exactly what else could be put out there that’s not already been said,” Thomas said.
Republicans have said that local governments should be responsible for providing property tax relief since appraisals have skyrocketed over the past few years.
Educators like John Patterson say that Ohio should bear the cost.
“The state has not done its best for local governments and for the school districts,” Patterson said.
Schools and municipalities have been underfunded while the wealthy have received tax cuts, Patterson said.
“I’m asking for a balance between property tax, sales tax, and obviously, income tax, for all taxing entities across the state of Ohio,” he said.
Veto overrides could lead to massive cuts, he said, to school programs and staffing.
Local law enforcement and firefighters could also face challenges due to levy restrictions.
“The FOP is very concerned about potential reductions in funding for law enforcement across Ohio and are looking forward to seeing the results of Governor DeWine’s task force,” said Jay McDonald, President of the FOP of Ohio. “Many jurisdictions across Ohio are barely able to provide basic services now, and we are interested in hearing any ideas on how those services will be sustained with a reduction in revenue.”
Tiberi said he knows that policy will need to have a balance, and every idea is on the table when coming up with relief.
“We have to figure this out because it’s important to our citizens, it’s important to our seniors, it’s important to our kids who we want to stay here, live here, buy a house here and create a business here,” Tiberi said.

(Getty Images)For the past two weeks now, I’ve gone to the movies.
That’s probably the first time in a half decade or so that I’ve actually chosen to buy tickets, make the drive out to the Lawrence multiplex, and watch two films on two successive Sundays. The first was the latest incarnation of Superman, the second a new take on the Fantastic Four.
I’m not actually the world’s biggest superhero movie fan. I enjoy them well enough, but I’ve sat out most recent entries. Too much spandex, too many capes, not enough human connection — except the punching and kicking kind. Yet the Fantastic Four and Superman both interested me enough to take the plunge. My husband, at one time a devoted comics reader, made the decision easier. We can always find something to talk about afterward, even if the movies are bad.
Yet neither movie was bad. And both had a lot to say about the world right now.
Sunday columnist Max McCoy covered Superman for the Reflector a couple of weeks ago, noting recent controversy about the hero’s immigration status. (He’s from the planet Krypton, after all, although raised right here in Kansas.) The Fantastic Four film reboots the first superhero team created for Marvel Comics, setting up a confrontation with cosmic baddie Galactus in alternate-history 1960s New York. Picture analogue robots, flying cars and sleek spaceships. It depicts a world in which nations eagerly work together to combat a common threat.
Wouldn’t it be nice to live in such a world? Wouldn’t it be nice to have that world inhabited by super-beings who work for the betterment of everyone?
Each film adopts a pointedly optimistic, earnest tone. My husband noted that either one would have been unthinkable 10 or 20 years ago, when irony was the coin of the realm.
These days, we want sincerity. Even in our escapist weekend entertainment, we want to believe that we can work together with our fellow human beings. We want to believe that folks among us can be, well, super. If you want wisecracks and sarcasm, you can pull up whatever social media platform you choose.
The films put me in mind of another Kansas Reflector columnist, Mark McCormick. Last week, he argued that attacks on the U.S. Department of Education undermine the common good.
“Increasing waves of politicians exalt qualities that should disqualify them as public officials: a mistrust of government, demonizing opponents, and supporting private schools with public money,” Mark wrote. “These qualities should stand as barriers to candidacy, not bona fides.“
Both the Fantastic Four and Superman devote themselves to the common good.
That’s why they’re superheroes — not because of their powers, but because of their morals. They serve humanity. They serve their country. They serve one another. The Fantastic Four literally contains a family: Reed Richards (Mr. Fantastic) and Sue Storm (the Invisible Woman) are a married couple, while Johnny Storm (the Human Torch) is Sue’s brother and Ben Grimm (the Thing) is a close friend. During the film, Reed and Sue welcome their son, Franklin, into the world.
“They are parents first,” director Matt Shakman told Variety. “They are scientists and explorers second. And they’re superheroes only when they have to be. I come at this as a dad and as a husband. That’s what makes it so special to me.”
Every summer brings superhero films. Almost every superhero film brings battles between good and evil. Yet these films, and this summer, suggest to me that both filmmakers and audiences yearn for more than thrills. They want clarity. They want warm, nurturing, uncomplicated goodness.
Unfortunately, that’s not the world right now.
We live in a state and nation riven by partisan divides. Figuring out the right course in a shattered political landscape can flummox the most informed among us. Rather than the bright clarity of the movies, alternate realities where we know good from bad and right from wrong, where villains helpfully sneer and snarl at heroes, we have to make the best-informed decisions we can. We make decisions without knowing the outcome, only hoping for the best.
Superheroes appear in comic books on and screen. Those of us navigating troubled times have to find that heroism, moral clarity and dedication to others within ourselves.
We may not fly. But we can soar.

(Photo by Jnaiah Price)Twenty-eight-year-old Michaela Bonner has been working 12-hour shifts as an emergency medical technician in Norfolk, Virginia, for the past four years, while attending and paying for college to finish her prerequisites for medical school.
But now that President Donald Trump’s signature tax and spending law bars students from borrowing more than $50,000 annually in unsubsidized federal loans for medical school, Bonner is worried her dream of becoming a doctor is financially out of reach.
“I get told, ‘Well, we really need you. We have a physician shortage, and you’ve done all this work leading up to this point,’ and that’s true as well, and it’s not that I want to quit,” Bonner said in a recent interview. “But there are no systems in place that I can rely on to support me now that I can’t take out the full cost of living through loans.”
The tax and spending law includes provisions that significantly alter the student loan process for higher education. The law halts current student loan repayment plans for loans that are granted on or after July 1, 2026. On that date, the law also terminates Grad PLUS loans, which have helped people pay for their higher education degrees and total cost of attendance. Current borrowers will be grandfathered in.
The federal law gives current borrowers enrolled in loan repayment plans for students based on income — such as those plans known as SAVE or IBR — until July 1, 2028, to switch to a new plan. Interest collection will resume Aug. 1 for students enrolled in the Biden-era SAVE plan.
At the same time, medical or law school students hoping to get unsubsidized federal loans — in which the borrower is responsible for paying the interest at all times rather than the government — will only be able to borrow $50,000 per year, with a $200,000 lifetime cap. Those seeking advanced degrees in areas such as history or philosophy have a $100,000 lifetime cap.
The average yearly cost of medical school for the 2024-25 academic year ranged from around $42,000 to $72,000, depending on whether the school was private or public and whether the student was a resident or nonresident, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges.
Some congressional Republicans say that students need to be working harder to pay for higher education, like medical school, on their own. Others say the caps put the onus back on colleges and universities to rein in the rising cost of tuition. But critics of this legislation say the loan caps are only going to harm students, especially from lower-income backgrounds, and will exacerbate physician shortages.
In recent years states have tried to ease physician shortages by implementing various policy solutions. Since 2023, at least nine states have made it easier for doctors trained in other countries to get medical licenses. States have also participated in interstate licensing compacts, allowing nurses and physician assistants to travel across state lines to work, so long as they are licensed in one state within the compact.
For student loan relief, more than 20 states have enacted legislation to address student loan forgiveness, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, a group that tracks states policies. Georgia passed a measure that will expand a cancelable loan program for physicians working in rural and underserved areas. Idaho also created the Rural Nursing Loan Repayment Program, offering nurses $25,000 in forgivable loans after three years of service in a rural area.
States are making it easier for physician assistants to work across state lines

McKenzie Richards, a health care policy fellow at the conservative think tank Cicero Institute who has been studying the pace of physician shortages, told Stateline that the national physician shortage could potentially exceed 100,000 by 2034. At the end of 2024 that projected number was closer to 64,000 physicians.
Richards said states will be looking toward more policy solutions should the student loan changes exacerbate physician shortages.
“We know what’s going to be happening coming down the line in just five years, so I think policies that states can adopt to get out of this are really important to be looking at now,” she said.
“The hope is that by capping [federal loans], it will encourage schools to lower tuition prices,” Richards added. “Then maybe they need to be admitting more students, which would have a great downstream effect for getting more doctors through.”
Other students will be in the same boat, said Lesley Turner, an associate professor of public policy at the University of Chicago and an economist.
“This is going to hit some students worse than others,” Turner told Stateline. “Those [students] in more expensive programs tend to borrow more, and so for those students they will need to return to private student loans or other ways of financing their graduate education.”
Many students were already questioning their capacity to go to medical school before the student loan caps, said Shannon Jimenez, dean of the Arkansas College of Osteopathic Medicine.
“I expect that this bill, this cap, is going to push people out of primary care and into specialties to help pay off those higher interest rate loans,” Jimenez told Stateline. She added that caps will likely deter students from lower socioeconomic statuses from going into primary care — important in places like Arkansas, where she says there is a “maldistribution of physicians.”
“Many schools like us try to attract those students, because they’re more likely to go into primary care and serve in underserved areas. So it’s going to tie our hands in a lot of ways.”
Amid mental health crisis, new compact allows social workers to practice across state lines

Large states and more rural states will feel the gaps more deeply, said Richards, of the Cicero Institute. Louisiana, for example, is projected to be short almost 5,000 doctors from a variety of specialties by 2030, including close to 400 primary care doctors. Already more than a third of Louisiana physicians are close to retirement age — similar to the situation in neighboring Arkansas.
As for whether schools will just be able to lower tuition, Jimenez said, “it makes no sense.”
“We still function in a somewhat market-driven economy and have to compete with other schools around us, so our cost is based mostly on what we have to pay our faculty, and that’s not going to go down,” she said. The annual cost of attendance at her school is between $80,000 and $85,000.
Bonner, the EMT, holds a political communications degree from Regent University and now is studying biomedical sciences at Old Dominion University. She already has $20,000 in loans, she said, and for the rest of college tuition, she has paid out of pocket. Since she’s supporting herself, she hasn’t been able to save much.
She’d planned to take the medical school entrance exam next spring, but now worries about how she’d pay for living expenses while attending. “Medical school scheduling doesn’t allow for working, so you have to take out loans for living expenses,” she said.
“A lot of people, I feel, would be panicked if you had worked for eight to 10 years of your life and found out that all the systems that you were banking on in a really academically challenging space are disappearing,” Bonner said.
“I don’t see a path forward for certain, but I’m fighting to make one.”

More than 63 million Americans are caregivers for a family member with complex medical needs, a 20 million increase over the past decade, according to a new report.
But state policies, workplaces and the American health system haven’t kept up with this surge in family caregiving responsibilities, said Dr. Myechia Minter-Jordan, a physician and the CEO of the AARP, which released the report with the National Alliance for Caregiving, a nonprofit policy and research organization.
“Nearly half of caregivers say they face major financial consequences, draining savings, falling into debt or struggling to afford basic needs like food and housing,” Minter-Jordan told reporters on a call this week.
One of the biggest reasons for the surge in family caregivers is that Americans are living longer, yet they’re not necessarily healthier. There’s a 12-year gap between the average number of years that Americans live and the number of years they’re healthy.
The caregiving role typically involves helping a family member with daily tasks like bathing, dressing and eating. But more than half of caregivers also perform more complex medical tasks, such as managing catheters or administering injections, the report found.
A growing number of caregivers are so-called “sandwich caregivers” — parents caring for their children as well as for an adult family member, such as an aging parent. About 17 million people are sandwich caregivers, compared with 11 million a decade ago. And most caregivers are also working a job.
And while the bulk of caregiving still falls on women, 40% of American caregivers are men.
Some states have heeded the growing calls for action.
Earlier this year, Maine lawmakers created a state program to provide respite care, which includes services such as adult day care that give family caregivers a temporary break.
Also this year, Tennessee extended its pilot program that provides respite care for Alzheimer’s and dementia patients, and also passed a bipartisan bill that directs the state Medicaid program to develop guidelines to allow family caregivers to be paid for their work.
Last year, Nebraska passed a tax credit for family caregivers; Oklahoma passed a similar law the year before. And while the United States is one of few countries that doesn’t mandate paid family leave at the federal level, 13 states and the District of Columbia have established their own paid family leave rules.
Meanwhile, the historic cuts to Medicaid enacted as part of the GOP’s Big, Beautiful Bill Act will shift health costs to states, leaving experts worried that family caregivers could lose Medicaid-funded services they rely on.

Like the rest of the nation, North Carolina faces some enormous policy challenges these days. Thanks to sustained disinvestments in an array of core public services, our state is fast becoming coarser, less healthy and more divided.
Unfortunately, Republican legislative leaders seem unconcerned. Rather than working with Governor Josh Stein to tackle our numerous outsized problems, they spent the recent legislative session advancing divisive culture war bills and failing even to pass a new state budget for the fiscal year that began July 1.
And now, rather than honestly owning up to and addressing their shortcomings, they’re returning to Raleigh this week to double down on them with a plan to override Stein’s vetoes of several destructive and hyper-partisan bills. And the overdue budget? It’s nowhere in sight.
The bottom line: Caring and thinking lawmakers of both parties should take a stand against this failed and divisive strategy by sustaining Stein’s vetoes and sending a message to legislative leaders that it’s past time to end the games and work together for the good of all North Carolinians.

With a growing number of Democratic and a pair of Republican hats in the ring, Nebraskans in the Omaha-based 2nd Congressional District will have a bountiful slate of hopefuls from which to choose as Republican U.S. Rep. Don Bacon’s successor. U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., will be challenged by registered nonpartisan Dan Osborn. Gov. Jim Pillen has announced his bid for reelection. Those willing to run in this political universe deserve some respect, too.
Some in the chattering class — this space included — have on occasion referred to these days, weeks and months as “silly season,” a snarky broadside not without basis. For details, check some of the frivolity that has accompanied recent campaigns when we set about practicing the bedrock principle of a democratic republic: representative government. Surely the next political contests will provide an intermittent inanity or perhaps some full-on foolishness. 
But make no mistake. What’s at stake this time is anything but silly.
Serious season
This “season” is as serious as one has been. That’s because the shibboleths are correct: Elections have consequences, and we get the government we choose. Even a cursory reading of the morning headlines or a map of the republic’s current misdirection underscores the point that the nation has arrived at a critical intersection.
Election “issues” include the usual suspects: taxes, inflation, immigration, education, foreign policy and jobs. Those and others such as climate change and international trade need to be parsed, debated and delineated among those vying to represent Nebraskans. 
Given the rocky road on which we find ourselves, however, at this juncture in the nascent campaigns, only two issues have worked their way to the top of my mind. Whether they will get any “play” in the 24/7 phalanx of media that hops aboard these long, expensive journeys to a seat in Congress or the state’s corner office remains to be seen. Pro tip: Don’t hold your breath.
First is perhaps more of a group exercise. I’m wondering who, if any, among candidates — incumbents or hopefuls — share the concern that Congress has ceded its co-equal status as a full and functioning branch of government? Or are they comfortable with governing via executive order? See DOGE’s rampage and ransacking for evidence of such acquiescence.
Numbers look off
The numbers are in, too. According to GovTrack.us, Congress has enacted just 27 pieces of legislation since raising its aggregate right hand in early January. Despite the GOP having a majority in the House and Senate, that’s the fewest number of bills in the first six months since the 103rd Congress in 1993, when Democratic President Bill Clinton also enjoyed a political advantage in both houses. 
Nor does passing the Big Ugly in early July make up for the meandering pace of problem solving. All of which adds to the incredulity of House Speaker Mike Johnson extending the August recess while he appears to need time to mitigate the House’s role in a scandalous tempest starting to howl. Less production apparently equals longer recesses.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Second, and of even more importance for a candidate to consider than undoing Congressional capitulation or unchallenged conformity, is whether he or she, as an elected official, would be willing to stand in the face of complete horse hockey and demand that when we do the people’s business, we do it with the facts, not conspiracy theories, internet rumors or simple, bald-faced lies. 
Case in point: Did any of Nebraska’s quintet of representatives publicly question that the country’s director of national intelligence, at a regularly scheduled press conference in the White House briefing room, accused a former presidential candidate of abusing prescription drugs using information from Russian spies? That was also about the time, contrary to evidence, the president was trying to sell the snake oil that a former president should be indicted for treason.
Nebraska used to enjoy a reputation for producing independent political thinkers, a feather in our caps. As we navigate this election season, I’ll be listening for those kinds of voices as taxes, inflation, immigration, education, foreign policy, jobs and more dominate our electoral discussions.
Given the seriousness of this election, however, I’ll mostly be listening for voices who want to return Congress to its full power and who will speak and respect facts, evidence and the truth.

 SMYRNA, Del. Delaware Emergency Management Agency launches a new Delaware School Safety Center as an extension of its Comprehensive School Safety Program. Delaware is committed to providing safe and secure learning environments for students. The DSSC features a new, user-friendly website (https://de.gov/demaschoolsafety) that will be a central hub for training, resources, and coordination where schools and families can access guidance, tools, and best practices on school safety planning and response efforts.



   Joshua Bushweller said that ensuring a safe environment for all Delaware students is of paramount importance.
 

  “The DSSC is a collaborative effort that supports educators and first responders and engages students and parents to build safe and resilient schools communities,” said DEMA director A.J. Shall.
 


 The CSSP was established in 2012, following the passage of Omnibus Safety Act. It laid the foundations for comprehensive, standardized emergency planning at all public and charter school across the state. The act required all schools to have safety plans, conduct lockdown drills and tabletop exercise, as well as critical incident training.


 Delaware has made significant achievements in the area of school safety. Delaware was the state that provided uniform aerial maps for all 19 districts of public schools and charters to ensure rapid response by law enforcement to school buildings and campus during emergencies. Delaware launched Safe DE in 2023. It is a comprehensive safety suite with a 24/7 anonymous report application that empowers students, staff and families to access crisis resources and report safety concerns. Delaware’s School Safety Center offers comprehensive Behavioral Threat Analysis (BTA), enabling school-based teams to identify and respond to potential threats proactively. The Center also provides secure case-management software that facilitates consistent documentation, collaboration and follow-up during the assessment process.



  The Delaware School Safety Center was created to help prevent incidents at schools by preparing educators to work together with community partners in order to mitigate and manage crises.
 

  “Nothing is as important as student safety. Students learn and teachers can teach when they are safe. Safety is not an accident, it’s a deliberate decision.  Secretary for Education Cindy Marten said, “The launch of the Delaware School Safety Center is so important because it represents our shared commitment to create safe and welcoming school environments where teachers can teach and students can flourish.” I am grateful to DEMA for its focused leadership and proud that Delaware is always at the forefront of putting students’ needs first.
 


 The new DSCC offers a range of services that will enhance school safety as part of its core mission. These include:



  After-School Activities – Officials are able to provide schools with tools and guidance in order to plan and manage safely after-school activities, extracurricular sports and gatherings of the community on school grounds.
 

  Law Enforcement Training – School resource officers and constables can receive the latest law enforcement training, with an emphasis on relationship-building, safety planning and de-escalation.
 

  Safety Assessments: Trained professionals are available to help schools identify weaknesses and make practical recommendations based on evidence to enhance school security.

(Screenshot via Facebook page of HOMES Inc.)The groundbreaking Wednesday for a new neighborhood in the Floyd County seat of Prestonsburg wasn’t just a ceremony for Tom Manning-Beavin. The crews working for his nonprofit had already started digging trenches to pour concrete foundations of future homes. 
“My crew leaders were talking to the city building inspector as we were leaving, coordinating the inspection of those footers,” said Manning-Beavin, president and CEO of Frontier Housing in Morehead. “We’ll pour and just start rocking and rolling.” 
The quick pace Manning-Beavin describes is one that nonprofit housing builders in Eastern Kentucky have tried to keep up in the three years since catastrophic flooding inundated Eastern Kentucky communities in the summer of 2022. The aftermath of that disaster ruined thousands of homes and killed dozens of people, and the region has grappled with more devastating floods since, including in February. 
It also has brought about collaborations between Kentucky state government, nonprofit builders and local officials to develop several “higher ground” communities out of flood plains. 
Newly built homes have been going up, some on former strip mines, and flood survivors are slowly starting to move in. Housing developments are still being planned. In Floyd County, the planned neighborhood called New Hope Estates will have 34 homes funded by federal disaster funds previously allocated. 
Despite builders trying to ramp up construction, the need for housing is both vast and urgent.

Ashley Tackett-Laferty, D-Martin. (Provided via Flickr, Office of Gov. Andy Beshear)
Scott McReynolds, the executive director of the Perry County-based Housing Development Alliance, said his nonprofit has built roughly 400 homes over roughly 30 years. In  past years, the nonprofit would typically consider 20 homes built in a year as a “great year.” 
He now expects to build around 60 this year, with a total reaching up to 140 over two years. 
“We’re producing at a scale that just a few years ago was not conceivable. And so on the one hand, I think this is a great push,” McReynolds said. “On the other hand, I don’t know that it’s sufficient.” 
Fahe, a network of more than 50 nonprofits across Appalachia including the Housing Development Alliance and Frontier Housing, rallied around the slogan “Housing Can’t Wait” in the wake of the 2022 floods to call on the Kentucky legislature to allocate immediate housing funds for the region. It’s evolved in the years since into a call to action to address the broader housing shortage across Appalachia, setting an ambitious goal of building or rehabilitating 60,000 homes through 2030 across the multi-state region that Fahe serves. That would double the pace of housing work that the Fahe network does. 
Reynolds said his nonprofit’s calculations, utilizing census data on housing and income, estimate that about 40% of the tens of thousands people across the primary counties they serve of Breathitt, Leslie, Perry and Knott are “inadequately housed.” He said that can include people experiencing homelessness, people living in substandard housing with structural issues or people paying a disproportionate amount of funding on rent or a mortgage. 
“If that number is even remotely accurate, then we need thousands of affordable units. And even with the flood recovery, we’re building hundreds,” McReynolds said. 
Collaborations building communities
One success story is just outside the Letcher County seat of Whitesburg — eight homes on top of a hillside for flood survivors called Thompson Branch. It’s the second planned “higher ground” community in the region to finish construction, according to the office of Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear. 
Seth Long, executive director of the nonprofit housing builder HOMES Inc., that led the construction of the community, said one of the flood survivors his nonprofit is trying to get into a Thompson Branch home has been living in a 16-foot trailer since the 2022 flood. 
“When I walked him through the house, which is a modest ranch-style house, he was like, “My whole trailer could fit in this one room. He said, ‘You don’t know what it’s like to live three years in a trailer,’” Long said. “He hasn’t been able to move one way or another because there’s nothing that’s available.” 
The homes at Thompson Branch also feature solar panels and an energy efficient design, a part of Home Inc.’s efforts to greatly reduce electricity costs for residents in a region that struggles with some of the state’s highest electricity bills. One of the flood survivors who moved into Thompson Branch, he said, was “tickled to death” to have an electricity bill of only $22.58. 
Another statistic that sticks with Long: More than 500 households in Letcher County have used  federal buyout programs to move out of the flood plain after the 2022 and 2025 floods. Those are hundreds of houses that aren’t being replaced in his community. 
“We’re still yet, three years later, feeling a very sharp impact,” Long said. “That federal investment is now just really practically hitting the ground to where builders are building houses back.”
The work of building homes is just getting underway for Long and other builders. There’s a planned “high-ground” community of 115 homes in Jenkins that’s moving forward. HOMES Inc. is also partnering with the Letcher County government on a few housing projects including turning an old high school building in Fleming-Neon into rental units. They’re also one of several housing nonprofits involved with a higher ground community called Chestnut Ridge in Knott County.

Frontier Housing, the Morehead nonprofit, is also launching a factory in Martin County to build customizable modular homes that it hopes can ramp up the production of housing in multiple Eastern Kentucky communities. 
Building out the infrastructure to serve these homes and securing and developing the land has taken years, nonprofit housing builders told the Lantern. Long said the work of actually building the homes is “just hitting the ground.” 
Builders including Long will still be tapping into the remaining pool of nearly $300 million in federal disaster housing funds allocated after the 2022 floods. But builders believe more investment is needed to keep building on the boom of construction. 
Fahe and other nonprofit housing builders came before the Kentucky legislature last year asking for $200 million to be placed into state housing trust funds to pay for housing construction and rehabilitation. Republican leadership, as they were crafting a two-year state budget, declined to make that investment and questioned the capacity of housing developers to effectively use that money  in a two-year timeframe.
Long said the progress nonprofit housing builders have made in three years shows they do have the capacity to build — if given the resources. 
“One of the things that have limited capacity has been property to build and investment to develop that property. If those things are in place, we can build as many houses that are needed,” Long said. “This kind of momentum, this kind of investment is what moves the needle. It gives impact. It can get attention. It can house people.” 
Floods and funding
Many aspects of future housing work are uncertain, such as how to plan for the next flood or storm. The trauma of going through a major flood can remain with people. 
“It is hard to heal from that,” said Courtney Rhoades, an organizer at the nonprofit legal group Appalachian Citizens’ Law Center in Whitesburg. She mentioned the anxiety of dealing with flash flood warnings earlier this month and hearing the news of destructive flooding in Pike County earlier this year. 
There needs to be more affordable housing, she said, but it needs to be done in a way that includes the input of communities. That includes people with personal connections to their land. 
“I think the ‘higher-ground’ communities is great in the sense of if people want to move,” Rhoades said. “You also need to find solutions for people who don’t want to move away.” 
She believes the construction of the Thompson Branch community incorporated local feedback well, given its close proximity near Whitesburg for people who live and work locally. 
Another question for the future: what will happen under a new administration to federal housing programs that builders rely on.
The Kentucky Housing Corporation, the quasi-governmental agency that allocates federal housing funding, has spoken out against a Trump administration budget proposal that the agency argues could cut federal housing monies, including programs for housing construction, received in Kentucky by 44%. 
“At a minimum, it’s chaotic at the federal level,” said Jim King, the CEO of Fahe. “We don’t know what the commitment of federal resources that have traditionally supported this kind of work will look like.” 
He said Fahe’s nonprofit members are instead leaning into private philanthropy and funding to meet their longer-term housing goals in lieu of uncertain federal and state support. While he considers the Kentucky governor and the Kentucky legislature to be “great partners” when involved, he isn’t going to be limited by their funding choices. 
“I think Eastern Kentucky has spent a lot of time waiting for other people to show up with resources. And that’s — quite honestly — that’s the dynamic I’m actually interested to change,” King said.

However, these low performances are not anomalies — but the status quo, highlighting the state’s prolonged struggle to reverse its affordability issues.   
In early July, CNBC released its annual “America’s Top States for Business” report in which the Constitution State finished middle-of-the-pack, placing 28th overall. The top five were North Carolina, Texas, Florida, Virginia, and Ohio. 
Despite Connecticut improving its overall ranking by four positions from last year, driven mostly by leaps in subcategories like ‘workforce,’ the state still lags in critical areas such as ‘Economy,’ ‘Cost of Doing Business,’ and ‘Cost of Living.’ (See Table One) 
TABLE ONE: CONNECTICUT’S CNBC RESULTS 
CATEGORY 2025 GRADE 2025 RANK 2024 RANK DIFFERENCE Economy D+ 38 39 +1 Infrastructure C 33 29 +4 Workforce B 8 20 +12 Cost of Doing Business D+ 44 43 -1 Business Friendliness C 35 39 +4 Quality of Life B 5 9 +4 Technology & Innovation C+ 19 25 +6 Education A- 5 4 -1 Access to Capital C+ 16 22 +6 Cost of Living D+ 37 34 -3 
Connecticut’s subcategory scores from CNBC are consistent with other national and local surveys released over the past year, indicating a concerning pattern.
WalletHub ranked Connecticut 49th for starting a business; and the Tax Foundation placed the state 47th for the most burdensome tax climate for the tenth consecutive year. The CT Mirror also recently asserted that while Connecticut boasts high average salaries, its cost of living is among the nation’s highest.  
Meanwhile, earlier this year, Realtor.com listed Connecticut third among the states with the highest median property taxes. As the real estate website noted, “Overall, Connecticut residents faced some of the largest property tax increases in the last decade. …Bridgeport, Stamford, and Norwalk are paying some of the highest.”  
When compared to other New England states, New Hampshire eclipsed the Constitution State with the second highest median property tax. Vermont had the lowest rate in the region ranking 33rd. (See Table TWO) 
TABLE TWO: HIGHEST MEDIAN PROPERTY TAX 
STATE MEDIAN PROPERTY TAX AMOUNT New Jersey $9,413 New Hampshire $7,715 Connecticut $6,944 Washington $6,338 New York $6,096 Texas $5,860 California $5,248 Massachusetts $5,142 Rhode Island $5,111 District of Columbia $5,087 
High electric and gas rates, coupled with Connecticut’s ranking among the worst states to retire, exacerbate its affordability crisis — which may endure without curbing government spending and regulations. 
Yet fiscal restraint appears unlikely. Lawmakers are aiming to loosen the state’s fiscal guardrails — bipartisan reforms passed in 2017 to limit the growth in government spending and stabilize the state’s finances — in a rumored special session this fall. Indeed, lawmakers already broke several of the guardrails this past legislative session, despite the reforms’ effectiveness. Since enacted, they have reversed decades of pension underfunding, improved Connecticut’s creditworthiness, and saved the state more than $170 million annually in reduced pension debt payments.  
And despite declaring to be a “strong believer in the spending cap,” Gov. Ned Lamont and lawmakers exceeded the constitutional limit for the first time in nearly two decades to address anticipated Medicaid shortfalls from the federal government. 
Increased government spending, often funded by higher taxes, undermines economic vitality. Indeed, over the years, Connecticut has lost numerous corporate headquarters fleeing to other states (e.g., General Electric, Aetna, Alexion Pharmaceuticals, even LEGO) mostly driven by cost of business expenses.  
Connecticut’s business community has expressed a lack of overwhelming confidence in the state’s economic outlook. In a 2024 survey conducted by the Connecticut Business & Industry Association (CBIA), 86% of business leaders felt the cost of doing business in Connecticut was increasing; and only 8% believed the business climate was improving, versus 39% who said it was declining.  
Although Connecticut’s GDP grew by 2.6% last year, the state economy is not particularly on sound footing, contracting for the “first time in more than three years in the first quarter of 2025 amid tariff concerns, slower consumer spending, and ongoing volatility in the state’s jobs market,” according to CBIA.  
These circumstances would not be as harsh if Connecticut residents received quality government services in return for higher property taxes, helping fund local government operations and schools — yet this isn’t the case. A March 2025 WalletHub report ranks the Constitution State 37th in the country for taxpayer return on investment.  
In short, residents are paying more for less services.  
Further tax increases to fund programs will likely worsen affordability. Higher taxes raise property costs, exacerbating cost-of-living burdens and driving residents and businesses to more affordable states. This vicious cycle leads to the foreshadowed conclusion: a reduction in the tax base. 
Ultimately, Connecticut’s rankings are unlikely to improve without fiscal discipline. All roads to recovery and affordability stem from government restraint, which had once saved the state from a budgetary crisis. 
Lawmakers must resist short-term spending increases, prioritizing fiscal responsibility to ensure a more prosperous future.

It was a symbolic show of solidarity with the real Gaza Freedom Flotilla boats, which have tried to bring humanitarian relief to the two million Palestinians in Gaza – almost always without success and on one occasion resulting in the killing of 10 crew members by Israel.  
One boat – the Madleen – was boarded by Israel in international waters on June 8. The entire crew was arrested and deported from Israel, and its cargo impounded. It only garnered as much publicity as it did because the climate and human rights activist Greta Thunberg was on board.

Another Flotilla ship, the Handala, was intercepted by Israel July 27 in international waters. Among the humanitarian supplies it was carrying was baby formula for starving babies in Gaza.
Besides raising awareness of the ongoing genocide there, the New Haven Freedom Flotilla was raising money for the World Central Kitchen (WCK). It had been feeding tens of thousands of starving Gazans until it was forced to stop for seven weeks due to Israel’s total blockade from March to May, after unilaterally breaking the second ceasefire since October 7. WCK started up operations in late June, but announced on July 20 that it was shutting down again because they had run out of supplies, since Israel is preventing 3,000 trucks from entering the territory.
Our kayakers paddled just outside the Lighthouse Point swimming area, eight of them each displaying a letter that spelled out FEED GAZA. We landed near the lighthouse where we were greeted by dozens of supporters, singing songs and holding banners that demanded, “Permanent Ceasefire Now,” “U.S.: Stop Arming Israel” and “Stop Starving Gaza – Stop ICE – Free Palestine.”

We shared watermelon and got acquainted, since many of us did not know each other and people had come after learning about the event from various lists and social media.
This was a unique action, and it was a local angle on a horrible international tragedy and crime, funded with our tax dollars. It was, therefore, newsworthy. I sent out the news advisory to the usual suspects, but didn’t get much pick-up. One TV station called to say they were planning to come, unless “breaking news” intervened. Then – guess what?! – “breaking news” intervened.
I guess the fact that Israel’s murderous assault on Gaza had been going on for 644 days at that point made it old news.
The confirmed death toll in Gaza so far is more than 58,000 souls, not counting all those buried in the rubble, with some estimates in the hundreds of thousands. And here’s an almost unbelievable twist. Since the U.S. stopped funding UNRWA – the U.N. agency responsible for meeting the needs of displaced Palestinians since 1947 – and since Israel kicked UNRWA out of Gaza, a new U.S.- and Israel-supported organization, the so-called Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), is in charge of feeding the starving populace. 
So far, according to the U.N., at least 875 Gazans have been killed trying to access food, the vast majority at the four sites operated by GHF. (UNRWA ran 400 community-based sites.) According to a report on the Israeli news site Ha’aretz, some Israeli soldiers have revealed that they were ordered to shoot to kill unarmed people who posed no threat. When Hamas and other fighters entered Israel on October 7, they massacred 736 Israeli civilians. So, more Palestinians have been killed trying to get food than Israeli civilians were killed on Oct. 7.
When Israel broke the ceasefire in March, I was filled with anger and despair. I’d been holding signs and banners since mid-October of 2023, but none of my messages seemed adequate to the enormity of Israel’s crimes. It came to me to make a sign that reads, “Palestinians are human.” It’s by far my most popular message. I get dozens of horn honks and thumbs up whenever I hold it at busy intersections. Someone even blew me a kiss.
The American people do not agree with sending billions in military aid to Israel to destroy Gaza. If you agree that two million people – including a million children – do not deserve to starve, you can help by donating to WCK. And if you think the more than $350 million from Connecticut taxpayers currently going to Israel to carry out its atrocities could be put to better use, contact your federal elected officials to demand that they turn off the spigot. And tell them to demand that Israel allow the trucks stuck at the border into Gaza.
Every day the death toll from starvation rises, one more proof of Israel’s genocidal intentions.

This story was updated at 10:38 p.m.
Vermont Green Football Club’s magical season will continue next week in the USL League Two national championship after a 4-2 penalty kick shootout victory over Dothan United Sunday night.
Owen O’Malley netted the Green’s fourth goal in the shootout, punching the club’s ticket to the national championship next Saturday — and sending the sold-out crowd at the University of Vermont’s Virtue Field into a raucous celebration. 
“I do it for the fans, man, you know?” O’Malley said. “I just love these guys so much.”
Goalkeeper Niklas Herceg made two dramatic saves in the shootout to help secure the win.
“The reaction [to me] saving the penalties was incredible. It gives you more energy to maybe save the next one again,” Herceg said.
The Green and Alabama-based Dothan battled through an evenly matched, scoreless 90 minutes in regulation. Vermont Green seemed to have the edge in the two 15-minute extra time halves. But despite a few chances, Vermont couldn’t find the back of the net.
“At the end of the day, we deserved to win,” said Vermont Green FC Head Coach Chris Taylor.
The 2025 season has been the club’s highest-achieving by far, with a 16-match undefeated record, a first-place finish in the northeast division, and an ongoing deep run into the playoffs. In 2024, the Green placed third in its division and won two playoff matches, but were ultimately knocked out by the nationally top-ranked Seacoast United of New Hampshire.
This year, the club will play for the national title — and for the growing fanbase in Vermont.
“These boys, they’re special,” Taylor said. “It’s a humbling experience, I would say, for me to see a community like this support our team.”

ASP was notified of a double homicide at the Washington County park about 2:40 p.m. Saturday, and the couple was found dead on a walking rail, the release said.  The agency’s Criminal Investigation Division is investigating the suspected homicide.
Investigators asked that anyone who visited the park Saturday check cellphone photos and video and GoPro camera footage for possible images of the suspect. State police asked, however, that anyone with photos or video not post footage on social media, as this could jeopardize the investigation.
“Anyone with images of the suspect, information about the suspect or his whereabouts should contact ASP Troop L at (479) 751-6663,” the release said.
State police on Sunday described the suspect as a white male of medium build wearing a long-sleeved shirt with the sleeves rolled up dark pants, a dark ballcap and sunglasses. He was carrying a black backpack and wearing fingerless gloves, according to state police’s description.
He was seen driving toward a park exit in a black, four-door sedan, possibly a Mazda with the license plate covered by black tape, the ASP press release said. He may have traveled on Arkansas Highway 170 or 229 near the park, state police said.
The area where the couple was found remains cordoned off and secured by law enforcement, the release said. The park’s website on Sunday said all trails remain closed.
Located in a remote, rural and rugged area with thick vegetation and no cellphone service near West Fork, the park is a popular hiking and mountain biking destination.
Shea Lewis, secretary of the Arkansas Department of Parks, Heritage and Tourism, issued a statement saying, “We are deeply saddened by the tragic events that occurred at Devil’s Den State Park. … The safety of our visitors and staff is our highest priority, and we are working closely with Arkansas State Police and various law enforcement officials as the investigation continues.”
Col. Mike Hagar, director of State Police and secretary of Public Safety, said his agency is working with local, state and federal law enforcement to apprehend the suspect.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ASP-patrol-car-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-07-27 21:56:45.008145

(Photo by Clark Corbin/Idaho Capital Sun)Ninety-six percent of all registered voters in Idaho believe that public lands should remain in public hands, according to a new poll paid for by Conservation Voters for Idaho.
The poll was conducted in the aftermath of a federal proposal from U.S. Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, to make millions of acres of public land in the U.S., including in Idaho, available to be sold off.
The poll specifically asked Idaho voters questions about Idaho public lands and who they support in Idaho’s 2026 U.S. Senate race.
Alexis Pickering, executive director of Conservation Voters for Idaho, said she has never in her career seen Idahoans from all sides of the political spectrum unite behind a single issue like they have behind public lands this year.
“It really is clear that voters are unified in keeping public lands in public hands,” Pickering said in a phone interview Wednesday.
“It demonstrates that Idaho voters are very cognizant of this fight right now,” Pickering said. “They are very engaged, and they are not going to sit this out.”
More than 60% of the land in Idaho is public land of some form.
Idaho’s registered voters are clear on their support for public access to public lands
The polling firm Change Research conducted the poll among 1,027 registered Idaho voters from July 15-17. The margin of error was 3.2%, according to Change Research.
One poll question asked voters, “Did you support or oppose the amendment to sell off over 3 million acres of public land across 11 Western states, including Idaho?” – with 87% of respondents saying they opposed it.
Battles over public lands loom even after sell-off proposal fails

Another poll question asked voters which statement came closest to their opinion:

Public lands in Idaho, where people enjoy outdoor activities such as fishing, hunting, hiking, camping, and biking, should remain public and be protected so that everyone can keep enjoying them.
Public lands in Idaho, where people enjoy outdoor activities such as fishing, hunting, hiking, camping, and biking, should be made available for purchase and private ownership.

Ninety-six percent of Idaho registered voters said public lands should remain public, including 97% of registered Democrats and 95% of registered Republicans, the poll found.
Lee withdrew his amendment to sell public lands after a public backlash and three of Idaho’s four members of Congress provided public opposition from within the Republican Party to selling public lands.
Even though the public lands amendment was withdrawn, Pickering said the issue isn’t going away. She said Conservation Voters for Idaho plans to highlight public lands as a central issue and continue to hold elected officials accountable for keeping public lands public.
Pickering also said the public is deeply invested in the issue and knows Lee could file another proposal to sell public lands. She compared the proposal to sell public lands to waking a sleeping bear.
“Now that they have woken the bear, it will be really hard to get that bear back in hibernation mode,” Pickering said.
How Idaho’s congressional delegation responded to public lands proposal
Three of Idaho’s four members of Congress, U.S. Sens. Jim Risch and Mike Crapo and U.S. Rep. Mike Simpson, all R-Idaho, provided public Republican opposition to the proposal to sell off public lands, the Sun previously reported.
On June 20, Risch and Crapo, both announced they were opposed to the provision in the budget reconciliation process to sell off public lands. Simpson co-sponsored the Public Lands in Public Hands Act.
Meanwhile, U.S. Rep. Russ Fulcher, R-Idaho, opposed the Public Lands in Public Hands Act, the Utah News Dispatch reported.
In a phone interview with the Idaho Capital Sun earlier this month, Fulcher said, “public land should remain public, but the control, management should be local stakeholders, not the federal government.”
Polling data shows that Risch received a 10% bump in support among all registered voters after they learned Risch provided opposition to the proposal to sell off public lands, up from 41% to 51%. Among registered Republican voters only, Risch’s support increased from 60% to 72% after voters learned Risch provided opposition to the proposal to sell off public lands.
The poll only asked voters about Risch’s upcoming U.S. Senate race, where he faces re-election in 2026. The poll did not ask about Crapo, Simpson or Fulcher, Pickering said.

As the planet gets hotter and its reservoirs shrink and its glaciers melt, people have increasingly drilled into a largely ungoverned, invisible cache of fresh water: the vast, hidden pools found deep underground.
Now, a new study that examines the world’s total supply of fresh water — accounting for its rivers and rain, ice and aquifers together — warns that Earth’s most essential resource is quickly disappearing, signaling what the paper’s authors describe as “a critical, emerging threat to humanity.” The landmasses of the planet are drying. In most places there is less precipitation even as moisture evaporates from the soil faster. More than anything, Earth is being slowly dehydrated by the unmitigated mining of groundwater, which underlies vast proportions of every continent. Nearly 6 billion people, or three quarters of humanity, live in the 101 countries that the study identified as confronting a net decline in water supply — portending enormous challenges for food production and a heightening risk of conflict and instability.

The paper “provides a glimpse of what the future is going to be,” said Hrishikesh Chandanpurkar, an earth systems scientist working with Arizona State University and the lead author of the study. “We are already dipping from a trust fund. We don’t actually know how much the account has.”
The research, published Friday in the journal Science Advances, confirms not just that droughts and precipitation are growing more extreme but reports that drying regions are fast expanding. It also found that while parts of the planet are getting wetter, those areas are shrinking. The study, which excludes the ice sheets of Antarctica and Greenland, concludes not only that Earth is suffering a pandemic of “continental drying” in lower latitudes, but that it is the uninhibited pumping of groundwater by farmers, cities and corporations around the world that now accounts for 68% of the total loss of fresh water in those areas, which generally don’t have glaciers.
Groundwater is ubiquitous across the globe, but its quality and depth vary, as does its potential to be replenished by rainfall. Major groundwater basins — the deep and often high-quality aquifers — underlie roughly one-third of the planet, including roughly half of Africa, Europe and South America. But many of those aquifers took millions of years to form and might take thousands of years to refill. Instead, a significant portion of the water taken from underground flows off the land through rivers and on to the oceans.
The researchers were surprised to find that the loss of water on the continents has grown so dramatically that it has become one of the largest causes of global sea level rise. Moisture lost to evaporation and drought, plus runoff from pumped groundwater, now outpaces the melting of glaciers and the ice sheets of either Antarctica or Greenland as the largest contributor of water to the oceans.
The study examines 22 years of observational data from NASA’s Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment, or GRACE, satellites, which measure changes in the mass of the earth and have been applied to estimate its water content. The technique was groundbreaking two decades ago when the study’s co-author, Jay Famiglietti, who was then a professor at the University of California, at Irvine, used it to pinpoint where aquifers were in decline. Since then, he and others have published dozens of papers using GRACE data, but the question has always lingered: What does the groundwater loss mean in the context of all of the water available on the continents? So Famiglietti, now a professor at Arizona State University, set out to inventory all the land-based water contained in glaciers, rivers and aquifers and see what was changing. The answer: everything, and quickly.

Since 2002, the GRACE sensors have detected a rapid shift in water loss patterns around the planet. Around 2014, though, the pace of drying appears to have accelerated, the authors found, and is now growing by an area twice the size of California each year. “It’s like this sort of creeping disaster that has taken over the continents in ways that no one was really anticipating,” Famiglietti said. (Six other researchers also contributed to the study.) The parts of the world drying most acutely are becoming interconnected, forming what the study’s authors describe as “mega” regions spreading across the earth’s mid-latitudes. One of those regions covers almost the whole of Europe, the Middle East, North Africa and parts of Asia.
In the American Southwest and California, groundwater loss is a familiar story, but over the past two decades that hot spot has also spread dramatically. It now extends through Texas and up through the southern High Plains, where the Ogallala aquifer is depended on for agriculture, and it spreads south, stretching throughout Mexico and into Central America. These regions are connected not because they rely on the same water sources — in most cases they don’t — but because their populations will face the same perils of water stress: the most likely, a food crisis that could ultimately displace millions of people.
“This has to serve as a wake-up call,” said Aaron Salzberg, a former fellow at the Woodrow Wilson Center and the former director of the Water Institute at the University of North Carolina, who was not involved with the study.

Research has long established that people take more water from underground when climate-driven heat and drought are at their worst. For example, during droughts when California has enforced restrictions on delivery of surface water to its farmers — which the state regulates — the enormous agriculture enterprises that dominate the Central Valley have drilled deeper and pumped harder, depleting the aquifer — which the state regulates less precisely — even more.
For the most part, such withdrawals have remained invisible. Even with the GRACE data, scientists cannot measure the exact levels or know when an aquifer will be exhausted. But there is one foolproof sign that groundwater is disappearing: The earth above it collapses as the ground compresses like a drying sponge. The visible signs of such subsidence around the world appear to match what the GRACE data says. Mexico City is sinking as its groundwater aquifers are drained, as are large parts China, Indonesia, Spain and Iran, to name a few. A recent study by researchers at Virginia Tech in the journal Nature Cities found that 28 cities across the United States are sinking — New York, Houston and Denver, among them — threatening havoc for everything from building safety to transit. In the Central Valley, the ground surface is nearly 30 vertical feet lower than it was in the first part of the 20th century.
When so much water is pumped, it has to drain somewhere. Just like rivers and streams fed by rainfall, much of the used groundwater makes its way into the ocean. The study pinpoints a remarkable shift: Groundwater drilled by people, used for agriculture or urban supplies and then discarded into drainages now contributes more water to the oceans than melting from each of the world’s largest ice caps.
People aren’t just misusing groundwater, they are flooding their own coasts and cities in the process, Famiglietti warns. That means they are also imperiling some of the world’s most important food-producing lowlands in the Nile and Mekong deltas and cities from Shanghai to New York. Once in the oceans, of course, groundwater will never again be suitable for drinking and human use without expensive and energy-sucking treatment or through the natural cycle of evaporating and precipitating as rain. But even then, it may no longer fall where it is needed most. Groundwater “is an intergenerational resource that is being poorly managed, if managed at all,” the study states, “at tremendous and exceptionally undervalued cost to future generations.”
That such rapid and substantial overuse of groundwater is also causing coastal flooding underscores the compounding threat of rising temperatures and aridity. It means that water scarcity and some of the most disruptive effects of climate change are now inextricably intertwined. And here, the study’s authors implore leaders to find a policy solution: Improve water management and reduce groundwater use now, and the world has a tool to slow the rate of sea level rise. Fail to adjust the governance and use of groundwater around the world, and humanity risks surrendering parts of its coastal cities while pouring out finite reserves it will sorely need as the other effects of climate change take hold.

If the drying continues — and the researchers warn that it is now nearly impossible to reverse “on human timescales” — it heralds “potentially staggering” and cascading risks for global order. The majority of the earth’s population lives in the 101 countries that the study identified as losing fresh water, making up not just North America, Europe and North Africa but also much of Asia, the Middle East and South America. This suggests the middle band of Earth is becoming less habitable. It also correlates closely with the places that a separate body of climate research has already identified as a shrinking environmental niche that has suited civilization for the past 6,000 years. Combined, these findings all point to the likelihood of widespread famine, the migration of large numbers of people seeking a more stable environment and the carry-on impact of geopolitical disorder.
Peter Gleick, a climate scientist and a member of the National Academy of Sciences, lauded the new report for confirming trends that were once theoretical. The ramifications, he said, could be profoundly destabilizing. “The massive overpumping of groundwater,” Gleick said, “poses enormous risk to food production.” And food, he pointed out, is the foundation for stability. The water science center he co-founded, the Pacific Institute, has tracked more than 1,900 incidents in which water supplies were either the casualty of, a tool for or the cause of violence. In Syria, beginning in 2011, drought and groundwater depletion drove rural unrest that contributed to the civil war, which displaced millions of people. In Ghana, in 2017, protesters rioted as wells ran dry. And in Ukraine, whose wheat supports much of the world, water infrastructure has been a frequent target of Russian attacks.
“Water is being used as a strategic and political tool,” said Salzberg, who spent nearly two decades analyzing water security issues as the special director for water resources at the State Department. “We should expect to see that more often as the water supply crisis is exacerbated.”
India, for example, recently weaponized water against Pakistan. In April, following terrorist attacks in Kashmir, Prime Minister Narendra Modi suspended his country’s participation in the Indus Waters Treaty, a river-sharing agreement between the two nuclear powers that was negotiated in 1960. The Indus system flows northwest out of Tibet into India, before turning southward into Pakistan. Pakistan has severely depleted its groundwater reserves — the region is facing one of the world’s most urgent water emergencies according to the Science Advances paper. The Indus has only become more essential as a supply of fresh water for its 252 million people. Allowing that water to cross the border would be “prejudicial to India’s interests,” Modi said. In this case, he wasn’t attempting to recoup water supply for his country, Salzberg said, but was leveraging its scarcity to win a strategic advantage over his country’s principal rival.
What’s needed most is governance of water that recognizes it as a crucial resource that determines both sovereignty and progress, Salzberg added. Yet there is no international framework for water management, and only a handful of countries have national water policies of their own.
The United States has taken stabs at regulating its groundwater use, but in some cases those attempts appear to be failing. In 2014, California passed what seemed to many a revolutionary groundwater management act that required communities to assess their total water supply and budget its long-term use. But the act doesn’t take full effect until 2040, which has allowed many groundwater districts to continue to draw heavily from aquifers even as they complete their plans to conserve those resources. Chandanpurkar and Famiglietti’s research underscores the consequences for such a slow approach.
Arizona pioneered groundwater regulations in 1980, creating what it called active management areas where extraction would be limited and surface waters would be used to replenish aquifers. But it only chose to manage the water in metropolitan areas, leaving vast, unregulated swaths of the state where investors, farmers and industry have all pounced on the availability of free water for profit. In recent years, Saudi investors have pumped rural water to grow feed for cattle exported back to the Arabian Peninsula, and hedge funds are competing to pump and sell water to towns near Phoenix. Meanwhile, four out of the original five active management areas are failing to meet the state’s own targets.
“They like to say, ‘Oh, the management’s doing well,’” Famiglietti said, but looking out over the next century, the trends suggest the aquifers will continue to empty out. “No one talks about that. I don’t think it’s an exaggeration to say it’s an existential issue for cities like Phoenix.”
Both California and Arizona grow significant portions of America’s fruits and vegetables. Something has to give. “If you want to grow food in a place like California,” Famiglietti asked, “do you just bring in water? If we deplete that groundwater, I don’t think there’s enough water to really replace what we’re doing there.” The United States might not have much choice, he added, but to move California’s agriculture production somewhere far away and retire the land.
Chandanpurkar, Famiglietti and the report’s other authors suggest there are ready solutions to the problems they have identified, because unlike so many aspects of the climate crisis, the human decisions that lead to the overuse of water can be speedily corrected. Agriculture, which uses the vast majority of the world’s fresh water, can deploy well-tested technologies like drip irrigation, as Israel has, that sharply cut use by as much as 50%. When California farms reduced their take of Colorado River water in 2023 and 2024, the water levels in Lake Mead, the nation’s largest reservoir, jumped by 16 vertical feet as some 390 billion gallons were saved by 2025. Individuals can reduce water waste by changing simple routines: shortening showers or removing lawns. And cities can look to recycle more of the water they use, as San Diego has.
A national policy that establishes rules around water practices but also prioritizes the use of water resources for national security and a collective interest could counterbalance the forces of habit and special interests, Salzberg said. Every country needs such a policy, and if the United States were to lead, it might offer an advantage. But “the U.S. doesn’t have a national water strategy,” he said, referring to a disjointed patchwork of state and court oversight. “We don’t even have a national water institution. We haven’t thought as a country about how we would even protect our own water resources for our own national interests, and we’re a mess.”

(Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)Feeding South Dakota is the first of what could be multiple nonprofits asking the Legislature for help to recover from federal funding cuts.
Executive Director Lori Dykstra requested $3 million in one-time funds at the legislative Appropriations Committee meeting Wednesday in Pierre to offset 1.5 million pounds of food no longer being provided by the U.S. Department of Agriculture since March.
Feeding South Dakota partners to provide food to 265 smaller food pantries and food insecurity organizations throughout the state. “If we don’t have food, they don’t have food,” Dykstra said.
The nonprofit’s budget typically runs just over $10 million and is nearly entirely privately funded. The $3 million of state funding would help the organization purchase the lost 1.5 million pounds of food and purchase additional food to meet the expected increased need, Feeding South Dakota Vice President of Marketing Stacey Andernacht told South Dakota Searchlight after the meeting. The cost to purchase that much food fluctuates, rising to $2.7 million as of July 25.
South Dakota’s budget could face a $24.5 million revenue shortfall, legislators learn

Tea Republican Sen. Ernie Otten, who serves as co-chair of the budget committee, warned lawmakers of hard choices to “pick winners and losers” in the next legislative session. The committee learned of an up to $24.5 million shortfall in projected general fund revenue for this fiscal year, and Otten said because of federal cuts affecting state departments and nonprofits, “every agency and group will have their hands out.”
Sen. Taffy Howard, R-Rapid City, questioned ways that Feeding South Dakota could get churches and South Dakotans to contribute more, rather than relying on state or federal funding.
“You are a wonderful organization, but you’re one of hundreds, if not thousands, that want government funds to assist them in doing what they started out doing probably without government funds,” Howard said.
Dykstra told lawmakers the nonprofit “runs very lean” and that 93 cents of every dollar goes toward feeding people. Feeding South Dakota has been operating for 50 years, primarily privately funded, and this is the first time leaders have requested state general funds, Andernacht said.
Lawmakers won’t take up the request until the 2026 legislative session starts in January.
“We felt it was the right time to put in front of the state the dollars that they could partner with us on to help fill that gap,” Andernacht said. “They have plenty of time to consider that, ask questions and get more information from us.”
The cuts came from the rollback of federal aid by the Trump administration, particularly programs begun during the COVID-19 pandemic to help the U.S. Department of Agriculture support food distribution. Feeding South Dakota spoke to the legislative budget committee in May about the cuts.
The nonprofit reduced its programs by up to 35% to address the federal loss, Dykstra told lawmakers. Reduced programs include its mobile pantry, wellness pantry and senior box programs, Dykstra said. Feeding South Dakota partners with the state to deliver U.S. Department of Agriculture food insecurity programs, like the senior box program, in South Dakota. Andernacht said the nonprofit has not reduced food provided in the backpack program for school children. 
The group didn’t fill open positions and made cuts to technology to lessen the blow to food-insecure families.
“We did what we needed to Band-Aid the situation,” Dykstra added.
If the nonprofit doesn’t fill its gap in federal funding, she said, rural communities will be hit hardest, because they don’t have other resources like Sioux Falls and Rapid City do.
Sioux Falls Republican Sen. Larry Zikmund highlighted the amount of volunteerism Feeding South Dakota depends on to operate its programs, in addition to the funding.
“It’s very much needed,” Zikmund said, “and we need to look at seeing what we can do to help support them.”

Experts say Medicaid cuts will exacerbate rural communities’ access to mental health care. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)Across the nation, Medicaid is the single largest payer for mental health care, and in rural America, residents disproportionately rely on the public insurance program.
But Medicaid cuts in the massive tax and spending bill signed into law earlier this month will worsen mental health disparities in those communities, experts say, as patients lose coverage and rural health centers are unable to remain open amid a loss of funds.
“The context to begin with is, even with no Medicaid cuts, the access to mental health services in rural communities is spotty at best, just very spotty at best — and in many communities, there’s literally no care,” said Ron Manderscheid, former executive director of the National Association of County Behavioral Health and Developmental Disability Directors.
Cuts over the next 10 years could force low-income rural families to pay for mental health care out of pocket on top of driving farther for care, experts say. Many will simply forgo care for depression, bipolar disorder and other illnesses that need consistent treatment.
No one knows whether Trump’s $50B for rural health will be enough

“Not only do you have very few services available, but you don’t have the resources to pay for the services,” Manderscheid said. “That makes the problem even worse.”
Rural communities are already at higher risk of suicide, with rates almost doubling over the past two decades. Already, rural communities are grappling with a shortage in mental health professionals, making them more vulnerable to losses compared with more urban areas, experts say.
Paul Mackie, assistant director of the Center for Rural Behavioral Health at Minnesota State University, Mankato, studies rural mental health workforce shortages.
“If it [coverage] goes away, what would then be the person’s next option if they already don’t have the resources?” said Mackie, who grew up on a rural Michigan dairy farm. “You can have a rural psychologist or a rural clinical social worker working under a shingle, literally alone.”
Small rural hospitals often provide critical behavioral health care access, he said. One analysis found the cuts next year would leave 380 rural hospitals at risk of shutting down.
States such as Mackie’s Minnesota, which expanded Medicaid eligibility under the 2010 Affordable Care Act, would suffer significant slashes in federal matches as a result of President Donald Trump’s signature legislation. The law, which includes tax cuts that disproportionately benefit the wealthy, cuts the federal government’s 90% matching rate for enrollees covered under expansion to anywhere from 50% to 74%.
States will have to redetermine eligibility twice a year on millions enrolled under Medicaid expansion. Some Medicaid recipients also will have to prove work history. The new law creates work requirement exceptions for those with severe medical conditions — including mental disorders and substance use — but experts say proving those conditions may be convoluted. The exact qualifications and diagnoses for the exceptions haven’t been spelled out, according to a report by KFF, a health policy research organization.










Not only do you have very few services available, but you don't have the resources to pay for the services. That makes the problem even worse.


– Ron Manderscheid, former executive director of the National Association of County Behavioral Health and Developmental Disability Directors


“You can’t work when your mental illness is not treated,” said Dr. Heidi Alvey, an emergency and critical care medicine physician in Indiana. “It’s so counter to the reality of the situation.”
Alvey worked seven years at Baylor Scott & White Health’s hospital in Temple, Texas. As nearby rural critical access hospitals and other mental health centers shut down, the hospital became the only access point for people hours away, she said.
“People who just had absolutely no access to care were coming hours in to see us,” she said. Many had serious untreated mental health conditions, she said, and had to wait days or weeks in the emergency department until a care facility had an open bed.
She’s concerned that Medicaid cuts will only make those problems worse.
Jamie Freeny, director of the Center for School Behavioral Health at advocacy group Mental Health America of Greater Houston, worries for the rural families her center serves. The organization works with school districts across the state, including those in rural communities. Nearly 40% of the state’s more than 1,200 school districts are classified as rural.
She remembers one child whose family had to drive to another county for behavioral health. The family lost coverage during the Medicaid unwinding, as pandemic provisions for automatic re-reenrollment expired. The child stopped taking mental health medication and ended up dropping out of school.
“The child wasn’t getting the medicine that they needed, because their family couldn’t afford it,” Freeny said. “The catalyst for that was a lack of Medicaid. That’s just one family.
“Now, you’re multiplying that.”

The community health clinic serves patients from across the area’s rural farm communities and combines primary care with mental health care services, Bennett said.
“When our patients lose Medicaid, which we expect that they will, then we’ll have to continue to take them, and that will be quite a strain on the finances of that system,” Bennett said. The center could even close, he said.
“The folks who are having the most difficulty managing their lives — and that’s made worse by having depression or substance use disorder — are going to be the folks most likely to drop off,” said Bennett, a University of Washington mental health services researcher. “The impacts down the road are clearly going to be much worse for society as we have less people able to function.”
The psychiatric care landscape across Michigan’s rural western lower peninsula is already scarce, said Joseph “Chip” Johnston. He’s the executive director of the Centra Wellness Network, a publicly funded community mental health care provider for Manistee and Benzie counties. The network serves Medicaid and uninsured patients from high-poverty communities.
“I used to have psychiatric units close by as an adjunct to my service,” he said. “And they’ve all closed. So, now the closest [psychiatric bed] for a child, for example, is at least two hours away.”
Those facilities are also expensive. A one-night stay in an inpatient psychiatric facility can be anywhere from $1,000 to $1,500 a night, he said.

JB Pritzker, at the center of 2028 election speculation, asked North Carolina Democrats whether they were ready to fight back against “MAGA Republicans” on Saturday, July 26. (Photo: Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)Illinois Governor JB Pritzker spoke like a presidential candidate in waiting in his keynote address at North Carolina Democrats’ Unity Dinner fundraiser Saturday evening, outlining his vision for a post-Trump America.
“When we emerge from this, and we will emerge from this, our Democratic agenda must be bold and our idea fearless. We will have no time to waste: America needs us” Pritzker said. “We must deliver on an agenda centered on working families who truly make America great.”
In a 25-minute speech, Pritzker issued sharp condemnations of President Donald Trump and his cabinet and outlined his vision for how Democrats can regain voters’ trust on kitchen table issues. He also sketched out an agenda for the next Democratic administration that includes rebuilding social services, bringing down cost of living for working and middle class Americans, and developing a cohesive policy approach to artificial intelligence.
“Our democracy is on the line, and Americans are wondering, who is going to fight for them?” Pritzker asked. “North Carolina Democrats, I have a question for you: Are you ready to fight?”
Pritzker’s remarks followed speeches by former Governor Roy Cooper and state Supreme Court Associate Justice Anita Earls, at the center of the state party’s 2026 election hopes. Democratic Party officials and supporters also heard from North Carolina House Democratic Leader Robert Reives and Senate Democratic Leader Syndey Batch.
‘I’ve been to this movie before’
Pritzker, a Duke University graduate who served as legislative aide to Democratic Senator Terry Sanford, took on a pugilistic demeanor as he skewered Trump and denounced his administration in his remarks.
“It’s wrong to snatch a person off the streets of America and ship them to a foreign gulag with no chance to defend themselves in a court of law,” Pritzker said. “They’re literally arresting U.S. citizens in broad daylight, and then green card holders, people who have never committed any crime in their lives and who dream someday of becoming American citizens — they’re being swept up and deported. So are babies and children and teenagers.”
Launching into an explanation of habeas corpus, the legal right to due process of law for those detained, Pritzker quoted Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, Alexander Hamilton, underscoring their commitment to that principle and their abhorrence for tyrants who would violate it.
“Franklin, Jefferson, Hamilton — they were talking about Donald Trump,” Pritzker said. “Standing for the idea that the government doesn’t have the right to kidnap you without due process is arguably the most effective campaign message in history.”
In charting a course for new Democratic leadership, Pritzker evoked his own experience taking over the state former Governor Bruce Rauner, a Republican — an analogy that would seem to pitch Pritzker as the antidote to the Trump era.

“There’s a way out of this mess — I know, because I’ve been to this movie before when I was elected governor in 2018 to replace a very destructive Republican chief executive. He defunded the government, slashed health care for the poor and for people with disabilities, racked up massive deficits, and plunged our state’s finances to worst in the nation,” he said. “Does that sound familiar? That’s what happens when you elected a chief executive who’s hell-bent on shaking things up without any idea how to fix what he’s broken.”
Pritzker, the billionaire scion of the family that owns the Hyatt Hotels Corporation, has served as Illinois governor since 2019. While he announced in June he would seek a third term in 2026, his cross-country speaking engagements have fueled expectations that he will seek the presidency in 2028.
Besides North Carolina, Pritzker headlined a New Hampshire Democratic Party fundraiser in April and gatherings of Wisconsin, Virginia, and Iowa Democrats in 2024. He was also a high-profile surrogate for Vice President Kamala Harris’s 2024 campaign, including appearance in Arizona and Nevada.
He urged Democrats to “say what we mean and mean what we say” in his speech Saturday, while jettisoning “poll-tested language and decades of stale decorum.” At times, his blunt condemnations of Trump and his associates were reminiscent of the president’s own barbs.
“Autistic kids don’t deserve to be stigmatized and targeted by a weird nepo baby who once stashed a dead bear in the back seat of his car,” Pritzker said. “Our great soldiers don’t deserve to be told by a washed-up FOX TV commentator who drank too much and committed sexual assault before being appointed Defense Secretary that they can’t serve this country simply because they’re Black, or gay, or a woman.”
He also took aim at Homeland Security Secretary Kristie Noem, saying she “likes to play dress-up as ICE Barbie,” and Attorney General Pam Bondi “who protects the President from scrutiny about his close friendship with a pedophile,” referencing Jeffrey Epstein.
“No more self-dealing by the President of the United States. No more gifts from foreign nations. No more unvetted Russian assets in key government positions,” Pritzker said. “It’s disgusting and it’s got to change. If it sounds like I’m becoming contemptuous of MAGA Republicans, it’s because I am contemptuous of MAGA Republicans.”
‘You didn’t give up the fight’
While Pritzker’s speech centered heavily on national politics, North Carolina leaders largely focused their remarks on judicial elections, storm recovery, and veto overrides.
Delivering a video address in absentia — away attending the National Governors Association conference in Colorado — Governor Josh Stein praised the state party for its successes in 2024, including in the elections for Governor, Lieutenant Governor, Attorney General, State Superintendent, and Secretary of State. And he thanked supporters for backing Supreme Court Justice Allison Riggs amid an “outrageous Republican attempt to steal her seat.”
He condemned the Trump administration for causing “unprecedented chaos” and “an economic roller coaster” while eroding due process and freedom of speech. And he criticized Republicans in the General Assembly for putting forward bills that “make our state less safe and less strong.” So far, Stein has issued 14 vetoes, none of which have been overridden, though state Republicans aim to do so in the coming week.

Rep. Dante Pittman (D-Wilson), the only House Democrat to vote in favor of a sweeping anti-trans bill the Governor blocked, appeared to signal he would stand with Stein’s veto of it at the dinner. Without Democratic assistance, Republicans cannot override Stein’s veto after losing their supermajority in the lower chamber of the General Assembly in the 2024 election.
“When I was sitting at my chair and I saw our governor come up on the screen, my resolve was hardened,” Pittman said before delivering the Salute to the Flag of North Carolina. “When it comes to the veto overrides, we’ve got your back.”
Cooper, Stein’s predecessor, also condemned Republicans in the state legislature, though most of his speech centered on dysfunction in Washington as he alluded to his upcoming Senate bid. “Here in Raleigh, the Republican legislature has left town,” he said. “No budget, no badly needed funding for healthcare, no teacher pay raise. Just passing bills to increase your electric bill and stoking the culture war fires. It’s not right.”
Reives, the House Democratic Leader who represents Chatham County, urged attendees to accept the nature of a big tent party and tolerate disagreements with one another.
“There are going to be people that you don’t like in this party. There are going to be some people running for office that you’re not that crazy about,” Reives said. “I got a guy running in District 54 in Chatham County, I don’t know if I agree with him all the time. But you know what I do know? I need him so we can get our state back.”
  Associate Justice Anita Earls said she would never forget the attempts to overturn the results of the 2024 Supreme Court race. (Photo: Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)
Gearing up for her the Supreme Court race in 2026, Earls said she would never forget that four of her Republican colleagues on the bench ruled in favor of Judge Jefferson Griffin’s effort to throw out overseas and military ballots that did not include voter ID “even though those voters fully complied with the law as it existed at the time they voted.”
“I also will never forget that Justice Riggs and the North Carolina Democratic Party stood up for the voting rights of all North Carolinians when they argued that every vote should count,” Earls said. “We are the party willing to win fair and square. You stood up for our rights. You didn’t give up the fight.”
Batch, the Senate Democratic Leader, called on audience members to continue fighting and organizing and not give up hope. She attacked Republicans for shifting funds from public education to private schools, rolling back reproductive rights, and putting Medicaid expansion at risk while cutting taxes for the wealthiest people in the state.
“There has never been a time in the history of this country that it has been safer and easier to do the right thing,” Batch said. “Nobody’s unleashing fire hoses at voter drives. Nobody’s hanging strange fruit from trees because we marched. The steepest price we’ll pay is sore calves from knocking doors, a raspy voice from speaking the truth, or a bruised ego because someone told you to sit down.”
‘Fired up and ready to go’
After the speeches, Democrats at the dinner said they felt optimistic and invigorated ahead of the next wave of electoral battles in the state.
“They were terrific, I’d like to say fired up and ready to go,” said Brenda Pollard, president of Durham County Democratic Women. “They were right on point, and that’s where we need to be, and we’re going to fight.”
Pollard said she was especially pleased with Cooper’s remark hinting at his upcoming Senate announcement. “He’s still standing, so I mean, that was music to my ears. I’m ready and the Governor will make a wonderful U.S. Senator,” she said.
Pritzker’s remarks also drew praise from those in attendance, including state party leadership. Clayton said she was pleased with “what she saw tonight from every person up on that stage” in terms of a willingness to be direct with voters and those in power. She said she would hope to see those traits in future presidential candidates.
“I’d like to see somebody who’s willing to stand up there and go toe-to-toe with a Republican and not afraid to talk to them exactly how they talk to us right now,” Clayton said. “You’re willing to get down in the nitty-gritty, but you’re also willing to speak truth to power.”
Of his blunt style, Batch said “people are exhausted with appearing that Democrats roll over,” something she’s tried to address in her own interactions with Republicans. “I’m showing up like he does every single day with the fight. I’m not going to start a fight, but I sure as hell won’t walk away from one.”
“I am so forever grateful for the amount of energy that you have all given to us,” Clayton said, closing out the dinner. “And I want to take this energy that you have now and give it back to your neighbors, your friends, your community members. Talk to folks, knock on doors with us, make the calls, tell you story — help us write the next chapter of North Carolina.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/P7262984-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-27 08:56:22.436813

Almost half of the 63 million Americans who care for a family member say they struggle financially to do so. (Photo by Bruce Bennett/Getty Images)More than 63 million Americans are caregivers for a family member with complex medical needs, a 20 million increase over the past decade, according to a new report.
But state policies, workplaces and the American health system haven’t kept up with this surge in family caregiving responsibilities, said Dr. Myechia Minter-Jordan, a physician and the CEO of the AARP, which released the report with the National Alliance for Caregiving, a nonprofit policy and research organization.
“Nearly half of caregivers say they face major financial consequences, draining savings, falling into debt or struggling to afford basic needs like food and housing,” Minter-Jordan told reporters on a call this week.
One of the biggest reasons for the surge in family caregivers is that Americans are living longer, yet they’re not necessarily healthier. There’s a 12-year gap between the average number of years that Americans live and the number of years they’re healthy.
‘A purpose in this world’: Older adults fear elimination of program that helps them find work

The caregiving role typically involves helping a family member with daily tasks like bathing, dressing and eating. But more than half of caregivers also perform more complex medical tasks, such as managing catheters or administering injections, the report found.
A growing number of caregivers are so-called “sandwich caregivers” — parents caring for their children as well as for an adult family member, such as an aging parent. About 17 million people are sandwich caregivers, compared with 11 million a decade ago. And most caregivers are also working a job.
And while the bulk of caregiving still falls on women, 40% of American caregivers are men.
Some states have heeded the growing calls for action.
Earlier this year, Maine lawmakers created a state program to provide respite care, which includes services such as adult day care that give family caregivers a temporary break.
Also this year, Tennessee extended its pilot program that provides respite care for Alzheimer’s and dementia patients, and also passed a bipartisan bill that directs the state Medicaid program to develop guidelines to allow family caregivers to be paid for their work.
Last year, Nebraska passed a tax credit for family caregivers; Oklahoma passed a similar law the year before. And while the United States is one of few countries that doesn’t mandate paid family leave at the federal level, 13 states and the District of Columbia have established their own paid family leave rules.
Meanwhile, the historic cuts to Medicaid enacted as part of the GOP’s Big, Beautiful Bill Act will shift health costs to states, leaving experts worried that family caregivers could lose Medicaid-funded services they rely on.

BESSEMER — For Ron Morgan, the signs told the tale. He was among the dozens of residents who spilled into the Birmingham suburb’s city hall chambers who were met by what they viewed as propaganda: Literal signs, the residents felt, that city officials may not have an open mind about voting against a development project facing near universal public opposition.
Flanking the chamber doors and on both sides of the council dais were city-printed posters with bold, all-capital letters at their tops: “LET’S TALK FACTS.”
Lower down on the posters was information residents said they felt was misleading and aimed at swaying public opinion on an issue they’ve studied closely: the impacts of a 4.5 million square foot data center proposed in their largely rural community.

“Focus on Benefits,” one of the posters read, “Not Misinformation.”
At the bottom of the posters, next to an emblem of city hall itself, another all-caps slogan: “POWERED BY KNOWLEDGE, NOT FEAR.”
“They’ve already made their mind up,” Morgan, an Army veteran, said. “No surprise there.”

So far, officials in the city of 25,000 have shown little interest in publicly digging into the details of what could be one of the largest development projects in state history—one that would require the clear-cutting of more than 100 acres of land, threaten endangered species and lead to large increases in water and electricity usage.
Instead, public officials, many bound by non-disclosure agreements with the developer, have relied on the assertions of the company proposing the project—a company that has so far refused to answer media questions about the impact of their plans on the community and the environment.
Not long after the July 15 City Council meeting began, Brad Kaaber, a representative of the developer, Logistic Land Investments LLC, told City Council members that residents’ near-universal opposition wasn’t based on facts.

“You’re going to hear things that simply are not true,” Kaaber told council members. “And I appreciate all the people who took time out of their day to come to a meeting like this, but all I want to do is speak to the facts. You’re going to hear a lot of things that simply are not facts.”
Residents who’d packed into the relatively small council chambers balked, audibly reacting to Kaaber’s comments.
Earlier, when Martin Evans, the developer’s attorney, exceeded the two-minute time limit imposed by the council on comments, several members of the audience shouted in protest. Proponents of the development, they said, should be bound by the same time constraint placed on opponents. Council President Donna Thigpen quickly squelched the residents’ complaints: “If you can’t be quiet, we’ll clear the room,” she said.
As Kaaber continued speaking, JC Matthews, director of economic development for the Birmingham Business Alliance, reacted to the groans of community members.
“Y’all just don’t care about the facts,” he said from the side of the room. Residents seated nearby, dressed in red to show their opposition to the data center’s construction, looked shocked.
“That’s exactly what we’re interested in,” one resident said. “The facts.”
To find “the facts,” Inside Climate News interviewed the developer’s representative, public officials and residents who live near the proposed development site on key topics and claims. Among the findings:
Water usage
Because of the need to cool the computer servers and other electronics in the proposed data center, the facility—consisting of 18 buildings, each the size of a Walmart Supercenter—could consume large amounts of water. The specific amount of water used by a data center campus depends primarily on its size and on its specific method of cooling.
Representatives of the developer behind the Bessemer project have said they’re unsure which method of cooling will ultimately be used by the proposed data center campus because an end user has not yet been secured.
At a June meeting, Kaaber told planning and zoning commissioners that a large tech firm, likely a Fortune 10 company, would eventually sign on as the facility’s primary customer—Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook among the chief possibilities.
  Residents opposed to the data center wore red to show their solidarity. (Lee Hedgepeth/Inside Climate News)
Only then, with a final user in place, would there be firm estimates of water usage.
Still, publicly available documents provide an insight into how much water the project could ultimately consume.
Warrior River Water Authority, a local utility, said in a letter obtained by Inside Climate News that the developer requested a supply of 2 million gallons per day, an amount the utility said it would not be able to provide without “significant upgrades” to the water distribution system.
Water usage of 2 million gallons per day would likely place the facility among the largest consumers of water in the region with the exception of power plants, the utility document said, straining its capacity. Residents have said they already consider the water utility unreliable.
Publicly available information suggests that the Warrior River Water Authority’s supply capacity is around 6 million gallons per day. Usage of 2 million gallons per day, then, would amount to a third of the utility’s water supply if capacity is not increased to accommodate the facility.
The 2 million gallons of water a day requested by the developer is equivalent to the typical usage of around 6,700 households, about two-thirds of Bessemer’s population, based on the water utility’s consumption estimates.
Charles Miller, policy director for the Alabama Rivers Alliance, told council members at the July 15 meeting to be wary of the developers’ claims that council members should leave environmental regulation to other entities, like the Alabama Department of Environmental Management or the federal Environmental Protection Agency.
“In Alabama, we have no water quantity laws, so no state body or board will be examining whether the volume of water this project requires is reasonable or will harm neighboring communities,” Miller said.
“Water is a finite resource,” Lauren Adele, a citizen concerned about rising water utility rates, told council members. “What do we do as the residents of Bessemer, Jefferson County, Birmingham, the state of Alabama, when our showers don’t work, when we have no water pressure, when we can’t wash our dishes, when we can’t cook our food? We have no way to generate more water than what God sends us from the sky.”
Public water usage estimates also don’t account for the additional water Alabama Power will need to cool its power plants as they provide megawatts of new power the proposed data center in Bessemer will need to operate.

Power consumption

In addition to significant water usage, the data center in Bessemer will consume an enormous amount of electricity, with servers running around the clock.
A document produced by Evans & Evans, the law firm representing the developer, suggests that at total buildout, the proposed data center campus would consume around 1,200 megawatts of energy. That’s more than 90 times the amount of energy used by all residences in Bessemer and more than 10 times the amount of energy used by all residences in Birmingham annually. An increase of that magnitude would amount to a 10 percent rise in Alabama Power’s total electricity demand statewide.
Increased demand for energy, or at least the potential for it, is already driving Alabama Power’s desire to double down on fossil fuel investments. The company, an effective monopoly, has asked the state’s Public Service Commission to approve its purchase of a gas-powered power plant in recent days, increasing the state’s reliance on fossil fuel energy, which globally accounts for over 75 percent of greenhouse gas emissions.
Many experts also say that increased demand from data centers across the country will drive prices up for everyone, including residential customers. Alabamians already pay some of the highest energy bills in the country, according to various analyses of electricity rates nationwide.
Ron Morgan expressed his concern to council members that the data center’s power usage will be so large that it will have to take electricity from multiple power plants.
“Just because they’re on a transmission line doesn’t mean that Alabama Power can flip a switch and provide an additional 1,200 megawatts of power,” he said.

Cancer risks

The city’s signs at July’s council meeting made specific claims around the risk of cancer caused by data centers.
“MYTH: ‘Data Centers Cause Cancer’ FACT: There is NO scientific proof linking data centers to cancer,” the sign said. “While data centers do use diesel backup generators, these are rarely used and must meet EPA emission standards. Most centers are also moving toward clean energy and battery backups.”
No one involved in the proposed development has suggested that either renewable energy or battery backups will be used at the data center, if built. Instead, Kaaber confirmed at the meeting that diesel generators will be the backup source of energy at the site. Kaaber said that each generator in the “generator yards” would be tested three hours each month.
Estimates based on other hyperscale data centers suggest that the proposed Bessemer data center campus would need between 300 and 500 diesel generators to provide a reliable backup source of electricity for the facility. Amazon representatives in Minnesota, for example, asked regulators to approve the operation of 250 diesel generators to provide back power for a facility around half the size of that proposed in Bessemer. Regulators rejected the plan. Even assuming uninterrupted power supply, the testing of the generators for three hours per day would produce a significant amount of emission, contributing to air pollution.
Exposure to diesel exhaust can lead to “serious health conditions,” according to the EPA. Diesel fumes are “likely to be carcinogenic to humans,” according to the federal agency.
The International Agency for Research on Cancer also labels diesel exhaust as “carcinogenic to humans.”
  Becky Morgan explains her concerns regarding air pollution caused by the data center’s operation. (Lee Hedgepeth/Inside Climate News)
Becky Morgan, who already suffers from breathing issues, told council members about her concerns around air pollution caused by diesel generators. She said the council’s posters claiming data centers don’t cause cancer are inaccurate. She said that even if the facility’s power supply is stable, the particulate matter from testing the generators will travel great distances. EPA regulates such emissions, she said, precisely because they may cause cancer.
“We need to know how many generators are going to be backing up the 1,200 megawatts, because that’s a huge factor,” she said. “Pollution will travel. It’s going to come in our backyards.”

Endangered species

Kaaber, the representative for the developer, has told residents in Bessemer that there will be no notable environmental impact from the proposed data center site.
Multiple experts interviewed by Inside Climate News have said the project will have significant, potentially irreversible impacts, including putting an already imperilled, newly identified species of fish—the Birmingham darter—at risk of extinction.

“This would nuke this creek,” Thomas Near, a Yale biologist, said of the data center project.
Near said that based on what he’s learned, its construction and use would be devastating for the Birmingham darter and for other aquatic wildlife in the area.
These “dramatic” negative impacts, he said, could include increased river temperature for a fish attuned to inhabit cool, spring-fed streams. Significant water runoff and water extraction for cooling purposes would also fundamentally alter the ecosystem. And Near is concerned about how the data center development might affect the delicate limestone substrate habitat unique to the Birmingham darter.
The Center for Biological Diversity, a national environmental nonprofit, has also said they’re considering legal action against the city under the Endangered Species Act related to the project’s potential impacts on the watercress darter, another fish already listed as endangered under federal law.
In his comments on environmental impacts, Kaaber has referenced multiple environmental assessments he said were conducted by the developer but has so far declined a request from Inside Climate News for those assessments. Kaaber would not answer questions about the project following the July meeting.
Zoning changes
In a June zoning and planning commission meeting, representatives of the developer suggested that hyperscale data centers are commonly zoned as “light industrial,” the zoning classification they’ve advocated for in the context of the current proposal.
Under Bessemer’s zoning regulations, light industrial uses include bus terminals, gas stations with garages and large billboards. Expressly forbidden from light industrial classification are facilities “which are especially detrimental to property or to the health and safety beyond the district by reason of the emission of odor, dust, gas, fumes, smoke, noise, vibration or waste material.”
The proposed data center site is currently zoned for agricultural use, but city officials are concurrently considering changing the site’s zoning to light industrial to facilitate the construction of the new development.
“This is not light industrial,” Becky Morgan told zoning commission members. The facility’s high power consumption, security needs and sheer footprint should require its zoning in heavy industrial or another, newly created zoning category, she argued.
An Inside Climate News analysis of zoning ordinances around the country concluded that hyperscale data centers are rarely zoned “light industrial.” Municipalities more commonly create a new zoning category specific to data centers, which have unique power and water usage needs when compared to many other commercial facilities.
Many cities also require the placement of such facilities in areas zoned for heavy industrial use. For example, the only other data center project backed by Logistic Land Investment—a proposed data center in Texas—has been zoned heavy industrial.

Tax implications

Both the residents and the developer have made various claims around the tax implications of the project. Representatives of the developer have suggested that the project will be a financial boon for the city while residents have said they’re skeptical of the claims.
Jimmie Stephens, president of the Jefferson County Commission, told council members at the meeting that they would likely end up abating more tax revenue than they would actually collect.
“This isn’t about the environment,” Stephens said. “This is about the money. This is about the tax revenue that has been laid before the city of Bessemer that you’re depending on, you’re looking forward to but that, in all likelihood, they’re going to ask you to abate.”
Stephens, who is opposed to the project, said that if any abatements go before the Jefferson County Commission, he would vote against them.
He may not have the chance. Alabama law contains explicit tax carve outs for capital projects, including a specific, 30-year tax abatement meant to attract large data centers. If approved by Bessemer officials, a tax abatement under the economic development law could amount to a tax cut of more than $500 million. It’s unlikely such an abatement would even need to go before the county commission.
Rep. Leigh Hulsey, a member of the Alabama House who represents residents in the area, said she’s also skeptical of claims around tax revenues. She said she’s spoken to individuals familiar with a data center project in Huntsville who confirmed that actual tax revenues are not meeting expectations.
“They’re not bringing the revenue that the city thought they would, and that’s the truth,” Hulsey said. “That’s directly from those individuals there in Huntsville. It’s the same thing that Commissioner Stevens was talking about. There are promises. … It’s not going to bring all the money you think it’s going to bring.”

Homicides and several other serious offenses, including gun assaults and carjackings, dropped during the first half of 2025 across 42 U.S. cities, continuing a downward trend that began in 2022, according to a new crime trends report released Thursday by the nonpartisan think tank Council on Criminal Justice.
Homicides fell 17% in the first half of 2025, compared with the same period in 2024, among the 30 cities that reported homicide data, according to the report.
During that same period, five cities saw increases in homicide — ranging from 6% in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to 39% in Little Rock, Arkansas.
While the report’s authors say the continued drop in violent crime — especially homicides — is encouraging, they note that much of the decline stems from a few major cities with historically high rates, such as Baltimore and St. Louis.
More than half of the cities studied have higher homicide rates than before the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, though, the analysis found that there were 14% fewer homicides during the first half of 2025 compared to the same period in 2019.
The authors say more research is needed before crediting any specific policy or practice for the continued drop in violent crime.
The group’s findings come as President Donald Trump continues to amplify concerns about crime, at times citing misleading statistics and narratives.
In a Truth Social post earlier this week, Trump claimed that cashless bail — a practice that allows people charged with a crime to be released pretrial without paying money, unless a judge deems them a threat to public safety — were fueling a national crime surge and endangering law enforcement.
He wrote: “Crime in American Cities started to significantly rise when they went to CASHLESS BAIL. The WORST criminals are flooding our streets and endangering even our great law enforcement officers. It is a complete disaster, and must be ended, IMMEDIATELY!”
Some research suggests that setting money bail isn’t effective in ensuring court appearances or improving public safety. Opponents of ending cash bail often raise concerns that released suspects might commit new, potentially more serious crimes. While that is possible in individual cases, studies show that eliminating cash bail does not lead to a widespread increase in crime.
The Truth Social post also marked a sharp shift from Trump’s remarks during a June roundtable with the Fraternal Order of Police, where he claimed the national murder rate had “plummeted by 28%” since he took office — a figure that overstates the decline and overlooks the fact that murder rates began falling well before he returned to office.
According to data consulting firm AH Datalytics, which manages the Real-Time Crime Index — a free tool that collects crime data from more than 400 law enforcement agencies nationwide — the number of homicides between January and May 2025 was 20.3% lower than the same period in 2024.
Similarly, data released in May by the Major Cities Chiefs Association showed that homicides fell roughly 20% in the first quarter of 2025 compared with the first three months of the prior year. The group’s data is based on a survey of 68 major metropolitan police departments nationwide.
Researchers at the Council on Criminal Justice note in their report that it’s difficult to pinpoint a single reason for the drop in homicides, but they note that fewer people appear to be exposed to high-risk situations, such as robberies.
Most major crimes fell in the first half of 2025 compared with the same period last year, according to the council’s report.
Motor vehicle thefts dropped by 25%, while reported gun assaults fell 21%. Robberies, residential and non-residential burglaries, shoplifting, and aggravated and sexual assaults also saw double-digit declines
Drug offenses held steady, while domestic violence reports rose slightly — by about 3%. Carjackings declined 24% and larcenies were down 5%.
Compared with the first half of 2019, before the pandemic and nationwide reckoning over racial justice and policing, overall homicides are down 14%, robberies by 30%, and sexual assaults by 28%.
Still, more than 60% of the cities in the council’s study sample report homicide rates that remain above 2019 levels.
Motor vehicle theft remains the only crime tracked in the report that is still elevated compared to pre-pandemic levels — up 25% since 2019 — although it has declined sharply since 2023.
The council also released another analysis on the lethality of violent crime, showing that while violent incidents have decreased, the share of violence that ends in death has increased significantly. In 1994, there were 2 homicides per 1,000 assaults and about 16 per 1,000 robberies. By 2020, those figures rose to 7.2 and 55.8, respectively.

(Photo: Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)In his first public event after news of his impending Senate campaign broke, former Governor Roy Cooper asked everyone in the audience planning to run for office in 2026 to please stand for a round of applause.
Glancing at his feet with a grin, he quipped, “Hey — I’m not sitting down, am I?”
Previewing his run for Senate in a speech before North Carolina Democratic Party leaders and supporters Saturday night, days ahead of an expected campaign announcement, Cooper was met with a standing ovation and cheers of “Run Roy, run!”
“Look at what’s happening in Washington — they are running up our debt, they are disrespecting our veterans, they’re cutting help for the hungry, and they’re ripping away with health care for millions of people,” Cooper said. “All to give tax breaks to the millionaires and the billionaires, and it’s not right.”
Cooper is expected to declare his candidacy for the Senate seat being vacated by Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) next week, a development first reported by Axios on Wednesday. He would be vying to become the state’s first Democratic senator in more than a decade, with the party’s last Senate victory coming in 2008 when President Barack Obama won the state.
Tallying up his resume at the party’s annual Unity Dinner, Cooper expressed pride in passing Medicaid expansion and expanding coverage to more than 675,000 people, raising pay for public school teachers, eliminating billions in medical debt for North Carolinians, and taking a stand against a 12-week abortion ban that Republicans ultimately passed over his veto.
“Right now, we’re living in a time in this country, I think, that is as fragile as I can remember,” Cooper said. But this beautiful experiment we call democracy — it only works when we work for it, which means that everybody needs to stay engaged and find a way to do something. We cannot let our progress slip away.”
The popular two-term governor is expected to compete in the general election against Republican National Committee chair Michael Whatley, who is also anticipated to declare as a candidate in the days to come, as first reported by POLITICO Thursday. This follows Tillis’s announcement that he would not seek reelection after voting against Trump’s “big, beautiful bill,” citing cuts to Medicaid.
Cooper is poised to be a formidable candidate for Senate, after departing office at the end of 2024 with broad popularity. A March 6 survey of 662 voters by Public Policy Polling found that 47% of held a favorable view of the former governor, while 42% held an unfavorable view — a net favorability rating 28 points better than that of Tillis, who the poll found Cooper leading in a hypothetical match-up 47% to 43%. Pollsters have yet to publish surveys of a prospective Cooper-Whatley matchup.


On Saturday night, Cooper followed state Supreme Court Justice Anita Earls, also running in 2026, and preceded Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, who is widely expected to seek the presidency in 2028. His fellow Democrats ranged from similarly coy about his plans to openly delighted at his imminent entry into the race.
Among the most upfront was Earls, who introduced him as “Governor and we hope soon-to-be Senator Roy Cooper” to rousing cheers.
  Among those praising former Governor Roy Cooper at Saturday’s dinner were state party chair Anderson Clayton and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker. “We can’t wait to support you in the next stage of your career,” said Pritzker. (Photo: Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)
“He knows this state and how to get things done in difficult times,” she said. “His passion for the well-being of every North Carolina is evident in all of his accomplishments, most recently persevering in the quest to extend Medicaid, resulting in healthcare coverage now for more than 650,000 additional people.”
“The top of the ticket matters tremendously to my race, and you can tell from the enthusiasm in this room that he is someone that the party across North Carolina would be thrilled to have as our candidate,” Earls told reporters after the speeches.
Pritzker, the keynote speaker, said serving alongside Cooper as a governor during the first Trump administration gave him a “true master class in the humility and integrity that marks the best of public service.”
“Roy, I know I speak for Democratic governors across the country when I say: we can’t wait to support you in the next stage of your career delivering for the people of North Carolina,” Pritzker said, applauding the former governor.
“I’m excited. North Carolina Democrats are ready to put a Democrat in the Senate office next year, making sure that we’re representing everybody in North Carolina,” state party chair Anderson Clayton said after the dinner. “I think tonight, Governor Cooper alluded to the fact that he’s excited to be able to put somebody in that same office and do the same thing.”
The enthusiasm reflects a party that had all but lined up to support Cooper before the candidate even made his plans public. Attorney General Jeff Jackson, who gave remarks in private to a VIP Reception preceding the dinner, made headlines earlier this month when he endorsed Cooper for Senate before the former governor entered the race. Former U.S. Rep. Wiley Nickel, the first Democratic entrant in the Senate race, is expected to drop out and run for Wake County District Attorney with Cooper’s announcement.
In some of his most extensive remarks in his seven months out of office, Cooper returned the praise, singling out Pritzker, Earls, and his successor in office. “I’m sleeping really well at night knowing we have Governor Josh Stein leading the charge for our state,” he said.
“Despite all the turmoil and cruelty — because of people of people like you here tonight, I still believe that our best days are ahead of us,” Cooper said.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/P7262863-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-27 07:56:17.338090

The challenge is great. The solutions are complex. The cost is significant. I do not deny the seriousness of the issues we all face, but we are humans.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Garry Schaedel: Despite all the world’s challenges, we are all human.","This commentary is by Garry Schaedel, of Burlington. Previously, he was the health promotion and disease prevention division director for the Vermont Department of Health. He is now retired from state service.


It was a conversation I have heard many times. Too many unhoused people, too many people suffering from substance use disorder, too many criminals in Burlington — implying no one is doing anything to fix it, and our community is rotting away. 
I get it. The challenge is great. The solutions are complex. The cost is significant. I do not deny the seriousness of the issues we all face.
But we are humans.
A while back, I drove to the downtown City Market in Burlington to shop for groceries. When I arrived, I realized I left my wallet home. Darn it! I also had to pick up a picture I had redone at the LeZot Camera store on Main Street, just a few blocks away. Luckily, I had already paid for it.
I walked down Church Street and took a left onto Main Street, where I picked up my picture. I went down Main Street toward City Market, in the opposite direction that I had walked to LeZot Camera. A few doors down I came upon a young man standing and looking at me as I walked toward him. I was prepared for his ask. I assumed he was unhoused and was looking for money.
As I approached him, I said, “I am sorry, I don’t have any money. I left my wallet at home.” He stared at me as I briefly waited for a response. Then he said, “Will you give me a hug?” He was so sincere, and it was not what I expected. I immediately said yes. 
He was younger and shorter than me. I felt like I was hugging an adult son, if I had one. I hugged him gently, but he pulled us together a bit tighter. It was real. He needed a person to give him a hug. We all have felt this way.
We held each other until he let go of me. Still inches away, we were looking right at each other.  I spontaneously patted his cheek, as I would do with anyone I love. A woman sitting on a step next to us yelled, “Wow, he does not let me pat his cheek!”
We looked at each other for a bit more. I said I was sorry I had nothing else I could offer him. I patted his arm. I said, “Hang in there buddy. I will be thinking of you!” — which I do so often when I am downtown. Before I walked away, he replied, “Thank you.”
We are all human.

Consumers are facing a Sept. 30 deadline to be eligible for tax credits for EVs, followed by a Dec. 31 deadline when credits vanish for rooftop solar, air source heat pumps and certain water heaters.
These are major purchases and customers will likely want to consider multiple options before making a selection, but there isn’t much time for research. To help, I’ve convened some experts to help you make good decisions.
First, how we got here: President Donald Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act earlier this month, which repealed tax credits that had been created or expanded under the Inflation Reduction Act.
Since the EV credits expire first, we’ll start there. Until Sept. 30, the government has a $7,500 credit for qualifying new EVs and plug-in hybrids, and a $4,000 credit for qualifying used EVs. There is also a $7,500 credit under a different part of the law that applies to leased EVs.
Should you buy immediately? I asked Alex Knizek, associate director of auto test development at the Consumer Reports Auto Test Center.
“If you’ve already done your research and found a safe, reliable EV or [plug-in hybrid] that fits your needs and budget, you should make that purchase sooner rather than later,” he said. “But don’t panic-buy a car in a rush just for the sake of getting the tax credit.”
Knizek said there is a danger that a quick decision will leave you stuck with a vehicle that doesn’t fit your needs. Also, a quick buying process may lead you to get a vehicle that is unreliable and will need expensive repairs.
Especially if you’re a first-time EV buyer, there are some details you need to figure out before you start taking test drives. For example, you should determine your charging setup and get a sense of whether there will be extra costs to upgrade your home’s wiring.
The larger point is that rushed decisions are often bad decisions.
But if you feel ready to buy, there are many resources available to identify which vehicles have the best promotions and the inventory levels in your area. Websites such as KBB.com and Edmunds.com can provide a big-picture view.
The federal government lists which new vehicles and used vehicles qualify for credits when a customer is buying, as opposed to leasing.
For leases, dealers and their financing affiliates can get a $7,500 credit for EVs that they deliver to customers, with few restrictions. But there is no master list for prices and availability. I’ve found that it’s helpful to look online for lists of the best lease deals, and also look for specials on the websites of local dealers.
Prices vary depending on where you are located. For example, Columbus, Ohio, where I live, often doesn’t have some of the best promotions that are available in markets where dealers have a lot more EV inventory.
You have more time to shop and make decisions about the other expiring credits than you do with EVs. Most of the other consumer-facing tax credits expire on Dec. 31, including:

A 30 percent credit for home energy systems that can include rooftop solar, battery energy storage systems and small wind turbines, among others. This credit has no maximum benefit, which allows for a lot of flexibility in deciding the size of the system you want.


 A 30 percent credit for buying a qualifying air source heat pump, which is an electric system that provides home heating and cooling. The maximum benefit is $2,000.


A 30 percent credit for home improvements that help with energy conservation, which can include insulation, windows, doors and electrical panel replacement. The maximum benefit is $1,200, and there are several other limits for certain items, such as a cap of $600 for windows.

The only major consumer-facing credit that will continue beyond the end of the year is an incentive for buying and installing a home charger for an EV, which ends after June 2026. This is a 30 percent credit with a maximum benefit of $1,000. (EnergySage has a good roundup of the credits and expiration dates, which helped me to parse some of these details.)
But knowing which credits are available is just an initial step. The next one is to determine what to do with this information.
At my house, I have found that Electrify Central Ohio is a great resource, and I wrote about it in 2022. It’s a volunteer-run organization in which people share their experiences with buying rooftop solar, EVs and other emissions-cutting technologies. Other cities and regions have their own groups like this and I advise you to join one in your community.
I asked the co-founders, Andy Leber and Madeline Fleisher, whether the rapid expiration of tax credits means I should rush to make purchases.
“We were advising people considering solar to do it this calendar year, but it might already be too late to start getting bids and getting the system installed by Dec. 31,” said Leber, who is an Ohio State University psychology professor by day. “If I were shopping now, I’d try to secure a guarantee that the system would be installed in time and eligible for the credit.”
He is less sure of what to recommend for people who want to buy battery energy storage. He expects that retail prices for batteries will continue to fall to the point that the repeal of the credit won’t be as much of an issue in a year or two as it would be for rooftop solar and other resources.
Fleisher, an attorney who specializes in energy issues, emphasized the urgency of getting rooftop solar before the end of the year because of questions of what the solar industry is going to look like as it tries to adapt to not having the credits.
“I think you’re rolling the dice after the end of this year as to what might happen,” she said. “The business model is built around the tax credit and there’s going to need to be some significant adjustment of that business model before companies can figure out how to make money. It could be rough in the meantime.”
In writing about the rapid expiration of the credits, I’m reminded of how forward-thinking they were. Most of these credits were set to last for a decade before this abrupt reduction in the timetable.
Fleisher noted that the original timetable meant that the credits were going to be around as consumers reached the point in their buying cycle when they needed a new car, heating system or other major purchases.
She suspects that many people will find that their needs didn’t line up precisely enough with the window of when the incentives are available.
“People won’t find out about it until it’s too late,” she said. “People are going to miss the chance.”

Other stories about the energy transition to take note of this week:
PJM Capacity Price Rises Again and Hits Cap as Clean Energy Projects Remain Stalled: Electricity customers are going to see a continuing increase in costs because of results of an auction announced this week in the country’s largest grid region, as my colleague Rambo Talabong reports for ICN. PJM Interconnection—whose territory runs from New Jersey to Illinois—held the auction to set the price that is paid to power plant owners to be available for use by the grid when needed. Growth in electricity demand combined with PJM’s backlog of approvals of grid connections for new energy projects, most of them renewable, are contributing to a scarcity that is driving up prices. The new price, which takes effect next year, is $329.17 per megawatt-day, which hit a price ceiling set by PJM. The upshot is that most customers will see increases in the part of their bills that covers PJM’s services.
Tesla’s Automotive Revenue Falls Again, Even Lower Than Analysts Expected: Tesla had a rough second quarter, reporting on Wednesday that its automotive revenue fell 16 percent compared to a year ago, the second quarter in a row in which sales decreased. This is the second straight quarter of revenue declines as the automaker dealt with challenges tied to the lack of a hot new model and the continuing fallout from CEO Elon Musk’s close association with the Trump administration. The results fell short of analysts’ expectations and added to a string of disappointing news for the company, as Lora Kolodny reports for CNBC.
Trump Has Unleashed a Regulatory Blitz Against Renewables: President Donald Trump has used the powers of his office to try to put up barriers to renewable energy development. A recent example is the requirement disclosed last week that Interior Secretary Doug Burgum or his deputy personally approve renewable energy projects on public lands. Benjamin Storrow reports for E&E News about the administration’s efforts and how they are a significant escalation using the government to slow growth of renewables.
Republican Excitement for Wyoming Rare Earth Mining Contradicts the Party’s Disdain for Renewables: A recent ribbon cutting for Ramaco Resources’ Brook Mine was showcase for Republicans’ dissonance on mining for rare earth minerals, as my colleague Jake Bolster reports for ICN. On one hand, the Trump administration has taken action to encourage U.S. production of rare earth minerals. On the other hand, the administration has been hostile to the products that need these minerals, which can include solar cells and EV batteries.
Can the Rooftop Solar Industry Make Up for Lost Tax Credits by Cutting Costs? One of the big questions as tax credits are about to expire is whether the rooftop solar industry will be able to adjust. Jeff St. John of Canary Media reports on some of the attempts by solar companies to reduce “soft costs” in the process, which includes just about everything other than hard equipment. The industry has long recognized that there is room to cut soft costs, and the companies that survive are likely going to be the ones that figure out how to do it.

Adam Smith, in a congressional hearing, in September 2021 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Rod Lamkey-Pool/Getty Images)U.S. Rep. Adam Smith has been around in Washington state politics a long time. 
A moderate Democrat, he’s been in Congress since 1997, and before that, served in the state Legislature. His 9th Congressional District stretches from parts of Bellevue and south Seattle down to Federal Way and Auburn.
Smith covered many topics in an interview this month with the Standard at a Bellevue Starbucks. 
But as the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, he’s one of his party’s lead thinkers in Congress on national security issues and spoke at length on that topic and overseas conflicts in the Trump era — from his tepid optimism for peace in the Middle East and his one meeting with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.
Looking toward next year’s midterms, Smith faces a challenge from socialist candidate Kshama Sawant, a former Seattle City Council member, who has sharply criticized the congressman’s alignment with U.S. policy supporting Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza.
Reflecting broadly on President Donald Trump’s second term so far, Smith did not have much positive to say. “They are the most insular, the most partisan administration that I’ve ever dealt with,” he said. “It’s not just partisan, it’s authoritarian.”
The following interview was edited for clarity and length.
Let’s start in the Middle East. What do you think we’ll most likely see there in the next couple of years?
The most positive thing that’s happened in the last 20 years is the evolution of Saudi Arabia and the [United Arab Emirates] in terms of dealing with extremism. 
Prior to 9/11, Saudi Arabia was the foremost exporter of radical extremism, and now they are combating it, and the UAE is as well, because their focus is on stability.  
They need stability in the region because people aren’t going to do business if buildings are getting blown up and suicide bombers are showing up all the time. 
With Hezbollah weakened, with [former Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad] gone, there’s the chance that Lebanon and Syria could become stable countries.
They could focus on governing instead of jihad grievances against Israel. But for that to happen, Israel needs to make peace with the Palestinians. So that’s the great unknown. 
What’s Iran going to do? I don’t know, but the region is going to be in a lot better position to unify and put pressure on Iran if we can end the war in Gaza, and if there could be some kind of future for the Palestinian people that involves some element of self-governance.
That’s the real test: Can we get Israel into that type of agreement? That’s what Trump’s trying to do right now. God bless him. I hope he succeeds.
If that goes sideways, then terrorist groups motivated by Israel could become a factor in Syria.  They could have militia groups in Iraq that are aligned with Iran, and then these and others destabilize the government in Iraq. 
So that’s the big challenge, and as far as how that is going to play out, I don’t know, but it’s going to require a considerable amount of diplomatic skill.
You strongly condemned the U.S. strikes in Iran. With a few weeks’ hindsight, has that feeling evolved at all?
No, it was a mistake. I don’t think it was the right policy. I don’t think it was the right approach. 
It seems, for the moment, the risks did not bear out as much as it could have. Sort of like, you drive home drunk and you don’t hit anyone. The lesson from that isn’t that driving home drunk is not a problem.
The bad downside consequences have not yet manifested as greatly as they could have. Iran very easily could have chosen to launch a more aggressive attack. Iran still has the capacity to build nuclear weapons. 
You can make a pretty compelling argument that, after being attacked by Israel and attacked by us, it sort of pushes the scale toward, well, ‘Let’s build a damn thing so we can have an adequate deterrent,’ because the deterrent that Iran thought they had clearly was not sufficient. 
Are you at all optimistic that a diplomatic solution is a possibility in any kind of near future?
It is a possibility. Optimism is fine, but you’ve got to do the work. If the players in the region and if the U.S. choose to play a constructive role, it’s a possibility.
Have you always felt it’s a possibility over the past two years?
Not really. The big changes, and Israel deserves credit for this: Assad’s gone, Hezbollah is weakened and so is Iran. That is a fundamental shift that I will confess I did not see coming. It creates a greater possibility that we’ll get to a more peaceful outcome, but it’s still a region rife with conflict.
Moving to Ukraine. The U.S. paused military shipments. The president didn’t seem to know and didn’t agree. The situation has evolved. What does that tell you?
Have you seen the movie “Die Hard?” 
Yes. 
You know the point in the movie when the guy goes in and tries to cut the deal with the terrorist. “I do billion-dollar deals every day. I can handle this guy. Bunch of Eurotrash.” I think that’s the way Trump felt about Putin. “Come on, I’m Trump, I can cut a deal with this guy.”
I think now Trump’s like, “Oh, f***, maybe not.”
And in this case, Trump’s not going to get shot in the head by Putin, but I think he’s beginning to wake up to the fact that, no, he is not someone who Trump’s magnetic personality is just going to magically melt.
On the Armed Services Committee, we are attempting, and this is a very bipartisan thing — Mike Rogers, who’s the chairman of the Armed Services Committee. He and I are talking and like, “How do we get Trump to make the right call?” A lot of bipartisan support in Congress for this, but it’s just where is the support in the Trump administration? [Vice President] JD Vance is not going to be helpful. [Secretary of State Marco] Rubio could be. [Secretary of Defense Pete] Hegseth, I don’t think he thinks that sophisticatedly. 
So it’s really going to come down to what Trump wants.
He assumed that he could bully Ukraine into cutting a deal, then get a peace agreement that he can take credit for, which showed a fundamental misunderstanding of what was going on.
Russia will take every last inch of Ukraine that they can get away with. The only way to get to peace is to make it clear that they can’t. We actually had some success in that, because the Ukrainians have proved far more tenacious than anyone would have expected, and because the Biden administration put together a 53-nation coalition that helped Ukraine defend itself, that has really driven up the cost substantially for Putin continuing this war. 
Have you had any meetings with Hegseth?
I had one conversation [with Hegseth] when Mike Rogers and I were on the phone with him. We had one meeting with what they like to refer to as the Big Eight senators and House members, where Hegseth was at. Then, of course, I ripped into him the one time he testified before us.  
It’s not just partisan, it’s authoritarian. They don’t want to deal with Congress. In fact, they don’t talk to the Republicans that much.  
Has that been surprising? Were you expecting six months in to be saying it’s more authoritarian than partisan?
It’s not surprising. January 6 happened. It was a failure of imagination, not a failure of will, that stopped [Trump] from overthrowing our Constitution and trying to hold on to the White House.
Trump said what he was going to do. Dictator day one. We should be clear about the fact that Trump is attempting an authoritarian takeover of our government.
Do you feel like you and your colleagues have any power to do anything?
Absolutely. I’m a believer in: “There’s always a way.” 
He has done things that are manifestly unpopular, and the power that we have is to make that argument.
Three-step process. One, go after the authoritarian stuff. 
Two, go after the way his policies are negatively impacting people. 
Third thing is we’ve got to show them an alternative. Democrats got a ton of work to do in that area. 
Sadly, we’re locked in a bit of an ideological struggle. Too many people on the left want to prove that the activist left has never been wrong about anything. And you have too many people in the center who want to prove that centrists have never been wrong about anything, and not enough people are just trying to figure out how we all collectively get better so that we can govern better and win elections. 
We’re still stuck in that past of wanting to make sure everything’s pre-curated, as opposed to being authentic.  
Do you see your own election next year as any sort of microcosm of this debate?
I am downright excited about it because it offers the contrast that I want to offer. 
Do you want to sign up for some utopian revolution to tear down everything in society in the hope that some magical left-wing utopia will emerge from it? Or do you want to get to work in the way that true progressives do?

,Mississippi Today,2025-07-27 11:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,Health care in Mississippi could get even worse with new federal law,Bobby Harrison,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/07/27/health-care-worse-new-federal-law/,"Column: Don’t look now, but thanks to the so-called One Big Beautiful Bill, health care, which by nearly every metric already is bad in Mississippi, is going to get worse.","Don’t look now, but thanks to the so-called One Big Beautiful Bill, health care, which by nearly every metric already is bad in Mississippi, is going to get worse.
While Mississippi annually ranks at or near the bottom for most health care outcomes, in recent years some solace could be taken in the fact that the state’s percentage of people without health insurance had dropped significantly.
That drop can be attributed primarily to the fact that since the COVID-19 pandemic, Mississippians have embraced the Affordable Care Act, better known by many as Obamacare.
The citizens of two solid red or Republican states where the ACA for years was ridiculed embraced Obamacare in breath-taking fashion. Texas, viewed as the North Star by many conservatives, had the largest percentage increase of people enrolling in the ACA’s marketplace or health care exchange to obtain private insurance. Texas’ enrollment increased 255% between 2020 and 2025, followed next by Mississippi with a 242% increase to 338,159 people, according to KFF, a nationwide nonprofit that studies health care policy.
Texas and Mississippi have in common that they have more people eligible to sign up for the marketplace policies because they have not adopted another key ACA component: expanding Medicaid to provide health insurance for primarily the working poor. Texas and Mississippi are among 10 states that have not adopted Medicaid expansion. Nine of those non-Medicaid expansion states, excluding Wisconsin, have among the highest percentage of their populations without health insurance and some of the worst health care outcomes. Even with the strong participation in the ACA marketplace, Texas has the nation’s largest uninsured rate at 18.7%, according to Public Health Watch. Mississippi also is in the bottom 10 at 12.4%.
All that said, the uninsured rate in Mississippi is much better than it was pre-ACA, which was passed in 2010 and fully enacted in 2014.
In the 2024 legislative session, as the Mississippi Legislature finally seriously considered expanding Medicaid with the federal government paying the bulk of the cost to provide health care for primarily the working poor, some leaders said the expansion was not needed because of the ACA marketplace. It was true that the working poor, though not the poorest of the poor, could garner private insurance at little or no cost through the exchanges. It was a powerful argument that prevailed, even though hospital administrators stressed that Medicaid expansion would provide more financial security to their struggling hospitals than would the payments they received through the ACA marketplace’s private insurance.
Still, the ACA marketplace policies did provide coverage, and that coverage was bolstered through legislation passed during the Joe Biden administration that provided enhanced federal subsidies to allow the working poor to obtain the policies at little or no cost.
But those enhanced subsidies were not extended with the One Big Beautiful Bill. Some subsidies will still be available under the new legislation, but on average the payments people will have to pay in Mississippi for the marketplace’s private health insurance policies will increase an estimated $480 per year, according to a 2024 KFF study. Plus, the One Big Beautiful Bill makes it more difficult for people to obtain the policies.
Most public health policy experts and the Congressional Budget Office all agree that the percentage of people without health insurance will dramatically increase thanks to the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill touted by President Donald Trump.
But that news is especially disheartening for many in Mississippi, which has the nation’s highest percentage of unhealthy people.
With fewer people receiving health care coverage through the marketplace and with no Medicaid expansion, those numbers most likely will only get worse in Mississippi.
And the people losing coverage will be those who Republicans in the 2024 session of the Mississippi Legislature claimed they wanted to help: the working poor.
They could still help the working poor by expanding Medicaid in the upcoming 2026 session.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/04190025/3X0A0655-scaled.jpg,,,2025-07-27 07:56:17.338090

Vermont is among 20 states that filed a lawsuit Monday challenging the Trump administration’s decision to restrict the Head Start program based on immigration status, claiming it violates federal law.

For 60 years, all families across the United States, including in Vermont, have had access to Head Start, a federally funded preschool program that has become a national model for positive early learning, health and nutrition outcomes.
On July 10, however, the Trump administration announced the program will require immigration status verification, a new restriction that could affect scores of families enrolled across Vermont. 
“Fundamentally, Head Start programs believe in meeting the needs of all children so they can thrive in adulthood. Head Start programs strive to make every child feel welcome, safe, and supported, and reject the characterization of any child as ‘illegal,’” Christy Swenson, director of Head Start in Vermont, wrote in an email.
The mandate follows a number of hurdles for the program. The Trump administration has threatened its federal funding, a computer glitch led to the temporary suspension of some programs and its staff have endured mass layoffs, the Associated Press reported.
Those programs will be repackaged as federal public benefits, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced earlier this month. The move is part of a broad effort to limit access to federal benefits for immigrants who lack legal status and protect “vital resources for the American people,” Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. stated.
This comes two months after the department celebrated the 60th anniversary of the federally funded program, when Kennedy said he would “ensure that the next generation of families living in poverty have access to this vital program that offers what they need to thrive.”
Head Start educators in Vermont told VTDigger declined to comment as they wait to receive further guidance. 
Meanwhile, Vermont is among 20 states that filed a lawsuit Monday challenging the Trump administration’s broad demand to screen legal statuses before allowing people to access a slew of federally funded services – from domestic violence shelters to soup kitchens – including Head Start.
According to an agreement reached Friday, the federal government will pause implementation of the new restrictions until at least September 3rd.
The lawsuit claims restricting enrollment based on immigration status violates federal law. Two of the seven programs could be affected by the rule change, while five appear to be exempt based on their private, non-profit status, according to Swenson, who sits on the board of the National Head Start Association.
“I filed the lawsuit because the Trump Administration cannot violate the Constitution or federal law. These unlawful attempts to restrict access to critical safety net programs will harm many of our neighbors here in Vermont and undermine the health and wellbeing of entire communities,” Attorney General Charity Clark wrote in an emailed statement.
The challenge argues the federal government acted unlawfully by issuing these changes without following required procedures under the Administrative Procedure Act, and by misapplying the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act to entire programs rather than to individual benefits. 
The mandate further violates the Constitution’s spending clause by imposing new funding conditions on states without fair notice or consent, the lawsuit states.
More than 750,000 children have access to Head Start programs nationwide this year through schools, non-profits and community organizations, according to the department’s May 19 press release. 
In Vermont, Head Start has more than 12,000 students enrolled across seven programs, employs more than 600 staff, and had a budget of $26.8 million in fiscal year 2024, according to a program factsheet. The programs run by Capstone Community Action in Barre and the Champlain Valley Office of Economic Opportunity in Burlington are the two largest and serve multiple counties. 
The program has far-reaching effects beyond helping the children enrolled, Swenson said. For instance, it also served 203 unhoused families, 17 military members or veterans, 352 fathers and employed 752 families in school or training.
Others denounced the latest federal policy as un-American and difficult to implement because Head Start has for 60 years been open to any child based on their age or their family’s income, regardless of immigration status.
“When we deny children access to early learning opportunities like Head Start, we not only undermine their chances of success in elementary school and beyond, we also place additional pressure on our elementary schools due to the child’s lack of preparedness,” Erica McLaughlin, assistant executive director for the Vermont Principals’ Association, wrote in an email.
As an elementary teacher and principal, she said she saw first-hand the benefits of the program that has historically played a pivotal role in leveling the playing field, giving low-income and marginalized children a strong start to thrive academically, socially and emotionally. This includes access to health screenings, nutrition assistance and early identification of special needs and developmental resources that are “lifelines for children who already face significant barriers and/or have experienced significant trauma.”
“Restricting Head Start access based on immigration status will have profound and far-reaching consequences, especially for our most vulnerable children,” she added.
The effort mainly affects undocumented children and families and those who don’t have paperwork at hand. Some immigrants, such as children of Green Card holders and certain refugees, remain eligible to enroll, but no further guidance has been issued. For now, the classes in Vermont continue.
“Programs funded by U.S. taxpayers must follow federal law in determining eligibility,” a spokesperson with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said in a statement. “This ensures fairness and integrity in the use of public resources, particularly in programs that serve vulnerable populations.”
Eligibility will be “based on the immigration status of the child” and new guidance will be issued soon by the Administration for Children and Families, the statement said.
Head Start officials are not sure how to implement the mandate in the interim because they don’t know what documentation would be required to determine U.S. citizenship or legal immigration status, according to Swensen.
“We do not want to see an added burden for children to enter our programs. Many families of our enrolled children do not have legal documentation at hand even though they have been U.S. citizens for generations,” she wrote.
Rebecca Callahan, a professor and researcher of education policy with a focus on immigrant children at the University of Vermont, is concerned about how the rule will impact immigrant families. 
She emphasized the importance of the landmark 1981 Plyler v. Doe Supreme Court decision that guarantees education for all children regardless of immigration status, including undocumented children. 
“The vast majority of our children of foreign-born parents are U.S. citizens themselves. And one of the protections that’s been in place for K-12 and for preschool, for Head Start students, has always been the Plyler v. Doe decision,” she said.
Because the new rule does not distinguish between undocumented parents, undocumented students, Green Card holders, refugees or others who are in the country legally, Callahan said she is worried it will have a chilling effect and deter parents from enrolling their children in the longstanding program.
She referred to recent incidences of federal immigration overreach in Vermont. “They’re blurring everybody together, they’re stopping U.S. citizens,” she said. 
The mandate “hurts our society in the long run,” Callahan said. “These are low-income children and our society is strong because we educate our youngest and are our least able to fend for themselves. That’s why we’ve been a strong society.” 
Gov. Phil Scott has said the focus should not be on law-abiding people, especially children, and that Vermont will continue to be a welcoming place for those seeking a better life for themselves and their families, according to an emailed statement from Scott’s office. 
“It’s long past time for Congress and the President to pass legislation to allow greater pathways to citizenship rather than forcing them to live in the shadows,” the statement reads.

BURLINGTON — Marlene Tromp — the University of Vermont’s new president — says she wants to prioritize in-state student enrollment, collaborate with the Legislature and city leadership, and plans to protect academic freedom in the face of the Trump administration.
Tromp, the former president of Boise State University in Idaho, took the reins in Vermont this month at a precarious time for higher education in the country.
President Donald Trump’s administration has targeted universities like Harvard and Columbia, cut federal research funding, and has cracked down on protests on campus.
Many leaders in higher education have resisted, and in June, hundreds of colleges and universities — UVM included — signed on to a letter protesting the “unprecedented government overreach and political interference.” Other institutions, like Dartmouth, have taken a more neutral stance.
Meanwhile, the University of Vermont faces its own challenges internally, including how it manages in-state versus out-of-state enrollment, how it balances its overall enrollment against the realities of the local housing market, and how it manages budget pressures and tuition rates.
In a wide-raging interview, Tromp spoke with VTDigger about these and other issues.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
VTDigger: This year, the university was designated as an R1 institution. But it coincided with the Trump administration’s pausing, terminating and just general disruption of federal research grants. Could you describe what impact that has had on the university thus far and how the university is working around that?
Marlene Tromp: I don’t want to diminish the real impacts that those disruptions have had and the ways in which that can have real impacts on people and on places. The work that was being done with those grants, it could be vital research to health care. It could be vital research in a community. Those kinds of things are real. 
But it’s a really powerful moment — and this is happening now across higher education in the nation — for people to ask the question: Is this a time for us to ask questions about who we should be partnering with in order to make sure that the research that we do, that’s so valuable to the world, is well-funded and continues?
We’re also not being passive in the face of it. We’ve gone and met with folks, met with agencies and really tried to determine how we can work really actively to ensure that we restore as much of that funding as possible. But I think we have to really think carefully about going forward, how we partner, how we make sure that research is funded.
It’s real. It’s serious. We’ve had an awesome response here so far, and we’re looking forward, thinking about how we can get more creative going forward.
VTD: UVM has one of the lowest percentages of new in-state students of any large public university across the country. But last year, the percentage of enrolled in-state students increased for the second year in a row, bucking a longer-term decline in in-state enrollment. Is that a goal of yours, to continue to increase that, and how would you build off of that?
MT: For the (Vermont) students who choose to apply to college, so many of them apply here, and we accept a huge proportion of those students to UVM. But our population is so small that that really affects who comes to school. Even if we’re doing really well, proportionally, if other states were doing as well with in-state students as we were, they’d have a huge range of in-state students.
We’re actually helping to drive the economy by bringing students in from out of state. In fact, one of the most interesting things I’ve learned since I’ve been here is that for every Vermonter that graduates from UVM, two of their out-of-state peers end up staying and working in Vermont. It really helps for a state that has an upside down population (demographically), to drive the economy, and bring it vigor and vitality and new ideas into the state.
But the other part of your question, is that a priority to me? It’s absolutely a priority to me. Vermont and Wyoming are the only two states in the country that have a population smaller than Washington, D.C. The notion that there are talented people around the state who aren’t considering college or who aren’t considering UVM is significant to me.
The UVM Promise is a program that lets any family that has an income under $100,000, their students can basically come to school tuition free, and that means we’re really opening the doors for access. We want to make sure people know about that program.
But at my last institution, I built a lot of programs that were designed to really reach out into the state and make sure that students that were place bound had an opportunity to think about how they could still engage with the university.
While rural college attendance declined by about 50% nationally after the pandemic, we saw a 20% to 50% increase in those communities where we created a program that was about engaging in rural communities. So, I think there are some opportunities here to make sure people know that this is Vermont’s university, and we want those young people to come to school here.

VTD: Overall enrollment is increasing at UVM. But I wanted to ask about a law that was introduced this legislative session that proposed limiting enrollment to UVM when Burlington’s housing vacancy rate is below 5%. What do you think is the university’s responsibility in terms of managing enrollment against the realities of the housing market? How do you balance that?
MT: I do think the university has a responsibility to think about the community. I think it’s intimately connected to the community. I just met with (Mayor Emma Mulvaney-Stanak) this afternoon, and she and I were talking about this very issue.
One of the things that I explained to her, and it’s probably something that you know about, is the demographic cliff. It’s the decline that we’re seeing in the pipeline of people who will age out (of) high school to be able to come to college. That percentage is declining over time, and (the decline is) the most significant in the Northeast.
There’s some states that are continuing to grow, like California, Texas, Arizona, Idaho, and those states are going to see less impact from the demographic cliff, because there’s so much in-migration to those states, but states around the Northeast are seeing actually a lot of out-migration.
We’re actually aiding the economy by bringing people in, but we also want to be really thoughtful to make sure that we have all the resources here that we need to serve the students, and that we’re partnering with the cities that surround us in ways that help us both thrive.
What happens in Burlington and South Burlington impacts the university and vice versa. In my conversation with the mayor today, one of the things we really talked about is, how can we be the kind of partners that help each other thrive. So that feels actually very exciting and positive to me, and less about a kind of adversarial relationship.
I did a lot of projects at my other institutions that were about how partnerships could actually increase housing options. We were partnering with the city of Boise, which was experiencing a lot of the same challenges. We were partnering with the city to think about how we could create projects that helped alleviate the stressors for both the city and the university.
VTD: That bill never made it far, but if it were to proceed, how would the university handle that?
MT: I would really want to talk to legislators to understand exactly what their concerns revolved around. Let’s actually work together and trace out where the concerns are, and think about how we can work together. I think that allows us to be responsive, and as a land grant institution, one of our great commitments is to the state, and to the well-being of the state, so I take that very seriously, and would want to think about: How do we work together to solve the common problems that we have.
VTD: Last year, the university increased tuition on both out-of-state and in-state students, the first time tuition had been increased for in-state students since 2019. University officials cited rising health care costs — like many other institutions in the state — and the school was forced to use reserve funds to fill a $10 million budget gap. Do you expect another budget gap this year, and do you expect to increase tuition again?
MT: I think we’re going to have to get all the data about our class, about what’s happening federally, because, as you noted, that’s a huge factor in how the university will operate. That’s a factor in our budget.
Whenever it’s possible, I don’t want to raise tuition. Nationally, what’s happened in the last couple of decades is states’ dollars, their public money coming into public universities, have decreased because they’ve had to spend money on a lot of other things. A lot of state monies have gone into things like corrections, health care. So, more of that cost is borne by students and their families. I’m very keenly aware of that.
We have to be really sensitive to those costs because we want to ensure that students have access to education. We also want to give them the best quality education that we can, and it is incumbent upon us to be as smart and creative financially as we can be, so that we can find ways to create efficiencies, reduce our own costs, so that we can become more and more efficient, so we’re not passing on the inflationary costs that every entity in the country has experienced.
We saw record inflation and didn’t even raise tuition here during that period of record inflation. It was only when it became absolutely necessary. I have a lot of respect for the people who made those hard choices to keep those tuition dollars flat. I hope we can continue to do that as much as possible, but as all these things are changing and factors are rolling in, we’re going to have to assess that. But we’re going to keep looking for ways to be really efficient.

VTD: UVM is the second largest employer in the state. When you were officially announced, the university was in a hiring freeze. Is the university still in a hiring freeze?
MT: Everything goes back to that first question you asked: Until we have a little more clarity about what’s going to happen with the federal funding dollars, we just want some of the dust to settle. We realize we may not have absolute certainty about what’s happening, but until some of that dust settles, I think it would be premature for us to lift the freeze.
VTD: There’s been some layoffs recently. An op-ed we published written by co-presidents of UVM Staff United — signed by a coalition of unions — called into question about a half dozen layoffs in various departments at the university. Could you respond to that? And maybe speak to the general economic climate around hiring and employment at the university, and where you draw the line in terms of cuts to staff and employees here?
MT: For me the priority is to care for our community in the best way that we can. We don’t want to create a situation where we have some costs that escalate so much that people can’t afford their own health insurance as these costs escalate.
It’s not a dualistic situation, where we either support our employees or we don’t. There’s so many factors, and it matters to me to be in dialogue with our unions and with our staff association and our faculty association, and to really create some transparency around budget issues so people actually have a deep understanding of how the university is making decisions.
Part of the reason it’s important to me to build a strategic plan is so that we’re all on the same page as a community, and understanding what our priorities are, and caring for our community is one of those priorities
I’m really sensitive to those issues, and nobody wants to go through the loss of people’s jobs. It’s hard on them, it’s hard on their families, it’s hard on the larger community outside of the university. But we don’t know what we’re up against. We have some really challenging issues on the national front that are putting a lot of pressure on the university, but I hope we can bring people together in a dialogue to talk about those.
VTD: I asked you this when you were announced as president, but to put it more pointedly, I’m wondering how much the political climate in Idaho motivated you to search for other jobs? And did the political climate of Vermont specifically draw you here and motivate you to pursue this role?
MT: I’m very conscious about how the institution that I served for a long time is implicated in your question. I felt very fortunate to serve there for six years. And I am so grateful to be in a place that cares so deeply about education and believes in education, and I feel so grateful to be in a place where people care about other people as a very high priority.
I feel really excited to be in a place that values public education, that values higher education, and so for me, it’s a thrill to be here. There’s challenges in every environment. I just went and spoke at a program for new university presidents where I was one of the speakers, and one of the questions people asked in a dozen different ways during that session was, help us understand how what you saw can help us understand what’s happening nationally right now.
We have an obligation to really deeply understand and to move nimbly as we move forward, and so I’m grateful to be in a place that’s committed to those kinds of things.
VTD: I did want to bring up some criticism you faced in your previous role, as detailed in a ProPublica story, that you capitulated to pressure from right-wing state lawmakers around DEI policies. Now that you’re here, in a state with a less hostile Legislature, would you operate differently? And what is your stance on DEI policies at the university, considering that that federal threat still looms?
MT: If you look at the period when that story was written, it was when the very first anti-DEI, anti-CRT legislation was being written in the country. And at that time, I don’t think anyone thought that that was a real threat, or that it was something that could really undermine the functioning of a university.
It comes from a specific moment in time, and it was written by somebody who was from a very progressive place, who had never seen those kinds of things happening before. Now, I think everybody in the country understands: We’ve seen universities make changes that people could have never imagined years ago.
We never compromised on serving our students, serving our faculty or serving our staff, and I am so proud of that because it was a very, very challenging period. There were stories circulating about the university, what our motives were, what we were doing, and we worked really hard, because the misconstruction of what we were doing on campus was so damaging to the university. So, we worked really hard to educate people, and we saw a lot of minds changed over those six years about the services that we were providing and the support that we were giving our students, faculty and staff, and the impact that was having.
I am really grateful that now I’m in a place where there’s people who really don’t see the work that we’re doing to serve our community as somehow disadvantaging other people. That’s an amazing context to operate in. But it was tremendously stressful and tremendously hard to face the mischaracterization of our work all the time.
I wish that there was a more rich national conversation right now because I think it becomes so polarizing so quickly, and it took years for us to help communicate with people in Idaho about what we were really doing.
Things have happened so fast nationally. It hasn’t given people a lot of time to even have the practice of having those conversations. But I believe universities are the place where just those kinds of conversations should happen, and so I think there’s a real opportunity, and I think the University of Vermont can be a real national leader in helping people understand how democracy works, what it means to be engaged in serving people, what freedom of expression and academic freedom are, and I think we can take a step up onto the national stage to do that work. That’s one of the things that excites me about the University of Vermont.
VTD: Students last year camped out on campus to protest the conflict in Gaza. How would you handle a similar protest, one that specifically violates university policy? Would you discipline students for that and how would you handle that type of situation?
MT: I can tell you what my philosophies are because I think so much depends on the specifics of what happens. We met with student groups across the university when I was president at my last institution, and we said, ‘We want you to have the opportunity to express your perspectives. We believe in freedom of speech and academic freedom,’ and there were state laws that prohibited some activities, and we wanted to educate them about the state laws because we wanted them to feel safe too.
We also recognize that there can be powerful collisions when people disagree. So one of the things we were very concerned about was making sure people really understood the (state) laws in our case and the policies that we had on campus. We often reached out to make sure that we were communicating those things with people, but we kept a lot of really open dialogue.
VTD: What would your stance or your strategy be if the Trump administration were to attack the University of Vermont?
MT: My priority is to protect academic freedom, freedom of speech, the work of our faculty and staff, and our students.
A lot of times that filters down to individual choices. So for example, does the faculty member think that what they’re doing is so important they need to take a stand? I want to support that.
I want to protect people’s academic freedom to make those choices, and that’s the hill we have to stand on. That’s what makes universities what they are.

This story by Liberty Darr was first published in The Citizen on July 24.
For Charlotte residents Shawn Dumont and his two kids, peace signs are more than just a symbol. Each one, they’ve found, also tells a unique story.
So, the Dumonts started documenting them. But quickly, the journey shifted from a pastime summer hobby — finding peace signs and photographing them — to discovering the essence of Vermont, and an ethos grounded in community, culture and the enduring spirit of the back-to-the-land movement. The exhibition, “Peace Signs of Vermont: The Visual Legacy of the Back-to-the-Land Movement,” runs at the Karma Bird House at 47 Maple Street in Burlington Monday-Saturday, through the end of August.
“We are peace people,” reads a mural hand-painted on the gallery wall by Dumont’s kids, Zoë and Jasper, ages 9 and 4. That’s what the family is known for around those parts as of lately. However, Dumont has an even deeper connection to the Burlington art scene, much of which is rooted in the same building where the exhibition is located. He also was the art director for Burton Snowboards for ten years.
His latest creative endeavor: crisscrossing across the entire state of Vermont with his kids in search of peace signs. And it turns out, once you start seeing them, they are almost unavoidable.
“I was just like, what makes this piece so special?” Dumont said, his kids sitting next to him, sipping on chocolate milk. “What makes it so incredible? The peace sign just became this symbol of that. It was so obvious.”
But the journey didn’t just involve stopping to take a passing picture of any given peace sign — usually located on someone’s house, barn or even mowed into the grass. It also involved a conversation with the owner about the symbol and what it means for them.
“I have this deep understanding of graphics and design symbols, and I had sort of had a tertiary respect for the peace sign, but then you meet the people who put them on their house, and then you’re just like, this really is significant,” Dumont said.

The interaction usually stood in stark contrast to how people nowadays communicate. Rather than sending a direct message over social media or a quick text through a cell phone, the family would knock on strangers’ doors and strike up a conversation.
And people, the Dumonts discovered, were always up for a chat.
“There’s this cool tension (initially), but then every single time we would meet these people, there was just beautiful kindness,’ Dumont said.
A lot of the people the Dumonts found were in their 70s, many of whom came to the state as part of the back-to-the-land movement. Others were younger people who came to Vermont more recently, but still in search of that same lifestyle.

He noted people like April Cornell, the designer, and Robin Lloyd, Burlington activist and philanthropist who co-founded the Peace & Justice Center, as some prominent names whose peace signs have found themselves on the exhibition wall.
But among some of the more well-known peace sign carriers are the people who have laid the foundation for the state in a quieter way.
“Like the people who moved up here and then started running the library. I get goosebumps,” he said. “Because maybe they’re not living these big lives, but they’re super important. They’re raising kids here who understand how important it is to take care of your environment and how important food systems are and how important it is to take care of our waterfront and make sure that it’s for everybody.
“We’re living in such a unique, wonderful place because of the foundation that they laid for us.”
Part of his mission now, through this art display, has been to tell those stories.
But while the family has been retelling these stories through photographs, they have also been writing their own story. As Dumont puts it, the summer months in Vermont aren’t for screen time and staying in the house; it’s about family time and for them, setting off in any given direction with no plan in mind, just seeing what adventure might be before them.
“My wife was like, the fact that you found something you get to do with your kids that fills your creative cup is really the biggest gift,” he said.

Twenty-eight-year-old Michaela Bonner has been working 12-hour shifts as an emergency medical technician in Norfolk, Virginia, for the past four years, while attending and paying for college to finish her prerequisites for medical school.
But now that President Donald Trump’s signature tax and spending law bars students from borrowing more than $50,000 annually in unsubsidized federal loans for medical school, Bonner is worried her dream of becoming a doctor is financially out of reach.
“I get told, ‘Well, we really need you. We have a physician shortage, and you’ve done all this work leading up to this point,’ and that’s true as well, and it’s not that I want to quit,” Bonner said in a recent interview. “But there are no systems in place that I can rely on to support me now that I can’t take out the full cost of living through loans.”
The tax and spending law includes provisions that significantly alter the student loan process for higher education. The law halts current student loan repayment plans for loans that are granted on or after July 1, 2026. On that date, the law also terminates Grad PLUS loans, which have helped people pay for their higher education degrees and total cost of attendance. Current borrowers will be grandfathered in.
The federal law gives current borrowers enrolled in loan repayment plans for students based on income — such as those plans known as SAVE or IBR — until July 1, 2028, to switch to a new plan. Interest collection will resume Aug. 1 for students enrolled in the Biden-era SAVE plan.
At the same time, medical or law school students hoping to get unsubsidized federal loans — in which the borrower is responsible for paying the interest at all times rather than the government — will only be able to borrow $50,000 per year, with a $200,000 lifetime cap. Those seeking advanced degrees in areas such as history or philosophy have a $100,000 lifetime cap.












There are no systems in place that I can rely on to support me now that I can't take out the full cost of living through loans.


– Michaela Bonner, aspiring medical student




The average yearly cost of medical school for the 2024-25 academic year ranged from around $42,000 to $72,000, depending on whether the school was private or public and whether the student was a resident or nonresident, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges.
Some congressional Republicans say that students need to be working harder to pay for higher education, like medical school, on their own. Others say the caps put the onus back on colleges and universities to rein in the rising cost of tuition. But critics of this legislation say the loan caps are only going to harm students, especially from lower-income backgrounds, and will exacerbate physician shortages.
In recent years states have tried to ease physician shortages by implementing various policy solutions. Since 2023, at least nine states have made it easier for doctors trained in other countries to get medical licenses. States have also participated in interstate licensing compacts, allowing nurses and physician assistants to travel across state lines to work, so long as they are licensed in one state within the compact.
 Over 20 states passed laws for medical student loan forgiveness. Idaho refused to expand its program focused on rural doctors.

For student loan relief, more than 20 states have enacted legislation to address student loan forgiveness, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, a group that tracks states policies. Georgia passed a measure that will expand a cancelable loan program for physicians working in rural and underserved areas. Idaho also created the Rural Nursing Loan Repayment Program, offering nurses $25,000 in forgivable loans after three years of service in a rural area.

McKenzie Richards, a health care policy fellow at the conservative think tank Cicero Institute who has been studying the pace of physician shortages, told Stateline that the national physician shortage could potentially exceed 100,000 by 2034. At the end of 2024 that projected number was closer to 64,000 physicians.
Richards said states will be looking toward more policy solutions should the student loan changes exacerbate physician shortages.
“We know what’s going to be happening coming down the line in just five years, so I think policies that states can adopt to get out of this are really important to be looking at now,” she said.
“The hope is that by capping [federal loans], it will encourage schools to lower tuition prices,” Richards added. “Then maybe they need to be admitting more students, which would have a great downstream effect for getting more doctors through.”
Other students will be in the same boat, said Lesley Turner, an associate professor of public policy at the University of Chicago and an economist.
“This is going to hit some students worse than others,” Turner told Stateline. “Those [students] in more expensive programs tend to borrow more, and so for those students they will need to return to private student loans or other ways of financing their graduate education.”
Many students were already questioning their capacity to go to medical school before the student loan caps, said Shannon Jimenez, dean of the Arkansas College of Osteopathic Medicine.
“I expect that this bill, this cap, is going to push people out of primary care and into specialties to help pay off those higher interest rate loans,” Jimenez told Stateline. She added that caps will likely deter students from lower socioeconomic statuses from going into primary care — important in places like Arkansas, where she says there is a “maldistribution of physicians.”
“Many schools like us try to attract those students, because they’re more likely to go into primary care and serve in underserved areas. So it’s going to tie our hands in a lot of ways.”

 Large and rural states will be most affected, expert says

Large states and more rural states will feel the gaps more deeply, said Richards, of the Cicero Institute. Louisiana, for example, is projected to be short almost 5,000 doctors from a variety of specialties by 2030, including close to 400 primary care doctors. Already more than a third of Louisiana physicians are close to retirement age — similar to the situation in neighboring Arkansas.
As for whether schools will just be able to lower tuition, Jimenez said, “it makes no sense.”
“We still function in a somewhat market-driven economy and have to compete with other schools around us, so our cost is based mostly on what we have to pay our faculty, and that’s not going to go down,” she said. The annual cost of attendance at her school is between $80,000 and $85,000.
Bonner, the EMT, holds a political communications degree from Regent University and now is studying biomedical sciences at Old Dominion University. She already has $20,000 in loans, she said, and for the rest of college tuition, she has paid out of pocket. Since she’s supporting herself, she hasn’t been able to save much.
She’d planned to take the medical school entrance exam next spring, but now worries about how she’d pay for living expenses while attending. “Medical school scheduling doesn’t allow for working, so you have to take out loans for living expenses,” she said.
“A lot of people, I feel, would be panicked if you had worked for eight to 10 years of your life and found out that all the systems that you were banking on in a really academically challenging space are disappearing,” Bonner said.
“I don’t see a path forward for certain, but I’m fighting to make one.”

Jon Ossoff after a private phone call with Gov. Brian Kemp, who told King and other candidates he would not support their campaigns as he works behind the scenes to anoint a preferred candidate. “I got into the U.S. Senate […]","Gov. Brian Kemp is reportedly working behind the scenes in support of his preferred U.S. Senate candidate, Derek Dooley, a former coach at the University of Tennessee. Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderGeorgia Insurance Commissioner John King on Thursday suspended his bid to challenge Democratic U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff after a private phone call with Gov. Brian Kemp, who told King and other candidates he would not support their campaigns as he works behind the scenes to anoint a preferred candidate.
“I got into the U.S. Senate race to beat Jon Ossoff, not distract from the mission,” King said in a statement shared on X. “Right now it’s clear there’s little path forward to the nomination, so today I’m suspending my campaign.”
He said he now plans to run for a second full term as insurance commissioner.
King, a Spanish-fluent native of Mexico, was appointed to his post by Kemp in 2019 and became the state’s first elected Hispanic statewide official when he secured a full term in 2022. He was previously a street cop before working his way up to police chief in Doraville, a majority-Hispanic suburb of Atlanta.
He also came into the race with an extensive military background, having spent a combined four decades in the U.S. Army and the National Guard. His missions included deployments to the Middle East, building pop-up hospitals during the coronavirus pandemic and cracking down on illegal immigration at the U.S. border with Mexico, according to his campaign website.
Despite his impressive resume, his campaign left a lot to be desired. He lacked the financial resources of his rivals and wasn’t able to unite the party’s competing factions: MAGA diehards who prioritize loyalty to President Donald Trump and establishment-minded conservatives who would much rather talk about things like tax cuts.
His exit comes as the governor is said to be working the phones in support of Derek Dooley, a former coach at Tennessee and the son of the late Georgia coaching legend Vince Dooley. It’s not clear when or if the younger Dooley will join the contest, but he is lining up a political team full of staunch Kemp allies and has been sounding a lot more political in interviews despite having never run for office before.
Kemp might have nudged King out of the race, but his involvement doesn’t seem to be deterring other candidates — at least not yet. U.S. Rep. Earl “Buddy” Carter, a wealthy pharmacist, was the first to enter the contest in an effort to try and lock up the MAGA lane, even switching a lot of his social media photos to pictures of himself sharing a thumbs-up with the president.
The St. Simons Island Republican’s campaign did not hold back when asked about Kemp’s involvement: “Politicians don’t elect our Senators,” his campaign said. “The people of Georgia do.”
After announcing that he wouldn’t run himself, Kemp had committed to working with the White House toward a consensus candidate. But his moves behind the scenes to elevate the former Volunteers coach have “frustrated and p—d off” those close to the president, as one advisor said to Fox News.
And U.S. Rep. Mike Collins, who has been hinting at a Senate run for months, seems likely to enter the race within days. A trucking company owner from Butts County, Collins’ father Mac spent most of the 1990s representing the same northeast Georgia district his son now holds.
Collins’ support for immigration crackdowns and his bombastic presence on social media have made him something of a celebrity in MAGA world, which means the party could be headed for the proxy war it wanted to avoid. The conservative congressman was also an early supporter of Trump’s 2016 bid for the White House, while Dooley doesn’t appear to have much of a voting history.
“When Mike Collins enters the race, he will likely become the frontrunner,” says Martha Zoller, a radio host who is close with the governor. “His work on the Laken Riley Act cannot be underestimated regarding how that resonates with Republican primary voters.”
Zoller added that the candidates are only speaking to primary voters right now and suggested that whoever wins the primary will need to recalibrate before going toe-to-toe with the well-funded Ossoff.

When Jarvis Parker was looking to buy a house in Waterbury in late 2019, he had several basic criteria.
He wanted to avoid properties with leaking roofs and flooded basements. And he needed a place with enough space for himself, his daughter and his now 4-year-old grandson.
The modest two-bedroom home that Parker eventually purchased in Waterbury’s East End checked all of those boxes.
Five years later, however, he’s confronting a problem he never saw coming: a potentially toxic water line. 
Parker was informed this year that a small pipe known as a service line, which connects his house to the larger water main that runs under the street, could be made of lead.

The news stunned Parker, a disabled military veteran. He was so concerned about the water line and what it could do to his family’s health that he stopped using the tap water until he could purchase a filter to install on his kitchen sink.
“I got things going on that the doctors can’t even figure out,” Parker said. “And now you tell me that I’ve got bad water, lead water coming in?” 
“That right there really scared me,” he added.
Home builders and water utilities were banned in the mid-1980s from using lead plumbing in order to prevent the toxic metal from leaching into tap water and poisoning children and adults.

But as Parker and thousands of people across Connecticut recently learned, there are a significant number of lead service lines installed before 1986 still supplying homes, apartments and other properties in the state. 
New data obtained by The Connecticut Mirror shows there could be as many as 8,000 lead service lines still in use in public water systems throughout the state — though that number is likely to change as water utilities continue to inspect basements, unearth pipes and comb through century-old records to verify how much lead remains in the ground. 
The data provides the first public look at how many people in Connecticut could be consuming water that travels through lead lines. And it highlights how that aging infrastructure is not distributed equally throughout the state. 
A majority of the suspected lead lines are located in lower-income neighborhoods in Bridgeport, Willimantic, Middletown, New London and Waterbury, places that have significant Black and Hispanic populations and are designated by the state as environmental justice communities.
Still, Connecticut’s wealthier suburbs were not spared entirely. More than 1,500 lead lines are also suspected in Greenwich, one of the state’s wealthiest enclaves.
The push to identify lead service lines in Connecticut is the result of a new federal regulation implemented in the aftermath of the Flint water crisis.
That federal rule, which was finalized in late 2024, requires public water utilities across the country — both large and small — to create an inventory of every lead service line in their systems and to replace all of those pipes within the next decade. 
The success of that mission, however, could depend on whether the new federal regulation can survive a legal challenge filed by the country’s largest water utility association and possible efforts by President Donald Trump and Congressional Republicans to roll back the new rule. 
A team of CT Mirror reporters spent more than six months reviewing records, analyzing data, knocking on doors and talking to residents and experts in order to understand the scope of the problem in Connecticut. 
While it is not yet known how Connecticut compares to other parts of the country, the numbers clearly show the state has a lot of work to do before all of the aging lead pipes are out of the ground. 
The data on the lead lines was contained in hundreds of reports assembled by the state’s water utilities and submitted to the Connecticut Department of Public Health, which regulates drinking water safety.
The properties flagged in that data include a variety of locations that serve young children, who are at the greatest risk of developmental delays from lead poisoning.  
The CT Mirror found examples where in-home daycares, a local Boys and Girls Club and older elementary schools were listed among the properties with suspected lead lines. That includes Waterbury’s Margaret M. Generali and Frank Regan elementary schools, which predominantly serve students of color.

The number of lead lines located in minority communities was expected. In fact, officials with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency predicted much of the country’s leftover lead plumbing would be found in lower-income and minority neighborhoods, where there is older housing stock and a lack of investment.
U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal referenced that reality during a press conference in New London last year, arguing that the state and federal government had a “moral obligation” to remove every remaining lead service line.
“There is a real environmental justice issue here. It’s the dark side of this problem,” Blumenthal said while brandishing a lead pipe that had just been pulled from a home. “Much of this danger is determined by the ZIP code where a child lives, and all too often it’s a ZIP code that affects children of color.”

Questions and concerns
The leaders of some of Connecticut’s largest water utilities said that further inspections and investigations will be required before they can get a true count of how many lead service lines remain in their systems. 
They also emphasized that they treat their water with what are known as corrosion inhibitors — compounds that help prevent service lines and older plumbing from leaching significant amounts of lead into people’s drinking water. 
Even so, several engineers and former regulators interviewed for this story warned that the aging lines pose a risk to people’s health. And they noted that treating the water supply does not guarantee that lead from older service lines won’t end up in the tap water. That’s especially true if the pipes are disturbed during sidewalk and road repairs or when the water in a building isn’t used every day, like in the cases of schools and daycares. 
“Corrosion control does help reduce the amount of lead that gets into water. It does not prevent lead from getting into water,” said Elin Betanzo, a professional engineer who helped uncover the Flint water crisis in 2014, which set off a public reckoning over lead contamination in drinking water. 
You can’t see, taste or smell lead in water. So the best way to ensure lead service lines aren’t poisoning people, Betanzo said, is to remove the pipes from the ground.  
That’s exactly what the new federal drinking water regulations, which were enacted under President Joe Biden’s administration, are expected to do. 
The EPA set a deadline late last year that requires any water utility serving at least 25 people to identify and remove every lead service line within the next 10 years — a monumental undertaking that is expected to cost tens of billions of dollars. 
In the meantime, utilities in Connecticut are sending out notices advising customers with confirmed or suspected lead lines to purchase water filters or to flush their sinks for several minutes before consuming the water.
Those notices have ignited concerns and sowed confusion among some Connecticut residents, like Parker. The Waterbury resident doesn’t understand why he is just learning that the water line for his home is potentially made of lead. 
“How can you give certain people lead-filled water and not even come and test the water or do nothing?” Parker asked. 
“Who’s checking? Who’s doing rounds and telling us?” he added.

Gaps in communication
The CT Mirror spent months knocking on doors at properties with suspected lead service lines, and the reactions from residents at those locations varied from town to town and street to street. 
Some said they’d recently been notified that their service line might need to be replaced, while others said they’ve known for years that their property was supplied by a lead service line.
Bill Flaherty, a Willimantic resident, said he learned about the lead line supplying his house in the southeast end of town after utility crews unearthed it during a water main replacement years ago. But he said utility officials repeatedly told him not to worry about it because the water was being treated to prevent corrosion. 
Flaherty said he began to question that, however, after he received a notice in the mail last year informing him that utility officials wanted to replace his service line and the more than 300 other lead lines that remained in town.
Denise Deleon, a 48-year-old Waterbury resident, said she did not receive a notice that her apartment had a suspected lead service line, and she would remember seeing that type of information, since she has a history of dealing with lead exposure.
Years ago, while she was living in New York City, Deleon said her daughter began struggling to concentrate in school, and doctors found elevated levels of lead in her blood. As a result, Deleon said her family moved out of their home in the Bronx to prevent her daughter from being further exposed. 
While her daughter is now grown, Deleon was troubled to learn that her community may be home to hundreds of lead water lines. She worries what effect those lines could have on the kids she sees playing in her neighborhood. 
“I see a lot of children around here, and I’m concerned because I went through that,” said Deleon. “I think about the children around here and if it’s going to affect them the same way it affected my daughter.”

The gaps in communication surrounding lead service lines did not surprise Arthur Denze Sr., a lifelong Waterbury resident. People in Waterbury, he said, have been dealing with environmental hazards for decades, including concerns about air pollution and other contamination from old industrial sites. 
“Years ago, we fought tooth and nail against a lot of companies coming in and polluting the area,” said Denze, 87, head of a council that represents the city’s neighborhood associations. “I used to get out of work at night, and a smokestack was sending plumes up. You could see it all the way down the valley. We probably have some of the highest asthma rates in the state.” 
He said the city’s water department could be more proactive in informing residents about lead lines and potential health risks that come along with them.
“That should be discussed within the city. It’s a big item. God knows how much they used [lead lines] years ago,” Denze said. 
Bradley Malay, the superintendent of Waterbury’s Water Department, said the city sent out notices to properties with suspected lead lines earlier this year. It also provided information about lead service lines to every water customer in the utility’s most recent water quality report. 
Malay emphasized that the city is in the very early stages of identifying potential lead service lines, and he said it was largely relying on historical records, which can sometimes be unreliable or out of date.  
The city, Malay added, is currently developing a multi-year plan for how to replace the lead lines it finds, and he said the city intends to prioritize line replacements at schools and similar locations first.

‘What do we have to do to protect ourselves?’
Many of the properties that CT Mirror reporters visited for this story were older, three-story walkup apartments and brick duplexes built in the early 1900s — places where tenants are also at heightened risk of exposure to lead paint.
The EPA published research in recent years that found census tracts where lead service lines are located often have higher percentages of renters, low-income residents and people of color.
Federal officials also produced studies that suggest the owners of rental properties are not always as engaged in the conversations and activities surrounding lead service line replacements, partly because they are not the ones drinking the water. 
That has not been a problem in Greenwich, however, where most of the suspected lead lines are supplying single-family homes. 

The news that hundreds of properties in Greenwich could contain a lead service line drew significant attention in the town, where the median household income is $180,000 per year and more than 60% of the housing is owner-occupied.
Jill Boullin, a homeowner in Greenwich’s southwest corner, said she was surprised by the letter she received from Aquarion Water late last year identifying her home as one the properties with a suspected lead line. 
“The next thought was, what do we have to do to protect ourselves?” said Boullin, who has two young children, ages 2 and 5.
Bouillin, who closed on her house in 2024, said she quickly contacted the town’s state-certified laboratory to purchase a water testing kit. But by that point, she said, the lab had already been swamped by other homeowners who were seeking to verify that their water was safe to drink. 
“They were overrun with the amount of people calling,” said Bouillin, who is now weighing whether to purchase a water filtration system for her and her family.

Warnings
Many of the lead service lines flagged in Connecticut have been in place for more than a century.  
The data collected by water utilities shows many were installed between the 1870s and early 1930s, long before the federal ban on lead plumbing. 
Lead was used during that time frame because it’s pliable, which made it ideal for snaking under sidewalks and into basements. It is also durable, which is why the federal government estimates there are still between 6 million to 10 million lead service lines in the ground nationwide.
“Lead service lines and lead bearing plumbing have basically been forced on people,” said Yanna Lambrinidou, a co-founder of the national nonprofit Campaign for Lead Free Water. “People did not go to the store and choose lead service lines.” 
“Lead lines in many cases were imposed through local plumbing codes and local laws that made them mandatory, or that made them at least one of the acceptable materials until they were banned,” she added. “People were never really told what the health risks would be in essentially using a lead straw to pull in water to drink and cook with.”
Public health officials and advocates warned for decades about the threat those forgotten lead lines could pose to human health. There were high-profile examples over the years, including in Washington, D.C., that highlighted the damage that can be done to children and communities when lead service lines are allowed to corrode and poison people’s drinking water. 
But it wasn’t until after the Flint water crisis that federal officials acted by requiring utilities to identify and replace all of the remaining lead service lines in the country. 
Flint was a worst-case scenario. Tens of thousands of children and adults were exposed to high levels of lead after the city switched the source of its drinking water to the Flint River and failed to properly treat the water to prevent corrosion in lead service lines and other plumbing. 
In the end, the crisis resulted in a massive spike in the number of children in Flint with elevated levels of lead in their blood. 
Betanzo, who now runs a company that consults on drinking water safety, said Flint is a dramatic example, but it is also an indicator of what can happen in any community where lead service lines are allowed to remain in the ground. 
“Every time there’s lead in the pipes, there is a risk of lead in the water,” Betanzo said. “There is no need for anyone to drink lead in their water.”
“The issue in Flint is that we used children as our warning system,” she added. “And once you test it in children, it’s too late.”

A quiet threat
Lead is not like iron and zinc, which people need trace amounts of. There is no safe level of lead in the human body. 
In adults, lead can affect kidney function and can contribute to cardiovascular problems. And in children, elevated lead levels can cause developmental delays, learning difficulties and behavioral problems. 
When someone swallows lead particles, the metal accumulates in the body. It gets stored over time in the blood, bones and organs. 
Lead-based paint, which was widely used on homes built before the late 1970s, is the biggest contributor to lead poisoning in children throughout the United States.
More than 66,000 children in Connecticut were tested for lead in 2023, the most recent year that data is available. And more than 1,600 of them had lead in their blood above 3.5 micrograms per deciliter, which is the new reference level for when cases get flagged. 
Local health officials also performed inspections on 96 different properties that year in an attempt to identify the source of the lead poisoning cases. None of those cases was attributed to lead in water. 
But public health experts said lead service lines represent another potential source of lead exposure, and the EPA estimates that drinking water can make up 20% or more of a person’s total exposure to lead.
Dr. Carl Baum, a pediatrician who has treated lead poisoning cases in Connecticut for more than 20 years, said infants who are consuming baby formula that is mixed with tap water are at the greatest risk from lead water lines. Another vulnerable population is pregnant women. 
Baum, the director of the lead poisoning treatment center at Yale New Haven Children’s Hospital, said the only foolproof way to protect infants and other people from lead service lines is to eliminate the source of potential exposure. 
Lead exposure, Baum explained, is often a silent disease, meaning parents and doctors don’t realize there is a problem until lab testing finds elevated levels of lead in a child’s blood. In Connecticut, the state has a universal testing requirement. 
All children between nine months and 35 months must be tested annually for lead in their blood. There are further testing requirements for children who are at heightened risk. 
“Unfortunately, we use kids as biological monitors,” Baum said. “We are allowing kids to go into homes where there is a probability that there is lead either in the water or in the paint and we wait until they get a lead level checked and then we say, ‘Oh, this kid is lead poisoned.’” 
David Cash, the former regional administrator for the EPA in New England, said the quiet threat that lead poses to children is why the Biden administration adopted regulations that require lead service lines to be removed within the next decade. 
“If we care about children’s health and neurological development and success in school, then we should care very much about this,” Cash said. 
“You know, having a kid who grows up with full mental and neurological abilities is great for that kid and great for their family,” he said. “But it’s also great for the community, great for the economy.”

‘We saw the writing on the wall’
Connecticut’s community water systems, which collectively serve more than three quarters of the state’s population, are at varying stages of pinpointing and eliminating their lead service lines.
In New London, contractors are already in the process of ripping out and replacing more than 500 lead service lines identified in the city. The city was celebrated in recent years — including at an event at the Biden White House — as one of the most proactive municipalities in the country when it comes to addressing its aging lead lines.
“We saw the writing on the wall after Flint that this was going to become a major problem,” said Joseph Lanzafame, New London’s Director of Public Utilities. 
Other utilities, however, are just beginning to research how much lead remains in their systems. 
Some of the state’s water systems told state regulators late last year that they were not sure what most of their service lines are made of. 
The Southington Water Department, for instance, classified 89% of its service lines as “lead status unknown.” The Manchester Water Department listed 81% of its service lines in the same category. And in Meriden, the city’s water division, said it was uncertain about 84% of its roughly 20,000 service lines.
Dr. Manisha Juthani, Connecticut’s public health commissioner, said those cases highlight the difficulty many utilities are facing, especially when there isn’t historical documentation about each service line.
“For some, it’s very challenging,” Juthani said. “They’re going back to records — literally, paper cards and things — from the 1800s.” 
William Norton, Meriden’s director of public utilities, said his team recently asked property owners to help document what their water lines are made of by taking photographs of the pipes where they enter people’s homes. And the utility’s employees are excavating several hundred service lines this year to confirm whether they contain lead.
Many utilities are also using computer modeling and machine learning to help predict where lead service lines are located, based on the age of a home or whether other properties on that street have a confirmed lead line.

Officials with the Metropolitan District Commission and Regional Water Authority, which provide drinking water to more than 800,000 people in and around Hartford and New Haven, said they do not expect to find a large number of lead lines in their systems based on the modeling they’ve done up to this point.
The MDC, which serves the Hartford region, told state regulators that it was confident that roughly 86% of its service lines were lead free. And the Regional Water Authority, which covers all of New Haven, similarly reported that at least 93% of its more than 125,000 service lines did not contain lead. 
Meanwhile, Aquarion Water, which serves a large portion of Fairfield County, is estimating it could find nearly 4,000 lead lines in Bridgeport and surrounding towns, based on its current projections.

A financial burden
Identifying the lead lines is difficult enough, but utility officials said replacing all those pipes is likely to be an even bigger feat. 
In many systems, water customers own at least part of the service lines — meaning utilities need permission from each property owner before they can begin pulling lead from the ground.
Utility officials said tracking down hundreds or thousands of property owners is an enormous challenge, especially in cities where there are a substantial number of rental properties and absentee landlords. 
But the biggest impediment to replacing all of Connecticut’s lead service lines is likely to be money. The EPA estimated in 2019 that it could cost roughly $4,700 on average to replace a single service line. 
Lanzafame, who is overseeing New London’s lead service line program, said the price has been even higher in his experience. 
Part of the cost of replacing lead lines in New London is being covered by a $6.9 million federal loan, a portion of which will be forgiven. Without that assistance, Lanzafame said, it would be far more difficult for the city to complete the work. 
“It is a big financial burden. I think that is one of the biggest challenges, especially being a distressed community,” Lanzafame said. “Without the grants and the funding that we’re getting from the federal government, we wouldn’t be able to carry out this project.” 
Federal lawmakers and the Biden administration set aside more than $15 billion through the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to help utilities across the country to identify and replace lead service lines. Connecticut received $99 million from that pot of money over the past three years, which the state is making available to water utilities through grants and low-interest loans.
But some groups are estimating the price tag for replacing every lead line nationwide could be up to $45 billion or even $90 billion — meaning some replacement projects may not receive federal support. 
Lambrinidou, of the Campaign for Lead Free Water, said utilities cannot rely on individual property owners to pay out-of-pocket for the cost of replacing their service lines. If they do, she said, those lead lines will likely remain in the ground. 
Many Connecticut utilities told CT Mirror they intend to cover the entire cost of replacement, but in order to do so, they may need to raise utility rates. The Connecticut legislature passed a bill this session that would allow investor-owned utilities, like Aquarion and the Connecticut Water Company, to create a surcharge on people’s water bills to cover the cost of lead removal projects. 
Lambrinidou, an affiliate faculty member at Virginia Tech’s Department of Science, Technology and Society, said that is also problematic. It would be far more equitable for the federal government to pick up the tab for service line replacements, she said.
“In many communities, it’s going to be the people — the victims — who are going to be required to pay, at least partially,” Lambrindou said. “If that’s not an environmental injustice, I don’t know what is.”
Does your address have lead pipes?
This table shows addresses served by 60 of Connecticut’s public water systems. Together, they serve nearly 90% of Connecticut’s population that is connected to a public service line.
To look up your address, type it in the “Street Address” field, like the Park Street example. You can also filter by town or by what the lines are made of using the “Entire Service Line Classification” field.
If you can’t find your address, try different formats or abbreviations like “st” for street. GRR means “galvanized requiring replacement.”
If you don’t find your address, you may be in the 10% of the population served by a smaller water system or not served by a public water system at all.

(Max McCoy/Kansas Reflector)How’s your tap water?
Here in Emporia, we supposedly have the best-tasting water anywhere. I wouldn’t know, because the stuff that comes out of the kitchen faucet seems ordinary enough to me. Maybe I’m spoiled because I’ve been drinking it for 20 years. But judges have given Emporia’s municipal water a couple of gold medals for taste.
There really is a competition to judge tap water, and it’s called the Berkeley Springs International Water Tasting. It’s a big enough deal that the Washington Post devoted nine photos and about a million words in February to cover the event, which is held in West Virginia and began as a way to generate tourism in the off-season.
It was a cute piece, breathlessly reporting the event as the Oscars of H20. There are other international water tastings, the story noted, and at those other ones the judges are actually water connoisseurs. At Berkeley Springs, the judges typically come from the travel and media industrial complex.
“The gold medal for tap went to Emporia, Kansas, its second since it began competing,” the story noted. “Berkeley Springs took silver.”
Quite a coincidence that the town that has hosted the competition for 35 years also placed. Chalk it up to home team advantage. No reason to question the integrity of a fun little contest that, frankly, does no harm, generates some positive PR and allows city water workers to take some pride in their jobs. Right?
“Emporia’s water is sourced and treated with state-of-the-art technology and rigorous quality control measures, ensuring it meets and exceeds health and safety standards,” the city said in a press release. “Winning Gold at this prestigious competition is a testament to the dedication of the City of Emporia’s Water Department in delivering clean, refreshing, and top-quality water to the community.”
But recently Emporia has achieved another first, one that won’t be generating glowing press releases anytime soon: It topped the list of cities with the highest unemployment in the state.
The unemployment rate is 5.8%, according to the latest figures from the Kansas Department of Labor. That’s double the 2.9% unemployment KDOL recording for the city this time in April 2024.
What happened?
The massive Tyson Beef Plant closed, with a loss of more than 800 jobs. Tyson announced the closure in December 2024 (here comes Santa Claus) and said it would be effective by Feb. 14 (just in time for Valentine’s Day). Really, who picks these dates?
Tyson said it was shutting down the Emporia plant to improve efficiency. That means it was losing money. The company’s beef unit logged a $291 million loss in fiscal 2024, and because the Emporia plant primarily produced ground beef, it had to go.
The plant was one of the things that made Emporia, well Emporia, kind of like the weirdly sweet smell from the Dolly Madison plant on Industrial Road. Dolly, which employs several hundred, closed in 2012 after strikes and union woes. Hostess, the parent company, went bankrupt. The Dolly bakery was reopened in 2013, following its acquisition by a private equity firm. It still makes Twinkies, but as the Dolly Madison Cake Co.
The smell coming from the beef packing plant, however, was never sweet.
The plant was once owned by Iowa Beef Processors, the nation’s biggest beef packer, before Tyson bought them out in 2001. Cattle were still slaughtered at Emporia then, and a variety of smells emanated from the massive facility nearly the railway tracks on Prairie Street, especially on “blood burning” days. I don’t know if that’s what actually happened, but it sure smelled like it.
Tyson wasn’t the only cause of Emporia’s recent gold in unemployment.
Assorted smaller layoffs contributed. Tyson wasn’t Emporia’s biggest employer, but it was in the top three, after Simmons Pet Food and the local school district.
Emporia’s unemployment stats shot up this summer, as the Tyson closing was fully felt. Unemployment here is now greater than the state average of 3.8% or the national, 4.1%.
I asked the Kansas Department of Labor for the city’s unemployment rate for the last 20 years, and its staff provided a handy spreadsheet. Here are the highlights: The seasonally unadjusted unemployment was 5.3% in June 2005, about the same as the state level. Then the Great Recession hit us hard, and in 2008 we logged 8.4%, double the state average. Then it went back down but spiked at 8.9% in late 2012 and early 2013, after the Dolly plant closed. There followed a gradual decline to 1.6% in November 2021, the lowest in the 20 years. It remained at or under 4% — generally following the state level — from then until January 2025, when it began its current climb.
If you live in Emporia, you don’t need statistics to know the community is in sudden trouble. There is the former Tyson plant, of course, the gates of which have been fenced and padlocked like a scene from “Citizen Kane.” And there are other casualties, such as the United Parcel Service customer center just down the street.

The UPS center was only open from 4:30 to 6 p.m. on weekdays, and parking was problematic. But when I went to drop off a couple of packages there recently, I found the only thing worse than an inconvenient UPS center was none at all. A note taped to the door said the center had closed. The UPS website directed me to an “access point” at a nearby hardware store, where a helpful but harried clerk took my packages. She said the last few months had been a challenge, especially when customers didn’t have prepaid labels.
The UPS store was one of 70 facilities closed in the past few months, including locations in Dodge City and Lawrence. UPS dropped Amazon to boost profits, then sacked 20,000 employees in a massive overhaul.
A small inconvenience for consumers, but a major indicator of tectonic shifts in the economy. Since the pandemic, living in a small town like Emporia has felt not as neighborly and far less secure.
Just a few years ago, our neighborhood on Constitution Street woke up before dawn. All down the block, you could hear the racket of cars and trucks starting, the blare of music from radios or decks, and sometimes a few words of goodbye as people started off to work or school. Now it’s ghostly quiet. The cacophony used to annoy me. Now I miss it.
The guy who does our lawn was among those sacked by recent layoffs. He also has cancer. But he still cuts our grass because he says he feels OK. We’re also talking about some badly needed house painting, which I will pay him for, but I have to go buy the paint. Frankly, I’m dragging my feet on the paint because it is so damned hot out. It was 96 today.
There is a sadness to my friend, and I worry about him.
To be laid off is a trauma that only those who have gone through it can understand. It not only creates an immediate fiscal crisis — really, how many of us are lucky enough to go more than a few weeks without a paycheck? — but is an injury to one’s sense of self.
I know, because I was laid off in 2022.
It was the only time I’ve been fired, and it wasn’t my fault.
Sometimes I imagine actual physical trauma would have been easier to deal with, like a gunshot wound or fracture. I wrote about the runup to the layoffs at my university, and may write again about the aftermath, but not yet.
Being stone cold fired from a job you love — or a job you need — is a special kind of hell. Shortly after it happened to me, I went downtown to one of the older taverns in Emporia and had a bourbon. When the bartender found out what happened, she gave me another, on the house. I got some change and fed some quarters into the pinball machine in the back room. It was the best five bucks I ever spent.
I’m mostly fine now, I think. But it took a while.
The experience made me more sensitive to things I knew about but never took personally. Like how Kansas is ranked among the 10 worst states when it comes to the rights of workers. How losing a job is one of the most unhealthy things that can happen to you and can also damage your family. And how insensitive or downright offensive some officials can be when talking about unemployment statistics.
A case in point is Lyle Butler, interim director of the Emporia Regional Development Association. The RDA is a nine-member board to promote economic growth. In a press release, Butler called the city’s unemployment rate a “small uptick,” as if he were talking about the price of ground beef.
“Kansas and the nation are seeing similar short-term increases in unemployment as the job market adjusts to inflation and seasonal shifts,” Butler said in the statement. “Despite the local uptick, Emporia remains near ‘full employment,’ typically defined as below 5%, which reflects normal workforce movement — not widespread job loss.”
Similar short-term increases? Seasonal shifts? Normal workforce movement?
Apart from the dismissive and defensive tone of Butler’s release — move on, nothing to see here — and his obvious break with economic reality, there’s the question of just how callous the entire statement is. Even if there is some grain of truth beneath all that posturing, imagine for a moment you were one of the 809 individuals laid off from Tyson.
You’re just an uptick, a seasonal fluctuation.
Butler may be a decent guy, but he’s tone deaf.
I hope the RDA manages to help some of the people terminated by Tyson and other employers to find jobs. I hope Butler is ultimately right to be optimistic and that our title as unemployment capital is brief. I hope that Emporia thrives and that our neighborhood will fill back up with students and workers.
But what the unemployed need, other than a job, is empathy. Can’t any city leaders talk about how tough it really is to be laid off? What it’s like to look for a job when you’re young or old or too sick to work or have just lost your confidence through a series of tough breaks?
Emporia needs compassion for those hardest hit by the layoffs. Yes, I know there have been job fairs and other events to help individuals find work. But we also need confident and fact-based leadership, and somebody who understands that a doubling of the city’s unemployment rate in just 14 months affects just about every family in some way, and has been devasting for some. This is a crisis, not a fluctuation.
We’ve endured tougher collective times. National unemployment is estimated to have been 25% in March 1933, during the Great Depression. But that was before most of us were born. Right now, Emporia is experiencing a job slump surpassed in recent memory only by the Great Recession and the Dolly plant closing.
There’s a lot of families worried about how they’re going to cover the rent, buy food, and pay the water bill. Here on Constitution Street, the city utility bill — water, trash, sewer — has gone up 25% in two years, and is now $95.70.
Personally, I’ve never found Emporia’s water to be “refreshing” in ways that other water isn’t. Also, I’ve found the occasional boil advisories annoying and inconsistent with the goal of delivering clean, top-quality water. Right now, there are 10 jugs of bottled water in our kitchen waiting for the next trouble at the water plant.
What we don’t need is somebody handing us a glass of water and telling us it’s wine.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Tyson-7.23.25-Fence-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-27 04:56:49.721112

Riding the ancient Danbury branch of Metro-North is hard enough, but now it’s going to be shut down for two weeks, the trains replaced by buses from August 1 through the 17th.


The 24-mile-long, mostly single-track railroad from South Norwalk to The Hat City carries about 2,000 daily riders at an average speed of 27 mph.  Now those riders will get to enjoy the “bustitutes” which will make the journey faster than the train.
During the train outage, crews will improve the tracks and several grade crossings. What won’t be addressed is the long-discussed re-electrification of the line.  Yes, the Danbury line used to be electrified, just like the main line along the Connecticut coast.
It was in 1959 that the last electric locomotive pulled a train on the Danbury branch, “under the wire.”  Why did that change?  Here’s a synopsis of what I wrote a couple of years ago…
Most rail historians, like former New Haven and Metro-North veteran Jack Swanberg, blame one man for the de-electrification:  Patrick B McGuiness, then-President of the New Haven Railroad.  “He was not a good railroad man,” said Swanberg, a master of understatement.  In his two years running the mighty, private and once profitable New Haven Railroad, McGuiness made terrible choices we’re still living with today.
At the NH Railroad, predecessor to Metro-North, McGuiness cut maintenance and laid off staff, trying to goose up the stock price.  But it was when General Motors came calling that he made his biggest error.
The New Haven’s real profits came from running passengers and freight on the main line from New York City to Boston.  Because steam and diesel locomotives were not allowed in Grand Central, the New Haven was one of the first railroads to electrify, starting in 1909, but only as far as New Haven.
Trains running north to Boston needed to waste time and expense changing engines (from electric to steam and later diesel) in New Haven. McGuiness thought he could avoid that when GM introduced its hybrid FL-9 locomotive, railroad’s Prius of its day: running all electric in third rail territory, then running diesel.
In the 1950’s the New Haven ordered 60 FL-9s from General Motors, replacing their classic but boxy looking EP-2 electrics built by General Electric.  By 1959 that meant no more electric service on the Danbury branch.  In 1965 they finally took down the copper-wire catenary, selling it for scrap like some sort of junkie.
But the FL-9s were not performing well. 
While the original EP electrics had 4,000 hp, the hybrid FL-9s were less than half that.  And that meant poor acceleration and longer travel time, especially on commuter trains making a lot of stops.  Longer trains that used to have one electric locomotive now required two or three FL-9s.  And on the steep Danbury line where it’s a 360-foot climb from the coast to The Hat City, keeping traction on slippery tracks is a problem even today in the fall and winter.
The FL-9s were also expensive to maintain and dirty, even before we cared about air pollution.  In cold weather the diesels had to be kept running all night, just idling in the yard (creating noise and air pollution).  Their 25-year life expectancy wasn’t impressive and overhauls were costly.
“It was a mistake to take down the wire [on the Danbury branch],” says Swanberg who has written extensively on the topic.  
Now the Connecticut Department of Transportation seems to have given up on re-wiring the line as we await delivery of shiny new unpowered railcars from Alstom (costing $5.25 million apiece) to be pulled by new hybrid locomotives costing about $15 million each.
Meantime, it’s back on the bus this summer.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/FL9-loco-credit-Scott-Hartley-1024x640.jpg,,,2025-07-27 04:56:49.721112

Zach Wahls, D-Coralville, mingled with attendees at an Iowa Farmers Union potluck in Elkhart July 26, 2025 as he spoke about his campaign for U.S. Senate. (Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Iowa Democrats looking to learn more about the candidates aiming to become the party’s U.S. Senate candidate gathered for an Iowa Farmers Union event Saturday, where Iowa Sen. Zach Wahls, D-Coralville, and Democrat Nathan Sage gave their pitches for why they could be the best choice to unite voters in the upcoming election.
Both Democrats are running as contenders to become the Democratic nominee for U.S. Senate in 2026 who will compete against the Republican candidate in the upcoming midterms. Speaking before at the potluck hosted by Iowa Farmers Union, a progressive organization focused on Iowa agriculture, the two candidates spoke about issues from air and water quality, food security and Medicaid cuts.
The U.S. Senate race in Iowa has been in the spotlight, in part, because of criticisms of incumbent U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst. The Iowa Republican’s response “well, we all are going to die,” at a May town hall to a person saying Medicaid cuts will cause people to die gained national attention. She has also received some flak from the right over her criticisms of U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth during the nomination process despite her ultimately voting to confirm him.
Ernst has not officially announced whether she plans to run for another term, and Politico reported Senate Majority Leader John Thune has said he is working to encourage her to run. She has hired a campaign manager and plans to hold her annual fundraiser, “Roast and Ride,” in October.
Both candidates made references to Ernst’s comments, with Sage, executive director of the Knoxville Chamber of Commerce, saying he starts every speech with “just saying I want everybody to here to live a long and prosperous life.”
Attendees at the gathering were largely Democrats, and people already looking for their choice to defeat the Republican nominee in 2026. Ardyth Gillespie, who has a farm near Atlantic, said while she believes all three of the Democrats running for the U.S. Senate seat would be better to have in the Senate than Ernst, she was most interested in seeing which candidate could build a coalition to win in the state where Republicans have seen overwhelming victories for many years. Iowa’s federal delegation is currently all Republican, and there is a GOP trifecta at the Statehouse.
Breaking that hold, and winning against Ernst, will require a candidate who can find ways to build “community,” including with people who may have previously supported Republicans or who are not involved in politics, Gillespie said.
“I think somebody that can bring people together — we really need that, really badly,” Gillespie said. “I haven’t figured out who’s going to do that, but that’s why we’re here.”
Wahls said in the time since launching his campaign, he has heard from Republicans and independents who have expressed frustrations with Ernst and Republicans in power in Congress. Democrats have to be willing to “extend an open hand” to these voters and ensure these voters will be able to support Democratic candidates, he said.
“Because I will tell you, the agenda that this administration is putting forward, and that Senator Ernst has been a complete rubber stamp for, it is uniquely bad for a state like Iowa, right?” Wahls said. “… But when you talk about things like the Medicaid cuts, the tariffs, the fact that you are now talking about this mass deportation scheme, you almost could not design a worse agenda for our state. And fundamentally, the job of being a U.S. senator is to say, you’re going to have your party politics — they always have to come second serving your constituents.”

Sage said he is coming into the race as someone who is not a seasoned politician, and can offer a perspective — and a disruption to politics as usual — that people of different political backgrounds can appreciate, as a veteran and business leader who grew up in poverty.
“I’m not your run-of-the-mill politician,” Sage said. “I don’t have one-liners. I’m not going to say things just to say them, I’m not going to talk about political rhetoric, I’m not going to joke around about things that are not funny to a lot of people. I’m here to fight. I fought in Iraq three fun-filled times. I stood up and did that. And right now, what I feel like, we have a lot of people in this world that need somebody to fight for them. They need somebody to look up and go, ‘This guy’s willing to do it.’ That’s what I’m trying to do.”
Cole Lindaman, who runs an urban agriculture business in Ames and works with the Story County Democrats, said he believes the budget reconciliation bill will also have a negative impact on farms because of the cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). He said earlier federal cuts to local foods programs for schools also negatively impact small agriculture producers in the state, in addition to harm to people receiving food benefits.
He said Ernst has been “selling out the state” and said he is looking for a candidate who can represent Iowans’ best interests in Congress — something he did not believe Ernst was doing.
Wahls said he disagreed with U.S. Rep. Angie Craig, D-Minnesota, who is the House Agriculture Committee ranking member, for comments on shutting down negotiations on the farm bill because of disagreements about SNAP and food assistance cuts.
“I understand that there’s frustration about how they decoupled SNAP, and those changes that were in the bill that they passed,” Wahls said. “However, I just  — anytime you’re not at the table, you’re on the menu. And so I’m just, I’m really concerned about the fact that Democrats have walked away from negotiations, but I think it’s clear that if we had a Democratic senator from Iowa who was serving on the Agriculture Committee, we’d get a real voice in that conversation. Because right now, really, we’re not getting it from Joni Ernst or Chuck Grassley.”
Bonnie Winslow-Garvin, a 69-year-old farmer from Belle Plaine, said she liked hearing from both Sage and Wahls — but that she wanted to hear more specific policy ideas, especially on how to improve Iowa’s air and water quality.
“I think there’s a lot of people coming out to run, and that’s fantastic, and I’m excited,” Winslow-Garvin said. “And it may be hard to pick the right candidate, the best candidate. So … I think as time goes on and they say more specific things, that I’ll be watching.”
Sage said he had a personal connection to the need to improve Iowa’s air and water quality, particularly as it potentially relates to rising cancer rates in the state, as both his parents died from cancer.
“I have a personal stake in this game,” Sage said. “I’m here to fight for Iowans. I’m here to fight for workers, here to fight for farmers.”
In the most recent Federal Election Commission campaign finance reports, Sage had raised the most in the Democratic field at $709,000 from April 1 through June 30. His haul was followed by Wahls with $656,000 and Iowa Rep. J.D. Scholten, R-Sioux City, with $175,000 in the same time period. Both Wahls and Scholten entered the race in June.
All three Democrats raised less than Ernst at almost $723,000 in the reporting period — though her fundraising fell behind her fundraising total from the same time period during the 2020 election season, leading to further speculation that she may not run for reelection.
Wahls noted there is “speculation” that Ernst may not run, but pointed out that if she does run again, she is breaking the commitment she made in 2014, while running for her first term in office, to only serve two terms. In the two terms since Ernst took office, Wahls said Iowa’s public schools have fallen behind, the state’s economy has suffered and air and water quality problems have gotten worse.
“Assuming that she does, in fact, move forward with a third term, what does she have to show for her 12 years in Washington, D.C., except from all the things that I just mentioned?” Wahls said. “It’s clear to me that Joni Ernst did not change Washington, D.C., Washington, D.C. changed Joni Ernst.”

We need to ensure our system is as strong and resilient as possible today, before federal government and market forces exert even more pressure tomorrow. 
The post The urgency of tackling health care affordability  appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","OUR STATE has a chance to make big changes in our health care system right now – the kind of transformation that can only come about in a crisis.  
There’s no question we’re in a critical moment. The new federal tax and spending bill is likely to pose extraordinary challenges to our hospitals, health plans, and ultimately, many of our neighbors in the Commonwealth who will need health care in the years to come.  
But our problems predate the legislation President Trump signed earlier this month.  
There has long been a chasm between government reimbursement for care and its actual costs – and that gap has long been filled by commercial plans like ours, with our employer customers and members picking up the tab. That structure is straining under recent unprecedented cost increases for drugs and medical care. 
Businesses are forced to make painful choices between investing productively in new hires, wage increases, new equipment — or sinking their funds into health insurance. 
A recent poll we commissioned found 40 percent of Massachusetts residents say they’ve delayed getting care due to the cost. Many say they’ve faced a choice between paying for medical care or housing, food, or gas. 
Hospitals are short-staffed, paying more for people, devices, medications – everything it takes to provide our state’s famously world-class care.  
Many not-for-profit health plans are experiencing unsustainable losses as they strain to cover rising costs for care. Last year, Blue Cross lost $400 million, the biggest loss in our history.  
There’s never been a greater need for us to work together and do things differently. There’s no better place, either. 
We have an excellent track record in our state of collaboration between health plans, clinicians, business, labor, and policymakers. 
Landmark health reform led to near-universal coverage here. And the value-based care model widely adopted in our state — largely replacing the old fee-for-service system — slowed cost increases, spurred innovation, and improved quality for many years. 
But that’s under threat now.  
So how do we build a more affordable system that can withstand old and new pressures?      

Enforce the state health care spending benchmark: It’s intended to protect consumers from unaffordable annual cost increases. But the benchmark, established as part of health care reform legislation in 2012, has been breached for so many years it’s been rendered nearly meaningless. Let’s strengthen our regulators’ enforcement capability with real penalties and performance improvement plans for health plans and health providers that exceed the benchmark.  


Control what we can. Private insurers don’t have to wait for state action. We can commit to keeping the average price increase we pay providers below the 3.6 percent state benchmark.  This month, my company notified providers in our network that we intend to do exactly that.  


Establish a pharmacy drug affordability board to review high-cost prescription drugs and set limits to how much the costs can grow. 


 Explore ways to live within a budget for health care services. Some states have had success setting price controls, including Rhode Island and Maryland. We may choose another route, but evaluating innovative options, with curiosity and transparency, can help catalyze meaningful change.  


Develop and require payment models that reward outcomes over volume to ensure patients are getting the right levels of care at the right time in the right setting. Value-based care has proven effective in primary care and offers potential in other areas as well.   


Expand independent lower-cost treatment options including primary care, urgent care, and ambulatory surgical centers to relieve the long wait times and overcrowded emergency rooms at our hospitals and doctors’ offices. 


Learn from the collapse of Steward Health Care to ensure for-profit health care organizations in our state enhance the quality of care and decrease the cost.  

In short: We need to ensure our system is as strong and resilient as possible today, before federal government and market forces exert even more pressure tomorrow. 
Building that system will take deep collaboration between our state’s hospitals, drug companies, not-for-profit health plans, policymakers, regulators, and employers.  
We can’t just ride out this storm. The headwinds are too strong. But we can come together to harness the power of this moment for meaningful change.

Kennedy Jr. at the National Governors Association in Colorado Springs on July 26, 2025. (Andrew Fraieli for Colorado Newsline)Governors from across the country played host to a variety of health conspiracy theories in Colorado Springs on Saturday, as Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. expounded on his “Make America Healthy Again” initiative in a fireside chat.
With Republican Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee moderating, Kennedy repeated a litany of false and misleading claims, including assertions that aluminum in vaccines causes food allergies and that diabetes can be cured through diet, to about a dozen governors gathered together for their National Governors Association summer meeting.
He also suggested the use of AI in telemedicine and said “fee-for-service medicine” gives doctors and insurance companies “the incentive to keep Americans sick.”

One initiative Kennedy elaborated on was the Department of Health and Human Services’ collection of Medicaid data from states with the intention of anonymizing it to create a public database for independent scientists to be able to study. He claimed that “the medical establishment and the government were not able to give good data to people” during COVID, in response to a question from Lee on how to measure the efficacy of federal and state approaches to public health.
As governor of Tennessee, Lee banned mask mandates during the pandemic and “touted Tennessee for being one of the last to close early in the pandemic and among the first to reopen,” according to the AP.
Kennedy was confirmed as President Donald Trump’s pick for the nation’s top health official in February despite a long history of false statements about vaccine safety, among other conspiracy theories. Throughout the panel he repeatedly referred to the country being in a “chronic disease epidemic,” going so far as to question whether the real reason the U.S. had a high COVID death rate — about 3,000 deaths per million, the 17th highest rate in the world — was due to chronic disease in America.
“So what was killing them?” he asked. “Was it COVID, or was it the chronic disease?”
Kennedy previously visited Utah lawmakers in April after they passed multiple bills aligning state law with MAHA initiatives, such as banning fluoride in water. In late June he visited Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry, a Republican, as he signed a bill claiming processed foods are “poisoning” children.
With this summer meeting, Kennedy was able to pitch his MAHA agenda to Democratic governors as well, including Gov. Jared Polis, who asked why nothing has changed in treating allergies that are well-known, such as peanut allergies.
Kennedy claimed that it is not known why peanut allergies develop, and repeated his false claims that aluminum in vaccines are causing allergies, specifically targeting the Hepatitis B vaccine in the meeting. In reality, some vaccines contain aluminum salts that help bolster immune responses.
Polis cheered Kennedy’s appointment in a a November social media post, saying that he was “excited” by Trump’s pick for health secretary.
“He helped us defeat vaccine mandates in Colorado in 2019 and will help make America healthy again by shaking up HHS and FDA,” Polis said at the time. “I hope he leans into personal choice on vaccines rather than bans (which I think are terrible, just like mandates).”
As health secretary, Kenedy has scrutinized children’s vaccine schedules in a May report without evidence, ousted the entire scientific committee that advised the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on vaccine use, and most recently, rescinded federal approval for a flu vaccine with a specific preservative that vaccine skeptics have falsely linked to autism.
Polis is currently chair of the NGA, a bipartisan public policy organization made up of governors across the country that formed in 1908. According to their website, they help challenge and shape federal policy across party lines.

(Photo courtesy Kyle Roerink)Water in Lake Mead is on course to fall to the lowest level in recorded history by 2027, according to a recent forecast by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation.
Water levels in the reservoir have steadily dropped over the years as the Colorado River – the lake’s biggest source of water – has been choked by rising temperatures, prolonged drought and growing demand.
If reservoir storage continues on its current trajectory, Lake Mead’s water elevation is likely to drop to about 1,038 feet by the end of June 2027 – two feet lower than when it fell to a record low in July 2022, according to a two year forecast released by the federal agency last week.
That projection is based on the most probable scenario, but federal water managers also considered what the lake could look like if the next two years are drier than usual.
In the worst case scenario, Lake Mead’s water elevation could fall even further to about 1,026 feet – one foot short of the most severe water shortage level defined by BuRec which would trigger record cuts to water use in Arizona and Nevada.
Lake Mead is already under a Tier 1 shortage – the least severe level – which mandates a 21,000 acre-feet annual reduction in the state’s share of the Colorado River. That shortage level, and the reduction in Nevada’s water allocation, is likely to continue next year under current projections.

But steeper water cuts are likely to take place in 2027 under the most probable scenario, according to the study.
Federal water managers projected Lake Mead’s elevation would likely drop to below 1,050 feet by July 2026, triggering a more severe Tier 2 shortage which would reduce annual available water for Nevada by another 4,000 acre-feet.
Federal water managers decide shortage levels each year in August, based on projected water levels at Lake Mead and Lake Powell for the start of the following year.
The troubling projections come as the seven states that share the Colorado River’s water are in deadlocked negotiations over how the river and its reservoirs should be managed after current guidelines expire at the end of 2026.
The states — Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming — primarily disagree over which of them should have to decrease their water use, and by how much.
‘Uncertainty is difficult to plan around’
Negotiations have continued behind closed doors for months as water officials try to reach an agreement.
The federal government has given the states until mid-November to come up with a draft for a new plan. If they can’t reach a deal ahead of a 2026 deadline, the federal government can step in and make those decisions itself.
The lackluster reservoir forecast follows a winter of below-average snowpack across the Upper Colorado River Basin, a major source of snowmelt for Lake Mead and Lake Powell.
Climate scientists studying water supply on the Colorado River were not surprised by the latest projections, which reflect a two decade trend of decreasing streamflow into the river and its reservoirs.
“I’ve been warning about this situation since last fall. The worst has come true,” said Utah State University professor Jack Schmidt.
Without an effort to seriously recover water storage in Lake Mead and Lake Powell in order to withstand dry years, the river could be on the “brink of crisis,” said Schmidt.
Severe drought causing Utah reservoir levels to drop at ‘concerning’ rate

Schmidt said reservoir storage across the Colorado River will only gain a fraction of the water collected in previous years due to below-average snowpack and warmer temperatures.
This year snowmelt inflow to Lake Powell is predicted to be about half of average, one of the lowest inflow years in the past two decades. Lake Powell’s water levels directly affect Lake Mead because streamflow to Lake Powell is eventually released to Lake Mead.
“We’ve got the onset of an extremely dry year, and we’re on the brink of collapsing the system,” Schmidt said.
Two consecutive winters with robust snowpacks in 2023 and 2024 gave states that rely on the Colorado River a few more years of stability, but with a dismal water year approaching Lake Mead and Lake Powell are on a path to record low elevations.
“We’ve done a poor job since then and never significantly recovered storage,” Schmidt said.
Schmidt emphasized the need for immediate water conservation efforts to reduce water use across all seven states that rely on the river to protect the river and its reservoirs from collapse.
“The system we have is not good enough, and it’s not working, so this is a warning that we need to become far more flexible and far more adaptable,” he said.
Despite drought challenges, Southern Nevada remains one of the most water-secure areas along the Colorado River.
Southern Nevada hasn’t used its full allocation of Colorado River water for years. Conservation efforts have helped Southern Nevada use 36% less water from Lake Mead than it did two decades ago, according to the Southern Nevada Water Authority (SNWA).
The water authority also said it’s confident Southern Nevada can weather even the most severe water shortage, Tier 3, which would require Nevada to give up enough water to supply about 60,000 households for a year.
Bronson Mack, the outreach manager for SNWA, said Lake Mead’s water levels over the next two years will depend significantly on winter snowpack and soil conditions in the Upper Colorado River Basin.
“The potential for historically low lake levels is what catalyzed our community’s adaptation toward using less water more efficiently,” Mack said.
“Water conservation continues to be critical throughout the Colorado River Basin, and the Bureau of Reclamation’s most recent 24-month study further emphasizes that,” he continued.
Still, the lack of agreement between states on future guidelines has also created a lot of uncertainty for water users, said Kathryn Sorensen, the director of research at the Kyl Center for Water Policy at Arizona State University.
“There’s a total unknown still about what happens after the current shortage sharing guidelines expire, and what will be the new operating guidelines. There’s a lot of uncertainty, and uncertainty is difficult to plan around,” Sorensen said.
Sorensen said record low water elevations at Lake Mead and Lake Powell are “the new normal,” adding that water utilities should prepare for a future where the most severe water shortage level is more and more common while communicating risks to customers.
“This latest 24-month study report is not good news, but it is what many have been warning about. The river is just producing less on average,” Sorensen said.

In the second image, a younger Duncan is pictured with his parents, Sharon and Bennie. (Kathleen Flynn for ProPublica)Longtime death row prisoner Jimmie Duncan, whose 27-year-old murder conviction was vacated this spring, will have to wait a few more days to find out if he will be able to walk out of the Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola. After a three-day hearing on whether to release Duncan, a Ouachita Parish judge said Thursday that he will not rule until Monday at the earliest.
In April, Judge Alvin Sharp set aside Duncan’s 1998 conviction for murdering 23-month-old Haley Oliveaux, his then-girlfriend’s daughter. Sharp agreed with Duncan’s attorneys that an analysis performed on the girl that purported to match marks on her body to Duncan’s teeth — a key piece of evidence in the trial — was based on discredited science.
As ProPublica and Verite News reported in March, the effort to secure Duncan’s freedom has become more urgent in recent months due to a renewed push by Gov. Jeff Landry to restart executions in the state following a decade-plus pause.
Attorney Scott Greene, who is part of Duncan’s legal team, said during the hearing that Duncan has “enormous support” from his family, the community and Haley’s mother, Allison Layton Statham. Now that his conviction has been vacated, Greene argued, Duncan should be freed on bail pending another trial.
This week’s hearing on that request began Tuesday and continued until Thursday afternoon. It descended into chaos on Wednesday as prosecutors grilled Statham, who supports Duncan’s release.
At one point during a tense back-and-forth with Ouachita Parish Assistant District Attorney Michael Ruddick, Statham asked what became of Dr. Steven Hayne. Hayne, who died in 2020, was half of the team that was responsible for the bite mark analysis. Ruddick replied that Hayne was in the same place as her daughter — “six feet under the ground,” drawing shouts of outrage from the audience.
The Ouachita DA’s office maintains that Duncan is guilty of raping and murdering Haley in 1993. The office has appealed the April ruling setting aside Duncan’s conviction. Ruddick urged Sharp to keep Duncan locked up pending the outcome of the appeal. Prosecutors have argued that Duncan is “a safety risk to not only the victim’s family, but also the general public.” Early in the hearing, Ruddick unsuccessfully moved for Sharp to recuse himself, arguing that his earlier ruling nullifying Duncan’s conviction made him biased and unfit to decide whether or not to grant him bail.
He’s on Louisiana’s death row, his attorneys say, for a crime that didn’t happen

Duncan’s attorneys, however, cast him as a law-abiding man who had been railroaded by the legal system. Prior to his now-vacated murder conviction, Duncan had never previously been convicted of a crime, noted attorney Chris Fabricant with the Innocence Project. What’s more, Fabricant said, the child’s family, including her mother, support Duncan’s release.
In an interview published earlier this month, Statham told Mississippi Today that she believes Duncan “was falsely accused of a crime he didn’t commit.”
“I loved him,” Statham said from the stand.
‘Not scientifically defensible’
Duncan was babysitting Haley in West Monroe on Dec. 18, 1993 when, he said, he heard a noise coming from the bathroom, where the toddler was taking a bath. When he went to check on her, he found her floating face down in the water. She was pronounced dead a few hours later.
Hayne, a pathologist who worked on hundreds of criminal cases in Mississippi and Louisiana over his decades-long career, conducted Haley’s medical exam. He claimed he found evidence that she was sexually assaulted and intentionally drowned.
He also claimed to find bite marks on the girl. Michael West, a forensic dentist who worked with Hayne in a number of cases in the 1990s and early 2000s, analyzed the marks and found that they were a match for Duncan’s teeth.
Based in part on those findings, Duncan was charged with first-degree murder. After about two weeks of testimony in 1998, the jury found Duncan guilty and sentenced him to death.
But a team of post-conviction attorneys later uncovered evidence that, they say, proves his innocence.
Judge nullifies Louisiana death row inmate’s murder conviction based on junk science

The most effective arguments concerned Hayne and West’s bite mark evidence. The type of analysis West performed — matching a suspect’s teeth to purported bite marks — while frequently used in criminal cases at the time of Duncan’s trial, has since been widely discredited and dismissed by experts as “junk science.”
Duncan’s attorneys also questioned whether the supposed “bite marks” were even bite marks at all. In a video of West’s 1993 examination of Haley — which was not shown to jurors at the trial — West can be seen taking a mold of Duncan’s teeth and grinding it into the girl’s body. (West has previously said he was simply using what he called a “direct comparison” technique — in which he presses a mold of a person’s teeth directly onto the location of suspected bite marks.)
In his April ruling vacating Duncan’s conviction, Sharp said the work Hayne and West did on Duncan’s case was “no longer valid” and “not scientifically defensible.”
Robert Tew, district attorney for Ouachita and Morehouse parishes, argued in a June 16 filing that bite mark evidence was an accepted science at the time of Duncan’s trial and that some experts still consider it to be a useful forensic methodology. He also noted that Hayne, who died in 2020, served as the pathologist for the district for over a decade and during that time “there has been no cases overturned because of Dr. Hayne’s autopsy.”
Over the past 27 years, nine prisoners have been set free after being convicted in part on inaccurate evidence given by West and Hayne. Seven of those convictions had involved bite mark identification analysis, a discipline that has been called into question. And three of the freed men had been sentenced to die.
‘My daughter is in heaven’
Throughout the hearing, the small courtroom was filled with Duncan’s supporters, including family members, a community pastor and Sen. Katrina Jackson, D-Monroe, who said she came to support Duncan’s release on bail. Also in the court was Detective Chris Sasser, who originally investigated the case in 1993.
Duncan was brought into court this week with his feet shackled, a chain around his waist connected to a pair of handcuffs that kept his wrists flush to his stomach. He wore an orange prison jumpsuit that was faded yellow in various spots. The sides of his head were shaved and his dark, dreadlocked hair pulled back into a ponytail.
Duncan’s attorneys made the case that he was not a danger to the public. They told the court that Duncan had never been arrested prior to 1993, that he didn’t have a history of violence, and that he had a clean disciplinary history in prison for more than 20 years. They also read a letter of support from a death row corrections officer, and noted that Duncan tutored his fellow death row inmates, helping at least 17 achieve their GEDs.
Fabricant argued that the state’s odds of convincing a jury a second time that Duncan is guilty are basically nonexistent given the new evidence, science and testimony they would be able to produce that was not available or allowed at the first trial.
Along with insisting that Duncan is guilty of murder and therefore a danger to the public, Ruddick also argued that Landry’s recent push to restart executions in the state could turn Duncan into a flight risk. If state appeals court judges side with the DA’s office and overturn Sharp’s April order vacating Duncan’s conviction, Ruddick said, then Duncan, fearing his execution is imminent, might flee.
“I’m gone,” Ruddick said, imagining what Duncan would be thinking.
Tension in the courtroom boiled over Wednesday when Ruddick called on Haley’s mother to testify. Statham had stepped out of the courtroom that afternoon as she was growing increasingly agitated.
Sharp sent several deputies outside to bring her back. Statham was visibly upset as they walked her through the hallway back into the courtroom, loudly complaining that Ruddick only wanted her to testify so he could harass her. Statham took the stand as five deputies positioned themselves in front of the door and on either side of the bench.
Staring directly at Ruddick, Statham said she has waited 30 years to look him in the eye and tell him that her daughter wasn’t killed. Haley was sick and died in a tragic accident, she said, and the DA’s office lied to make it look like murder.
She then brought up Hayne, the pathologist from Mississippi, saying it was wrong for the district attorney to bring in a doctor with such a questionable history to conduct her daughter’s autopsy.
“Where is he now?” she asked Ruddick, referring to Hayne, who died in 2020.
“He’s in the same place your daughter is,” Ruddick snapped back, “six feet under the ground.”
The audience erupted. People shouted at Ruddick while others gasped in shock. Statham stood and yelled at Ruddick that he was “sick” and that his lies have caused her family and Duncan’s nothing but pain and misery for decades.
Then she said of Hayne: “He’s in hell for what he did. My daughter is in heaven.”
Throughout Statham’s testimony, Duncan wept as his attorneys attempted to console him.
Tew’s office did not respond to requests for comment.
The next day in court, Ruddick apologized to the judge, the defense team, and those in the audience who witnessed his interaction with Statham. When prompted by Sharp, he also apologized specifically to Statham.
Closing the hearing on Thursday, Sharp gave both the prosecution and defense until 10 p.m. Sunday to submit any additional materials before he renders a decision.

(Photo courtesy U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement)Throughout his 2024 campaign to return to the White House, President Donald Trump promised to implement the “largest deportation program” in the nation’s history.
And since he assumed office on Jan. 20, that promise has not only led to a surge in Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrests, it’s shifted the agency’s tactics as well.
New data shows that Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrests have more than doubled since the beginning of the second Trump administration. ICE made 1,736 arrests this year in Maryland — 1,683 since Trump’s Jan. 20 inauguration — through June 26, according to data compiled by the Deportation Data Project, a research team based in Berkeley, California.
That’s an average of about 9.8 arrests per day in Maryland in 2025. For comparison, there were 1,343 arrests in Maryland throughout all of 2024, for an average of about 3.7 arrests per day.
Cori Alonso-Yoder, a professor at the University of Maryland Carey School of Law and director of its Immigration Clinic, said the rise in immigration arrest is “a political message,” and part of a larger trend to punish states that aren’t in political alignment with the administration.
“The underlying mechanisms have been there, predating the election, and certainly predating the second Trump administration,” she said. “But what we’re seeing is sort of them being pushed to their ultimate limit.”

The increase in ICE activity in the state has led to several high-profile incidents in Maryland over the last six months, including that of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was arrested by ICE agents in Baltimore on March 12 and wrongfully deported to El Salvador due to what the Trump administration called an “administrative error.”
Abrego Garcia was deported to El Salvador’s Terrorism Confinement Center three days later, despite having a previous court order from an immigration judge protecting him from deportation to the country due to his risk of persecution if returned to El Salvador. He has since been returned to the U.S. to face human smuggling charges, and is currently being held in Tennessee.
And on Monday, Daniel Fuentes Espinal, a local pastor described as a pillar of his Talbot County community, was stopped and arrested by ICE while on his way to work. Fuentes Espinal was born in Honduras, and entered the U.S. illegally after fleeing from violence in the country in 2001. He has no criminal record.
After initially being held in a facility in Baltimore, he was transferred and is now being held in Louisiana.
Several Maryland leaders, such as Rep. Glenn Ivey (D-4th), have criticized these new tactics and the impact they have on immigrant communities.
“It is shocking that the Trump Administration is now targeting churches and other places of worship for ICE raids,” Ivey wrote in a statement in January. “The risk of racial profiling makes this unconscionable defiance of basic constitutional protections even worse.”
But others, like House Freedom Caucus Chair Rep. Andy Harris (R-1st), have praised ICE for its increase in arrests.
“Criminal illegal aliens don’t belong in our communities. They belong in custody — and out of this country,” Harris wrote in a post on X earlier this month.
While Trump has said the deportations will target criminals, 40% of those who have been detained by ICE had no criminal record. About 45% detained had been convicted of a crime, while another 15% had criminal charges pending, according to ICE. 
Eastern Shore pastor detained by ICE transferred to Louisiana facility

ICE did not reply to multiple requests for comment.
Eric Lopez, deputy program director at the Amica Center for Immigrant Rights, which provides legal services for immigrants facing detention or deportation, said ICE has become “incredibly aggressive” in its tactics.
“What we’re seeing is an escalation in not just the number of arrests that are happening, but also an escalation in terms of who’s being detained, who’s being arrested, what practices are being used to arrest people,” Lopez said.
Lopez said that many of the people that the Amica Center has worked with have been arrested while going to work or attending regular ICE check-ins. The range of people getting arrested varies drastically, he added.
“People who have never had any contact with the criminal system, not even minor infractions,” he said. “We’re seeing high school students being arrested and transferred out of state. We’re seeing parents who’ve been here for decades, who have no prior contact with law enforcement, arrested and transferred out of state.”
Alonso-Yoder said the impacts of these daily arrests will last for generations.
“Families who are separated today, they are going to be feeling that separation for generations to come,” she said.
Alonso-Yoder emphasized “how flimsy this concept of doing immigration the ‘right way.’”
“Doing it legally has just been utterly upended,” she said, noting people who went through legal processes, like Abrego Garcia, or those waiting through the asylum process continue to get arrested.
“The administration has really obfuscated and confused what it means to be a criminal alien,” she said. “I think what we’re just really seeing is that there is not this massive group of criminals in the United States who were not supposed to be here.”

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)If you’ve ever suffered from that nagging feeling that the Legislature is systematically trying to undermine your right to petition something onto the ballot, you’re not alone. I’ve had it, too.
We need to start trusting that gut feeling. It turns out we weren’t wrong. That’s exactly what the Republican majority in the Legislature has been trying to do. It has just been proven by three authors of a South Dakota Law Review article: “Have Recent Legislative Changes in South Dakota Made Using the Initiated Measure Process More Difficult?”
It seems the answer to the question in the title of the article is yes, and how.
South Dakota’s legacy of citizen ballot questions is under threat, law review authors warn

You can find the article on the Law Review’s website. Be warned: at 40-some pages, it’s not an easy read. There are footnotes strewn about and readers may struggle with some of the world’s ugliest charts. However it still tells a compelling tale of how, since 2017, the Republican super-majority in the Legislature has been whittling away at the rights of citizens to petition measures onto the ballot.
Republicans may scoff at the article as so much whining from the left as two of the authors are well-known Democrats: activist Cory Heidelberger and former State Sen. Reynold Nesiba. While a Republican byline would have been nice for the sake of balance, there’s no disputing the truth of the facts they have compiled. These bills were filed and are there for anyone to look up.
Their paper gets particularly interesting when it goes about listing the Legislature’s 14 worst bills designed to cut back the rights of citizens to petition an initiative onto the ballot. Those range from insisting on a larger font size on petitions to make them unwieldy, to allowing petition signers to later withdraw their names after the petition has been submitted, and a couple of attempts to raise the vote total needed for passage of the initiative beyond a simple majority.
Some of these attacks on our rights were defeated at the ballot box; some were challenged in court where they fell short of being entirely constitutional. Sadly, some were enacted into law. At least now, through the work of the article’s authors, the grim history of the war on ballot initiatives in South Dakota is summed up in one place.
Unfortunately, while that history has been chronicled, the siege still continues. The authors go on to mention seven petition-related bills and five constitutional amendments submitted in the 2025 legislative session, 10 of which, they say, sought to curtail the rights of citizens to initiate ballot measures.
When legislators want to amend the state constitution themselves, they have to convince a majority of their colleagues to send the amendment to voters. This legislative quest to get on the 2026 ballot through constitutional amendments comes from the same party that tries to curtail voter access to the petition process by claiming that voters have ballot fatigue with so many issues to decide on Election Day. This ignores the fact that in each case, more than 17,000 South Dakotans applied their signatures to petitions, a sure sign that there are plenty of people who think the ballot issue is something that should go before voters.










At least now, through the work of the article’s authors, the grim history of the war on ballot initiatives in South Dakota is summed up in one place.


This years-long attempt to curtail the initiative process is nothing more than a means for the Republican super-majority to solidify its power by cutting off people they don’t agree with from access to the ballot. Republican efforts aren’t trying to make the process better or more secure. They’re just tired of beating back attempts to legalize marijuana and abortion.
The irony here is that in the Statehouse, no piece of legislation is ever blocked. Sure, there may be some arm-twisting that could lead to a bill being tabled or withdrawn, but each bill is handled in the light of day. These same Republicans who are so upright and transparent with legislation are working overtime to have darkness descend on the ballot box.
Their attempts to slow or stop citizen access to the ballot initiative process is a sign of the power that citizens wield. The recent law journal article has proven that this notion that our rights are under attack is more than just a gut feeling. We now have a historic record that spells out the way Republicans have been trying to take away the power of citizens to petition their government.

(Photo courtesy Fuentes Espinal family)An Eastern Shore pastor who was arrested by immigration agents Monday and taken to Baltimore for processing is in good spirits and is preaching to fellow detainees — but that preaching is now being done at a detention center in Louisiana.
Daniel Fuentes Espinal, an undocumented immigrant from Honduras with no criminal record, was transferred Thursday from Baltimore to the Winn Correctional Center outside New Orleans, a family friend said Friday.
“He’s a remarkably resilient man, and for all of the trauma that he has been subjected to and the stress that’s been inflicted upon him and on his family, he is upbeat and his spirits are good,” said Len Foxwell, speaking for the family.
Fuentes Espinal’s daughter, Clarissa Fuentes Diaz, had been speaking for the family earlier this week, but is now declining interviews for fear of retaliation, Foxwell said.
Fuentes Diaz spoke to her father Thursday before his transfer. Foxwell said. He said Fuentes Espinal’s attorney filed a motion for a bond hearing, which was approved and will take place next week.
Fuentes Espinal, his wife and daughter fled violence in their native Honduras in 2001, when Clarissa was 8 years old, and eventually came to the Eastern Shore where they put down roots and where two more children were born.
Beloved Talbot County pastor picked up in dragnet of ICE arrests

Since 2015, Fuentes Espinal has been pastor of Jesus Te Ama Iglesia del Nazareno [Jesus Loves You Church of the Nazarene] in Easton — an unpaid position. He works in construction to pay the family’s bills.
Fuentes Espinal had gone to a hardware store for construction materials for his job on Monday and was on his way to work when he was stopped by unidentified agents and arrested on immigration charges and taken to Baltimore. The family only learned of his whereabouts when he called later that night, as the family was about to file a missing persons report, his daughter said earlier this week.
Fuentes Diaz recently learned that she had been approved for U.S. citizenship, after a 16-year wait, and said both parents had been working to get documentation. “I was going to help my dad and mom get their papers straight,” but that was before her father was arrested, she said earlier this week.
His arrest comes amid a surge in immigration detentions, part of President Donald Trump’s campaign pledge to enact mass deportations if reelected. The pressure to make arrests has led to Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents frequenting areas where day-laborers gather, raiding businesses and sites that had previously been off-limits, like courthouses — and, according to critics, engaging in racial profiling to stop people simply for looking Hispanic.
In Maryland, immigration arrests jumped from about 3.7 per day in 2024 to 9.8 per day since Trump’s inauguration on Jan. 20, according to data from the Deportation Data Project.
While Trump and Department of Homeland Security officials have said their immigration enforcement actions are aimed at removing the “worst of the worst” undocumented criminals in the U.S., only 45% of those arrested this year have criminal convictions and 40%, like Fuentes Espinal, have no criminal charges.

Fuentes Espinal’s case has drawn extensive media coverage as well as the attention of immigration advocates and members of Maryland’s congressional delegation. Foxwell said a gofundme page he set up for the family quickly surpassed its original goal of raising $15,000, and then a second goal of $25,000. As of Friday, it was inching toward a new goal of $40,000, which he said will come in handy if the Fuentes Espinal has to travel to Louisiana.
In the meantime, Fuentes Espinal remains upbeat and is trying to console his family, Foxwell said Friday.
“His exact words to his daughter were: ‘This must be God’s plan,’” Foxwell said.
Fuentes Espinal said he has been ministering to his fellow detainees, both in Baltimore and in Louisiana, Foxwell said. 
“A preacher is going to preach, and he doesn’t necessarily need a church to talk about the grace of God,” Foxwell said. 
Fuentes Diaz told Foxwell that her father said he’s aware of the coverage his case has attracted, and he is grateful.
“He is a true man of faith who embodies the teachings of Christ each and every day of his life,” Foxwell said. “He is remaining upbeat and resilient under a set of circumstances that would break most other people.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2.-IMG_2263-cropped-e1753504625106.jpg,,,2025-07-26 10:56:17.780640

But as his administration pares back federal rules and programs designed to protect patients from the high cost of health care, Trump risks pushing more Americans into debt, further straining family budgets already stressed by medical bills.
Millions of people are expected to lose health insurance in the coming years as a result of the tax cut legislation Trump signed this month, leaving them with fewer protections from large bills if they get sick or suffer an accident.
At the same time, significant increases in health plan premiums on state insurance marketplaces next year will likely push more Americans to either drop coverage or switch to higher-deductible plans that will require them to pay more out-of-pocket before their insurance kicks in.
Smaller changes to federal rules are poised to bump up patients’ bills, as well. New federal guidelines for covid-19 vaccines, for example, will allow health insurers to stop covering the shots for millions, so if patients want the protection, some may have to pay out-of-pocket.
The new tax cut legislation will also raise the cost of certain doctor visits, requiring copays of up to $35 for some Medicaid enrollees.
And for those who do end up in debt, there will be fewer protections. This month, the Trump administration secured permission from a federal court to roll back regulations that would have removed medical debt from consumer credit reports.
That puts Americans who cannot pay their medical bills at risk of lower credit scores, hindering their ability to get a loan or forcing them to pay higher interest rates.
“For tens of millions of Americans, balancing the budget is like walking a tightrope,” said Chi Chi Wu, a staff attorney at the National Consumer Law Center. “The Trump administration is just throwing them off.”

White House spokesperson Kush Desai did not respond to questions about how the administration’s health care policies will affect Americans’ medical bills.
The president and his Republican congressional allies have brushed off the health care cuts, including hundreds of billions of dollars in Medicaid retrenchment in the mammoth tax law. “You won’t even notice it,” Trump said at the White House after the bill signing July 4. “Just waste, fraud, and abuse.”
But consumer and patient advocates around the country warn that the erosion of federal health care protections since Trump took office in January threatens to significantly undermine Americans’ financial security.
“These changes will hit our communities hard,” said Arika Sánchez, who oversees health care policy at the nonprofit New Mexico Center on Law and Poverty.
Sánchez predicted many more people the center works with will end up with medical debt. “When families get stuck with medical debt, it hurts their credit scores, makes it harder to get a car, a home, or even a job,” she said. “Medical debt wrecks people’s lives.”

For Americans with serious illnesses such as cancer, weakened federal protections from medical debt pose yet one more risk, said Elizabeth Darnall, senior director of federal advocacy at the American Cancer Society’s Cancer Action Network. “People will not seek out the treatment they need,” she said.
Trump promised a rosier future while campaigning last year, pledging to “make America affordable again” and “expand access to new Affordable Healthcare.”
Polls suggest voters were looking for relief.
About 6 in 10 adults — Democrats and Republicans — say they are worried about being able to afford health care, according to one recent survey, outpacing concerns about the cost of food or housing. And medical debt remains a widespread problem: As many as 100 million adults in the U.S. are burdened by some kind of health care debt.
Despite this, key tools that have helped prevent even more Americans from sinking into debt are now on the chopping block.
Medicaid and other government health insurance programs, in particular, have proved to be a powerful economic backstop for low-income patients and their families, said Kyle Caswell, an economist at the Urban Institute, a think tank in Washington, D.C.
Caswell and other researchers found, for example, that Medicaid expansion made possible by the 2010 Affordable Care Act led to measurable declines in medical debt and improvements in consumers’ credit scores in states that implemented the expansion.
“We’ve seen that these programs have a meaningful impact on people’s financial well-being,” Caswell said.
Trump’s tax law — which will slash more than $1 trillion in federal health spending over the next decade, mostly through Medicaid cuts — is expected to leave 10 million more people without health coverage by 2034, according to the latest estimates from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The tax cuts, which primarily benefit wealthy Americans, will add $3.4 trillion to U.S. deficits over a decade, the office calculated.
The number of uninsured could spike further if Trump and his congressional allies don’t renew additional federal subsidies for low- and moderate-income Americans who buy health coverage on state insurance marketplaces.
This aid — enacted under former President Joe Biden — lowers insurance premiums and reduces medical bills enrollees face when they go to the doctor or the hospital. But unless congressional Republicans act, those subsidies will expire later this year, leaving many with bigger bills.
Federal debt regulations developed by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau under the Biden administration would have protected these people and others if they couldn’t pay their medical bills.
The agency issued rules in January that would have removed medical debts from consumer credit reports. That would have helped an estimated 15 million people.
But the Trump administration chose not to defend the new regulations when they were challenged in court by debt collectors and the credit bureaus, who argued the federal agency had exceeded its authority in issuing the rules. A federal judge in Texas appointed by Trump ruled that the regulation should be scrapped.

(Photo by Bruce Bennett/Getty Images)More than 63 million Americans are caregivers for a family member with complex medical needs, a 20 million increase over the past decade, according to a new report.
But state policies, workplaces and the American health system haven’t kept up with this surge in family caregiving responsibilities, said Dr. Myechia Minter-Jordan, a physician and the CEO of the AARP, which released the report with the National Alliance for Caregiving, a nonprofit policy and research organization.
“Nearly half of caregivers say they face major financial consequences, draining savings, falling into debt or struggling to afford basic needs like food and housing,” Minter-Jordan told reporters on a call this week.
One of the biggest reasons for the surge in family caregivers is that Americans are living longer, yet they’re not necessarily healthier. There’s a 12-year gap between the average number of years that Americans live and the number of years they’re healthy.

The caregiving role typically involves helping a family member with daily tasks like bathing, dressing and eating. But more than half of caregivers also perform more complex medical tasks, such as managing catheters or administering injections, the report found.
A growing number of caregivers are so-called “sandwich caregivers” — parents caring for their children as well as for an adult family member, such as an aging parent. About 17 million people are sandwich caregivers, compared with 11 million a decade ago. And most caregivers are also working a job.
And while the bulk of caregiving still falls on women, 40% of American caregivers are men.
Some states have heeded the growing calls for action.
Earlier this year, Maine lawmakers created a state program to provide respite care, which includes services such as adult day care that give family caregivers a temporary break.
Also this year, Tennessee extended its pilot program that provides respite care for Alzheimer’s and dementia patients, and also passed a bipartisan bill that directs the state Medicaid program to develop guidelines to allow family caregivers to be paid for their work.
Last year, Nebraska passed a tax credit for family caregivers; Oklahoma passed a similar law the year before. And while the United States is one of few countries that doesn’t mandate paid family leave at the federal level, 13 states and the District of Columbia have established their own paid family leave rules.
Meanwhile, the historic cuts to Medicaid enacted as part of the GOP’s Big, Beautiful Bill Act will shift health costs to states, leaving experts worried that family caregivers could lose Medicaid-funded services they rely on.

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Gov. Mike Dunleavy allowed three bills to become law this week without his signature, creating two fishing-related laws and one that updates the rules governing accountants in the state.
Under the Alaska constitution, a governor may sign a bill into law, veto it, or allow it to become law by taking no action on it after it is transmitted to him by the Legislature.
House Bill 31, from Rep. Louise Stutes, R-Kodiak, eliminates a state law that required fishing boats to register with the Alaska Division of Motor Vehicles every three years. Now, any boat that’s actively in use fishing and registered with the Commercial Fisheries Entry Commission and the U.S. Coast Guard will not have to also register with the DMV.
In a written statement, Stutes said the DMV registration — passed by the Legislature in 2018 — turned out to be excessive, particularly in rural Alaska.
“A lot of these communities don’t even have a DMV. Alaska’s commercial fishing industry is facing historically challenging times, and I’m glad we could implement this small step to make getting started for the year a little easier,” she said in the statement.
The second fishing-related bill was House Bill 116, which allows commercial fishing cooperatives to act like insurance without being regulated like insurance.
In some cases, fishing boat owners create pools of money to act as insurance funds to pay liability and damage claims themselves, bypassing the high rates charged by insurance companies.
Three pools already exist in Alaska but are organized under Washington state law because Alaska did not permit them. The new law enables pools under Alaska law, encouraging a cheaper alternative to traditional insurance.
House Bill 121, which also became law this week, lowers the training requirement for new accountants if they can substitute experience for classroom time. It also aligns some state accounting laws with model legislation used in other states.
