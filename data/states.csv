Where are the 92 percent?
That has been a persistent question since the presidential election, referring to the Black women who overwhelmingly organized and voted for Kamala Harris and then seemingly went dark after November 5. For many of them — who have largely rejected Donald Trump in his three campaigns for president — Harris’ loss felt like a betrayal, and another signal of disrespect from a democracy they have long worked hard to shape.
In the early days of the Trump administration, there have been feelings of anger, resolve, resignation and exhaustion among Black women and many other Americans frustrated with the president’s actions and the current political climate. Earlier this month, millions of protesters took to the streets in cities across the country to make their voices heard as Trump and ally Elon Musk have sought to dramatically remake the federal government, with consequences for real Americans.
The crowds were overwhelmingly White, not the typical makeup of other recent protest movements. Many of the Black women who have been among the leaders of such movements in the past decade, were noticeably — and intentionally — absent.
The Black women I talk to said they are being strategic, pragmatic and creative about what their resistance looks like now, preparing for a long fight ahead, and rejecting narratives that suggest their lack of visibility in this moment translates into inaction.
“People are paying more attention to what Black women are doing because of the impact we had in the election,” said Janai Nelson, president of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. “We pointed people in the right direction and they did not follow. We may be out of sight to some people, but we’re not checked out by any stretch. The crisis in America is certainly not out of our minds.”

Within weeks of the election, a meme began to circulate of a group of Black women sitting on the roof of a building, sipping their beverages and watching the country burn. The message: Black women would do nothing to help if the democracy they’d tried to save went up in flames.
This month, another image quickly gained traction during the “Hands Off” protests: a photograph of White marchers filing past a restaurant while Black people having brunch looked on, unbothered.
While the idea that Black women deserve rest is showing up in organic social media content, it’s also part of a campaign of misinformation, said Esosa Osa, founder of Onyx Impact, a nonprofit dedicated to researching Black online communities and fighting harmful information that targets Black voters. Emphasizing Black women talking about rest can discourage others in this key Democratic voting bloc from engaging civically.
“We are seeing bad actors trying to influence and suppress Black engagement in a really targeted and hostile way,” Osa said. “We should be cautious of any narrative that’s just, ‘Black women won’t turn out or won’t engage civically.’  Those are the types of narratives that folks working against Black power would want to uplift and amplify. Just because you don’t see your Black friend at a protest doesn’t mean we’re not working or being strategic.”
A lot of that strategy is happening behind the scenes, said Kimberlé Crenshaw, who coined the term “intersectionality” and is a leading legal and civil rights scholar at UCLA and Columbia Law School. Crenshaw added that she has been skeptical of much of what she has seen online about Black women “resting.”
“I see a contrast between what’s being given to me on social media and what I’m seeing in the trenches,” Crenshaw said. “Are we tired? Yes. Are we heartbroken? Absolutely. Are we willing to roll over and let this … happen to us without hearing from us? I’m not seeing that, not in the circles I talk to. We don’t have an option not to fight.”

Nelson is among the Black women in the fight now, tapping into LDF’s long history of legal activism to make American democracy live up to its values. The group was among several civil rights organizations that filed a lawsuit earlier this month challenging Trump’s executive order calling for sweeping election changes.
Fatima Goss Graves, head of the National Women’s Law Center, said Black women are leading a lot of the strategy in this time, pointing to colleagues like Alexis McGill Johnson of Planned Parenthood; Melanie Campbell of the Black Women’s Roundtable, a network focused on the political and economic power of Black women; and SEIU President April Verrett. In February, Graves’ organization, a nonprofit advancing gender justice, filed a lawsuit challenging the president’s executive orders that take aim at diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives.
Asked about this month’s protests, Graves said she was not surprised to see White Americans — who make up the majority of the federal workforce — as the main participants.
“The folks who usually come to the streets first are the ones who see the direct impact,” Graves pointed out. “You haven’t always seen groups like that in the streets. I actually feel good about Black women’s leadership at this time. They understand the assignment fully.”
And there are others, focused on building community, messaging to counteract negative narratives and protesting with the power of their purses.

In the days leading up to Trump’s joint address to Congress, an idea was launched by Black activists, organizers and strategists including Angela Rye, Leah Daughtry and Tamika Mallory to provide an alternative to the president’s speech: a marathon of online programming aimed at educating and empowering Black Americans impacted by the new administration.
“State of the People” streamed for 24 hours and has since evolved into a 10-city tour starting April 26 in Atlanta that will include mutual aid, political education and town halls.
“We have not stopped; we are focused on not just surviving, but making sure we don’t lose ground on what we have achieved as a people in this country,” said Campbell, one of the organizers of the State of the People effort. “This is designed to build a larger, intergenerational movement, showing the potential of long-term, sustained organizing on the ground and online.”
During the Lenten season, Jamal Bryant, pastor of the Atlanta-based mega congregation New Birth Missionary Baptist Church, called for a 40-day boycott of Target after the retailer announced it would scale back its DEI initiatives. The campaign came in the wake of the Trump administration’s executive orders calling for an end to such programs, which the president referred to as “radical and wasteful.” Black consumers, many of them women, make up nearly 9 percent of Target shoppers. While the full impact of the boycott is unclear, the company’s stock price has dropped, foot traffic to stores has slowed significantly and net quarterly sales decreased as a result.
Last month, 100 women did a “buy-in” at a Washington, D.C.-area Costco to show support for the store’s commitment to DEI as part of an annual summit organized by the Black Women’s Roundtable. Campbell said the gathering also included a day on Capitol Hill hosted by Angela Alsobrooks and Lisa Blount Rochester — the nation’s two Black women senators — focused on federal budget priorities including Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security.
Campbell said she has been part of different organizing efforts since the election and strategizing around protecting Black women’s leadership in this moment.
“Part of resistance is self-care,” Campbell said. “That does not have anything to do with not fighting, because we are. We said we were going to take some rest after November 5, but there was never any notion that we weren’t going to fight for our freedom in this country.”

Resistance to the Trump administration, including for Black women, is still taking shape. Campbell said she invites allies whom she felt left down by after the election to step up now. What is clear in this unprecedented moment is that it will not look like it has looked before.
Nelson said Black women’s roles now must be “very targeted, very pinpointed, because we are in a crisis unlike anything we have seen in modern history for Black women.”
“We’re taking it very seriously,” Nelson said. “To the extent people sense silence or reserve, those energies are being put to good use, just in a quiet way.”
When the moment is right, Graves predicted that Black women could also take their protest to the streets.
“That’s part of being a strategist,” she said. “We’ll know when it’s time for us to engage, and that’s OK.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-15-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-04-20 11:07:07.320676

(Photo by Maddie McGarvey for KFF Health News)For many years, Eric Wunderlin’s health issues made it hard to find stable employment.
Struggling to manage depression and diabetes, Wunderlin worked part-time, minimum-wage retail jobs around Dayton, Ohio, making so little he said he sometimes had to choose between paying rent and buying food.
But in 2018, his CareSource Medicaid health plan offered him help getting a job. It connected him to a life coach, who helped him find full-time work with health benefits. Now, he works for a nonprofit social service agency, a job he said has given him enough financial stability to plan a European vacation next year.
“I feel like a real person and I can go do things,” said Wunderlin, 42. “I feel like I pulled myself out of that slump.”
Republicans in Congress and several states, including Ohio, Iowa, and Montana, are pushing to implement work requirements for nondisabled adults, arguing a mandate would encourage enrollees to find jobs. And for Republicans pushing to require Medicaid enrollees to work, Wunderlin’s story could be held up as evidence that government health coverage can help people find employment and, ultimately, reduce their need for public assistance.
Yet his experience is rare. Medicaid typically does not offer such help, and when states do try to help, such efforts are limited.
And opponents point out that most Medicaid recipients already have jobs and say such a mandate would only kick eligible people off Medicaid, rather than improve their economic prospects. Nearly two-thirds of Medicaid enrollees work, with most of the rest acting as caregivers, going to school, or unable to hold a job due to disability or illness, according to KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.
Existing efforts to help Medicaid recipients get a job have seen limited success because there’s not a lot of “room to move the needle,” said Ben Sommers, a professor of health care economics at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Most Medicaid enrollees already work — just not in jobs with health benefits, he said.
“The ongoing argument that some folks make is that there are a lot of people freeloading in Medicaid,” he said. “That’s just not supported by the evidence.”

Using health programs to encourage work
The GOP-controlled Congress could allow or require states to implement a Medicaid work requirement as part of revamping and downsizing Medicaid. The first Trump administration encouraged those work mandates, but many were struck down by federal judges who said they were illegal under federal law.
Policy experts and state officials say more attention should be paid to investments that have helped people find better jobs — from personalized life coaching to, in some cases, health plans’ directly hiring enrollees.
They argue work requirements alone are not enough. “The move to economic mobility requires a ladder, not a stick,” said Farah Khan, a fellow with the Brookings Institution, a nonpartisan think tank.
While Medicaid work requirements have been debated for decades, the issue has become more heated as 40 states and Washington, D.C., have expanded Medicaid eligibility under the Affordable Care Act to the vast majority of low-income adults. More than 20 million adults have gained coverage as a result — but Republicans are now considering eliminating the billions in extra federal funding that helped states extend eligibility beyond groups including many children, pregnant women, and disabled people.
Only Georgia and Arkansas have implemented mandates that some Medicaid enrollees work, volunteer, go to school, or enroll in job training. But a study Sommers co-authored showed no evidence work requirements in Arkansas’ program led to more people working, in part because most of those who could work already were.
In Arkansas, more than 18,000 people lost coverage under the state’s requirement before the policy was suspended by a federal judge in 2019 after less than a year. Those who lost their Medicaid health care reported being unaware or confused about how to report work hours. Since 2023, Arkansas has been giving Medicaid health plans financial incentives to help enrollees train for jobs, but so far few have taken advantage.
Some plans, including Arkansas Blue Cross and Blue Shield’s, offer members $25 to $65 to complete a “career readiness” certificate. In 2024, some Arkansas health plans offered enrollees educational videos about topics including taxes and cryptocurrency.
Health plans don’t have an incentive to help someone find a better-paying job, because that could mean losing a customer if they then make too much to qualify for Medicaid, said Karin VanZant, a vice president at Clearlink Partners, a health care consulting company.
Rather than offering incentives for providing job training, some states, such as California and Ohio, require the insurance companies that run Medicaid to help enrollees find work.
In Montana, where some lawmakers are pushing to implement work requirements, a promising optional program nearly collapsed after state lawmakers required it be outsourced to private contractors.
Within the program’s first three years, the state paired 32,000 Medicaid enrollees with existing federally funded job training programs. Most had higher wages a year after starting training, the state found.
But enrollment has plummeted to just 11 people, according to the latest data provided by the state’s labor department.
Sarah Swanson, who heads the department, said several of the nonprofit contractors that ran the program shuttered. “There was no real part in this for us to deliver direct services to the folks that walked through our door,” she said. The state hopes to revive job training by allowing the department to work alongside contractors to reach more people.
The hunt for results
State officials say they don’t have much data to track the effectiveness of existing job programs offered by Medicaid plans.
Stephanie O’Grady, a spokesperson for the Ohio Department of Medicaid, said the state does not track outcomes because “the health plans are not employment agencies.”
Officials with CareSource, which operates Medicaid plans in multiple states, say it has about 2,300 Medicaid and ACA marketplace enrollees in its JobConnect program — about 1,400 in Ohio, 500 in Georgia, and 400 in Indiana.
The program connects job seekers with a life coach who counsels them on skills such as “showing up on time, dressing the part for interviews, and selling yourself during the interview,” said Jesse Reed, CareSource’s director of life services in Ohio.
 
Since 2023, about 800 people have found jobs through the program, according to Josh Boynton, a senior vice president at CareSource. The health plan itself has hired 29 Medicaid enrollees into customer service, pharmacy, and other positions — nearly all full-time with benefits, he said.
In 2022, California started offering nontraditional health benefits through Medicaid — including help finding jobs — for enrollees experiencing homelessness or serious mental illness, or who are otherwise at risk of avoidable emergency room care. As of September, it had served nearly 280,000 enrollees, but the state doesn’t have data on how many became employed.
The University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, which is among the largest private employers in Pennsylvania, running both a sprawling hospital system and a Medicaid plan, has hired over 10,000 of its Medicaid enrollees since 2021 through its training and support services. Among other jobs, they took positions as warehouse workers, customer service representatives, and medical assistants.
The vast majority left low-paying jobs for full-time positions with health benefits, said Dan LaVallee, a senior director of UPMC Health Plan’s Center for Social Impact. “Our Pathways to Work program is a model for the nation,” he said.
Josh Archambault, a senior fellow with the conservative Cicero Institute, said Medicaid should focus on improving the financial health of those enrolled.
While the first Trump administration approved Medicaid work requirements in 13 states, the Biden administration or federal judges blocked all except Georgia’s.
“I don’t think states have been given ample chance to experiment and try to figure out what works,” Archambault said.

They also marched along the sidewalks surrounding the Capitol, joining protests taking place in cities across the country.
The sound of church bells around downtown Lansing coincided with the start of the rally organized by Stand Against Extremism, or  SAGE, and promoted on social media, highlighting their call for freedom, equality, and justice, and their solidarity with nationwide protests organized by grassroots protest group 50501. 
Protests were also held across Michigan, including in Coldwater, Detroit, Flint, Grand Rapids, Livonia, Port Huron, and Portage.
As the first speakers took their positions at the entrance to the Capitol, hundreds more people approached the Capitol grounds with anti-Trump, anti-authoritarianism, and anti-Nazi signs and banners.
“This is the anniversary of the beginning of the American Revolution, and the democratic rights that were established during that revolution, and later confirmed and developed in the American Civil War, are now under attack,” said Tim Rivers, 65, a member of the socialist movement, during his speech.
“Hundreds have already been sent [to the El Salvodoran prison known as CECOT], and now Trump is threatening to take American citizens and deport them to El Salvador,” Rivers added.

On April 17, Juan Carlos López-Gómez, 20, was released after being arrested in Florida by federal immigration agents, despite being a natural-born American citizen. However, Lopez-Gomez was not the only U.S citizen who had an encounter with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE.

Ramiro Martinez, a Mexican immigrant and U.S. citizen, was surrounded and detained by ICE in Michigan earlier this month.
Additionally, concerns about border patrol agents’ actions under Trump’s policies have been fueled by emails sent on April 11, around the country, by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to immigrants who entered the country using CBP One, a mobile app developed by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, with an American citizen in Michigan also receiving those messages.
Around 12:30, the march began on W. Allegan Street and marched once around the Capitol, as protesters chanted against the current administration.

“The purpose of our march was basically to defend our democracy. We wanted people to come out and express their discomfort with what is going on a national scale,” said Daniel Pfau, 37, a volunteer with SAGE. “I hope that people see this event is by the people, for the people. We didn’t need a national organization in charge. We showed up, and we took care.”
After the march, a series of speakers took the microphone to express their concerns to the audience. Among the speakers were community members, social activists, and elected officials who primarily spoke out against the federal government’s targeting of immigrants across the country.
“They are trying to distract us. They want people divided. They want to bring out the worst impulses in many people’s hearts,” said State Rep. Jasper Martus (D-Flushing) during his speech. “We need to think about all those folks who are going to church tomorrow morning and saying they’re okay with deporting people who are here illegally. I’m a believer, but that’s not what I believe in.”
During the speeches, support was given for Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland resident the Trump administration erroneously deported to his native El Salvador, which was echoed and chanted by the audience in favor of his release and return to the US.
Abrego Garcia was arrested March 12 as he drove his 5-year-old son home, and was informed by ICE agents that his status had changed, despite an order that determined it was more “likely than not that he would be persecuted by gangs in El Salvador” if he were returned there, according to court documents.
Although ICE accepted his deportation was due to an administrative error, and the Supreme Court of the United States later ordered his return, on April 14, U.S. President Trump and El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele announced in the Oval Office that they would not release Abrego Garcia.
Toward the end of the demonstration, near the Capitol, on the side of North Capitol Avenue, a Trump supporter counter-protested, giving speeches and holding a sign that read “God, put Trump in.” This situation generated tense moments among the protesters, who approached to confront and argue with the lone counter-protestor. 
By the end of the day, no acts of violence or physical confrontations had been reported.

Sign up for their newsletter here.
The Trump administration proposed a new rule Wednesday that would rescind widespread habitat protections for species protected under the Endangered Species Act, a landmark law enacted in 1973 to conserve the country’s imperiled animals and plants.
That would open the door for developments across the country to be approved even if they significantly disrupt critical habitat for species listed under the Endangered Species Act. The proposed rule, posted in the U.S. Federal Register by the U.S Fish and Wildlife Service, would “rescind the regulatory definition of ‘harm,’” which is defined as any significant habitat modification or degradation that actually kills or injures wildlife.
Environmental groups lambasted the proposal.
“There’s just no way to protect animals and plants from extinction without protecting the places they live, yet the Trump administration is opening the floodgates to immeasurable habitat destruction,” said Noah Greenwald, co-director of endangered species at the Center for Biological Diversity. “This administration’s greed and contempt for imperiled wildlife know no bounds, but most Americans know that we destroy the natural world at our own peril. Nobody voted to drive spotted owls, Florida panthers or grizzly bears to extinction.”
If approved, he said, the rule would mean endangered species would only be protected from actions that intentionally lead to the harm of a species. “It’s just foundational to how we’ve protected endangered species for the last 40-plus years, and they’re just completely upending that,” Greenwald said.










This administration’s greed and contempt for imperiled wildlife know no bounds.


–  Noah Greenwald, Center for Biological Diversity


Just the day before Wednesday’s proposed rule, the Trump administration put out a rescission notice to roll back a rule that put conservation on equal footing with extractive uses on the nation’s public lands. The two decisions, along with scores of others in recent months since President Trump took office, threaten species and the habitats they depend on across the country, experts and environmentalists say.
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service did not respond to a request for comment.
 What does ‘harm’ mean? 

By law, the ESA prohibits the “take” of an endangered species, which includes actions “to harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect, or to attempt to engage in any such conduct.” Historically, the “harm” part of this mandate encompasses “any activity that can modify a species’ habitat.”
This interpretation of “harm” has long been used by agencies to extend protections for endangered species to the land or ocean area that it relies on. For example, an oil or gas project may not be able to drill or be forced to modify operations in a certain area that provides habitat for an endangered animal, such as a dune sagebrush lizard. In many cases, the “harm” rule has not blocked projects altogether, but rather resulted in different designs that reduce impacts on endangered species.
In 1995, a group of landowners and timber interests in the Pacific Northwest and the Southeast challenged the regulation’s interpretation in a push to log forests where endangered northern spotted owls and red-cockaded woodpeckers lived. In a 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court upheld the broad definition of “harm” on the basis of the Chevron Doctrine, a principle that defers to federal agencies’ expertise for carrying out laws. Last year, however, Chevron was overturned, and the Trump administration has seized on that in the new proposed rule.
The new proposal would eliminate this “harm” definition—and the habitat protections that come with it, according to Dave Owen, an environmental law professor at the University of California, San Francisco.
“The shift here would be to say that just habitat modification that is detrimental to a species, even if the detriment is fairly direct, is not encompassed within the word ‘harm,’” Owen said. The majority of habitat protections related to the ESA fall under the “harm” interpretation, according to a 2012 study by Owen. Now, under the proposal, “the word ‘harm’ is essentially going to be read as an inconsequential nullity,” he said.
The Trump administration says that its proposal is more in line with the language in the ESA, arguing that the regulations surrounding the word “harm” should be defined as an “affirmative act directed immediately against a particular animal,” rather than one that could indirectly harm an endangered species’ population, according to the posting of the proposed rule in the Federal Register. However, research shows that habitat loss is a primary driver of extinction in the United States.
In the case of the spotted owl, nests must have a 70-acre circle of land around them protected, even on private lands used for timber. “With this change, they don’t have to do that anymore,” said Greenwald with the Center for Biological Diversity.
The Trump administration’s proposal is the latest in a series of deregulatory moves to undermine the ESA, which Republicans have long attacked for stifling economic development and interfering with states’ ability to manage wildlife. Rolling back its ability to protect species was outlined in Project 2025, the conservative roadmap published before the 2024 elections guiding much of the administration’s actions.
On Inauguration Day, President Donald Trump declared a “national energy emergency,” which outlined a process to enable fossil fuel projects to bypass the typical environmental reviews associated with approval, including those required by the Endangered Species Act. The order directed the heads of all agencies and the secretary of the Army to identify projects “that may be subject to emergency treatment” within 30 days. By mid-February, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers marked for review more than 600 permit applications for energy-related projects that could qualify for the fast-pass treatment, though environmental groups argue these efforts would disrupt crucial wetlands.
To support efforts for “unleashing energy dominance,” the secretary of the Department of Interior, Doug Burgum, issued several orders in February that aim to “suspend, revise, or rescind” several ESA regulations enacted during the Biden administration. This new proposal to rescind the harm definition could also pave the way for new energy projects, experts say.
The historic interpretation of the regulation served “as sort of a caution to people not to go down and knock down trees where red-cockaded woodpeckers were nesting. And if you change the definition, I think there’s the risk that people are going to go out and engage in that behavior in the real world,” said Andrew Mergen, the director of Harvard Law School’s Emmett Environmental Law and Policy Clinic. “The rule plays a really important role in preventing people from doing that sort of thing, and at the same time, it has hardly damaged the economy, or made economic progress impossible.”
The public will have 30 days to submit comments on the proposal. Environmental groups like Earthjustice have vowed to challenge the rule in court.
 A series of attacks on conservation

Meanwhile, on Tuesday, the administration proposed rescinding the Public Lands Rule—a landmark achievement of the Biden administration that placed conservation on equal footing as extraction across the nation’s public lands following an extensive public comment period. Ninety  percent of comments received supported the rule. Another rule implemented last year that restricts oil and gas development across millions of acres of public lands in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska was also rescinded.
“This is not policy—it’s a blatant giveaway to industry that threatens to dismantle decades of conservation progress, shut down public access, harm wildlife and accelerate the reckless sell-off of our natural resources,” said Alison Flint, senior legal director at The Wilderness Society, in a statement concerning the two proposed rescission notices.
Already this year, a series of executive orders and actions by Trump have removed protections across millions of acres in national forests to boost the logging industry, streamlined the permitting process for mines, made the extraction of minerals on public lands with suitable resources the priority use, and targeted national monuments elimination. Staff at national parks have also been gutted.
All of this has come despite polling showing that conserving public lands is universally popular across party lines.
“The Trump administration is just working to undermine all protections for air, for water, for wildlife and climate—systematically and rapidly,” Greenwald said.

But those dollars are now in jeopardy, as President Donald Trump and the GOP-controlled Congress move to shrink the nearly $900 billion health program that covers more than 1 in 5 Americans.
DeSoto CEO Todd Eppler said Medicaid cuts could make it harder for his hospital to repay the loans and for patients to access care.
“I just hope that the people who are making these decisions have thought deeply about it and have some context of the real-world implications,” he said, “because it’s going to affect us as a hospital and going to affect our patients.”

One of the decision-makers is Eppler’s representative in Congress: House Speaker Mike Johnson, who lives about 35 miles north of here. He said he knows the Republican leader and his staff understand hospitals’ plight: The mother of Johnson’s chief of staff is CEO of a rural hospital in the district.
“I’ve never met a congressman yet that wanted a rural hospital in their district to close, and certainly Mike is no exception to that rule,” Eppler said.
Last year nearly 290,000 people in Johnson’s district were enrolled in Medicaid, about 38% of the total population, according to data compiled by KFF, the health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.
About 118,000 of them are in the program thanks to the Affordable Care Act, which allowed states including Louisiana to expand Medicaid to cover low-income adults, many of whom were working in low-paying jobs that don’t provide health insurance.
Louisiana ranks second in Medicaid enrollment, at nearly 32% — a reflection of the state’s high poverty rate. As Republicans weigh cuts, their actions could have dramatic consequences for their constituents here. Of the eight GOP-held House districts with the most Medicaid enrollees due to the expansion, four are in Louisiana. Johnson’s largely rural district ranks sixth in expansion enrollees.
Among them is Chloe Stovall, 23, who works in the produce aisle at the SuperValu grocery store in Vivian. She said her take-home wage working full time is $200 a week. She doesn’t own a car and walks a mile to work.
The store provides health coverage, but she said she won’t qualify until she’s worked there for a full year — and even then, it will cost more than Medicaid, which is free.
“I’m just barely surviving,” she said.
In February, Johnson pushed a budget resolution through the House that calls for cutting at least $880 billion over a decade from a pool of funding that includes Medicaid, to help fund an extension of Trump’s tax cuts and his border priorities. Republicans in Congress are now considering where to make cuts, and Medicaid is likely to take a big hit.
Defending the plan, Johnson said that Medicaid is “not for 29-year-old males sitting on their couches playing video games.”
Stovall said almost everyone she knows on Medicaid works at least one job. “I don’t even own a TV,” she said.
Contacted for comment, Johnson’s office pointed to his remarks at a conference in Washington last month. “We’re going to be very careful not to cut a benefit for anyone who is eligible to receive it and relies upon it,” Johnson said.

KFF Health News spoke with two dozen Medicaid enrollees in Johnson’s district. Most said they were unaware their congressman is leading the Republican charge to upend the program. Those informed of the Republican plan said it scares them.
Some GOP members of Congress want to eliminate the ACA’s Medicaid expansion funding, which led to 20 million working-age adults gaining coverage and helped slash the nation’s uninsured rate to its lowest level in history. Forty states and the District of Columbia have agreed to the change, which promised extra federal funding in exchange for expanding eligibility.
In this heavily Republican district, where Johnson won with 86% of the vote in November, 22% of residents live in poverty.
Like Trump, Johnson says he wants cuts to Medicaid but hasn’t elaborated other than saying the program should not cover “able-bodied” adults without imposing a work requirement.
“Everybody is committed” to preserving Medicaid benefits “for those who desperately need it and deserve it and qualify for it,” Johnson said at a news conference in February. “What we’re talking about is rooting out the fraud, waste, and abuse.”
Medicaid recipients in Johnson’s district, told about GOP plans to cut the program, said their lives are hard enough in a state where the minimum wage is $7.25 an hour. Without Medicaid, they said, they couldn’t afford health coverage.
In Vivian, near the borders with Arkansas and Texas, close to half of the 2,900 residents live in poverty. The main-street shops are mostly shuttered, except for a thrift store and a mom-and-pop restaurant that specializes in fried pork chops.
“Most everybody you know is on Medicaid here,” said Doris Luccous, 24.
Luccous said she makes $250 a week after taxes as a housekeeper at a nursing home while raising her 2-year-old daughter in her childhood home. While shopping with her father — who doesn’t work, because of a disability — she said she counts on Medicaid for her bipolar medicines and to pay for therapy appointments.
“I don’t know where I would be without it,” she said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Neither Luccous nor Stovall said they voted in the last election, and neither knew that Johnson is their representative in Congress.
Vivian has few large employers, and most employers pay the minimum wage, which hasn’t changed since 2009. “We are just stuck,” Stovall said.
Still, she said, “it’s a community where everybody knows everybody, and people are always willing to lend a hand because so many are in difficult financial circumstances.”
Willie White is CEO of David Raines Community Health Centers, which operates six outpatient clinics in northwestern Louisiana that serve primarily Medicaid enrollees. He said that Louisiana already ranks among the worst states for people’s health and that Medicaid cuts would only worsen the situation.
“You cannot expect health outcomes to improve if people can’t afford to access care,” White said.
While the clinics provide primary and dental care on a sliding fee scale for uninsured patients, signing them up for Medicaid gives them better access to specialists and brings the health centers revenue to cover the cost of delivering care.

Many of the centers’ patients gained coverage through Medicaid expansion. Afterward, rates of screenings for colon and cervical cancer went from 10% to 50%, White said.
But if Congress cuts Medicaid, the health centers would be forced to cut services, he said.
“Mike Johnson has been here and knows us, and he and his office have been responsive about our issues,” White said. “The message in prior years was, ‘We need additional funding,’ but now it is asking for no cuts.”
Community health centers, which in 2023 provided care nationally to more than 32 million mostly low-income people, have seen funding increases from Republicans and Democrats for decades.
“Everyone is supportive, but the question remains what that support will look like under the current administration,” White said. “If there are to be reductions, they need to be done with a scalpel.”
Expecting cuts, the health centers have already restricted travel and put a hold on filling vacant positions, White said.
Sitting in a David Raines clinic in Bossier City, Benjamin Andrade, 57, said having Medicaid has been a lifesaver since he needed heart surgery in 2020. Andrade is a chef and said he supports his wife and two children on $14 an hour.
He had not heard about any potential cuts to the program. Without Medicaid, he said, “it would be very hard for me to pay for all the medicines I take.”
Dominique Youngblood, 31, who was at the clinic for a dental checkup, said she’s had Medicaid most of her life. “Medicaid helps me so I don’t have to pay out-of-pocket going to the doctors,” she said.
Youngblood, who has two children, makes $12 an hour at a day care center. Asked about GOP efforts to scale back the program, she said, “It’s not fair, because it helps a lot of people who cannot afford medications and emergency room trips, and those are costs you can’t control.”

Back in Mansfield, Eppler’s hospital is more than just a health facility — it’s where many people in town come for lunch. The cafeteria was packed on a recent Friday as workers served boiled shrimp, fried okra, and baked fish.
Eppler said he’s aware Republicans in Congress are targeting a system of taxes that some states, including Louisiana, levy on hospitals and other health providers to draw down more federal Medicaid funding. That money helps finance what are known as supplemental payments to providers. Some conservatives belittle the extra funding as “money laundering.”
But that money accounts for about 15% of the DeSoto health system’s budget, said Eppler, a retired Air Force lieutenant colonel who has been CEO for a dozen years. “We are using that money to invest in the next 50 years of Desoto Parish, to build a hospital that they can have that will be sustainable,” he said.
The supplemental payments, for example, help pay to provide mental health services at three outpatient clinics. “If that $4 million went away, we would have to limit services — it’s just that simple,” he said.

(Photo: John Partipilo)Opponents are turning to legal challenges to try to block or delay major public transit expansions — even after voters approve them.
Recent lawsuits in Arizona, Tennessee and Texas have attempted to slow voter-passed projects.
In Nashville, Tennessee, voters passed a $3.1 billion referendum in November to raise the city sales tax half a cent and fund expanded bus service, pedestrian improvements and 54 miles of “all-access” transit corridors. But a Tennessee court, while upholding most of the project, ruled last week that the city could not use the funds raised to purchase land for affordable housing or parks.
The ruling affects only 1% of the total revenue, the court said. But it was a signal that even well-funded, voter-backed transit efforts are vulnerable to some legal roadblocks.
After voters in Maricopa County, Arizona, last year approved an extension of a half-cent sales tax for transportation, the county GOP sued to try to invalidate the results, arguing the vote didn’t meet a 60% supermajority.
In Austin, Texas, a 2024 class-action lawsuit attempted to block the city from collecting property taxes unless it excludes a tax approved by voters in 2020 to fund Project Connect — a major transit expansion. But a judge dismissed the lawsuit late last year.
Public support for expanded transit is surging across the United States. In 2024 alone, voters approved 46 of 53 transit-related ballot measures, unlocking over $25 billion in new funding for transit projects and improvements, according to the American Public Transportation Association.
But despite support at the ballot box, cities often face legal, zoning and political barriers.
Nashville, in particular, is becoming a case study in both momentum and resistance to transit investment and development, according to researchers at the Urban Institute.
“There’s been a sea change,” said Gabe Samuels, a research analyst in the Housing and Communities Division at the Urban Institute. “Nashville had two failed transit referenda in the past decade. This time, it passed decisively. Voters want alternatives to sprawl and traffic.”
But transit-oriented development — the strategy of clustering housing and businesses near high-quality transit — is often hindered by outdated zoning, Samuels and colleague Yonah Freemark told Stateline.
According to an Urban Institute study, more than 90% of Nashville’s residential land is zoned for single- or two-family homes, a pattern common in Southern and Midwestern cities. That zoning limits the density needed to support high transit ridership, the report said. Currently, only 13% of Nashville’s housing lies within a quarter-mile, what the report calls easy walking distance, of its planned transit corridors.
“You’re investing millions — sometimes billions — into transit systems,” said Freemark. “If you’re not thinking about land use and density alongside that, you’re wasting the opportunity.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-04-20 09:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,"Chris Murphy, a new ‘pugilistic populist,’ maps resistance to Trump",Mark Pazniokas,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/20/chris-murphy-trump-pugilistic-populism/,Chris Murphy says President Trump is bullying key institutions into submission. He wants to meet the moment with uncompromising defiance.,"Sen. Chris Murphy was dropped at the L Street entrance of Washington, D.C.’s convention center and hustled through the kitchen to a ballroom where 2,000 progressive activists waited to hear his thoughts on what to do about the 47th president of the United States and the sorry state of the Democratic Party.
The audience was midway through a weeklong, largely off-the-record summit of “America Votes,” the self-described “coordination hub of the progressive community.” It promised “experts, strategists, and renowned progressive leaders to begin writing the next chapter of the American story.”
Among them was Murphy, 51, the Democratic junior senator from Connecticut. Reelected in November to a third term, Murphy is in his third new phase as a senator — the first 10 years building a gun control movement, the last two as a broker of bipartisan deals on gun safety and border control.
“And now I’m trying to convince my party to meet the moment and bash these guys over the head with a baseball bat, metaphorically,” Murphy said.
The moment, as Murphy describes it in increasingly heated terms in person and online, is a campaign by President Donald J. Trump and Elon Musk to undermine the press and bully law firms, universities and business leaders into submission, and the only way it can be met is with uncompromising, if risky, defiance.
“Our democracy isn’t at risk of dying. It is dying as we speak. We are watching it die. It is not too late to save it,” Murphy said in a Senate speech on April 10. “We say that again, it is not too late to save our democracy, but we can’t continue to close our eyes and think that our democracy can survive a coordinated assault on those four key institutions of accountability.”
Murphy is a multiplatform messenger, a believer in repetition. On Thursday night, unshaven and casually dressed after a basketball game with the youngest of his two teenage sons, he delivered a live video briefing on Instagram that repurposed and updated the Senate speech.
“So, I want to go over events that have been developing really, really fast. Trump’s plan is real. He has a plan,” said Murphy, who has 200,000 followers on Instagram and one million on X. “He is implementing it to convert our democracy to some form of autocracy, and that’s the only way that you can get away with the corruption and the thievery.”

Online, where his Instagram remarks got more than 12,000 “likes” by Saturday morning, or the previous week while addressing a live audience in the convention center ballroom, Murphy preaches and teaches the gospel of resistance, rallies and “mass mobilizations” as the counter to Trump’s efforts to quell dissent.
“They’re playing a different game, and whether we like it or not, we have to choose to fight on the terms that they’re setting,” Murphy told the activists. It is time, he said, for Democrats “to take big swings” on both tactics and policies. The message from Murphy is not new, but similar calls are popping up in unexpected places, such as buttoned-down David Brooks calling for an “uprising” on the New York Times opinion page.
As Murphy told the activists, he would have preferred that Democrats boycotted the president’s speech to a joint session of Congress, as he did.
“He has an obligation to give a real State of the Union speech, not run a reality show, not stand up on stage and tell lie after lie after lie,” Murphy said. “He’s not willing to play that on the level. Why are we willing to play that, right?”
Murphy voted to confirm Marco Rubio as secretary of state, but says there will be no more gestures of cooperation, of recognizing institutional norms. If they are a Trump nominee, they are complicit and to be opposed. He wished his Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer, had not voted with Republicans for a budget resolution drafted with no Democratic input. Let the government shut down. Let them own it.
Yes, Murphy said, it would have carried a risk.
“For ordinary Americans to take risks, or, for instance, for law firms or universities to take risks and just say no to this guy when he tries to extort them, then political leaders need to be willing to take risks as well. Right?”  Murphy said.
It was an applause line.

Fundraising like Bernie
Murphy entered the ballroom knowing that a campaign finance filing soon would show that his relentless, blunt and occasionally profane critiques of the Republican president and Democratic Party was putting him in a league with Bernie Sanders in the online game of raising money off opposition to Trump.
The report filed Wednesday shows Murphy spent $3.4 million in the first three months of 2025 on online pitches for help supporting “a political opposition movement” that remains a work in progress, so far producing a single town-hall meeting in Warren, Mich., and the promise of two more this week in North Carolina and Missouri. 
The online appeals, buttressed with constant presence on social media platforms and cable television, plus featured turns with everyone from the New Yorker’s David Remnick to the comedian podcaster Hasan Minhaj, brought in an eye-popping $8 million.
“It’s obviously an uncommon amount of money,” Murphy said. “I mean, it was shocking to me. It was shocking to me that so many people were interested in contributing. And I just feel like I have an obligation to put that money on the ground right now. Even though they were contributing to my election funds, they were really contributing as a means to try to help meet the moment.”
After expenses, Murphy netted $4 million for the quarter, adding to the $5.5 million leftover from his easy reelection last year. 
OK, listen, it is scary. I’m not going to tell you it’s not scary.U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn.
Among senators not facing reelection in 2026 or 2028, only Sanders raised more in the same period. The independent from Vermont and undisputed leader of the American progressive movement raised $11.4 million, while spending only $1.3 million to prime the pump with digital appeals.
The 83-year-old Sanders has been on the road since Feb. 21 with his “Fighting Oligarchy Tour,” staging 15 rallies in the midwest and west with his 35-year-old ally, U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York. Their stops in Denver and Los Angeles each drew more than 30,000 people.
Sanders figures prominently in Murphy’s retooled messaging: Economic populism should have been the tentpole of Kamala Harris’ campaign, and elements of the Democratic Party owe Sanders an apology for dismissing the two-time presidential candidate as occupying a place on the fringe of politics.

Pugilistic populism
At the America Votes’ summit, which ended as Congress left Washington for a two-week recess on April 11, Murphy insisted the Biden administration, by reinvigorating the Federal Trade Commission and authorizing antitrust actions, had a credible record of standing up for workers and against corporations.
“But Joe Biden wasn’t out there every single day beating the hell out of the tech companies that were poisoning our kids, against the oil companies that were price-gouging us at the pumps, the retail companies that were shipping all of our jobs overseas,” Murphy said. “You have to be engaged in a daily fight with the corporations, the greedy corporations, the price gouging corporations that are screwing Americans.”
Murphy said his new populist rhetoric signifies a change in tone, not philosophy.
“While I’ve always, I think, been a populist, I’m maybe a louder populist,” Murphy said. “I’m maybe more interested in being more pugilistic in my populism.”
During an interview in his office the next day, between speaking at a tax-fairness rally in a park by the Capitol and then giving a floor speech on the mounting threats to democracy, Murphy said a pugilistic populism means naming names, not blandly promising to “fight special interests.” 
“That’s a purposefully cowardly term,” Murphy said. “But when you say, ‘I’m going to attack the way that Amazon is destroying local businesses. I’m going to stop Pfizer and Bristol-Myers from bankrupting families, I’m gonna stop big agriculture from driving up the cost of food’ and tell them how you’re gonna do it, that’s a much more believable populism.”
Stylistically, Murphy runs cooler than Sanders and AOC, who draw energy from crowds. Murphy can sound like he is giving a TED Talk, conversational and informative. On Thursday, after warning that civil disobedience might be necessary sooner than later, he paused and said, “OK, listen, it is scary. I’m not going to tell you it’s not scary.”
Murphy, who managed a congressional campaign when he was 22, always has thought like a political strategist as much as a politician. His rhetoric and fundraising have renewed speculation of presidential ambitions, but some admirers wonder if a better role model would be LBJ, the master of the Senate, not president.
“As long as you are nimble, there are a lot of ways to be continually relevant and make a difference on behalf of things that you care about,” he said, taking break in office. He had just addressed a tax fairness rally outside the Capitol and was about to deliver a speech to the Senate.
He insists his rainmaking, his road trips and his social media are not prepatory to a campaign for higher office. 
“I think part of the reason that my voice is breaking through a little bit right now is that it’s not poisoned by personal ambition,” he said. “I think the reason that I feel and sound a little bit more authentic in my worry about where the country is is because I’m genuinely seized by my worry. And I’m posting videos not to gain followers. I’m posting videos to try to change people’s minds and to try to raise people’s urgency.”
He asserted a strategic role on Nov. 10 with a series of tweets and a 4-minute video in which he delivered a calm if devastating post-mortem of why so many blue-collar Democrats either defected to Trump or didn’t show up.
“We are not listening to the people we claim to represent,” Murphy said in the video. “We claim to be the party of the working class, the party of poor people, and yet we let interest groups and think tanks tell us what those people need. That’s why we end up with these relatively small-ball solutions. Not saying they don’t matter, but more roads and bridges, bulk negotiation of prescription drug prices, little bit bigger tax credit for families with kids, that’s not meeting the moment.”

Spent last week licking wounds. Now it's time to get to work. Some thoughts on the path forward. In short, we need to rebuild the left. No band aids. Admit that our policies don't connect with people emotionally. Stop being so afraid of populist fights. Build a bigger tent. pic.twitter.com/MPNn2mAEFJ— Chris Murphy  (@ChrisMurphyCT) November 10, 2024

That video created an immediate buzz, especially among Sanders supporters who had given up on the Democratic Party, people like Mike Figueredo, the founder and host of “The Humanist Report” podcast. On a show in November, he summarized Murphy’s message as an unexpected validation of Sanders.
“Wow. I’ve got to say I am genuinely shocked to see a sitting Democratic Party senator admit this about the party,” Figueredo said. “I mean, we all know it’s true, but to see them admit it is quite the thing to behold. And of course, he’s exactly right. Democrats shun their working class base because they think that those high income supporters are going to be the ones to carry them.”
Not all of Murphy’s prescription was applauded by Figueredo or others on the left. While pushing the party to be more aggressive and risk-tolerant in fighting Trump, he is also urging it to be less judgmental as a necessary step to reestablishing Democrats as the big-tent party.

On X, Murphy wrote, “You need to let people into the tent who aren’t 100% on board with us on every social and cultural issue, or issues like guns or climate.” In his speech to the activists, Murphy noted he spent the better part of a decade making sure that support for universal background checks and a ban on assault weapons was a litmus test for Democratic presidential candidates.
“I remember patting myself on the back in 2020 when we held a big forum on gun violence in Las Vegas, Nev., and every single Democratic candidate for president was there, right?” he said. “And every single one of them was singing the same tune. Everyone was for a ban on assault weapons and universal background checks. And I was like, ‘Alright, I did my job.’”
Cultural litmus tests have limited the ceiling for Democratic seats in the Senate to 52, Murphy said, and he suggests across-the-board litmus tests might be counterproductive, even on his issue of guns. 
“We maybe should be nominating candidates who believe in the economic populist tentpole but might not line up with us on all of the other cultural, social and hot-button issues,” Murphy said. “That’s a difficult call to make, but I think that might serve two purposes: That might grow the coalition so we win more elections, and that might actually put us in a position to change people’s minds.” 
That was not an applause line, nor did Murphy expect it would be. Murphy was doing his TED Talk thing. He was in teaching mode. 
“Frankly, if you are zeroed in on this question of the billionaire takeover of government, the corporate seizure of our economy, then you can frankly confront the right on their unconscionable scapegoating of gay, transgender kids or immigrants in the exact same sentence in which you are anchoring our message on economic populism, right?” he said.

Distraction and division are elements of Trump’s playbook, he said. Forget about Greenland, the 51st state of Canada and the Gulf of America and keep focused on the real threat of funding tax cuts for the rich by cutting Medicaid, most likely by rolling back the expansion passed as part of the Affordable Care Act. Ninety percent of the expansion is federally funded, and a retreat to the 50-50 state and federal split for the rest of Medicaid would cost Connecticut nearly $1 billion.
“You can say, ‘Listen, the Republicans are corporate shills. They are in the pockets of billionaires, and so they want you to believe that your problems are being caused by gay kids or drag shows or Mexican immigrants,’” Murphy said. “That’s not who’s screwing you, right? Who’s screwing you are unscrupulous insurance companies. What’s screwing you are the tech companies that are poisoning and addicting your kids to their devices. Who’s screwing you is your billionaires who are so rapacious that they’re arguing to cut your insurance off so that they can get another $50,000 tax cut.”
Murphy has been warning about the dangers of disaffection and loneliness since 2022, both in a political and sociological sense. He did so again at the convention center. At a time when the economic metrics were good, he said, too many voters just weren’t feeling it.
“You were seeing epidemic rates of self reported unhappiness in America at a time when unemployment was at a structural low, crime was dropping, test scores were going up,” Murphy said. “And I don’t think you were doing your job as a political leader if you didn’t step back and ask yourself, ‘Why?’ ” 
Democrats didn’t answer that question, at least not in a manner that was heard by disaffected voters, he said. The beneficiary was anyone who practiced the politics of grievance. 
“When you’re feeling powerless, when you’re feeling alone, when you’re feeling empty and devoid of meaning, that’s the moment the demagogues live for, right?” Murphy said. “That’s the moment where somebody who is going to sell a message of division and scapegoating, man, that’s their opportunity.”
Murphy’s higher profile comes at an awkward time. Five days after issuing the election post-mortem, Murphy and his wife, Cathy Holahan, informed friends and, ultimately, the general public of their separation. Five months later, there is no record of either filing for divorce. The topic is one Murphy declines to discuss. 
Last week, the first of the two weeks of the congressional recess, Murphy had no public schedule and spent time with his two sons, who are 13 and 16. Next week, he is going on the road with town-hall meetings in Saxapahaw, N.C., on Thursday and Chesterfield, Mo., on Friday. Both are in Republican congressional districts.

His wingman will be U.S. Rep. Maxwell Alejandro Frost, an up and coming 28-year-old Democrat who represents the 10th Congressional District of Central Florida. He was with Murphy at his event in Warren, Mich. Elected at age 25, Frost is the youngest and first Generation Z member of the House.
Frost ran with the backing of Sanders, and he appeared on stage with him at the Coachella music festival last week.
“I just think he’s one of a handful of members that is meeting the moment,” Murphy said. “I have a real sense of urgency. And if I’m going to be traveling with somebody, I want them to have the same sense of urgency.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/MURPHY-PROFILE-27-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-20 06:02:58.649103

By act of Congress, citizens were asked to turn to their Creator in supplication and meditation. This national day of prayer was to be celebrated in statehouses across the land, with every individual invited to offer hosannas or amens or other holy words of praise. The places of lawmaking were transformed into houses of worship, where the symbols dear to the faithful festooned the galleries and holy banners fluttered from balconies.
When the appointed day arrived, lawmakers made thunderous speeches and pounded their desks in protestations of righteousness. There was no louder din than in the capitol building of an interior province, a region known as much for its piety as for the bountiful harvests of wheat and corn. Under a great copper-sheathed dome, choirs of young people sang the praises of the One who made the sky while lawmakers clustered elbow to bended elbow and murmured their approval.
Few remembered the ancient day when the day of supplication became the law of the land, or the war that had prompted its passage, or the innkeeper and the lawmaker who had championed it. An ambassador of this interior province, was not yet born when the day was proclaimed, but from a dais in the capitol rotunda he addressed the assembled flock.
His face was stern as he clutched his holy book and urged the assembled to celebrate the land’s deliverance from the rule of the godless. At long last the battle for theocracy had nearly been won. The faithful were in power under the great copper dome. It would be a small matter to extinguish the infidels entirely. No true patriot could doubt the land was specially ordained by the Almighty for greatness. Victory was at hand. The ambassador bowed his head and asked the One to bestow wisdom on the leaders of the land. He unashamedly asked this for all in the name of peace and love.
No one could remember a more passionate or powerful sermon.
Then an aged stranger approached. She moved silently down the aisle and mounted the platform, her chalky robe swirling like smoke. Her white hair fell in rivulets to her shoulders. Her face was as pale as those of the statues of long-dead statesmen in the alcoves of the rotunda.
The stranger touched the ambassador on the arm and bid him step aside, which the startled man did. She grasped the lectern with skeletal hands and surveyed the congregation with eyes burning with uncanny light.
“I am sent from the Throne,” she said, her voice solemn and deep. “The One has heard your prayers, and they will be granted — if you wish. But know that for every prayer answered, another must be dashed. Each request for favor brings with it the unspoken plea that another be disfavored. All supplications for earthly power are wishes both selfish and damned.”
Her eyes smoldered.
“You have asked the One for victory,” she said, “so that you might rule this land in the way which pleases you. Very well. I will repeat your prayer, as it falls upon the ears of the One above the clouds.”
There were calls for the capitol guards to remove the stranger, but they stood as transfixed as the crowd.
“Almighty One, grant us the power over our political enemies, so that we may not only exalt You but punish them,” she said, her voice growing stronger. “Let us make laws that take the food from their mouths, the homes of their families, and their ability to pay for medicine and doctors to see them through sickness. Grant us the power to choose in their stead the governing of their bodies and their minds. Allow us to restrict the means of controlling conception and then force women to bear unwanted children, even when violated.”
The stranger paused and clutched the robe to her breast.
“Let us purge from their libraries those books we deem to be improper or impious. Allow us to deny our enemies the ability to seek redress by controlling the manner in which their leaders are selected. Grant us the right to banish from our shores those who utter seditious dissent.”
The crowd grew still.
“Let our enemies live from this day forward with fear in their hearts,” the stranger said. “Let them fear the loss of their positions if they speak of equity or inclusion, make them cower if they dare say azure instead of crimson, allow them pain if they insist on choosing how they shall be called by others. Make their nights sleepless in expectation of a knock at midnight’s door. Grant them freedom of worship only if they worship as we do, deny them public office if they refuse any manner of worship, and enforce the social and marital codes of a society these thousands of years dead.”
The ambassador attempted to mutter “blasphemy,” but the word caught in his throat. The stranger regarded him for a moment with pity, then turned back to the crowd.
“Allow no truth to free a human soul,” the stranger continued. “Shutter the great houses of learning lest a whisper be made against the ambassador or his earthly king. Make a virtue of intolerance and paint it as just. Make retribution the supreme law of the land, power the only virtue, and chaos the only mode. Force them to abandon the sacred civic code that once governed this land, just as we have, and accept in their stead whimsy, nonsense and malice. Allow the land to wither beneath tariffs on foreign things, the fear of strangers, and the rapacious hunger of misers and kings.”
The stranger shook her head and her hair floated cloud-like about her face.
“Finally, Greatest One, ignore the prayers of the meek, the young, the sick and the old,” she said, her voice growing soft. “Comfort not those who pray with pure hearts. Reward not those who thirst for righteousness. Punish those who seek the truth. Banish those who challenge power with fact. All are enemies of the state, Greatest One, and are therefore your enemies. Damn their hopes, dash their dreams, and make their eyes wet with tears. Deny them comfort, afflict their spirits, and fill their hearts with lead. Smite them and their generations to come. Forever make them inequal to us. Grant us the end of history and relieve us of the will to change. This we implore of You, in the name of love.”
The stranger paused.
“This is the prayer of your secret hearts,” she said, her voice a quaver. “If you still desire it, speak! The messenger of the One awaits.”
It was reported afterward that the old woman was a lunatic, because there was no sense in what she said. On the way to the asylum, a copy of Mark Twain’s “The War Prayer” was found in the folds of her voluminous robe.

And for some, the solutions are simple, if impractical.","While I’m on vacation this week I thought I’d revisit a commentary I wrote in 2014. Judge for yourself how little has changed in 11 years.=======================================Everybody loves to complain about our traffic. And for some, the solutions are simple, if impractical. If there were easy answers to our woes, they’d have been implemented by now.
Look… this is really a matter of supply and demand: too much demand (highway traffic) and not enough supply (space on those roads). I think the solution is to manage the demand. But others say it’s a “supply side” issue.


So here are a few of the crazier ideas for fixing our traffic that I’ve seen proposed over the years:
1) Double-deck I-95: Seriously, this was once proposed by the Stamford Chamber of Commerce. Can you imagine the decades of construction and billions in cost, with “upper level” roads having to soar hundreds of feet over existing bridges?
2) Allow trucks on the Merritt Parkway: There are two words to explain why this can’t happen: low bridges.
3) Ban trucks from our interstates: This was once suggested to me by a Fairfield County First Selectman. But as I reminded him… trucks are high-occupancy vehicles delivering goods to the stores where you drive your single-occupancy vehicle to shop. No trucks, no goods, no shopping.
4) Drive in the break-down lane: This was then-Gov. John Rowland’s idea in 2000 and he even wasted a million dollars studying it. But if you think of that far right-hand lane instead as the “emergency rescue lane,” you’ll see why this doesn’t make sense. This plan would also require re-striping the road to create narrower lanes, making driving even more dangerous.
5) Widening I-95 to four lanes: Again, billions in cost and decades of construction. And if you build it, they will come. The immutable law of “induced demand” means that traffic will expand to fill available space. Then what, a fifth lane?
There are better ways to manage congestion, some of them already being implemented:
Operational lanes: Adding a fourth lane from on-ramps to the next off-ramps gives traffic a better chance of merging on and off the highway without blocking the through-lanes.
Widening choke points: For example, the exit 14-15 bottleneck in Norwalk. But this widening project (for less than one mile) cost $50 million and took three years. The I-84 / Route 8 “Mixmaster” rebuild in Waterbury took six years and cost $253 million. Both projects were funded mostly with federal funds, but it’s anyone’s guess what will happen to that money pot under the new administration’s budget cutting.
Add a zipper lane: Sure, this may require highway widening, but just one lane that’s reversible depending on demand, a system that was used successfully on the Tappan Zee Bridge before its reconstruction. By moving the extra lane, capacity can be added to the direction where there’s the most traffic.
Change commuting hours: Does everyone really need to work 9 a.m. – 5 p.m.? How about starting earlier or later and spreading out the traffic? Your employer should understand and you’ll be happier and more productive.
And the very best idea of all: improve mass transit to encourage drivers to  get off of the roads.
As I say, there are no simple solutions to highway congestion. So when anyone says he or she has one, be skeptical. It’s easy to identify the problems. But fixing them will always be hard… and usually expensive.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Traffic-congestion-on-I-95.png,,,2025-04-20 05:00:28.260002

(Photo by Jacquelyn Jimenez Romero/Washington State Standard)Major pieces of a $12 billion tax package passed the Washington state Senate on Saturday without a clear sign that Gov. Bob Ferguson supports them.
Democratic senators used their near supermajority to override Republican opposition, approving bills to expand the capital gains tax, increase tax rates on large corporations and big banks, and begin collecting sales tax on an array of services.
Collectively, the legislation would raise around $3.2 billion in the next two-year budget and $5.5 billion over four years, money Democrats are counting on to erase a multibillion-dollar shortfall and enact a balanced budget before the regular session ends next weekend.
The most heated debate Saturday centered on Senate Bill 5814, which produces the most dollars — a projected $2.9 billion in the next budget and $4.7 billion over four years. It would affect an estimated 35,000 firms, according to a Department of Revenue fiscal analysis.
Meanwhile, the House Finance Committee on Saturday advanced the tax package’s other significant components. 
Those measures — expected to receive floor votes Monday in the House — would permanently increase the state’s business tax rate, impose a new sales tax on rented self-storage units, and add a new levy on the sale of electric vehicle credits between automakers. 
The committee also voted out a bill to lift the cap on annual increases in property tax growth. 
Democrats plowed ahead on these multiple fronts without clarity on how Ferguson would respond if the bills reached his desk.
The first-term governor on Thursday called their $12 billion package “unsustainable” and “too risky,” citing unknowns about the economy and the flow of federal funding with the Trump Administration. Ferguson insisted again that a mix of progressive revenue and spending reductions is needed to resolve the budget issue, but stopped short of specifics.
He met virtually with Democratic leaders Thursday, but did not cite any specific taxes in the package he dislikes. 
Senate Majority Leader Jamie Pedersen, D-Seattle, who took part in the meeting, didn’t speculate on whether the bills passed Saturday would get signed.
“I can’t speak for the governor,” he said. “This is consistent with what we have talked with him about in terms of our approach on revenue.”
Tax time
When the session began, Democrats forecast the need for new and higher taxes to sustain public services at or near or existing levels. Saturday marked the first time any significant tax measure made it to the floor of either chamber. 
Senate Bill 5814, which passed 27-22, produces the most dollars, an estimated $2.9 billion in the next budget and $4.7 billion over four years. It applies the retail sales tax to more services, such as temporary staffing, advertising, security and lobbying.
Sen. Noel Frame, D-Seattle, the caucus leader on finance legislation, described the bill as making the state’s tax code “more appropriate for the 21st Century.”
“Our taxes fund core public services,” she said. “That’s what this is about.”
Sen. Nikki Torres, R-Pasco, assistant budget leader for the Republican caucus, said there is “nothing modern about this bill.”
“This would be an unprecedented increase in the sales tax,” she said. “We were told that the wealthy need to pay what they owe but this bill hurts everyone.”
Democrats also pushed through Senate Bill 5813 to squeeze more money from the capital gains tax. In addition to the existing 7% tax on gains over $270,000 from the sale or exchange of long-term assets like stocks, bonds and business interests, the bill tacks on another 2.9% for gains exceeding $1 million. It would bring in $282 million in the coming budget and $561 million over four years, a fiscal analysis found. The bill passed 27-21.
Senate Bill 5794 advanced on a 26-22 vote. It revises or repeals a number of tax breaks. Republicans tried without success to preserve some, including exempting operators of self-service storage facilities from paying a business and occupation tax on the renting or leasing of individual units. Most storage unit users are not homeowners, they argued.
“This is a tax on renters,” said Senate Minority Leader John Braun, R-Centralia.
‘There’s no need’
Pedersen said budget writers “have scrubbed and scrubbed” and come up with $7 billion in savings through cuts, delays and deferrals. He said bills like those Senate Democrats approved are needed for crucial programs related to health care, housing, child care and schools.
Republicans pushed back hard. 
“There’s no need for any of the tax increases,” said Sen. Chris Gildon, R-Puyallup, who led a GOP effort to craft an alternative budget proposal that doesn’t rely on tax hikes.
He lambasted a provision that requires businesses with $3 million or more in taxable retail sales next year to make a one-time pre-payment of sales tax to the state. This maneuver would pull more tax revenue into the 2025-27 budget that otherwise would have been due the month after it ends.
“This is completely a budget gimmick that should not be tolerated,” Gildon said.
In mid-afternoon, Senate Republicans attempted to pull their budget bill to the floor through a parliamentary move, but failed.
“It doesn’t play games and use ghost money,” Gildon said. “It is the only budget proposal that lives within its means.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_1573-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-04-19 23:06:37.771023

(Robert Davis for Colorado Newsline)Thousands of Coloradans gathered at the state Capitol in Denver on Saturday to attend the month’s second Hands Off! protest against the Trump administration’s policies regarding immigrants, civil rights and marginalized communities. 
The protest was organized by young people from groups like Women’s Strike, Raise Her Voice, and the Party for Socialism and Liberation, according to co-organizer McKenzie Hales, 20. The Colorado State Patrol estimated about 3,000 people were in attendance as protesters began to march at 1:30 p.m. The previous Hands Off! rally in Denver on April 5 attracted more than 8,000 attendees. 
Similar protests happened in cities across Colorado, such as Boulder, Colorado Springs, Grand Junction and Fort Collins. Similar protests were planned throughout the country.
“We deserve a country that doesn’t just say the word ‘freedom’ but one that practices it,” Hales said.

Mandy Swartz, an organizer with Raise Her Voice, a group that teaches political skills to women and marginalized communities, told Colorado Newsline that including young people in the protest is a way to ensure the momentum continues. 
Swartz said she had several “doors slammed in (her) face” as a young organizer, and she wants to change that dynamic for today’s youths.  
“We need to pass the torch on to our youths,” Swartz said. “When we’re gone, we need our youths to carry this on.” 
  It was the second Hands Off! rally in Denver this month. (Robert Davis for Colorado Newsline)
Protesters started gathering at the intersection of Lincoln Street and East 14th Avenue about 90 minutes before the protest began. Many carried upside-down American flags — a symbol of distress — and homemade signs calling for the protection of due process rights for legal immigrants like Kilmar Abrego Garcia, whom the administration of President Donald Trump erroneously sent to prison in El Salvador without allowing him to have a court hearing. 
As the crowd grew, protest songs like “For What It’s Worth” by Buffalo Springfield, “Can You Get to That” by Funkadelic, and “Revolution” by The Beatles could be heard playing through loudspeakers. The smell of burning sage and marijuana hung in the air. Passersby honked car horns in a show of solidarity with the protesters. 
Police officers in unmarked cars drove down Lincoln Street to keep protesters on the sidewalks. Once the crowd became too large, police shut down the intersection and diverted traffic away from Lincoln Street.
Speakers highlighted the deportation proceedings against local labor organizer Jeanette Vizguerra as an example of the unfair treatment immigrants are receiving under Trump. Vizgeurra’s arrest drew widespread condemnation across the country, with Denver Mayor Mike Johnston likening it to “Putin-style political persecution.” 
Some also called on congressional and local lawmakers to repair the social contract for marginalized groups like people with disabilities, people of color, and the LGBTQ+ community. Others spoke in opposition to Israel’s war in Gaza and what they characterized as America’s complicity in the conflict. 
“Until we address and rebuild America’s foundation, this house will fall,” said Dr. Robert Davis (no relation to the author), an activist with the Denver Task Force to Reimagine Policing.

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — On the 30th anniversary of the deadliest act of domestic terrorism in U.S. history, former President Bill Clinton said Americans must unite despite their differences, and that Oklahomans can help lead the way by serving as that role model for the rest of the nation.
Clinton, who was president at the time of the attack, returned to the site of the 1995 Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building bombing Saturday to deliver the keynote address to a crowd of over 1,600 that attended to remember and honor those who died and were injured in the attack.
While the event is typically held outdoors at the Oklahoma City National Memorial and Museum, the site of the bombing, it was moved indoors due to inclement weather. The crowd that arrived to commemorate the anniversary was so large that once the pews were packed, people stood along the walls and filled an overflow room.

“The domestic terrorists who did this awful thing believed that it would spark a nationwide upheaval against the American government, and would eventually destroy our government, our democracy and our life,” Clinton said. “Instead, you gave them, as the mayor said so eloquently, the Oklahoma Standard. You gave them service, honor and kindness.”
Clinton, a Democrat, came to Oklahoma City days after the 1995 attack to address a devastated crowd assembled at the Oklahoma State Fair Arena. He said he’s returned to Oklahoma City in subsequent years to commemorate the event.
Three decades later, Clinton said that the country has again grown more polarized. When Oklahoma City was the “center of polarization” 30 years ago, it chose to move forward together, he said.
“America needs you, and America needs the Oklahoma Standard,” Clinton said. “And if we all live by it, we would get a fairer economy, a more stable society. We would understand one another, and we wouldn’t feel weak if we admitted we were wrong about something.”
Thirty years ago, a fertilizer and fuel oil bomb placed inside a Ryder truck outside the Federal Building in downtown Oklahoma City exploded at 9:02 a.m., killing 168 people, including 19 children, and injuring around 850.
Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols were arrested for their roles. Both were found guilty. McVeigh was executed June 11, 2001, by lethal injection at the Federal Correctional Complex in Terre Haute, Indiana. Nichols was sentenced to life in prison.

Michael Fortier was sentenced to 12 years in prison for failing to report his knowledge of the bombing plot.
Investigators said McVeigh held extremist views and planned the bombing on the anniversary of the end of the Waco siege between law enforcement and the Branch Davidians.
Other speakers at Saturday’s remembrance event included prominent Republican officials such as Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, former Gov. Frank Keating, and U.S. Sen. James Lankford. Oklahoma City Mayor David Holt also spoke. Most of Oklahoma’s Congressional delegation was present, as were a few other former governors, current state lawmakers and other officials.
There have been nearly “11,000 tomorrows” since the bombing and in Oklahoma City, Holt said, and the city has grown in that time. He said 30 years since the bombing signifies a “generation.”
While younger Oklahomans may not remember the bombing, Stitt said, they live in a state shaped by it and the “commitment to service, honor and kindness” that followed.
Lankford said Oklahomans need to ensure the lessons learned from the bombing and its aftermath are passed to future generations to ensure there is “no generation that rises up that does not remember.”
The Federal Building housed federal agencies like the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Secret Service, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and Explosives, the agency that initially launched the Waco raid. But the building also held a day care, military recruitment offices and other various federal agencies.

Family members of victims read the 168 names to the crowd Saturday in an effort to “humanize” the people, said Kari Watkins, president and CEO of the memorial museum.
The building was imploded after the rescue operations and evidence collections were completed. A new federal building was built nearby.
The memorial was built where the old federal building once stood. The 168 chairs erected at the site each represent an empty seat at the dinner table. The smaller chairs represent the children who died. A reflecting pool represents the time between 9:01 a.m. and 9:03 a.m. April 19, 1995. Officials were able to preserve an American elm tree that survived the blast. It is known as the “Survivor Tree.”
In the aftermath of the attack, the state became known for the “Oklahoma Standard,” a term used to describe the “selfless actions” of thousands who offered help.

(Photo via FIU)Florida International University’s police chief believes the university community would be best served by the department signing an agreement with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, although the faculty is uneasy. 
During a Faculty Senate special meeting Friday, interim President Jeanette Nuñez, the former lieutenant governor, and FIU Police Department Chief Alexander Casas fielded questions from faculty members about what a 287(g) agreement with ICE will mean for students and faculty, particularly ones fearing detainment.
Under the agreement, FIUPD officers could act as immigration enforcement officials to question and detain people they suspect are in the country without authorization.
“If we have to deliver someone, we’re the ones you want to do it, because it will be done in the most FIU way, the most Panther way, we can think of,” Casas said. 
Casas signed the agreement with ICE, as have several other university police departments in the state, and is awaiting a response from the federal agency before officers can begin training. When it’s signed, Casas said, he will choose his “best officers” to be trained. 
“If I don’t sign that agreement, we open the door for other agencies who are on this agreement, whether they’re federal agencies in power to do so or state agencies directed by our governor or local agencies that have agreed,” Casas said. 
Casas told faculty he wants his department to have a say in how immigration enforcement goes at the South Florida institution.
“Once I deliver someone to Krome or turn them over to ICE, you’re right, I lose control. But, absent this agreement, I don’t even have input. At the very least, once they execute it, at least now I have input and my officers do have a little say in what could be the outcome,” Casas said.
“If it has to happen because there’s a warrant in the system, who do you want interacting with you? God, I hope you say it’s me,” Casas said. 
Nuñez said she spoke at length with Faculty Senate Chair Noël Barengo earlier in the week after he reached out. She added that she wants to make sure she is “constantly addressing concerns.”
Faculty Senate members were not so convinced. Florida universities have made national news for signing the agreement with ICE.
Students live in fear for their ability to remain in the United States, faculty members said. One professor shared about a student who is not a citizen who came to him worried after receiving a parking ticket. 
Juan Gómez, director of the Carlos Costa Immigration Human Rights Clinic at FIU, said students have approached him to say they are afraid to look up items on their computer. Some, in abusive relationships, are afraid to call police. 
“I don’t know the status of any of our students. PD does not have access to any of that information,” Casas said, adding that his department has to follow FERPA, the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act.

Casas said he did not get a call from the governor encouraging him to seek a 287(g) agreement; instead, he approached Nuñez after conversations with other law enforcement convinced him it “really is with our best interest at heart.”
Faculty senators approved a resolution opposing the agreement, saying it “goes against the university’s values of truth in the pursuit, generation, dissemination, and application of knowledge, freedom of thought and expression, and respect for diversity and dignity of the individual.” The resolution called for the university to withdraw. 
Well into the two-hour meeting, Philip Carter, an FIU professor, remained unconvinced.
“It’s been good to hear you,” Carter said. “I haven’t heard anything that convinces me that this is a good agreement. It still sounds like a really bad agreement. I still worry about the safety of our students on campus who fear for their status and their safety. I worry, frankly, about all of us, I worry about faculty, I worry that there’s a slippery slope beneath us.”
Nuñez stressed that visa revocations and ICE agreements are different but sometimes get conflated. FIU has no control over visa revocations, she said. 
Earlier this week, FIU confirmed to the Phoenix that 18 students have had their visas revoked since Jan. 1. The University of Florida told the Phoenix that eight visas have been revoked; Florida State University, three.
Alana Greer, director of Community Justice Project, said the FIU 287(g) is “deeply unprecedented” and the “agenda behind relaunching these 287(g)’s is specifically engineered to break trust, to tear apart our communities and to get us to see our neighbors, our peers, our students as ‘other.’”
Greer referenced her involvement with a story the Phoenix reported on Thursday, when 20-year-old Juan Carlos Lopez-Gomez, a U.S. citizen, was arrested by a Florida Highway Patrol trooper as an “unauthorized alien” and held for ICE.

Clinton, who was president at the time of the attack, returned to the site of the 1995 Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building bombing Saturday to deliver the keynote address to a crowd of over 1,600 that attended to remember and honor those who died and were injured in the attack.
While anniversary events are typically held outdoors at the Oklahoma City National Memorial and Museum, the site of the bombing, Saturday’s remembrance was moved indoors due to inclement weather. The crowd that arrived to commemorate the anniversary was so large that once the pews were packed, people stood along the walls and filled an overflow room.

“The domestic terrorists who did this awful thing believed that it would spark a nationwide upheaval against the American government, and would eventually destroy our government, our democracy and our life,” Clinton said. “Instead, you gave them, as the mayor said so eloquently, the Oklahoma Standard. You gave them service, honor and kindness.”
Clinton, a Democrat, came to Oklahoma City days after the 1995 attack to address a devastated crowd assembled at the Oklahoma State Fair Arena. He said he’s returned to Oklahoma City in subsequent years to commemorate the event.
Three decades later, Clinton said that the country has again grown more polarized. When Oklahoma City was the “center of polarization” 30 years ago, it chose to move forward together, he said.
“America needs you, and America needs the Oklahoma Standard,” Clinton said. “And if we all live by it, we would get a fairer economy, a more stable society. We would understand one another, and we wouldn’t feel weak if we admitted we were wrong about something.”
Thirty years ago, a fertilizer and fuel oil bomb placed inside a Ryder truck outside the Federal Building in downtown Oklahoma City exploded at 9:02 a.m., killing 168 people, including 19 children, and injuring around 850.
Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols were arrested for their roles. Both were found guilty. McVeigh was executed June 11, 2001, by lethal injection at the Federal Correctional Complex in Terre Haute, Indiana. Nichols was sentenced to life in prison.
Michael Fortier was sentenced to 12 years in prison for failing to report his knowledge of the bombing plot.
Investigators said McVeigh held extremist views and planned the bombing on the anniversary of the end of the Waco siege between law enforcement and the Branch Davidians.

Other speakers at Saturday’s remembrance event included prominent Republican officials such as Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, former Gov. Frank Keating, and U.S. Sen. James Lankford. Oklahoma City Mayor David Holt also spoke. Most of Oklahoma’s congressional delegation was present, as were a few other former governors, current state lawmakers and other officials.
There have been nearly “11,000 tomorrows” since the bombing and in Oklahoma City, Holt said, and the city has grown in that time. He said 30 years since the bombing signifies a generation.
While younger Oklahomans may not remember the bombing, Stitt said, they live in a state shaped by it and the “commitment to service, honor and kindness” that followed.
Lankford said Oklahomans need to ensure the lessons learned from the bombing and its aftermath are passed to future generations to ensure there is “no generation that rises up that does not remember.”
The Federal Building housed federal agencies like the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Secret Service, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and Explosives, the agency that initially launched the Waco raid. But the building also held a day care, military recruitment offices and other various federal agencies.

Family members of victims read the 168 names to the crowd Saturday in an effort to “humanize” the people, said Kari Watkins, president and CEO of the memorial museum.
The building was imploded after the rescue operations and evidence collections were completed. A new federal building was built nearby.
The memorial was built where the old federal building once stood. The 168 chairs erected at the site each represent an empty seat at the dinner table. The smaller chairs represent the children who died. A reflecting pool represents the time between 9:01 a.m. and 9:03 a.m. April 19, 1995.
Officials were able to preserve an American elm tree that survived the blast. It is known as the “Survivor Tree.”
In the aftermath of the attack, the state became known for the “Oklahoma Standard,” a term used to describe the “selfless actions” of thousands who offered help.

The report, written by longtime natural resources manager John Tubbs, calls the financial implications of federal lands transfer “staggering and disproportionately impactful for a rural state with large swaths of national public lands.”
“The costs associated with maintaining national public lands at the state level — ranging from wildfire operations to the loss of essential federal funding for rural counties — would be far too great for Montana to bear per capita,” the report states. It amounts to an $8 billion “gamble on Montana’s future.” 
Tubbs, who authored the report with support from the Montana Wildlife Federation, Backcountry Hunters and Anglers, Mountain Mamas and the Montana Conservation Voters Education Fund, is the former director of the Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation under Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock.
The long simmering dispute over whether the federal government should relinquish lands managed by the Departments of Interior and Agriculture to individual states has been turned up at all levels, from the halls of Congress to Montana’s capitol.
The estimated roughly $8 billion increase to Montanan’s balance sheet would be primarily driven by the costs of managing the land, according to the report, including for wildfire, deferred maintenance backlogs, and abandoned mine reclamation.
Citing reports by the Legislative Fiscal Division, the report states that during the last 20 years, Montana has paid more than $2.3 billion in wildfire mitigation costs on federal land — comprising just 25% of total cost, as the federal government covers 75% of costs. 
A transfer of federal lands to state management would shift the cost of future wildland fire suppression to state taxpayers to the tune of $5.5 billion — the bulk of the total.
On a press call about the report, Tubbs pointed to the essential partnerships with federal agencies  — including the large fleets of firefighting aircraft operated by the Forest Service — and the difficulty in replicating that from the state or private industry. 
“That is untenable,” he said.
 Tubbs also focused on Payment in Lieu of Taxes funds the federal government disseminates. The PILT program channels money to rural counties with swaths of untaxable federal land to support vital services such as public safety, housing, social services and transportation. 
In fiscal year 2023, Montana counties received more than $40 million in PILT funds — and another $16 million from the similar Secure Rural Schools program — a loss the state likely couldn’t make up. 
Tubbs said such a loss would result in the largest “unfunded mandate” in state history, and “several of Montanaʼs counties would be bankrupt—- in particular, the 11 counties in which more than half of the acreage is owned by the federal government.”
The report also states that Montana would be on the hook for $623 million in deferred maintenance and repairs on current federal lands; between $474 million and $1 billion for reclamation work on the state’s 5,000 abandoned mines; and a 1,600% increase in grazing fees. 
 “The state simply cannot afford the responsibility of managing such vast swaths of land without significant financial strain,” the report concludes. 
Tubbs said the value of public lands goes far beyond the numbers, and supporters need to strengthen efforts. 
“The core value I think most of us find in public lands is there’s some landscape that means something to each of us,” he said on the press call. 

Discussions about the federal lands transfer came to the forefront in Washington D.C. and nationwide following statements by the Trump administration that federal lands are part of the nation’s “balance sheet” and could be utilized to help pay off the national debt. 
Earlier this month, the U.S. Senate passed a federal budget in a series of late night votes, and one particular budget amendment saw Montana’s two Republican Senators buck their party. 
The amendment, brought by Sen. John Hickenlooper, D-Colorado, would have prevented the sale of public lands to lower the federal deficit. 
Montana Sens. Steve Daines and Tim Sheehy joined all Democrats in supporting the amendment, but it was defeated 51-49. 
In a similar vein, Republican U.S. Rep. Ryan Zinke, Montanan’s western representative, reintroduced his “Public Lands in Public Hands Act,” earlier this year with a Democratic senator from New Mexico.
The provision would ban the U.S. Department of Interior and U.S. Forest Service from selling or transferring “most public lands” except in specific circumstances. It also would require Congressional approval for disposals of publicly accessible federal land tracts over 300 acres and for public land tracts over 5 acres if accessible via a public waterway.
“In Montana, public lands are our way of life. It’s not just Yellowstone and Glacier, it’s also the BLM and Forest Service areas where a kid fills their first tag, a lake in the Beartooths that is the perfect picnic spot, and the trail just down the road that helps you clear your head after a long workday,” Zinke, a former Secretary of the Interior during Trump’s first term, said in a press release. “Public lands must remain public, and the federal government has a responsibility to manage and ensure access to those lands.”
Earlier this month, Montana’s eastern representative, Republican Troy Downing, signed on as a cosponsor to the legislation, as did Idaho Republican Rep. Mike Simpson. 
In Helena this legislative session, Montana’s state lawmakers also got to offer their own takes on the issue thanks to a lawsuit filed by the State of Utah against the federal government in favor of land transfer.
The suit, which claimed federally-managed land infringed on the state’s sovereignty and sought a return of millions of acres, was rejected by the U.S. Supreme Court.
Despite that, freshman Rep. Tom Millett, R-Marion, introduced a resolution supporting Utah’s position.
While Millett stated House Resolution 24 did not concern Montana’s federal public lands, his comments were broadly applicable to all states. 
“Nothing in the U.S. Constitution authorizes the federal government to hold vast unreserved swaths of unreserved territory in perpetuity over the states’ express objection,” he told the House Energy, Technology and Federal Relations Committee during a hearing. “The U.S. generates significant revenue from these unappropriated lands — millions of dollars annually that would go toward our counties and schools. But instead, we get but a pittance, leftover crumbs from what should be our lands.”
The bill passed out of committee on partisan lines, but saw broad bipartisan opposition on the floor. 
“Montanans have overwhelmingly rejected transfer time and time again,” Rep. Debo Powers, D-Whitefish, told her colleagues during the debate. “In fact, 87 percent of Montana voters considered the conservation — not the transfer, but the conservation — of public land to be influential in their voting decisions. That’s why so many political candidates in Montana from every political party pledged to keep public lands in public hands.”
The bill failed to pass the House floor in a bipartisan 33-66 vote.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/52200523998_54a5016229_k-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-19 14:04:23.814161

(Adam Wesley/USA Today)ASHLAND, Wis. — In less than 10 years, three catastrophic floods ravaged northwestern Wisconsin and changed the way people think about water. 
The most severe, in July 2016, slammed Ashland with up to 10 inches of rain in less than a day — a month’s worth of rain fell in just two hours. As rivers swelled to record highs, major highways broke into pieces and culverts washed away. It took months for roads to reopen, with more than $41 million in damage across seven counties. 
The Marengo River, which winds through forests and farmland before meeting the Bad River that flows into Lake Superior, was hit hard during these historic deluges. Centuries earlier, the upper watershed would have held onto that water, but logging and agriculture left the river disconnected from its floodplain, giving the water nowhere safe to go. 
Today, the Marengo River stands as an example of a new kind of solution. Following the record floods, state leaders invested in opening up floodplains and restoring wetlands to relieve flooding. As the need to adapt to disasters grows more urgent, the Marengo River serves as an example that there’s a cheaper way to do so: using wetlands. 
“We can’t change the weather or the patterns… but we can better prepare ourselves,” said MaryJo Gingras, Ashland County’s conservationist. 
 This story is part of the series Down the Drain from the Mississippi River Basin Ag & Water Desk, an independent reporting collaborative based at the University of Missouri in partnership with Report for America, with major funding from the Walton Family Foundation.
Wetlands once provided more natural flood storage across Wisconsin and the Mississippi River Basin, soaking up water like sponges so it couldn’t rush further downstream. But about half of the country’s wetlands have been drained and filled for agriculture and development, and they continue to be destroyed, even as climate change intensifies floods.
As the federal government disposes of rules to protect wetlands, environmental advocates want to rewrite the ecosystem’s narrative to convince more people that restoration is worth it. 
Wetlands aren’t just pretty places, advocates argue, but also powerhouses that can save communities money by blunting the impact of flood disasters. A 2024 Wisconsin law geared at preventing such disasters before they happen, inspired by the wetland work in the Marengo River watershed, is going to test that theory. 
“Traditionally, the outreach has been, ‘We want to have wetlands out here because they’re good for ducks, frogs and pretty flowers,’” said Tracy Hames, executive director of the Wisconsin Wetlands Association. “What do people care about here? They care about their roads, their bridges, their culverts … how can wetlands help that?” 
Bipartisan bill posed wetlands as flood solution
Northern Wisconsin isn’t the only place paying the price for floods. Between 1980 and 2025, the U.S. was struck by 45 billion-dollar flood disasters, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, with a cumulative price tag of nearly $206 billion. Many parts of the vast Mississippi River Basin receive up to eight inches more rain annually than they did 50 years ago, according to a 2022 analysis from Climate Central, a nonprofit organization that analyzes climate science. 
Damaging floods are now so common in the states that border the Mississippi River, including Wisconsin, that the issue can’t be ignored, said Haley Gentry, assistant director of the Tulane Institute on Water Resources Law and Policy in New Orleans. 
“Even if you don’t agree with certain (regulations) … we absolutely have to find ways to reduce damage,” Gentry said.
Former Wisconsin state Rep. Loren Oldenburg, a Republican who served a flood-prone district in southwest Wisconsin until he lost the seat last year, was interested in how wetlands could help.
Oldenburg joined forces with Republican state Sen. Romaine Quinn, who represents northern Wisconsin and knew of the work in the Marengo River watershed. The lawmakers proposed a grant program for flood-stricken communities to better understand why and where they flood and restore wetlands in areas that need the help most. 
 
Jennifer Western Hauser, policy liaison at the Wisconsin Wetlands Association, met with Democratic and Republican lawmakers to advocate for the bill. She emphasized problems that might get their attention — related to transportation, emergency services, insurance, or conservation — that wetland restoration could solve. She said she got a lot of head-nods as she explained that the cost of continually fixing a washed-out culvert could vanish from storing and slowing floodwaters upstream. 
“These are issues that hit all over,” she said. “It’s a relatable problem.”   
  State Highway 13, a major north-south route in Wisconsin, collapsed in rural Ashland County in 2016 after a massive rainstorm caused area rivers to swell to record highs. The county used state funds to restore wetlands, hoping to prove that they’re a natural flooding solution.(MaryJo Gingras/Ashland County Land & Water Conservation Dept.)
The bill passed unanimously and was signed into law by Democratic Gov. Tony Evers in April 2024. Evers and the Republican-controlled Legislature approved $2 million for the program in the state’s most recent budget. 
Twenty-three communities applied for the first round of grant funding, which offered two types of grants — one to help assess flood risk, and another grant to help build new wetlands to reduce that risk. Eleven communities were funded, touching most corners of the state, according to Wisconsin Emergency Management, which administered the grants. 
Brian Vigue, freshwater policy director for Audubon Great Lakes, said the program shows Wisconsinites have come a long way in how they think about wetlands since 2018, when the state government made it easier for developers to build in them. 
There’s an assumption that wetland restoration comes only at the expense of historically lucrative land uses like agriculture or industry, making it hard to gain ground, Vigue said. But when skeptics understand the possible economic benefits, it can change things. 
“When you actually find something with the return on investment and can prove that it’s providing these benefits … we were surprised at how readily people that you’d assume wouldn’t embrace a really good, proactive wetland conservation policy, did,” he said. 
Private landowners need to see results
About three-quarters of the remaining wetlands in the lower 48 states are on privately owned land, including areas that were targeted for restoration in the Marengo River watershed. That means before any restoration work begins, the landowner must be convinced that the work will help, not hurt them. 
For projects like this to work, landowner goals are a priority, said Kyle Magyera, local government outreach specialist at the Wisconsin Wetlands Association, because “they know their property better than anyone else.”
Farmers, for example, can be leery that beefing up wetlands will take land out of production and hurt their bottom line, Magyera said. 
In the Marengo watershed, Gingras worked with one landowner who had farmland that wasn’t being used. They created five new wetlands across 10 acres that have already decreased sediment and phosphorus runoff from entering the river. And while there hasn’t been a flood event yet, Gingras expects the water flows to be slowed substantially.
This work goes beyond restoring wetland habitat, Magyera said, it’s about reconnecting waterways. In another project, Magyera worked on a private property where floods carved a new channel in a ravine that funneled the water faster downstream. The property now has log structures that mimic beaver dams to help slow water down and reconnect these systems.

Now that the first round of funding has been disbursed in Wisconsin’s grant program, grantees across the state are starting work on their own versions of natural flood control, like that used in Marengo. 
In Emilie Park, along the flood-prone East River in Green Bay, a project funded by the program will create 11 acres of new wetlands. That habitat will help store water and serve as an eco-park where community members can stroll through the wetland on boardwalks.
In rural Dane County, about 20 miles from the state capital, a stretch of Black Earth Creek will be reconnected to its floodplain, restoring five and a half acres of wetlands and giving the creek more room to spread out and reduce flood risk. The creek jumped its banks during a near record-breaking 2018 rainstorm, washing out two bridges and causing millions of dollars in damage. 
Voluntary program could be of interest elsewhere
Nature-based solutions to flooding have been gaining popularity along the Mississippi River. Wisconsin’s program could serve as a “national model” for how to use wetlands to promote natural flood resilience, Quinn wrote in a 2023 newspaper editorial supporting the bill.
Kyle Rorah, regional director of public policy for the Great Lakes/Atlantic region of Ducks Unlimited, said he’s talking about the Wisconsin grant program to lawmakers in other states in the upper Midwest, and that he sees more appetite for this model than relying on the federal government to protect wetlands.  
And Vigue has found that stakeholders in industries like fishing, shipping and recreation are receptive to using wetlands as infrastructure. 
But Gentry cautioned that voluntary restoration can only go so far, because it “still allows status-quo development and other related patterns to continue.”
Still, as the federal government backs off of regulation, Gentry said she expects more emphasis on the economic value of wetlands to drive protection. 
Some of that is already happening. A 2024 analysis from the Union of Concerned Scientists found that wetlands save Wisconsin and the upper Midwest nearly $23 billion a year that otherwise would be spent combating flooding. 
“Every level of government is looking at ways to reduce costs so it doesn’t increase taxes for their constituents,” Gingras said. 
John Sabo, director of the ByWater Institute at Tulane University, said as wetlands prove their economic value in reducing flood damage costs, taxpayers will see their value. 
“You have to think about (wetlands) as providing services for people,” Sabo said, “if you want to get people on the other side of the aisle behind the idea (of restoring them).” 
And although the Wisconsin grant program is small-scale for now, he said if other states bordering the Mississippi River follow its lead, it could reduce flooding across the region.
“If all upstream states start to build upstream wetlands,” he said, “that has downstream impacts.”

(Courtesy of CleanAIRE NC)Jabaar Edmond has long advocated for better air quality in his Childs Park neighborhood in St. Petersburg, Florida.
For decades, residents of the predominantly Black neighborhood complained of a persistent gasolinelike odor.
“We had an initiative called ‘Smell something, say something,’” said Edmond, former president of the neighborhood’s association. Residents have long sounded that alarm, blaming the noxious odor on a nearby oil recycling facility.
Last year, the city funded the planting of more than 180 trees across the neighborhood. Trees help battle the urban heat island effect and filter pollutants, which can mitigate odors and improve air quality. The project was funded by a federal grant from the U.S. Forest Service.
But now, the agency is hindering such efforts, canceling a grant that supports tree-planting in disadvantaged communities.
Communities across the nation are losing federal funds that helped pay for environmental justice efforts designed to mitigate the health effects of pollution and other hazards on historically underserved communities. President Donald Trump’s administration has targeted those initiatives in its drive to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion — or DEI — programs.
Tribes, long shut out from their own health data, fight for access and sovereignty

“Where it hurts for us is we still have a huge environmental problem that’s occurring in real time that we’re attempting to mitigate,” Edmond said.
Environmental justice refers to equitable access to healthy environments. Federal housing policies and disinvestment in historically segregated communities have been linked to numerous health consequences. Communities of color have been disproportionately exposed to refineries and other sources of pollution. Air pollution is linked to asthma, cardiovascular problems and lower life expectancy.
Such systematic, disproportionate exposure to industrial pollutants and disinvestment is known as environmental racism. Research shows, for example, that Black Americans living in communities that were redlined — a discriminatory practice under which the federal government and banks systematically denied mortgages to residents of minority neighborhoods — have lower life expectancy and more exposure to air pollution and other hazards. Meanwhile, many tribal communities have been the sites of or near mineral mining and oil and gas development.
The Biden administration awarded grants to help correct those harms, centering environmental justice and climate change across multiple federal agencies. The Justice40 initiative aimed to invest 40% of federal climate, housing, clean energy and clean water benefits in historically underserved communities.
Now, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin has canceled more than 400 environmental justice grants totaling $1.7 billion.
Democrats are accusing EPA of illegally canceling the grants, as many were funded through Biden-era congressionally appropriated funds under the Inflation Reduction Act. EPA canceled the grants as part of sweeping cuts to what the Trump administration and Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency task force deem unnecessary spending. In recent weeks, Democrats have demanded Zeldin reverse the cancellations.
The Trump administration has also shut down the EPA’s Office of Environmental Justice, as well as the Office of Climate Change and Health Equity.
State environmental and health departments, regulatory agencies, city and county governments, elementary schools, nonprofits and tribal communities were among those that received grants.
The grant-funded projects had a broad range of missions: They included child lead-poisoning prevention efforts, community air monitoring, tree-planting efforts and solar energy investments.
“I don’t know how we’ve come to demonize the idea that people deserve to breathe clean air, drink clean water and have access to environments that are non-polluting,” said Diana Hernandez, associate professor of sociomedical sciences at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health. “It’s a big loss, and it’s destabilizing.”
Wind and solar power opponents make headway in state legislatures

Hernandez, a former member of New York City’s Environmental Justice Advisory Board, researches health, housing and energy insecurity. Many of her studies focus on communities like the South Bronx, the neighborhood she calls home, where the air is heavy with emissions because multiple highways converge there. Children and adults in the Bronx have higher rates of emergency room visits for asthma than residents of any other New York City borough.
“I grew up in a community of need. It’s officially labeled as an environmental justice community, a disadvantaged community,” she said. “My mom is my next-door neighbor, and so we weekend in the ’hood. We still have our place there.”
The goal of her work has been to elevate the “lived realities of people in communities like the South Bronx.”
“You can’t take care of people if the organizations and agencies that are looking out for their best interests through oversight are gone,” she said.
‘A gut punch’
Many grantees, particularly those associated with universities, are hesitant to speak out about the impact a loss in funds will have on their projects.
“They’re just struggling and trying to figure out, ‘How do we push back in a way that doesn’t put a target on us?’” said Ryan Hathaway, director of environment and climate justice at Lawyers for Good Government.
His organization is leading a pro bono network offering legal advice to hundreds of groups as well as to state and local agencies whose grants are frozen or canceled.
Hathaway previously served under the Biden administration as director for environmental justice and the White House Interagency Council on Environmental Justice.
“It’s still shocking to me to have these interviews,” he said. “We’re talking about whether or not it’s good for children to be able to drink water safely. It just feels like a gut punch.”
Black children, for example, are more likely to have higher average blood lead levels, from exposure to water pumped through lead pipes in older buildings, as well as through lead paint. Lead poisoning can cause irreversible cognitive development damage in children as they rapidly develop.
Among the grants targeted for cancellation was a $500,000 award to the nonprofit Childhood Lead Action Project, as well as a $1 million award to Kansas City, Missouri, for soil lead mitigation. A $14 million grant awarded to Texas A&M University and the Black Belt Unincorporated Wastewater Program aimed to install wastewater treatment systems throughout 17 Alabama counties. In highly documented cases, residents were contracting infections such as hookworm, more commonly associated with developing countries in the global south, amid a lack of proper, expensive septic systems.










There's just so many programs that help neighborhoods be better places to live that states and communities were counting on.


– Ryan Hathaway, director of environment and climate justice at Lawyers for Good Government


CleanAIRE NC, which works to address air pollution across North Carolina, was slated to install 40 air monitors across four low-income white, Black and Hispanic communities in north Mecklenburg County. But about two weeks ago, the group’s $500,000 grant was terminated. The team had used less than half of the funds, and planned to train “air keepers” to track and monitor air quality.
One of the communities included a historic Black neighborhood near old asbestos factories and at the convergence of freeways and industrial complexes, said Executive Director Jeffrey Robbins. Many residents there struggle with asthma and heart disease, he added.
It’s “sad that we’re at this juncture,” Robbins said. “But we’re going to continue to battle and fight for information and the science behind it, and for the communities that are being impacted.”
Dr. Lisa Patel, a Bay Area pediatric hospitalist and executive director of the Medical Society Consortium on Climate and Health, noted that pollution affects babies’ health even before they’re born.
“The children that I worry about the most are the ones that are placed at a disadvantage before they’ve even drawn first breath,” she said. “Fossil fuel pollution crosses the placenta, enters the developing fetus. And so essentially, children are born pre-polluted, and there’s a higher risk of that if you live in these neighborhoods that tend to be systemically divested.”
Patel said that organizations her group’s research has helped are “trying to find ways to ensure that kids can have a healthy start.”
“And that’s the money that’s being taken away,” she said.
Some states have their own environmental justice agencies or laws and have filed motions to challenge the Trump administration’s direction. Others are continuing to lean on their own agency strategies amid the chaos.
The Massachusetts Department of Health, for example, was awarded a $191,000 grant for an asthma control project, another grant targeted for elimination.
In response to an interview request, an official with the state Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs said in a statement that the agency will “continue to invest in communities facing environmental challenges and extreme weather events.”
“We’re dedicated to promoting environmental justice and equity by breaking down barriers and creating economic opportunities for communities hit hard by pollution and climate change,” wrote Maria Belen Power, the office’s undersecretary of environmental justice and equity.
Climate disasters are on the rise. These states want to make oil companies pay.

Massachusetts, New Jersey and several other states filed a motion to defend a federal chemical accident safety rule. The attorneys general say the rule is a crucial tool to protect vulnerable communities near chemical manufacturing plants.
Continuing efforts
In 2020, New Jersey enacted a landmark law requiring the state to evaluate environmental and public health impacts of facilities on overburdened communities.
The law mandates permit denials if the facilities cannot avoid disproportionate impacts on the surrounding communities already deemed overburdened by industry. The state also uses an environmental public health and environmental justice tracking tool.
“Our [environmental justice] law and our rules are being appealed before our intermediate appellate court right now. There are some industry players who are concerned that it will scare away business,” Shawn LaTourette, New Jersey’s commissioner of environmental protection, told Stateline.
But LaTourette said the state is not pausing its environmental justice efforts in the meantime.
Meanwhile, Hathaway’s group, Lawyers for Good Government, is hearing from many organizations with unfinished efforts.
“Be it EV charging station infrastructure or improving bus idling in the cities,” Hathaway said. “There’s just so many programs that help neighborhoods be better places to live that states and communities were counting on.”
Abigail Fleming, associate director of the University of Miami’s Environmental Justice Clinic at the School of Law, said many groups the clinic works with have had their federal grants frozen, including grants toward air monitoring in Miami-Dade County and cleaner water.
“There was so much excitement about some of the future of these projects and what they could conquer,” Fleming said.
For Edmond, the St. Petersburg resident, that momentum isn’t over.
“We need to do it with or without the federal dollars,” he said.

(Taiwan Office of the President photo)JUNEAU — Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy flew to Taiwan last month to pitch business and government leaders on Alaska’s state-sponsored liquefied natural gas export project.
The same day Dunleavy and other Alaska officials arrived in Taipei on the unannounced trip, his office received an email from China’s vice consul in San Francisco, Ba Yanfeng. The consulate was aware that Dunleavy was leading a trip to the “province” of Taiwan, and Chinese government officials wanted a meeting with his chief of staff, Ba said.
Dunleavy had stepped into a simmering geopolitical conflict — an issue that China’s government describes as the most important and sensitive in its relationship with the U.S.
 
Take a trip to the Asian island that could play a role in Alaska’s future

	China claims Taiwan as its own territory and regularly conducts military drills nearby — including some that have simulated blockades and involved firing missiles over the island. 
The U.S. doesn’t officially recognize Taiwan’s independence. But it’s a longtime ally, sells arms to the government and has committed in legislation to support the island’s defense.

	In a formal follow-up note, the Chinese government said Dunleavy’s trip “sends a very wrong signal to the ‘Taiwan independence’ separatist forces,” and it urged the governor “to correct such mistakes and avoid their recurrence.”
But Dunleavy, in an interview, said he was undeterred. 
“I don’t allow myself to get pushed around by too many entities or people,” he said.
Alaska does significant trade with China, namely in seafood products, though that’s diminished since President Donald Trump began levying tariffs during his first term. Still, Alaska exports more than $500 million in seafood products to China each year.
But amid China’s broader, ongoing trade war with America, experts said it’s unlikely that the country will target Alaska with retaliatory action even if the LNG project moves forward with Taiwanese partnership.
“I think this is probably fairly low on China’s list of priorities. They have a lot on their plate,” said David Sacks, an expert on Taiwan and China and a fellow for Asia studies at the Council on Foreign Relations.
Sacks described the Chinese correspondence with Dunleavy’s office as “pretty pro forma,” even if it sounds strident. He also said there’s nothing unusual about an American governor or legislator traveling to Taiwan — and he noted that other states, like Arizona, have done robust business with Taiwanese firms without prompting a backlash from China.
“I think it would be fairly unprecedented for the Chinese to take aggressive action here that specifically targets Alaska,” he said.
Dunleavy’s trip to Taiwan last month came amid a new push by his administration to recruit investment in the $44 billion LNG development. Top Trump administration officials have also been touting the project to Asian allies, and a private firm, Glenfarne, has taken over leadership of the development from a state agency.
Dunleavy’s trip also included stops in Thailand, South Korea and Japan, where he met with politicians and corporate executives.
But his Taiwan visit garnered the most headlines. In Taipei, Dunleavy met for an hour with President Lai Ching-te and held a lunch with the vice president, according to his schedule. He also met with officials from Taipower, the country’s primary electric utility, and from the state-owned oil and gas company, CPC.

	CPC has signed a nonbinding letter of intent to buy one-third of the LNG produced by the Alaska project, and the letter also contemplates investment in the development, according to a description by officials from the state’s gas pipeline agency. The letter itself is confidential, according to the agency.
Promoters of Alaska’s LNG project, including Dunleavy and Republican U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, say that investment in and purchases of gas from the development can provide Asian allies with a secure source of fuel — with a shorter transit time than shipments from the Middle East. Importing Alaska gas would also lower Taiwan’s trade deficit with the U.S., which could curry favor with Trump.
But it’s still far from certain that the project will be built. Alaska’s government has spent decades studying construction of a gas line, and the current iteration of the project has been dogged by projected high costs.
Taiwanese investment in the project, and any American engagement with the island’s government, also risk pushback from China.
In a prepared statement to Northern Journal, the spokesman for China’s embassy in Washington, D.C., Liu Pengyu, called Taiwan “an inalienable part of China’s territory” and urged “the relevant U.S. side” to cease all forms of official contact with Taiwan. 
“China firmly opposes any form of official interaction between the United States and Taiwan, under any pretext or in any capacity,” the statement said.
Dunleavy, in the interview, said he did not know how the Chinese government became aware of his visit to the island. 
They “wanted me to abort the trip, apparently,” he said.
Dunleavy would not directly say whether he recognizes Taiwan’s sovereignty, calling that “the biggest loaded question.”
“These are human beings, 23 million people. They would like to have a great relationship with the United States,” he said. “We want to sell energy. They want energy. I’d love to partner.”
Alaska has a long history of trade with Taiwan, and other state officials have traveled there in recent years, including two state senators in 2024. Former Gov. Frank Murkowski has visited more than a dozen times, including as an observer of one of Taiwan’s presidential elections.
The Chinese response to Dunleavy’s trip, first reported by conservative news site Must Read Alaska, is “pretty boilerplate,” said Sacks, the expert from the Council of Foreign Relations. 
But its “ominous” language could also be an attempt by the Chinese to ward off business dealings in Taiwan by an American official who’s not well-versed in the island’s tense political dynamics, Sacks added, in comments that were echoed by a statement from the U.S. Department of State.
“Around the world, including in the United States, the Chinese Communist Party attempts to leverage economic and diplomatic pressure to try to prevent officials from interacting with Taiwan,” the statement said. “Robust cooperative activities with Taiwan, including by state leaders, are consistent with U.S. policy.” 
The statement added that the letter of intent from CPC “is another example of the longstanding, deep, and growing trade and investment ties between the United States and Taiwan, which create American jobs and mutual prosperity.”
Sacks said he sees the LNG project as being in America’s interests — both because of its potential to reduce Taiwan’s trade deficit and to give its people a more reliable supply of energy. 
But while Sacks described the risk of repercussions to Alaska as low, he also wouldn’t completely rule them out. He pointed to a recent move by China instructing the nation’s airlines to stop accepting deliveries of jets made by Boeing. 
“The context might change now, because the Chinese are looking for ways — in a way that they weren’t before — to punish the Trump administration for the tariffs,” Sacks said. “I wouldn’t foreclose that.”

States across the country are worried about losing pandemic aid that in some cases they’ve already spent or committed to spending. (Photo by Stephen Smith/The Associated Press)Early this month, the U.S. Department of Education issued an ultimatum to K-12 public schools and state education agencies: Certify that you are not engaging in discrimination under the banner of diversity, equity and inclusion, or risk losing federal funding — including billions in support for low-income students.
The backlash was immediate. Some states with Democratic governors refused to comply, arguing that the directive lacks legal basis, fails to clearly define what constitutes “illegal DEI practices,” and threatens vital equity-based initiatives in their schools.
After lawsuits from the National Education Association teachers union and the American Civil Liberties Union, the Department of Education agreed to delay enforcement until after April 24.
But states across the country, both liberal- and conservative-led, are worried about losing other aid: the pandemic-era money that in some cases they’ve already spent or committed to spending.
The Department of Education has long played a critical role in distributing federal funds to states for K-12 education, including Title I grants to boost staffing in schools with high percentages of low-income students, and emergency relief like that provided during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Conservative-led states — particularly Mississippi, South Dakota and Arkansas — rely the most heavily on these funds to sustain services in high-need districts.
The 15 states with the highest percentage of their K-12 budget coming from federal funding in fiscal year 2022 — the latest year with data available from the National Center for Education Statistics — voted for Trump in the 2024 presidential election. Similarly, 10 of the 15 states receiving the highest amounts of Title I funding in fiscal year 2024 also voted for Trump.
Mississippi and Kentucky have sent letters to the Department of Education expressing concern over halted pandemic aid.
The clash over federal funding comes even as the future of the Department of Education is murky, given President Donald Trump’s pledge to dismantle the department.
In Iowa, 14% of the state’s K-12 budget was funded by the federal government in 2022, according to the National Center for Education Statistics, with a total of $1.13 billion.
DEI-related cuts
In letters to the Department of Education, state officials and superintendents in Illinois, New York and Wisconsin pushed back against the DEI directive.
New York officials said they would not provide additional certification beyond what the state already has done, asserting that there “are no federal or State laws prohibiting the principles of DEI.” Illinois Superintendent Tony Sanders wrote that he was concerned that the Department of Education was changing the conditions of federal funding without a formal administrative process. Wisconsin Superintendent Jill Underly questioned the legality of the order.
New York State Department of Education Counsel and Deputy Commissioner Daniel Morton-Bentley noted that the federal department’s current stance on DEI starkly contrasts with its position during Trump’s first term, when then-Education Secretary Betsy DeVos supported such efforts.
Colorado and California also confirmed they would not comply with the Department of Education’s order.
While some states with liberal leaders are gearing up for legal battles and possible revocation of funding, conservative-led states such as Florida have embraced the federal directive as part of a broader push to reshape public education.
In Florida, anti-DEI laws have been in place dating back to 2023. In fact, many school districts and the state education department say they plan to follow the federal department’s directives, noting the similar state laws.
Pandemic aid cancellations
In March, the Department of Education abruptly rescinded previously approved extensions of pandemic-era aid, ending access to funds months ahead of the original March 2026 deadline.
When the Massachusetts governor’s office voiced concern over that decision, the federal department’s reply on social media was blunt: “COVID is over.”
Sixteen mostly Democratic-led states and the District of Columbia filed a federal lawsuit against the Department of Education and Secretary Linda McMahon, challenging the abrupt rescission of previously approved extensions for spending COVID-19 education relief funds.
But backlash against abrupt federal cuts to education has not been limited to blue states.
Federal cuts squeeze already-struggling food banks, school lunch programs
Mississippi’s Department of Education warned the cuts would jeopardize more than $137 million in already obligated funds, slated for literacy initiatives, mental health services and infrastructure repairs. “The impact of this sudden reversal is detrimental to Mississippi students,” state Superintendent Lance Evans wrote in a letter to McMahon.
The letter also outlines the state’s repeated — but unsuccessful — efforts to draw down millions in approved funds since February.
Shanderia Minor, a spokesperson for the Mississippi education department, told Stateline the agency is awaiting next steps and direction about the funds and federal directives.
In Kentucky, state Education Commissioner Robbie Fletcher told districts — which stand to lose tens of millions in pandemic aid — that abrupt federal changes leave them “in a difficult position,” with schools already having committed funds to teacher training and facility upgrades.
According to Kentucky Department of Education spokesperson Jennifer Ginn, the state has about $18 million in unspent pandemic aid funds left to distribute to districts. And districts have about $38 million in unspent funds, for a total $56 million that could be lost.
Lauren Farrow, a former Florida public school teacher, told Stateline that schools that receive Title I money are already underfunded — and the federal threat only widens the gap.
“Florida is pouring billions into education — but where is it going? Because we’re not seeing it in schools, especially not in Title I schools,” said Farrow. “I taught five minutes away from a wealthier school, and we didn’t even have pencils. Teachers were buying shoes for students. Why is that still happening?”
Effects in the classroom
Tafshier Cosby, senior director of the Center for Organizing and Partnerships at the National Parents Union, a parents advocacy group, told Stateline that while most families don’t fully understand the various school funding systems, they feel the impact of cuts in the classroom.











There’s so much fear around what we’re allowed to do now.


– Lauren Farrow, a former Florida public school teacher



Cosby said parents are worried about the loss of support services for students with disabilities, Title I impacts, and how debates about DEI may deflect from more urgent needs like literacy and teacher support.
“We’ve been clear: DEI isn’t the federal government’s role — it’s up to states,” she said. “But the confusion is real. And the impact could be devastating.”
Today, as a consultant working with teachers across Florida’s Orange County Public Schools — one of the largest districts in the country — Farrow says many educators are fearful and confused about how to support their students under changing DEI laws.
“Teachers are asking, ‘Does this mean I can’t seat a student with glasses at the front of the room anymore?’ There’s so much fear around what we’re allowed to do now.”
“There’s no one giving teachers guidance or even basic acknowledgment. We’re just left wondering what we’re allowed to say or do — and that’s dangerous.”

Wes Moore joined Maryland to California’s Advanced Clean Cars II program, pledging to slash greenhouse gas emissions by phasing out gasoline vehicle sales by 2035. Barely two years later, he signed an executive order delaying penalties for these Zero-Emission Vehicle Goals, blaming insufficient charging infrastructure.
The real culprit? A large portion of Maryland’s public chargers are utility-owned and routinely broken — mocking the drivers who rely on them and the ratepayers who funded them.
Since 2019, the Maryland Public Service Commission has let utilities like BGE, Pepco, Delmarva Power, Potomac Edison and SMECO operate public EV chargers in a pilot program now nearing its end. BGE alone spent $15 million installing chargers at libraries, parks and government buildings.
The utilities vowed these stations would match the reliability of their electric grid. Instead, they’ve delivered a charging disaster. Now, they want four more years — and more ratepayer cash — to keep it limping along.

The utilities’ pitch in 2018 was simple: Give us millions, and we’ll build a dependable electric vehicle network. But drivers know the truth: These chargers are often down. Worse, utilities outsourced most operations to third-party contractors. When a charger fails, EV drivers don’t call BGE for a quick fix — they’re stuck dialing a “network provider,” where complaints vanish into a virtual black hole, sometimes taking months to resolve. This isn’t service; it’s abandonment.
In 2023, the General Assembly demanded accountability, passing House Bill 834, the Electric Vehicle Charging Reliability Act, requiring 97% uptime, backed by quarterly reports and penalties for failure. Two years on, the Public Service Commission has yet to see those reports. Drivers, meanwhile, feel reliability worsening.
Moore’s executive order, citing the very infrastructure utilities failed to deliver, only deepens the distrust — easing pressure on automakers instead of fixing the public charging networks.
Fed up, I joined 12 other Maryland EV drivers to survey every fast charger statewide. Our Maryland Fast Charger Survey visited 304 locations, testing over 1,000 ports.
Tesla, running more than half of Maryland’s fast chargers, delivered 99.6% availability — 541 of 543 ports worked. BGE? A measly 33% (30 of 90 chargers operational). Delmarva Power’s Eastern Shore network was the worst at 31% (4 of 13). These aren’t chargers; They’re proof utilities can’t deliver.
Now, utilities propose bigger budgets for a second phase of the pilot program, funneling more money to contractors for obsolete chargers. Unlike Tesla’s stations—built near 24-hour stores with 8 to 16 plugs pumping up to 325 kW—most utility chargers are stuck at 50 kW, often with just one or two ports. They’re not at vibrant hubs but in desolate corners of parking lots, like behind state office buildings.
Why pour millions into slow, outdated chargers nobody wants to use?
Moore’s order admits the infrastructure isn’t ready, but after six years, that’s no excuse — it’s a failure of leadership. Utilities have had time and money to build a network that works. Instead, they’ve squandered trust and dollars.
The Public Service Commission must end this failed experiment, redirect funds to proven models like supporting commercial charger programs, and demand Moore recommit to Zero-Emission Vehicle Goals with infrastructure that delivers. Marylanders deserve better than broken chargers and weak promises. It’s time to pull the plug.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/54447410884_ae7daf624d_k-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-19 09:02:08.318787

(Ronda Churchill/Nevada Current)Five years of COVID-era relief for federally-insured mortgages has helped millions of American homeowners retain their properties, while artificially inflating home prices and leading to the potential for Bubble 2.0, insist some experts who are hailing a decision from President Donald Trump’s administration, announced Tuesday, to end one program in September.
The move comes after President Joe Biden, days before leaving office, instructed the Dept. of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to make the relief efforts permanent.
Critics of the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) COVID relief policy, which allows the agency to front payments on behalf of troubled borrowers, say it’s keeping unqualified borrowers in their homes without making a payment for two to three years, and delaying scarce inventory from going on the market.
COVID-era mortgage relief, initiated by Trump in 2020 and extended by Biden in 2021, “has created another subprime housing bubble and put taxpayers at risk. Trump should end it,” says a February editorial in the Wall Street Journal. “Under the guise of Covid relief, the Biden administration masked the growing troubles in the housing market by paying off borrowers and mortgage servicers to prevent foreclosures. Of the 52,531 FHA loans last year that went seriously delinquent within their first year, only nine resulted in foreclosure.”

Nationwide one in every 1,515 housing units had a foreclosure filing in the first quarter of 2025, reports ATTOM Data, a real estate analyst.  Nevada ranked third in the nation for the highest rate of foreclosure filings (behind Delaware and Illinois) with one filing for every 874 housing units.
By comparison, in 2008, at the height of the housing crisis, one in 14 Nevada homes received a default notice.
‘Canary in the coal mine’
The national delinquency rate for all mortgages, which topped 10% during the Great Recession, has been rising for more than a year and edged up to 3.53% in February, according to Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), a housing finance company.
FHA mortgages, which make up less than 15% of all active home loans, but allow higher debt ratios and smaller down payments than other loans, accounted for 90% of the 131,000 home loans that went delinquent last year, ICE reports.
Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody’s Analytics, tweeted last month the FHA delinquency rate is “Leading Indicator #2,” behind only consumer confidence on his recession watch, calling it “a proverbial canary in the coal mine…”
“Not that the financial troubles of FHA borrowers are enough to push the economy into recession. Indeed, high and middle-income mortgage borrowers are having no trouble making their payments at this time – the gap between the FHA delinquency rate and those on Fannie and Freddie loans has never been as large,” Zandi wrote. “But if the economy is headed for trouble, it is FHA borrowers who will signal it first. And they are.”
FHA loans, which are targeted to low-credit, first-time buyers, are a popular option for Nevada borrowers. In 2024, FHA served 766,942 new borrowers nationwide, including just under 11,000 in Nevada, according to its annual report.
Additionally, some 3,500 Nevadans have received assistance via federal relief programs in the last three years, according to the website for the Nevada Affordable Home Assistance Corporation’s (NAHAC), which administers relief programs for some 80 lenders.
‘Extend and pretend’ 
The COVID relief program allows FHA to make payments, called partial claims, (‘partial’ because the payment is not covering the entire debt) on behalf of delinquent borrowers, and add the amount fronted by the government to the back end of the loan, interest free. The FHA payments on behalf of borrowers cannot exceed 30% of a loan’s unpaid principal balance.
“Consider a borrower who misses five $4,000 monthly mortgage payments,” says the WSJ editorial. “The servicer will add the $20,000 in missed payments to the mortgage and reduce monthly payments by $1,000 for three years—adding another $36,000 to their mortgage. So the borrower is $56,000 deeper in debt, though with no additional interest.”
Mortgage expert John Comiskey projects the FHA “made ~2.6 billion dollars in mortgage payments from these stand alone partial claims last year.” Records analyzed by Comiskey indicate some borrowers made no payments for several years, with the FHA stepping in to bring their loans current every three to four months.
Comiskey, who calls the effort “an abject FHA loss mitigation policy failure,” tweeted last month that about 70% of some 160,000 FHA Covid relief modifications originated during the past two years are delinquent, and about 55% are seriously delinquent.
“The extend and pretend music is still playing for these mortgages, though that music now has an end date, and when it stops many of these mortgages will head to foreclosure,” Comiskey wrote last month. On Wednesday, the day after HUD’s announcement, he predicted the end of FHA loss mitigation “will start hitting housing transactions in early ‘26 with maybe some precursor effect late this year.”
“Let’s not forget the reason why most of these people are in trouble. It’s not because they make bad decisions like in 2008,” says longtime Las Vegas Realtor Steve Hawks, referring to borrowers who purchased multiple properties with no-money-down loans. “They’re in trouble because they can’t afford the cost of living. The home they bought for $300,000 is now $550,000. Their property taxes and home insurance have gone up. The cost of maintenance has gone through the roof. They’re using credit cards for everyday expenses.”
It’s unknown how many Nevada homeowners will be affected.
“FHA does not have publicly available information on its home retention solutions by state or dollar amount,” a HUD spokesperson said via email.
Hawks projects Nevada’s phantom inventory of homes with non-performing loans, but no public record of default, could be in the tens of thousands.
“It’s not rocket science,” he says, adding the writing was on the wall when home prices soared and inventory dropped in 2021 and 2022. “A lot of people that were going to sell took their houses off the market,” and opted for loan modification and forbearance programs.

FHA officials contend the relief has worked, and maintain it is fronting payments on behalf of a small percentage of borrowers. The measures “have proven to be effective in helping struggling homeowners avoid foreclosure and reduce losses,” FHA Commissioner Julia Gordan said just days before Biden left office.
From April of 2020 through September 2024, some 1.7 million FHA borrowers took part in COVID-19 forbearance, according to the agency’s 2024 annual report to Congress. Of those, 77% were able to get back on track, either paying off their loan or becoming current on their mortgages. Some 371,000 borrowers (22%) remained in delinquency or forbearance.
As of September 2024, FHA held active mortgage insurance on 7.81 million single family mortgage loans. The share of FHA borrowers who are seriously delinquent stood at 4.15% in September 2024, a slight increase from a year ago but consistent with rates seen prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Of some 425,000 loss mitigation actions reported by FHA to Congress in its 2024 annual report, just under 324,000 were partial claims.
Loan servicers receive a monetary incentive for participating in the relief program – between $500 and $1,750 every time the FHA steps up on behalf of borrowers.
“The FHA made 556,841 ‘incentive payments’ to servicers over the past year to prevent foreclosures—nearly as many as the new mortgages it insured,” says the WSJ editorial. “Government-backed mortgage relief has become a cash cow for servicers, some of which originated the risky loans they are paid not to foreclose. Moral hazard, anyone?”
Las Vegas real estate expert Tony Ricco says he contacted an FHA lender in an attempt to buy delinquent loans but was turned down. “Why would they sell them? They’re getting paid by the federal government on non-performing loans.”
Ricco says the level of manipulation in the housing market is preventing “true price discovery” and “is skewing housing to be unaffordable.”
The end of FHA loss mitigation could see “some additional homes entering the market from the seller’s side as either those borrowers are forced to sell to avoid foreclosure or once the foreclosure is complete,” says Nicholas Irwin, Research Director at UNLV’s Lied Center for Real Estate. “The tricky part is that foreclosed homes become HUD homes and I don’t know how quick the process is from foreclosure to on the market.”
Additional housing supply results in downward pressure on prices, Irwin says. “How much of an effect will depend on how many folks are impacted in our area.”
Unlike 2008, when most properties were privately held, government-sponsored entities such as FHA, the Veterans Administration, the U.S. Dept. of Agriculture, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac, have skin in the game on about half of all mortgages.
“The government’s not going to foreclose on these people just to put them on another relief program,” Hawks said. “That’s why they’ve been letting them go for this long.”

Senate Minority Leader Bobby Singleton, D-Greensboro, said after the bill’s passage that it potentially violates children’s constitutional rights, particularly free speech.
“When you start talking about fundamental rights. I think that’s going to be something that’s going to be challenged in courts too, in terms of whether or not — the constitutionality of — can you make kids listen to that on a daily basis, who may not want to and refuse,” Singleton said.
He also opposed making it a constitutional amendment, saying it would be “a forever permanent piece of law,” which he said was unnecessary. He said lawmakers should instead be focused on creating jobs and improving education in the state.
“I, too, am America, but do I have to love something that talks about me and the history of my slavery, that degrades me and my people? No, I don’t. So why make children have to sing that in school?” Singleton asked.

States worry that an executive order and federal funding cuts could weaken their cybersecurity efforts. (Joe Raedle/Getty Images)For the first half of his career in law enforcement, working as a police officer in South Florida, Chase Fopiano did not think cyberattacks on police agencies were a serious threat.
Many of his law enforcement colleagues were under the same impression — that since they were the most likely to investigate the attacks, there was no way cybercriminals would go after them.
By about 2015, as technology advanced and hackers became more creative, that changed, Fopiano said. Now, from the U.S. Secret Service to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, there are thousands of attempts to compromise networks or organizations every day, he said.
“A lot of those [attempts] are toward government or even police, especially because they know that we’re not as prepared as we should be,” said Fopiano, who now oversees cybersecurity as part of a regional task force.
Spanning health care facilities to court systems, states and local communities are facing a rise in cyberthreats. They include threats to critical infrastructure, increased activity from foreign actors, continued ransomware attacks and more, according to a recent report from the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center.
But President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order shifting some of the responsibility from the federal government to states and localities to improve their infrastructure to address risks, including cybercrimes. And federal cuts have reduced resources for state and local officials, including a cybersecurity grant program and a key cybersecurity agency.
States and localities are taking steps to address the problems, such as establishing new penalties for tampering with critical infrastructure, centralizing state IT personnel and setting standards in areas from elections to health care.
But the Trump order and federal funding cuts, a shortage of IT experts at the local level and an overall lack of preparedness could weaken their efforts.
In December, a major cyberattack forced Rhode Island to take down its online portal used by residents to obtain Medicaid benefits and SNAP, commonly known as food stamps. The personal data stolen from Rhode Island’s public benefits network — including Social Security numbers and banking information — was later found on the dark web.
In February, a “sophisticated cyberattack” hit the office of Virginia Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares, which led agency officials to shut down computer systems and resort to paper court filings.
Last week, hackers also breached the computer network of the Fall River School District in Massachusetts. The school district is working with third-party experts and law enforcement to determine if anyone’s personal information was targeted, according to MassLive.
In 2023, of the 48 states that participated in the Nationwide Cybersecurity Review, a voluntary self-assessment conducted by federal agencies that examines how well governments are prepared to respond to cyberattacks, only 22 states reached or surpassed the recommended levels of security in their systems.












The notion that the federal government could just withdraw and expect states and localities to step in is just not realistic.


– Samir Jain, Vice President of Policy at the Center for Democracy & Technology




Cybersecurity has become increasingly important over time because more government services and data are digitized, said Samir Jain, the vice president of policy at the Center for Democracy & Technology, a nonprofit that advocates for digital rights and freedom of expression.
But a national shortage of people with that expertise — especially at the local level — creates a challenge.
“The federal government has traditionally played at least some role in trying to fill some of those gaps,” Jain said. “And so the notion that the federal government could just withdraw and expect states and localities to step in is just not realistic.”
Local governments and law enforcement agencies also have other priorities, Fopiano said. The police need cars, guns, shields and other resources that generally take precedence over cybersecurity.
Today, Fopiano is the cybersecurity chair of the Southeast Regional Domestic Security Task Force in Florida, overseeing cyber activity from South Florida to the Florida Keys. The attacks continue to rise, he said.
“Terrorist groups are getting into cybercrime, cartels are getting into cybercrime, you have kids just learning about hacking and just fooling around,” he said. “The audience of who’s doing it has definitely expanded and led to that rise in overall cybercrime.”
 Cuts to federal resources

In 2022, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced a first-of-its-kind cybersecurity grant program, providing more than $1 billion in funding for states, localities, tribes and territories to address cybersecurity risks and threats.
The State and Local Cybersecurity Grant Program, created under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, awarded $279 million to states and localities in fiscal year 2024. The Tribal Cybersecurity Grant Program awarded another $18 million for tribes in its first year.
But the grant program is set to expire in September, with no current plans to renew it. At a hearing this month, several state and local officials urged Congress to reauthorize the program. But U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who refused the federal aid during her tenure as governor of South Dakota, questioned the program’s efficacy.
The Trump administration is also cutting as many as 1,300 employees from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, which administers the grants alongside the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
The program has allowed states to assess the security of their networks, develop cybersecurity training, implement multi-factor authentication features — which requires users to provide more than one form of verification to access a site or service — and much more, said Alex Whitaker, the director of government affairs at the National Association of State Chief Information Officers.
“This has been a really great program because we’re seeing a lot of great evidence for how states and their counterparts in local government are improving their cyber defenses,” Whitaker said.
Counties also rely on a number of federal resources to strengthen their defenses, including services provided by CISA, said Rita Reynolds, the chief information officer at the National Association of Counties and managing director for County Tech Xchange. NACo is an organization that represents county governments across the United States.
The Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center, for instance — a key collaboration between CISA and the Center for Internet Security to help state and local governments with cybersecurity operations — lost some of its federal funding for certain programs last month, Reynolds said.
In trying to keep up with emerging threats, counties are still trying to find resources to help them implement multi-factor authentication, convert government pages to “.gov” domains and other methods of protecting their infrastructure, she said.
“Are counties prepared?” Reynolds asked. “I would say they’re not as prepared as they’d like to be. And in some cases, they are looking at how to strategically approach this now that resources are disappearing.”
In a statement, CISA spokesperson Jared Auchey said Trump’s executive order empowers state and local governments “to make risk-informed decisions and investments to improve their preparedness.” The agency will work with state and local officials to ensure they have the information and support they need, Auchey added.
 Lawmakers step up

In 2024, 33 states adopted resolutions or enacted legislation regarding cybersecurity, according to a database from the National Conference of State Legislatures, a nonpartisan public officials’ association.
Many of those measures sought to protect states’ critical infrastructure, including water systems, government services, health care and more. Florida, Louisiana, West Virginia and other states created new criminal and civil penalties for people who attempt to tamper with critical infrastructure.
In Minnesota and Washington state, lawmakers passed measures allowing or requiring state and local governments to invest in cybersecurity protections related to election administration. Connecticut and Florida also passed legislation to secure health care facilities from cyberattacks by having hospitals create plans or by supporting investments in new technologies.
Other states are looking for solutions from outside vendors. South Dakota has set aside $7 million for a company to examine local governments for vulnerabilities to hackers.
With attacks occurring at every level of government, New Mexico Democratic state Sen. Michael Padilla, the Senate majority whip, sponsored legislation in 2023 to create the state’s office of cybersecurity. As chair of the Senate Science, Technology and Telecommunications Committee for 10 years, he plays a significant role in most of the state’s cybersecurity legislation.
Through the committee’s work, Padilla says New Mexico is in good shape to fend off cyberattacks — and the state’s cities and counties are joining in.
“I think New Mexico is in a very good position because what we decided to do by creating that office is to ensure that any transactions that occur with state government here [in New Mexico] have to meet a minimum set of security standards,” he said.
In Indiana, Republican state Sen. Liz Brown filed legislation that would encourage state agencies and groups to develop cybersecurity policies. The bill was approved by both chambers, with the Senate agreeing to changes sent from the House.
“You have to protect your infrastructure,” Brown said. “We don’t want utility systems to be shut down. We don’t want wastewater or freshwater treatment plants or even the water supply being contaminated or harmed in some way. Our systems all have backups, but even so, we know there are bad actors.”
Some states are also preparing to reshuffle their offices or create new ones to centralize their cybersecurity efforts. Arkansas, for example, enacted legislation this month to create a new state cybersecurity office, which will monitor the state’s computer networks and respond to cyberthreats.
In Alabama, rather than having information technology people scattered throughout the government, Republican state Rep. Mike Shaw wants cybersecurity personnel centrally managed.
Shaw’s legislation, which passed the House and is currently in the Senate, would give the Alabama Office of Information Technology central authority to maintain the needs of all of the state’s departments.
The centralization would make it easier to pursue cybersecurity initiatives in the future, Shaw said.
“The federal government is really big, and it’s really hard to come up with a one-size-fits-all solution for things like cybersecurity, data privacy and technology in general,” Shaw said. “So, in some sense, it’s good that the states are coming up with their own.”

(Photo courtesy of Washington State Department of Transportation)A creative plan in the Washington Legislature to raise billions of dollars to pay for the court-ordered removal of fish passage barriers appears to be a pipe dream, for this year at least. 
With just over a week until the scheduled end of the legislative session, the state Senate’s bipartisan proposal to borrow up to $5 billion to eliminate culverts faces, well, barriers on several fronts. 
Cities and counties fear missing out on state dollars for water, sewer and other projects that would be diverted to repay the culvert-removal bonds. 
And the governor’s office says the plan is coming at a bad time, given broad economic uncertainty.
The measure looked to help fulfill the state’s obligations under a 2013 federal injunction that the U.S. Supreme Court later upheld.
A judge found the state violated tribes’ treaty fishing rights by installing poorly designed and maintained culverts, typically pipes under roads or other infrastructure meant to allow water to flow. The judge’s order forced the state to pay to correct these barriers that impede salmon and steelhead migration in western Washington. 
The target has been to open up 90% of the habitat that culverts have long blocked by 2030. 
The state’s transportation department has estimated needing to address another 300 barriers to hit the benchmark. The most expensive remaining culvert projects range from $80 million to $240 million.
So last year, state officials returned to court to acknowledge they couldn’t meet the goal, as project costs have skyrocketed, and new barriers have been found.
The state and the 21 tribes that brought the original lawsuit are now going to mediation to potentially figure out a new path, recognizing Washington’s financial reality. 
Lawmakers hoped the cash infusion would show a good-faith effort to comply with the order as mediation begins. But opposition to the bond proposal appears insurmountable. 
“The state obviously has an obligation to meet,” said Rep. Steve Tharinger, D-Port Townsend, the House’s capital budget lead. “The question is how.”
The maneuver
The state’s transportation budget has traditionally paid for culvert projects. 
But like the state’s operating budget, transportation faces a major shortfall over the next few years. And the capital budget for construction projects is healthier, so senators moved the culvert funding over. 
This allowed the Senate transportation budget writers to cut in half their projected $8 billion shortfall over the next six years.
The transportation budget proposal from House Democrats does not include such a funding flip, instead earmarking more than $5 billion over the current budget and the next three budget cycles to pay for barrier elimination. The two chambers are currently negotiating over transportation funding.
The $5 billion in new bonds included in Senate Bill 5804, unveiled late last month, wouldn’t have to go toward state culvert removals specifically. The money could be used for both local and state projects identified as necessary through mediation. 
Even after the state removes its culverts, other downstream and upstream barriers continue to block fish passage and thwart Washington’s progress. 
Lawmakers looked to repay the bonds with revenue from an existing tax on electrical utilities that usually goes toward grants and loans for local public works departments. 
Enter the first concern: Local governments worry the redirection would threaten ongoing state money specifically set aside for their public works projects.  
The proposal’s supporters take issue with that critique. 
Sen. Mark Schoesler, R-Ritzville, said “some people are screaming wolf,” noting the capital budget proposal he helped write backfills the hole in public works money with $150 million in other bonds, for a total earmark of $250 million.
But Gov. Bob Ferguson has also snubbed the scheme. 
A letter from his budget director tells lawmakers that “given market uncertainty and volatile interest rates, this is not the time to explore a novel form of bonding outside of the state’s constitutional debt limit.”
The bonds the bill authorizes are separate from the “general obligation” bonds the state otherwise commonly uses. The usual bonds have low interest rates because they’re backed by the “full faith, credit, and taxing power of the state,” under the state Constitution. The proposed bonds are not, so they would carry higher borrowing costs.
The input disappointed Sen. Yasmin Trudeau, D-Tacoma. 
“My hope would’ve been that the governor would’ve been more enthused about this path forward,” she said, noting Ferguson was attorney general when the court case was decided.
Estimates from the state treasurer’s office also raised doubts that the utility tax could even generate the revenue necessary to service $5 billion in new debt.
Schoesler said he’s waiting for his colleagues to offer an alternative solution to what he described as “one of the biggest financial challenges” facing the state. 
“Show me a better idea,” he said.

He was named as President Donald Trump’s pick to lead the IRS in December, and in January received $137,000 in donations. He then paid back the remaining $130,000 in debt from a $250,000 loan he made to his unsuccessful 2022 U.S. Senate campaign.
The donations, and their timing, have renewed criticism of Long’s appointment, which still awaits Senate confirmation. Senate Democrats have already called for a criminal investigation of firms with ties to Long that they allege are involved in fraudulent tax credit schemes. 
Among the donors to Long’s campaign are financial advisers from some of those firms.
“When they told Billy he’d be in charge of revenue collection, did they forget to tell him that meant for the American people, not his own bank account?” said Sean Nicholson, a longtime progressive activist and campaign consultant in Missouri. 
Jordan Libowitz, vice president of communications for the liberal watchdog Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, said the timing of the donations and the “explicit knowledge that they’d end up directly in Long’s bank account, it’s hard to see them as anything other than an attempt to curry favor with the future head of the IRS.”
Long did not respond to a request for comment. 
Billy Long, Trump’s nominee to lead IRS, touts credential tax experts say is dubious

After a career as an auctioneer and conservative radio host, Long served six terms representing a Southwest Missouri congressional district. He gave up his seat to run for U.S. Senate in 2022, losing in the GOP primary to now-Sen. Eric Schmitt. 
Long then worked for Lifetime Advisors and earned at least $5,000 in income from White River Energy. Both companies have drawn scorn from Senate Democrats, and intense media scrutiny, over their involvement in controversial tax credit programs. 
In 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a limit on the amount of post-election funds a candidate can use to pay back personal loans. The majority found the limit an unconstitutional restriction on the freedom of speech, while the dissenting justices argued removing it would pave the way for political corruption.  
“Even if our broken campaign finance system allows this behavior,” Libowitz said, “it raises serious questions about future conflicts of interest and needs to be addressed in any hearings (Billy Long) has before Congress.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/candidatefilingday02222022000026-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-19 07:05:57.798734

Yet, all children and families are stretched thin, doing their best in systems that weren’t built for everyone to succeed—especially those who have been historically left behind.
Child maltreatment is a preventable, solvable, public issue when we invest in support and services for families when they need them. But for every $10 the U.S. spends on child welfare, only $1.50 goes toward primary prevention. That means most funding goes toward reacting after abuse or neglect has already happened—when investing earlier could strengthen families and give all children the nurturing, positive childhoods they deserve.
April is Child Abuse Prevention Month and it’s a time to promote the positive solutions that strengthen families and build strong foundations for children. This year’s campaign theme is Powered by Hope, Strengthened by Prevention. HOPE stands for Healthy Outcomes from Positive Experiences. Positive Childhood Experiences (PCEs) are experiences in childhood that build a child’s sense of belonging and connection. Studies indicate that the absence of positive experiences has a bigger impact on our health and wellbeing than the presence of Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs).
And we do feel hopeful this Child Abuse Prevention Month.
North Carolina Governor Josh Stein recently proposed over half a billion dollars in targeted tax relief to help working families cover the high costs of child care and other essential expenses that come with raising children, including:

Working families tax credit – 20% of federal Earned Income Tax Credit, worth up to $1,600
Child Tax Credit – Up to $300 for family of four
Child & Dependent Care Tax Credit – up to $600 for family of four
Back to school tax holiday

These proposals from the Governor are aligned with Positive Childhood Alliance North Carolina’s policy priorities and the positive experiences we hope to grow for all North Carolina children and families.
Just like no family can do it alone, neither can one single organization or agency. We urge the community to let your legislators know how these investments can strengthen families and prevent child abuse. It takes all of us—families, communities, policymakers, and organizations working together in partnership by:

Focusing on community-based solutions, such as local organizations like Family Resource Centers supporting families where they live.
Connecting families with support systems and building networks to support families and strengthen communities.
Advocating for policy change with programs and policies that help all children and families thrive– like affordable childcare, paid leave, and financial stability.

When parents and caregivers are overloaded with stress from financial insecurity, lack of health care, unstable housing, or the high cost of childcare, it’s like a car carrying too much weight—eventually, it breaks down. That overload of stress can then lead to a cascade of other problems including substance use, depression, and mental illness, some of the other major risk factors for maltreatment.
We must advance policies and practices that create the conditions proven by research to reduce the risk of maltreatment—because responding after harm has occurred is not enough. Addressing root causes by providing concrete support for parents is one of five protective factors proven to lower the risk of child maltreatment. Solutions such as paid family leave, housing assistance, and affordable childcare lightens the load and better equips parents to ensure their children’s well-being.
In addition, research shows that for every $1,000 that states invest in families living in poverty, Child Protective Service rates, foster care entries, and child fatalities drop. To reduce the number of children entering our child welfare system, which is also stressed and overloaded, we must invest in creating positive environments and experiences for families so that their children can thrive.
The bottom line: financial stability is foundational. By ensuring all families have access to support before challenges become crises, we can create a future filled with hope and opportunity. That’s good public policy and will create a healthier, more prosperous future for us all.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Postive-Childhood-Alliance-1024x459.png,,,2025-04-19 07:05:57.798734

Therefore, the relevant question we must ask ourselves writ large is this: is our goal as a society true justice or simply punishment? 
Research by pioneering psychologists like Erikson and Piaget is so respected that it is routinely taught in psychology textbooks. Although not indicated by name, that foundational research and the court’s indication that the neuroplasticity of a developing brain before the age of 25, as well as relevant case law, was instrumental in the decision to disallow the affected age group to be automatically sentenced to life without parole for first degree murder (building on the 2022 decision regarding 18-year-olds).  
Utilizing prevailing research as a component of legal decision-making is a win for logic, reasoning, and science but the dissenting opinion of the decision cannot be ignored. The dissent, penned by Chief Justice Clement, indicated that first degree murder is a grave offense, and, a “…punishment of great severity is therefore proportionate,” while also indicating that the majority decision focuses on examining the offender and not the offense.  
Therein lies the issue with what we tell ourselves, as a society, about how and why we incarcerate and hints at the reasoning behind the United States leading all developed nations in per capita prison populations.  Especially in Michigan. 
This is all rooted in the notion that we, as a society, view ourselves as a rehabilitative one that values change and personal responsibility… in theory. Faith-based and popular media stories routinely feature redemption arcs of men and women that have committed heinous crimes and acts but can find a place in society through change and sacrifice.  
The belief in these redemption arcs seem to end with Michigan’s prison population wherein, much like the dissenting opinion, a blanket punitive sentence is applied regardless of the rehabilitative potential of the offender. In large part based off the “tough on crime” rhetoric of the 1990s, the state is left with a prison population serving long sentences far greater than the majority of other states. The Council on Criminal Justice (2023) indicated that 66% of Michigan’s prison population is serving 10+ years based on 2016 releases and the average sentence is 20 years, which is much higher than most other states.  
It appears that we have not only given up the idea of rehabilitative incarceration but moved in the exact opposite direction. To date, the youngest ‘juvenile lifer’ in the state was Dontez Tillman. He was sentenced in 2011 at the age of 17 to life without parole for participating in the murder of a homeless man with friends where he was first arrested and in the system at 14. In 2025, he is now 30 years old. While Tillman was subsequently resentenced in 2015 to a term of 32-and-a-half to 60 years in prison, the earliest he could be set free is 2041.
If we continue to apply that blanket approach to sentencing and noting that only these long sentences can keep our communities safe, then are we to throw out the entirety of research on the matter, our purported belief in the ability for one to redeem themselves, and basic common sense? 
Although I have never met Mr. Tillman, I have encountered and worked in an academic and forensic setting with many men and women who are currently serving very long sentences for crimes committed in their youth. I would hazard that Mr. Tillman is a functionally different person than he was when he was in his adolescence. Recrimination and remorse are routinely part of an incarcerated person’s daily existence, but the system that we have in place does not have a mechanism to recognize that. If one can grow, learn, and become fundamentally changed in one environment, then that should apply to all environments… including our prison system. 
In addition, think of the standard brain development the court used to base the recent decision on. Brain development and socialization are not standardized, of course, but Piaget, Erikson, and others have mapped out general stages. However, some differences are common. This is under the assumption that development and socialization take place in an average society. What if, like Mr. Tillman and many others, that development takes place in a prison environment? 
There are no predictors on what incarceration does on brain development for adolescents, but the effects of incarceration on adults are startling. A rehabilitant society would never entertain the thought of allowing young people who have made terrible mistakes and choices to simply rot and, essentially, grow up in one of the most violent and hopeless landscapes imaginable.  
Yet, fear still pervades our societal view, and that fear means we must do whatever possible to ensure our safety. Just as long as that safety does not involve investing in the future of groups of people that we have already labeled as ‘monsters’ or ‘evil’. The use of those terms is low-hanging fruit for fearmongers, allowing an arbitrary, and largely fantastical, definition of a word to become the reasoning for disallowing a person to grow beyond what is ofttimes a single, horrible decision on a single, horrible day.  
As it stands, long prison sentences do nothing to actually make Michigan safer. They are not a deterrent to crime, quite obviously, and only function to punish without recourse. We only talk the rehabilitative game. 
Kudos to the Michigan Supreme Court for the current decision, but it does little to address the larger, systemic issues in sentencing in Michigan. As a society, allowing this decision to alleviate whatever pangs of guilt are felt whenever we see that our courts, much like an overzealous bartender, over serve justice to the cheers of voters is dangerous. I fear most people would agree with Chief Justice Clement’s dissent.

Kennedy Jr., President Donald Trump's pick for HHS secretary, appears at his nomination hearing before the Senate Finance Committee on Jan. 29, 2025. (Eric Harkleroad/KFF Health News)After the Senate voted to confirm Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as Health and Human Services secretary, supporters of his “Make America Healthy Again” movement cheered at having a champion in the federal government.
Now the grumbling has begun. Some of Kennedy’s allies say he’s become almost inaccessible since his confirmation and complain that he’s made glacial progress advancing MAHA goals, such as halting mRNA-based COVID shots and removing fluoride from drinking water.
The fractures underscore the clash between Kennedy’s movement and President Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” agenda. Kennedy is pulled between his supporters who want swift action to disrupt traditional health care and Trump, who is focused more on tariffs and increasing deportations than on disease, according to four people close to Kennedy who asked not to be identified because they weren’t authorized to speak to the press. Many of the priorities driving Kennedy’s MAHA program are not top priorities of his boss.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Kennedy’s capacity to navigate those tensions has been further strained by a measles outbreak and the threat of a bird flu pandemic, the people said.
Some of his deputies are still being vetted and other key positions remain unfilled. That, along with resignations of top HHS leaders and sweeping staffing reductions, has created a gap in expertise. Kennedy sometimes calls close informal advisers on the run before meetings, and the crises have put him in a reactionary stance, working on weekends and marshaling staff for Sunday meetings, according to the people.
More churn is coming because of an HHS reorganization set to eliminate about 20,000 jobs, including a 19% cut to the workforce at the FDA, which oversees food, nutrition, and vaccines.
HHS spokespeople didn’t respond to emails seeking comment.
To be sure, Kennedy’s ascendance represents a breakthrough for the MAHA movement, a broad collection of gadflies, groups, and wellness influencers who extol raw milk, metabolic health, and sustainable farming while lambasting Big Pharma, vaccines, and processed foods.
The coming months will test Kennedy’s ability to juggle the challenges and achieve Trump’s goals without losing the support of MAHA adherents, especially special interest and advocacy groups that helped him reach his influential perch overseeing one of the nation’s largest federal agencies. HHS, with a budget of almost $2 trillion, includes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institutes of Health, and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.
But the MAHA goals aren’t top agenda items for GOP voters, who tend to be focused more on the price of eggs than whether they’re organic.
The MAHA faithful “expect action” but their to-do list is not necessarily a high priority for voters or lawmakers, said Robert Blendon, a professor emeritus of health policy and political analysis at Harvard. “And should there be a big measles outbreak or avian flu, it would hurt the White House if there was a big conflict over vaccines going on,” he said.
An additional challenge for Kennedy is that not all MAHA and MAGA goals overlap. Trump wants to slash the workforce, which Kennedy has embraced. But fulfilling MAHA wishes will require more regulation, which runs counter to MAGA dogma favoring a smaller federal government.
MAHA wants fluoride out of water because followers say it leads to lower IQ levels in children, as well as arthritis and bone cancer. Kennedy said on X that fluoride is dangerous and that the Trump administration would recommend it be removed from America’s drinking water. Fluoridated water is credited for vastly reducing rates of tooth decay in the U.S. In 2015, the CDC called water fluoridation one of the 10 greatest public health achievements of the 20th century, and only 15% of Americans think fluoride is harmful or detrimental to the public, based on a poll in January by market research company Ipsos.

MAHA adherents believe in the debunked claim that vaccines cause autism, and Kennedy just tapped a vaccine opponent to work on a study on possible connections. In fact, HHS has launched an effort that Kennedy said will determine by September what has caused the “autism epidemic.” Many autism researchers say this timeline sows doubts about the study’s seriousness. Most voters support vaccines and believe in their benefits. Eight in 10 parents with children under age 18 say they normally keep them up to date with recommended childhood vaccines, according to a KFF poll in January.
And MAHA wants to replace seed oils, which the movement’s followers claim without evidence are unhealthy, with animal fats such as beef tallow, which is high in saturated fat, which can contribute to high cholesterol and heart disease. Only 13% of Americans believe seed oils are unhealthy to consume, based on a poll by the industry-backed International Food Information Council.
Perhaps no goal is more important to many MAHA followers, however, than banning the mRNA technology behind covid vaccines by Moderna and Pfizer.
“The big threat is that we still have covid-19 vaccines on the market,” said Peter McCullough, a former cardiologist who has been criticized for spreading covid misinformation and has informally advised Kennedy. “It’s horrendous. I would not hesitate; I would just pull it. What’s he waiting for?”
The FDA says COVID shots are safe. They are credited for saving millions of lives worldwide during the pandemic, and two NIH-funded scientists who advanced mRNA technology were awarded the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine in 2023.
Yanking authority for mRNA-based covid vaccines could backfire because Trump sees “Operation Warp Speed,” the federal effort to develop the shots, as one of his signature achievements, according to one of the people close to Kennedy. And it would have been impolitic to take action before the confirmation of an FDA commissioner, the person said. Marty Makary, a Johns Hopkins University researcher, was confirmed on March 25 to the post.
Kennedy also isn’t calling all the shots. He was initially unaware of the appointment of Gerald Parker, a veterinarian who recently chaired an NIH advisory board, to head the White House’s pandemic office, according to one of the people.
Kennedy did choose Susan Monarez, a former deputy director of the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health, as acting CDC director. Trump nominated her for Senate confirmation to lead the agency on March 24. Kennedy felt she had worked well with Trump’s job-cutting Department of Government Efficiency and did a great job in her acting director position, one of the people close to him said.
Kennedy is also in a difficult position regarding Trump’s Make America Healthy Again commission, which Kennedy chairs. The panel’s charge to investigate and deliver an action plan on the nation’s decades-long increase in chronic illness, with a special emphasis on children, is a clear pitch to the MAHA movement. But Trump has told Kennedy, according to one of the people, that he wants to see measurable progress in a year to 18 months — which is hard both to define and to achieve.
While Kennedy is a scion of the country’s most famous Democratic family, he is widely distrusted in the medical community because of his fringe views on vaccines and his rejection of established science. Since taking office, he has tried to cultivate relationships with MAGA-leaning state officials, including West Virginia’s governor, Republican Patrick Morrisey. And his alliance with Trump is new. When Kennedy was running for president in 2024, Trump took to his Truth Social platform to say, “Kennedy is a Radical Left Democrat, and always will be!!!” — though Trump’s administration includes other onetime adversaries such as Secretary of State Marco Rubio.
Many of Kennedy’s nutrition and health goals would require regulation, which clash with Trump’s anti-regulatory agenda and his focus on a lean federal government.
Meanwhile, he’s relied on his principal deputy chief of staff, Stefanie Spear, a longtime Kennedy aide who has taken on the role of traffic cop in the department. He’s also leaned on HHS chief of staff Heather Flick Melanson for expertise. She was a senior adviser to former HHS Secretary Alex Azar in Trump’s first term.
Kennedy’s close circle of informal advisers includes nontraditional doctors, fellow vaccine opponents, media personalities, and self-appointed health gurus. Some have gained unprecedented influence and access to the innermost workings of federal health agencies.
Calley Means, for example, is a Kennedy ally whose business sells wellness products such as saunas and supplements. His statements have dismayed some scientists, such as when he called covid vaccine mandates for children a “war crime” and said without evidence that “metabolically healthy” people don’t die from covid. In March, Means joined the White House as a special government employee and MAHA adviser.
Others in Kennedy’s orbit include Del Bigtree, a television producer who founded the anti-vaccination group Informed Consent Action Network, and some officials from the previous Trump administration. Aaron Siri, a lawyer for Kennedy, is no longer involved in vetting candidates for HHS positions, one of the people said.
“‘Nontraditional’ as a description for these people is not enough. We’re talking about beyond the outer fringes of medicine,” said Irwin Redlener, senior adviser for the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University, of Kennedy’s inner circle. “This faux expertise is really dangerous.”
Even as some MAHA adherents press for swifter action, Kennedy’s recent comments and actions suggest public health ideas once dismissed as fringe or unscientific now have an advocate at HHS.
Kennedy claimed without evidence that cod liver oil is an effective treatment for measles. He’s suggested letting the bird flu virus rip unchecked through infected chicken flocks even though scientists say that could unleash dangerous mutations.
And he’s backed cellphone bans in schools, saying phones cause cancer in kids. Most studies have found no such link.

Matthew Ariwoola, 32, was a fourth-year doctoral chemistry student at USC, scheduled to graduate in December. But on April 8, USC staff informed Ariwoola he could not continue studying and teaching due to a change in his immigration status.
U.S. District Judge Jacquelyn Austin granted a temporary order late Friday to prevent Ariwoola’s detention or deportation while the case makes its way through the court system.
In the order, which applies for two weeks, the judge wrote the government should not stop Ariwoola from “continuing to pursue his academic and employment pursuits that he is authorized to pursue.”
Ariwoola is one in a wave of more than 1,000 international students at colleges nationwide suddenly facing the possibility of arrest and deportation by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement after the Trump administration terminated their student visas.
In South Carolina, at least a dozen USC students, a pair of Furman University students, and some students at Clemson University have had their student visas revoked or records terminated without warning, according to Allen Chaney, the legal director of the ACLU of South Carolina who is representing Ariwoola. (Chaney said those are the students his organization knows about; there could be more.)
“Matthew is yet another victim of the Trump administration’s haphazard and flagrantly unconstitutional dragnet of our international students,” Chaney said. “It’s hard to see how ejecting a hardworking and law-abiding doctoral student is anything but the product of an unmasked hatred of non-Americans. No one is better off if Matthew is deported, no one.”
U.S. Senate GOP wants mass deportations to ‘start early’ next year, Graham says

International students enter the United States most commonly through the F-1 student visa program and are monitored through a federal database, known as the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS).
Once a student is granted a visa and residency status, they can typically stay in the U.S. even if that visa expires as long as they remain enrolled full time in school and aren’t convicted of a violent crime. There are also restrictions on off-campus jobs they’re authorized to take.
Ariwoola was researching ways to make medications more effective and teaching four chemistry courses at USC. He had been supporting his family through the stipend he receives from the university. Now he won’t be able to pay rent and could end up homeless, the ACLU of SC wrote.
Chaney said the federal immigration agency gave his client no warning that it intended to terminate his record.
The only reason listed in the federal database: “OTHER – Individual identified in criminal records check and/or has had their VISA revoked.”
“There’s no process, no notice, they’re just shipping them straight to termination,” Chaney said.
Ariwoola has never been convicted of a crime.
Police arrested him in 2023 on a warrant out of Georgia for alleged “theft by deception,” a crime which can involve the use of in-person or cyber scams to steal from a victim. But according to the ACLU, Ariwoola had never contacted the accuser and the prosecutor had dismissed all charges.
Historically, students whose visas were revoked or expired have not lost their legal residency status and could stay in the U.S. to finish school. It only prevented their leaving the U.S. and returning without reapplying.
In a similar case in Michigan involving four students from the University of Michigan and Wayne State University, lawyers from the government leaned into this, arguing in court documents filed this week that “terminating a record within SEVIS does not effectuate a visa revocation” because students can apply to have their status reinstated.
But immigration lawyers have questioned why Homeland Security terminated the records at all if it did not intend to revoke the students’ legal status.

Chaney also said applying for reinstatement involves a new set of arguments and assumes the student’s records were rightfully terminated in the first place.
“If ICE believes a student is deportable, it has the authority to initiate removal proceedings and make its case,” the ACLU of South Carolina wrote in court documents. “It cannot, however, misuse SEVIS to circumvent the law, strip students of status, and bully them into self-deporting without any process of law.”
The ACLU also argued in court documents that universities themselves could lose the ability to host any current or future international students if they fail to comply with federal regulations by allowing a student with a revoked status continue to attend.
This creates a self fulfilling prophesy, leading to visa revocation if a student can’t remain enrolled.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/SC25-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-19 06:03:08.463442

(Drew Angerer/Getty Images)Nearly every country in the world has a central bank — a public institution that manages a country’s currency and its monetary policy. And these banks have an extraordinary amount of power. By controlling the flow of money and credit in a country, they can affect economic growth, inflation, employment and financial stability.
These are powers that many politicians — including, currently, U.S. President Donald Trump — would seemingly like to control or at least manipulate. That’s because monetary policy can provide governments with economic boosts at key times, such as around elections or during periods of falling popularity.
The problem is that short-lived, politically motivated moves may be detrimental to the long-term economic well-being of a nation. They may, in other words, saddle the economy with problems further down the line.
That is why central banks across the globe tend to receive significant leeway to set interest rates independently and free from the electoral wishes of politicians.
In fact, monetary policymaking that is data-driven and technocratic, rather than politically motivated, has since the early 1990s been seen as the gold standard of governance of national finances. By and large, this arrangement, in which central bankers keep politicians at arm’s length, has achieved its main purpose: Inflation has been relatively low and stable in countries with independent central banks, such as Switzerland or Sweden — certainly until the pandemic and war in Europe began pushing up prices globally.
In comparison, countries such as Lebanon and Egypt, where independence was never extended, or Argentina and Turkey, where it has been curtailed, have experienced more bouts of high inflation.
But despite independence being seen to work, central banks over the past decade have come under increased pressure from politicians. They hope to keep interest rates low and reap voter gratitude for a humming economy and cheap loans.
Trump is one recent example. In his first term as president, he criticized his own choice to head the U.S. Federal Reserve and demanded lower interest rates. After Fed Chair Jerome Powell warned that tariffs are “highly likely” to trigger inflation, Trump lashed out on April 17, 2025, in an online post in which he accused Powell of being “TOO LATE AND WRONG” on interest rate cuts, while suggesting that the central banker’s “termination cannot come fast enough!”
As political economists, we are not surprised to see politicians try to exert influence on central banks. Monetary policy, even with independence, has always been political. For one thing, central banks remain part of the government bureaucracy, and independence granted to them can always be reversed — either by changing laws or backtracking on established practices.
Moreover, the reason politicians may want to interfere in monetary policy is that low interest rates remain a potent, quick method to boost an economy. And while politicians know that there are costs to besieging an independent central bank — financial markets may react negatively or inflation may flare up — short-term control of a powerful policy tool can prove irresistible.
 
Legislating independence
If monetary policy is such a coveted policy tool, how have central banks held off politicians and stayed independent? And is this independence being eroded?
Broadly, central banks are protected by laws that offer long tenures to their leadership, allow them to focus policy primarily on inflation, and severely limit lending to the rest of the government.
Of course, such legislation cannot anticipate all future contingencies, which may open the door for political interference or for practices that break the law. And sometimes central bankers are unceremoniously fired.
However, laws do keep politicians in line. For example, even in authoritarian countries, laws protecting central banks from political interference have helped reduce inflation and restricted central bank lending to the government.
In our own research, we have detailed the ways that laws have insulated central banks from the rest of the government, but also the recent trend of eroding this legal independence.
 
Politicizing appointees
Around the world, appointments to central bank leadership are political — elected politicians select candidates based on career credentials, political affiliation and, importantly, their dislike or tolerance of inflation.
But lawmakers in different countries exercise different degrees of political control.
A 2025 study shows that the large majority of central bank leaders — about 70% — are appointed by the head of government alone or with the intervention of other members of the executive branch. This ensures that the preferences of the central bank are closer to the government’s, which can boost the central bank’s legitimacy in democratic countries, but at the risk of permeability to political influence.
Alternatively, appointments can involve the legislative power or even the central bank’s own board. In the U.S., while the president nominates members of the Federal Reserve Board, the Senate can and has rejected unconventional or incompetent candidates.
Moreover, even if appointments are political, many central bankers stay in office long after the people who appointed them have been voted out. By the end of 2023, the most common length of the governors’ appointment is five years, and in 41 countries the legal mandate was six years or longer. Powell is set to stay on as Fed chair until his term expires in 2026. The Fed chair position has traditionally been protected by law, as Powell himself acknowledged in November 2024: “We’re not removable except for cause. We serve very long terms, seemingly endless terms. So we’re protected into law. Congress could change that law, but I don’t think there’s any danger of that.” But Trump’s firing of leaders of other independent federal agencies has set up a legal challenge that could affect the Fed, too.
In the 2000s, several countries shortened the tenure of their central banks’ governors to four or five years. Sometimes, this was part of broader restrictions in central bank independence, as was the case in Iceland in 2001, Ghana in 2002 and Romania in 2004.
 
The low inflation objective
As of 2023, all but six central banks globally had low inflation as their main goal. Yet many central banks are required by law to try to achieve additional and sometimes conflicting goals, such as financial stability, full employment or support for the government’s policies.
This is the case for 38 central banks that either have the explicit dual mandate of price stability and employment or more complex goals. In Argentina, for example, the central bank’s mandate is to provide “employment and economic development with social equity.”


Conflicting objectives can open central banks to politicization. In the U.S. the Federal Reserve has a dual mandate of stable prices and maximum sustainable employment. These goals are often complementary, and economists have argued that low inflation is a prerequisite for sustainable high levels of employment.
But in times of overlapping high inflation and high unemployment, such as in the late 1970s or when the COVID-19 crisis was winding down in 2022, the Fed’s dual mandate has become active territory for political wrangling.
Since 2000, at least 23 countries have expanded the focus of their central banks beyond just inflation.
 
Limits on government lending
The first central banks were created to help secure finance for governments fighting wars. But today, limiting lending to governments is at the core of protecting price stability from unsustainable fiscal spending.
History is dotted with the consequences of not doing so. In the 1960s and 1970s, for example, central banks in Latin America printed money to support their governments’ spending goals. But it resulted in massive inflation while not securing growth or political stability.
Today, limits on lending are strongly associated with lower inflation in the developing world. And central banks with high levels of independence can reject a government’s financing requests or dictate the terms of loans.
Yet over the past two decades, almost 40 countries have made their central banks less able to limit central government funding. In the more extreme examples — such as in Belarus, Ecuador or even New Zealand — they have turned the central bank into a potential financier for the government.
 
Scapegoating central bankers
In recent years, governments have tried to influence central banks by pushing for lower interest rates, making statements criticizing bank policy or calling for meetings with central bank leadership.
At the same time, politicians have blamed the same central bankers for a number of perceived failings: not anticipating economic shocks such as the 2007-09 financial crisis; exceeding their authority with quantitative easing; or creating massive inequality or instability while trying to save the financial sector.
And since mid-2021, major central banks have struggled to keep inflation low, raising questions from populist and antidemocratic politicians about the merits of an arm’s-length relationship.
But chipping away at central bank independence, as Trump appears to be doing with his open criticism of the Fed chair and implicit threats of dismissal, is a historically sure way to high inflation.

Garmatz U.S. Courthouse in Baltimore. (Photo by Christine Condon/ Maryland Matters)Attorneys for the U.S. Department of Education argued Friday that the department’s “Dear Colleague” letter criticizing some diversity, equity and inclusion practices was merely a reminder to schools that existing civil rights law protects white children from discrimination just as much as children from a minority group.
But to opponents, the letter represents a significant change in policy, which compels teachers to restrain their speech about diversity for fear that their schools could lose access to critical federal funding.
The arguments were part of wide-ranging hearing in U.S. District Court for Maryland over a lawsuit by the American Federation of Teachers, its Maryland chapter and the American Sociological Association seeking to block enforcement of the Feb. 14 letter, which says schools that do not comply with civil rights law “face potential loss of federal funding.”
“The government is saying, with its power of the purse: ‘We don’t like diversity, equity and inclusion,’” said Brooke Menschel, a senior attorney at Democracy Forward, who was representing the plaintiffs.
U.S. District Judge Stephanie Gallagher did not rule Friday on the request for a preliminary injunction that would prevent the government from enforcing its “Dear Colleague” letter, but said she plans to issue a written ruling in the days ahead. A similar case is unfolding in New Hampshire, where a federal judge heard arguments Thursday from the government, the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Education Association. That judge is also yet to rule.
On Friday, Gallagher peppered each side with questions on a number of grounds. Did teachers have standing to challenge rules directed at school districts and states? What type of action exactly did the letter constitute? And therefore, what procedural rules did the government have to follow in order to issue it?
At one point, Gallagher probed about how the “Dear Colleague” letter may be enforced, asking whether a school could come under investigation simply because one student reported feeling troubled by classroom discussions about the historical actions of a particular racial group.
“Some people are more sensitive to discussions in a classroom setting than others,” Gallagher said. “Where does that line get drawn?”
Brown joins another lawsuit against Trump administration, taking on Education Department

Abhishek Kambli, a Justice Department attorney, said the letter was not meant to police such classroom discussions. It was meant to address situations in which students are classified based on race, he said. He highlighted “privilege walks,” wherein participants are categorized based on advantages and disadvantages they’ve faced because of their backgrounds.
He argued that the Civil Rights Act already disallows such activities because they are discriminatory, even though the discrimination may victimize students who comprise a majority group rather than a minority.
“It’s highly unlikely that they’re going to go after a school because they taught a certain book,” Kambli said. “All this letter does is just clarify what the existing obligations are under Title VI [of the Civil Rights Act].”
“They’re trying to make the letter into something that it’s not,” Kambli said of plaintiffs.
But Menschel said that the department, through the letter, was “putting its thumb on the scale of a particular perspective,” causing reasonable teachers to fear reprisal because of particular classroom lessons, and thereby creating a chilling effect on school speech.
One passage in the letter says that “educational institutions have toxically indoctrinated students with the false premise that the United States is built upon ‘systemic and structural racism’ and advanced discriminatory policies and practices.” Menschel also pointed to the department’s creation of an online portal titled “End DEI,” through which community members can report instances of discrimination.
“The name of the portal itself points to exactly their perspective, and they are trying very hard to coerce people into sharing their views — and doing so under threat of withholding funds,” Menschel said.
But Kambli argued the portal’s name was just evidence that the department has a new priority in enforcing existing civil rights law: Rooting out discrimination occurring under the guise of “DEI.”
“It is perfectly allowable for the government to have a portal that’s aimed at that particular enforcement priority,” Kambli said.
A portion of Friday’s hearing focused on whether the teachers’ groups and the American Sociological Association had legal standing to file suit and seek a preliminary injunction.
Kambli argued that the Department of Education does not directly regulate individual teachers or school administrators, but rather school districts. The teachers would have to show that they sustained a direct harm from the Feb. 14 letter in order to have standing in court, he said.
But the department has yet to open an investigation focused on something like classroom speech, Kambli said, so the educators’ fears are only hypothetical in nature.
“If they’re censoring based off of something that the DCL [Dear Colleague letter] does not say is disallowed, then that harm is self-inflicted,” he said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
In March, the department announced that it had opened investigations into dozens of colleges and universities stemming from the Dear Colleague Letter. A department news release said 45 of the schools came under investigation because they were participating in “The Ph.D Project,” which the release called “an organization that purports to provide doctoral students with insights into obtaining a Ph.D. and networking opportunities, but limits eligibility based on the race of participants.”
Six schools came under investigation for “allegedly awarding impermissible race-based scholarships,” and one is being investigated for “allegedly administering a program that segregates students on the basis of race.”
Although none of those investigations focus on classroom speech in particular, Menschel said they provide a “relevant and important backdrop” for assessing teachers’ concerns that their own classroom conversations about diversity could result in their schools being penalized by the department.
To combat claims that the issuance of the Feb. 14 letter may have violated procedural rules, including by not offering an opportunity for public comment before implementation, Kambli argued that the department only issued the letter as a courtesy to schools. The department could have started investigating instances if considered problematic applications of DEI under existing law, he said.
“We didn’t have to provide any of this anyway,” Kambli said. “We did that to put the schools on as much notice as possible.”
But, Menschel asked, if the Dear Colleague letter didn’t represent a change in policy, why did the department pull “hundreds of pages” of prior civil rights guidance documents from its public-facing website?
Kambli argued that new presidential administrations are allowed to rescind Dear Colleague letters from prior administrations, calling it a “common practice.”
Menschel also said the department’s requirement that school systems certify their compliance with the letter indicates that it is a policy change. The plaintiffs asked\ Gallagher to pause enforcement of the letter as well as the certification requirement.
Gallagher said the latter request gave her pause, because the certification process was not mentioned in the plaintiffs’ original complaint, which focused entirely on the letter because the certification process had yet to be issued by the department.
“I’m struggling with the fact that I am being asked to enter a preliminary injunction with something that is not mentioned anywhere in the complaint,” Gallagher said.
But Menschel pushed back, arguing that the certification process is a continuation of the letter itself.
“The department is just recycling the letter, in a way, and taking another step toward implementation,” Menschel said.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_7527-1024x860.jpg,,,2025-04-19 05:00:42.067631

(Photo by Petty Officer 1st Class Luke Pinneo/U.S. Coast Guard)Officials at the state Department of Information Technology pushed back on a new audit that raises questions about how much progress has been made on issues found in earlier reviews.
The new report updates a 2024 review that cited more than a dozen concerns, including some redacted cybersecurity issues, at the department. While some progress had been made on those issues, auditors said the department “had not resolved some or all of the recommendations” from the earlier report.
But agency officials said they had fully implemented corrective action on four and were working on others. When auditors disagreed, Acting DoIT Secretary Melissa Leaman wrote in a response letter that “there are many factual inaccuracies in the draft report that we hope are addressed prior to OLA finalizing the report.”
It is common for auditors to share a draft copy of a report with department heads so that they can respond before an audit is released to the public.
The audit team said it stands by the accuracy of its report.
“DoIT’s response notes pervasive disagreement with our conclusions and several assertions that our comments were factually inaccurate,” Legislative Auditor Brian S. Tanen, wrote in the audit. “We reviewed DoIT’s responses and stand by the facts presented … which were factually accurate based upon documentation DoIT was able to provide during our fieldwork.”
The tug-of-war comes as lawmakers in Annapolis have taken a renewed interest in DoIT, following audits and concerns that the agency is not properly overseeing major and expensive technology projects. One top lawmaker characterized the agency’s efforts as a money pit.
The March 25 review by the Office of Legislative Audits looked at November 2024 to January 2025 and found that the department “had not resolved some or all of the recommendations in the 10 non-cybersecurity related findings” in a March 2024  report, that “concluded that DoIT’s accountability and compliance rating was unsatisfactory.”
The latest review showed many the earlier recommendations still unresolved, Tanen wrote in a letter to the legislative Joint Audit and Evaluation Committee.
DoIT claimed it had corrected concerns with ensuring major projects remained on time and on budget, evaluating outside project managers hired by contractors, and providing support documentation for costs in annual reports sent to the governor and legislature.
Auditors, in the most recent review, disagreed saying the efforts were “in progress.”
In another instance, auditors raised concerns about $25 million in cybersecurity remediation work orders. The auditor said the department had not done enough to ensure that nearly $12 million in work invoiced by the vendor related to those work orders.
The department reported to auditors that the issue had been corrected. Auditors, in their report, said corrective efforts were “in progress.”
The department also did not provide any updates on a nearly $589 million technology project called MDThink. Auditors said the recommendations from an earlier audit were not fully implemented.
The department has become a source of frustration for some lawmakers, including Sens. Katie Fry Hester (D-Howard and Montgomery) and Stephen S. Hershey Jr. (R-Upper Shore).
Both lawmakers said the agency’s “lack of clarity, authority and management and oversight really has led to poor project management, cost overruns and failures.”
One of those failures, according to Hester, was an 80% cost overrun on the MDThink project proposed by Gov. Larry Hogan (R). The senator called the resulting $588 million cost “pretty sad.”
Hester and Hershey sponsored a bill this year imposing more oversight over the agency.
The department also caught the attention of Senate Budget and Taxation Chair Sen. Guy Guzzone (D-Howard). He called the agency “a mess.” He added money for IT projects has been “going down a hole in many ways and in many projects. And it’s really a shame.”
The chair at the time vowed that the situation “has got to get handled, and it’s going to get handled.”
The General Assembly passed identical bills — House Bill 738 and Senate Bill 705 — aimed at refocusing the department on major projects and ensuring compliance with recommendations from the auditor. The bill now awaits action by Gov. Wes Moore (D).
Hester and Del. Anne Kaiser (D-Montgomery), sponsor of the House bill, are co-chairs of the Joint Committee on Cybersecurity and Information Technology.
The legislation as passed imposes new oversight and reporting requirements.
A key part of the bill expands and defines the responsibilities of the department secretary on oversight of major IT projects. The bill also prohibits contracting for IT services or products that are not consistent with its master plan.
The secretary must also meet quarterly with the chief information officer of agencies or departments with planned or ongoing IT projects.
It also sets up an expert panel to advise the legislature on IT issues and requires the Senate Budget and Taxation and House Health and Government Operations committees to convene a work group to evaluate the bill and other potential changes. The work group will also determine if other actions are needed to resolve issues raised by the auditor.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/1126510-newsletter-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-04-19 05:00:42.067631

(Diana Robinson Photography/Getty Images)Many Nebraskans are feeling pressure right now. Whether you’re a working parent in Scottsbluff, a small business owner in Omaha or one of the many farmers like myself in between, one word sums up the current economic mood: uncertainty.
Everyone’s watching their budgets a little more closely, wondering if they can still afford the same basic things they could a year ago.
That’s why we need our leaders in Washington, D.C., to step up. The people we elected to represent us were supposed to focus on lowering prices and making everyday goods more affordable. Instead, we’re dealing with another round of tariffs.
Just one set of tariffs, announced by President Donald Trump on April 2 — what he called “Liberation Day” — will cost the average American household about $2,100. If all of his proposed tariffs for 2025 go into effect? That number jumps to $3,800.
Pain is real
Nebraskans certainly didn’t vote in 2024 to have nearly four grand pulled out of our pockets.
The concern about costs isn’t a Republican issue or a Democrat issue: It’s an everybody issue.
Poll after poll shows the majority of voters are worried about prices. Even Trump’s own pollster found cost of living is the top concern for his supporters and swing voters. Nebraskans voted for policies that would ease inflation and let us keep more of what we earn. What we’ve gotten instead is the opposite.
The tariff-heavy approach doesn’t reflect the message many sent at the ballot box.
Inflation is already projected to go over 4% this year, and after the April tariff news, the stock market had its worst week since the COVID-19 pandemic. Consumer confidence has been dropping every month in 2025. It’s now the lowest it’s been since late 2022.
The hit to Nebraskans’ wallets is only part of the story. New tariffs are also hurting the backbone of Nebraska’s economy: agriculture.
We’re the Cornhusker State for a reason. Our corn production brings in more than $8 billion each year. But now our top export is at risk. In 2024, more than 90% of Nebraska’s corn exports went to Canada, Mexico and China, the countries being hit the hardest by these tariffs.
Agriculture always pays
This isn’t a new kind of pain for Nebraska’s farmers. Back in 2019, the Nebraska Farm Bureau said tariffs cost us $1 billion. That’s a tough pill to swallow, but for many farmers, it’s just more of the same.
Paul Krueger, a corn and soybean farmer from Bladen said it best: “Any time our country gets involved with any sort of tariffs that affect the agriculture industry, every farmer just kind of groans about that. We’re powerless to do anything except take what comes out in the wash.”
He’s right. And it’s not just farmers. It’s business owners across Nebraska who feel forgotten. While tariffs grab the spotlight, other policies that could actually help drive down costs are being pushed aside.
Take the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), which would extend tax cuts that spurred the economy during the president’s first term. This key legislation still hasn’t been extended. Policies that would cut red tape to empower small businesses are also on the backburner. Crucial industries like manufacturing, which is huge for our state, seem to be being ignored.
Tariffs can have a purpose. But the way they’re being used right now doesn’t match what voters asked for. Even some of President Trump’s former advisors have said we should’ve gone with tax cuts before tariffs.
It’s not too late
That said, it’s not too late. There’s still time to put working families first, to make the economy more affordable and to follow through on the promises that got officials elected.
Nebraska’s own U.S. Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., is moving in the right direction. He introduced a bill in Congress to give more say back to Congress on trade policy. He put it simply: “The Constitution is clear … Congress has the power of tariffs and taxes and we gave some of that power to the executive branch. … In hindsight, that was a mistake.”
It’s that kind of thinking we need. It shows he’s looking out for Nebraska families, farmers and workers who just want relief from rising costs.
We don’t need more economic strain. Nebraskans voted for lower prices and a better standard of living.
It’s time for our leaders to deliver.

(Pool photo by Trent Nelson/The Salt Lake Tribune)Is Utah’s “school choice” program unconstitutional? A year after Utah’s largest teacher union sued the state over that question, a 3rd District Court judge ruled that the program known as “Utah Fits All” violates the state constitution.
The Utah Education Association had argued that the Utah Fits All program violated articles III and X of the Utah Constitution because it was a “program within the public education system that is not free and is not ‘open to all the children of Utah,’” and diverts constitutionally appropriated funds from already underfunded public schools. 
The Utah Fits All program was established in 2023, providing up to $8,000 in scholarships per eligible student to cover private schools, or homeschool curriculums. In 2024, the Utah Legislature doubled the initial appropriation of $42.5 million in ongoing income tax revenue by adding an additional $40 million. And this year, that number grew $40 million more.

The money was enough to pay for the vouchers of 10,000 students — about 80% of them are homeschooled. But, with a waitlist of 17,000 and other irregularities in the expenses reported by parents, the Legislature this year approved a series of reforms, reducing scholarship amounts of homeschooled students to $4,000 a year for students ages 5 to 11 and $6,000 for ages 12 to 18. Those attending private schools can still receive $8,000 a year.
Lawmakers also prohibited some expenses like ski passes, furniture and musical instruments, and established a cap of 20% per scholarship for extracurriculars and physical education, an unpopular move among Utah Fits All parents.
In the decision, the court explained why its interpretation of the constitution sided with the UEA, especially highlighting a past Utah Supreme Court ruling that decided that the Legislature’s authority in establishing and maintaining the public education system is limited. “The legislature, for instance, cannot establish schools and programs that are not open to all the children of Utah or free from sectarian control,” the court wrote then.
The UEA celebrated the decision, describing it as a significant victory for public education. 
“This decision protects the integrity of public education, ensuring critical funding remains in schools that serve 90% of Utah’s children and prioritize equitable, inclusive opportunities for every student to succeed,” the union wrote in a statement. “It reinforces the belief that public education is a cornerstone of opportunity for all, regardless of background or circumstance.”

However, Republican leaders in the state lamented the decision and said they intended to continue the legal fight. House Speaker Mike Schultz, R-Hooper, called the ruling “a devastating setback for Utah families.” 
“We’re unwavering in our commitment to ensuring that every Utah student, irrespective of zip code or income, has equal access to the educational opportunities they rightfully deserve,” Schultz said in a statement. “We will vigorously pursue every avenue, including the Utah Supreme Court, to overturn this decision and restore hope for Utah’s students and families.”
Senate President Stuart Adams, R-Layton, and Gov. Spencer Cox expressed the same disappointment, with Cox adding in a social media post that the state “will be reviewing the ruling with our attorneys and preparing to appeal.”
However, the strongest reaction came from Rep. Candice Pierucci, R-Herriman, who sponsored the legislation that created Utah Fits All. She called the decision “judicial activism.” 
“It is not the job of judiciary to set policy on the bench and infuse personal opinion and ideology into their decisions. We are not done fighting this fight and will appeal this decision to the Utah Supreme Court,” she wrote in a statement.
Here’s why the court said the school choice program is unconstitutional:
Utah’s Education Article
“Utah’s Education Article does more than simply articulate a policy or aspiration, leaving the legislature with plenary authority to determine how best to accomplish it. It is a direct command to the legislature to perform a single duty: establish and maintain ‘the state’s education systems,’” Judge Laura Scott wrote in the decision. That includes a public education system open to all children of the state and a higher education system “free from sectarian control.”
The state had rejected that argument stating that the program “is expressly not part of the public education system.” 
However, the court said that the elementary and secondary schools funded through the program are not open to all, since all of them have some sort of application process with assessments, interviews or tests to determine if the student is “fit.” 
While private schools are prohibited from discriminating against students based on their race, color and national origin, “they are not prohibited from discriminating against students based on gender, religion, socio-economic status, disability, sexual orientation or political affiliation.” 
With reduced scholarship for homeschool students, Utah Fits All update poised to become law

Not only can schools deny admission because of these factors, the opinion reads, it also divides children into groups or classes — children attending public schools and children attending private schools — and “provides additional benefits to private or homeschooled children that may not be available to children attending public school, such as funds for computers, test prep courses, private tutoring,” among others.
Amendment G
In 2020 Utahns voted to pass Amendment G, which changed the Utah Constitution to allow intangible property or income tax revenue to support systems of higher education “and to support children and to support individuals with disabilities.”
While Utah GOP leaders said that the amendment allows them to run programs that are designed to support children, the UEA rejected that argument, stating that Amendment G was meant to allow using income tax to fund certain mental health and disability programs, which according to the court, is what the voters who approved the amendment understood with the language. 
That interpretation of Amendment G could also be attributed to the legislative debates on it. 
“No legislator ever mentioned ‘school choice’ or vouchers for children who do not have disabilities. No legislator ever suggested that Amendment G could be used to divert income tax revenue from public schools to private schools,” according to the opinion. The debates, instead, highlighted that the ballot question “would address budgetary constraints by allowing income tax revenue to fund certain social services programs” and “would strengthen public education funding.”

Under President Donald J. Trump’s leadership, we are unlocking the full potential of our offshore resources to benefit the American people for generations to come.”

	Most federal Arctic waters were previously put off-limits to oil leasing by former Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden.
President Trump attempted in his first term to open Arctic areas that Obama had withdrawn from the leasing program, but that attempt was struck down by a federal court.
A more recent Trump attempt to open withdrawn waters to oil leasing is now being challenged, as the first attempt was. A coalition of environmental groups sued the Trump administration in February over his efforts to overturn protections in the Northern Bering Sea and areas of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.
Environmentalists on Friday criticized the newly announced plans for more offshore oil leasing, including in the Arctic.
“Drilling in the Arctic is a disaster waiting to happen. There’s no way to clean up an oil spill there and it will harm polar bears and bowhead whales. Oil companies should think twice about drilling in the Arctic, as it has been plagued with challenges,” Natalie Jones of the Center for Biological Diversity said by email.
The Center for Biological Diversity is one of the environmental groups that sued the Trump administration in February.
Despite some sporadic attempts to explore for oil in federal Arctic waters off Alaska, there has never been any commercial oil production there or in any federal waters off Alaska, except for a small portion of the Hilcorp-operated Northstar field, which lies mostly on state territory.

Shell determined later that it could not salvage the Kulluk, and the company scrapped its Beaufort drilling plan that year. In 2015, it abandoned its entire Arctic offshore drilling plan.

	The field that was expected to become the first producing site located entirely in federal waters off Alaska, the Liberty project, has languished for decades without development. BP Exploration (Alaska) Inc. discovered it in the 1990s and drew up two separate development plans but wound up dropping those. Hilcorp acquired full ownership of Liberty in 2020, but its lack of progress on the project led to expiration of the leases earlier this year.
The last oil exploration attempt in federal Arctic waters was a Royal Dutch Shell campaign abandoned in 2015 after the company spent over $7 billion on it.
That campaign was beset with trouble — most notably, the wreck of a mobile drill rig that escaped its tow and grounded during a storm on Dec. 31, 2012. The rig, the Kulluk, had been used for Shell’s exploration in the Beaufort Sea, the portion of the Arctic Ocean east of Point Barrow. Shell used a separate drill ship in the Chukchi Sea, west of Point Barrow and north of the Bering Strait. That ship, the Noble Discoverer, also had numerous operational and environmental problems.
Shell wound up completing just one well, which was in the Chukchi, and the company concluded that it found too little oil there to justify further development.

Facing the continued collapse of Chinook salmon, officials today shut down California’s commercial salmon fishing season for an unprecedented third year in a row.
Under the decision by an interstate fisheries agency, recreational salmon fishing will be allowed in California for only brief windows of time this spring. This will be the first year that any sportfishing of Chinook has been allowed since 2022.
Today’s decision by the Pacific Fishery Management Council means that no salmon caught off California can be sold to retail consumers and restaurants for at least another year. In Oregon and Washington, commercial salmon fishing will remain open, although limited.
“From a salmon standpoint, it’s an environmental disaster. For the fishing industry, it’s a human tragedy, and it’s also an economic disaster,” said Scott Artis, executive director of the Golden State Salmon Association, an industry organization that has lobbied for river restoration and improved hatchery programs.
The decline of California’s salmon follows decades of deteriorating conditions in the waterways where the fish spawn each year, including the Sacramento and Klamath rivers.
California’s salmon are an ecological icon and a valued source of food for Native American tribes. The shutdown also has an economic toll: It has already put hundreds of commercial fishers and sportfishing boat operators out of work and affected thousands of people in communities and industries reliant on processing, selling and serving locally caught salmon.
California’s commercial fishery has never been closed for three years in a row before.
Some experts fear the conditions in California have been so poor for so long that Chinook may never rebound to fishable levels. Others remain hopeful for major recovery if the amounts of water diverted to farms and cities are reduced and wetlands kept dry by flood-control levees are restored.

This year’s recreational season includes several brief windows for fishing, including a weekend in June and another in July, or a quota of 7,000 fish.
Jared Davis, owner and operator of the Salty Lady in Sausalito, one of dozens of party boats that take paying customers fishing, thinks it’s likely that this quota will be met on the first open weekend for recreational fishing, scheduled for June 7-8.
“Obviously, the pressure is going to be intense, so everybody and their mother is going to be out on the water on those days,” he said. “When they hit that quota, it’s done.”
One member of the fishery council, Corey Ridings, voted against the proposed regulations after saying she was concerned that the first weekend would overshoot the 7,000-fish quota.
Davis said such a miniscule recreational season won’t help boat owners like him recover from past closures, though it will carry symbolic meaning.
“It might give California anglers a glimmer of hope and keep them from selling all their rods and buying golf clubs,” he said.










It continues to be devastating. Salmon has been the cornerstone of many of our ports for a long time. 


– Sarah Bates, commercial fisher based in San Francisco



	Sarah Bates, a commercial fisher based at San Francisco’s Fisherman’s Wharf, said the ongoing closure has stripped many boat owners of most of their income.
“It continues to be devastating,” she said. “Salmon has been the cornerstone of many of our ports for a long time.”
She said the shutdown also has trickle-down effects on a range of businesses that support the salmon fishery, such as fuel services, grocery stores and dockside ice machines.
“We’re also seeing a sort of a third wave … the general seafood market for local products has tanked,” such as rockfish and halibut. She said that many buyers are turning to farmed and wild salmon delivered from other regions instead.
Davis noted that federal emergency relief funds promised for the 2023 closure still have not arrived. “Nobody has seen a dime,” he said.
Fewer returning salmon
Before the Gold Rush, several million Chinook spawned annually in the river systems of the Central Valley and the state’s northern coast. Through much of the 20th century, California’s salmon fishery formed the economic backbone of coastal fishing ports, with fishers using hook and line pulling in millions of pounds in good years.
But in 2024, just 99,274 fall-run Chinook — the most commercially viable of the Central Valley’s four subpopulations — returned to the Sacramento River and its tributaries, substantially lower than the numbers in 2023. In 2022, fewer than 70,000 returned, one of the lowest estimates ever.

About 40,000 returned to the San Joaquin River. Fewer than 30,000 Chinook reached their spawning grounds in the Klamath River system, where the Hoopa, Yurok and Karuk tribes rely on the fish in years of abundance.
The decline of California’s salmon stems from nearly two centuries of damage inflicted on the rivers where salmon spend the first and final stages of their lives. Gold mining, logging and dam construction devastated watersheds. Levees constrained rivers, turning them into relatively sterile channels of fast-moving water while converting floodplains and wetlands into irrigated farmland.
Today, many of these impacts persist, along with water diversions, reduced flows and elevated river temperatures that frequently spell death for fertilized eggs and juvenile fish.
The future of California salmon is murky
Peter Moyle, a UC Davis fish biologist and professor emeritus, said recovery of self-sustaining populations may be possible in some tributaries of the Sacramento River.
“There are some opportunities for at least keeping runs going in parts of the Central Valley, but getting naturally spawning fish back in large numbers, I just can’t see it happening,” he said.
Jacob Katz, a biologist with the group California Trout, holds out hope for a future of flourishing Sacramento River Chinook. “We could have vibrant fall-run populations in a decade,” he said.
That will require major habitat restoration involving dam removals, reconstruction of levee systems to revive wetlands and floodplains, and reduced water diversions for agriculture — all measures fraught with cost, regulatory constraints, and controversy.

	State officials, recognizing the risk of extinction, have promoted salmon recovery as a policy goal for years. In early 2024, the Newsom administration released its California Salmon Strategy for a Hotter, Drier Future, a 37-page catalogue of proposed actions to mitigate environmental impacts and restore flows and habitat, all in the face of climate change.
California Department of Fish and Wildlife Director Charlton H. Bonham said the decision to allow limited recreational fishing “brings hope. We know, however, that this news brings little relief” to the industry.
He said salmon “are still recovering from severe drought and other climate challenges and have not yet benefitted from our consecutive years of wet winters and other actions taken to boost populations.”
However, Artis of Golden State Salmon Association said while the state’s salmon strategy includes some important items, it leaves out equally critical steps, such as protecting minimum flows for fish. He said salmon are threatened by proposed water projects endorsed by the Newsom administration.
“It fails to include some of the upcoming salmon-killing projects that the governor is pushing like Sites Reservoir and the Delta tunnel, and it ignores the fact that the Voluntary Agreements are designed to allow massive diversions of water,” he said.
Experts agree that an important key to rebuilding salmon runs is increasing the frequency and duration of shallow flooding in riverside riparian areas, or even fallow rice paddies — a program Katz has helped develop through his career.
On such seasonal floodplains, a shallow layer of water can help trigger an explosion of photosynthesis and food production, ultimately providing nutrition for juvenile salmon as they migrate out of the river system each spring.
Through meetings with farmers, urban water agencies and government officials, Rene Henery, California science director with Trout Unlimited, has helped draft an ambitious salmon recovery plan dubbed “Reorienting to Recovery.” Featuring habitat restoration, carefully managed harvests and generously enhanced river flows — especially in dry years — this framework, Henery said, could rebuild diminished Central Valley Chinook runs to more than 1.6 million adult fish per year over a 20-year period.
He said adversaries — often farmers and environmentalists — must shift from traditional feuds over water to more collaborative programs of restoring productive watersheds while maintaining productive agriculture.
As the recovery needle for Chinook moves in the wrong direction, Katz said deliberate action is urgent.
“We’re balanced on the edge of losing these populations,” he said. “We have to go big now. We have no other option.”

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Endowments have been around for a long time. Many universities have had them for decades and are major revenue generators. Have you ever heard a threat to overdraw an endowment fund? Probably not, because they are set up precisely to prevent that from happening. Unfortunately, our current Permanent Fund structure has a gaping hole in it that allows for all sorts of overdraw shenanigans to take place. Many would like to keep this topic as confusing as possible, but really it is quite simple and comes down to this: Would you rather have a portion of our largest savings account continually exposed to ill-advised ideas or would you rather have it all locked up and only allow a known amount to be drawn each year? I realize there are several iterations of how folks want to address this issue but if we are attempting to change the constitution, there is only one responsible way to do it: Move the entire fund under the constitutionally protected corpus.
Let’s start by discussing how the Alaska Permanent Fund Corp. views all the unwise ideas the Legislature has proposed to overdraw the fund. The APFC’s only concern is how much cash they need to keep available in case an imprudent idea passes. Legislation that causes uncertainty and thereby impairs the APFC’s ability to invest that cash has a profoundly deleterious impact on overall returns for the fund. 
There are two past examples which expose the need to protect the Permanent Fund from bad ideas. First, a few years ago the House was once again tied up in knots trying to balance their budget. To break the logjam, an amendment was introduced by a member to fund the entire budget, federal funds and all, from the earnings reserve account. I recall this would have amounted to a $12 billion draw. Fortunately, it failed.
Another example occurred when an overdraw of over $5 billion to back-fund PFDs actually passed due to a member being absent. The APFC had to take defensive measures and be prepared to have this additional $5 billion available for distribution.
What the funds were to be used for in either example is not relevant to this discussion even though the PFD continues to be a third-rail item. What is critical to understand is that the APFC had to keep cash available in case either idea passed. This prevents the APFC from keeping that money invested at a much higher rate than holding cash.
Let’s go over the Permanent Fund’s setup once more so we are all clear why the endowment plan is critical to the long term health of the fund. A noble goal espoused by many is to grow the fund to $100 billion, although we seem to have been stuck at about $80 billion for the past few years. We currently have a constitutionally protected portion — known as the corpus — which as of the end of February was about $60 billion of the $80 billion total. This cannot be touched without a constitutional amendment. The other $20 billion, or 25%, is in the earnings reserve account in various forms and is only statutorily protected. As an example, the PFD is also statutorily protected, and we have witnessed how closely that statute is followed. 
These past, real attempts to raid the fund demonstrate the exact reason an endowment is needed to protect the entire fund moving forward, so that future generations can enjoy the same benefits we have all enjoyed for the past four decades. Currently, it is too easy for individual legislators to introduce massive overdraw amendments. All that cash available with a mere majority vote is too tempting. The temptation will only worsen as oil prices drop.
If a constitutionally protected endowment is in place, the APFC would have the comfort and knowledge that a certain percentage of the fund — let’s use the current 5% — and only up to that amount would be required each July 1. Without getting into the more complex draw equation to minimize the annual changes to the draw, the draw of 5% would equate to about $4 billion.
Some might argue that goal is far too aggressive based on historical returns. History demonstrates that mistaken argument is based on the APFC having to sit on far too much cash in case the Legislature or executive branch takes action to overdraw the earnings reserve account. If this option is removed, the APFC would be able to be more aggressive in their investments. Loosening this restraint, even just a bit, could result in a percentage point or two increase in their annualized returns, leading to a real path toward $100 billion and beyond.  
I’ve heard so-called experts over the past few months misleading folks into believing the endowment plan is meant to expose the corpus to spending. Those same folks even suggest the fund will be drained. As a former APFC trustee, I know the endowment concept is to protect the fund for future generations. The concept is simple: Move the statutorily protected — in reality unprotected — earnings reserve account into the constitutionally protected corpus and allow for a known draw for years to come, thereby eliminating the opportunity for decision-makers to even introduce amendments to overdraw the fund. Anything other than moving the entire fund into a constitutionally protected status is not acceptable. The flexibility of always having the earnings reserve account there to overdraw as a “backup plan” has allowed decision-makers to kick the can down the road and not make the tough decisions that will benefit future generations.
The Legislature once again is wrapped around the budgetary axle as they engage in their annual battle on how to fund an ever-expanding government. There are too many variables at their disposal to distract them, such as the earnings reserve account,  oil prices and PFDs. As legislators continue to view the PFD as the main variable, this trainwreck will only get worse. I’m like many others who wish the PFD issue had been addressed when the percentage-based draw took effect several years ago. But it wasn’t, so here we are. Currently the debate is over how much money should be disbured through the PFD and how much new money should be directed to education.  
A constitutionally protected endowment fund producing a fixed, known amount at the beginning of each session coupled with a fairly known, but dwindling, oil revenue projection would take the PFD variable off the table. I’m not proposing anything when it comes to the future of the PFD. This is all about stabilizing the revenue streams we currently enjoy. Introducing income or sales taxes to fund our ever-expanding wish list is for another column.  
We will not be able to have an honest, educated discussion on future revenues and expenditures or the future of this great state until this issue is resolved and the ability to overdraw one of the last few accounts is removed as an option.

State legislators are beginning to recognize this with the introduction of bills like HB 2049, which proposes new revenue streams for education and creates a K-12 Funding Equity Work Group seated at the Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction.  
State leaders are using this moment to ask themselves how education funding should be more fairly and effectively allocated. But this will not be the first time the Legislature has asked that question or even created a work group to explore it. In fact, over the past 16 years, seven legislatively directed reports have explored and provided recommendations on various aspects of our K-12 funding system. (2009, 2009,  2010,  2012, 2012,  2019, and  2022). Unfortunately, these past reports have all fallen short in identifying an approach to resourcing schools that is consistent with the range of supports and services schools currently provide to students.  
Much has changed since our current approach to funding was established in 2010, and especially since the pandemic. There has been a significant shift in the depth and diversity of student needs. Whether it’s supporting mental health, addressing food and housing insecurity, or helping families navigate public systems, schools today are doing far more than delivering instruction. 
Schools have learned that when students’ basic needs are met, they can more effectively engage students in learning, so many districts have responded by working beyond their means to meet a growing diversity of student needs. This evolving role for schools has created a misalignment between what schools need to engage students in learning and how the state provides funding to schools. One of the key reasons this misalignment persists is that previous work groups and funding studies have failed to put the voices of historically marginalized communities at the center of their decision-making, especially students of color, students from low-income backgrounds, and those from families navigating systemic barriers. 
If Washington is serious about creating an education system rooted in equity, that commitment must be reflected not only in our funding formulas but also in how we define the problem and who gets to shape the solutions. Otherwise, we risk continuing the cycle: one where well-intentioned reforms claim equity as a goal but fail to deliver because they were built without the input of those most affected.
The lived experience of students and families is not anecdotal; it is expertise. When we not only invite but center that expertise in the decision-making process, we gain a more honest and accurate picture of what schools need. As we look to improve how we resource public K-12 education, we must use every tool available to design an education system that delivers the learning environments, supports, and opportunities all students deserve. 
If there was ever a moment to assemble a diverse working group focused on reassessing K-12 funding, it is now. We must ask ourselves: how will this be different? How will we ensure that students furthest from educational justice are at the forefront of this process? As funding decisions move forward, these must be the guiding commitments to ensure that real change is achieved.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/school-classrom-k-12-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-18 21:01:12.089651

States worry that an executive order and federal funding cuts could weaken their cybersecurity efforts. (Joe Raedle/Getty Images)For the first half of his career in law enforcement, working as a police officer in South Florida, Chase Fopiano did not think cyberattacks on police agencies were a serious threat.
Many of his law enforcement colleagues were under the same impression — that since they were the most likely to investigate the attacks, there was no way cybercriminals would go after them.
By about 2015, as technology advanced and hackers became more creative, that changed, Fopiano said. Now, from the U.S. Secret Service to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, there are thousands of attempts to compromise networks or organizations every day, he said.
“A lot of those [attempts] are toward government or even police, especially because they know that we’re not as prepared as we should be,” said Fopiano, who now oversees cybersecurity as part of a regional task force.
Spanning health care facilities to court systems, states and local communities are facing a rise in cyberthreats. They include threats to critical infrastructure, increased activity from foreign actors, continued ransomware attacks and more, according to a recent report from the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center.

But President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order shifting some of the responsibility from the federal government to states and localities to improve their infrastructure to address risks, including cybercrimes. And federal cuts have reduced resources for state and local officials, including a cybersecurity grant program and a key cybersecurity agency.
States and localities are taking steps to address the problems, such as establishing new penalties for tampering with critical infrastructure, centralizing state IT personnel and setting standards in areas from elections to health care.
But the Trump order and federal funding cuts, a shortage of IT experts at the local level and an overall lack of preparedness could weaken their efforts.
In December, a major cyberattack forced Rhode Island to take down its online portal used by residents to obtain Medicaid benefits and SNAP, commonly known as food stamps. The personal data stolen from Rhode Island’s public benefits network — including Social Security numbers and banking information — was later found on the dark web.
In February, a “sophisticated cyberattack” hit the office of Virginia Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares, which led agency officials to shut down computer systems and resort to paper court filings.
Last week, hackers also breached the computer network of the Fall River School District in Massachusetts. The school district is working with third-party experts and law enforcement to determine if anyone’s personal information was targeted, according to MassLive.
In 2023, of the 48 states that participated in the Nationwide Cybersecurity Review, a voluntary self-assessment conducted by federal agencies that examines how well governments are prepared to respond to cyberattacks, only 22 states reached or surpassed the recommended levels of security in their systems.



The notion that the federal government could just withdraw and expect states and localities to step in is just not realistic.


– Samir Jain, Vice President of Policy at the Center for Democracy & Technology


Cybersecurity has become increasingly important over time because more government services and data are digitized, said Samir Jain, the vice president of policy at the Center for Democracy & Technology, a nonprofit that advocates for digital rights and freedom of expression.
But a national shortage of people with that expertise — especially at the local level — creates a challenge.
“The federal government has traditionally played at least some role in trying to fill some of those gaps,” Jain said. “And so the notion that the federal government could just withdraw and expect states and localities to step in is just not realistic.”
Local governments and law enforcement agencies also have other priorities, Fopiano said. The police need cars, guns, shields and other resources that generally take precedence over cybersecurity.
Today, Fopiano is the cybersecurity chair of the Southeast Regional Domestic Security Task Force in Florida, overseeing cyber activity from South Florida to the Florida Keys. The attacks continue to rise, he said.
“Terrorist groups are getting into cybercrime, cartels are getting into cybercrime, you have kids just learning about hacking and just fooling around,” he said. “The audience of who’s doing it has definitely expanded and led to that rise in overall cybercrime.”
Cuts to federal resources
In 2022, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced a first-of-its-kind cybersecurity grant program, providing more than $1 billion in funding for states, localities, tribes and territories to address cybersecurity risks and threats.
The State and Local Cybersecurity Grant Program, created under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, awarded $279 million to states and localities in fiscal year 2024. The Tribal Cybersecurity Grant Program awarded another $18 million for tribes in its first year.
But the grant program is set to expire in September, with no current plans to renew it. At a hearing this month, several state and local officials urged Congress to reauthorize the program. But U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who refused the federal aid during her tenure as governor of South Dakota, questioned the program’s efficacy.
The Trump administration is also cutting as many as 1,300 employees from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, which administers the grants alongside the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

The program has allowed states to assess the security of their networks, develop cybersecurity training, implement multi-factor authentication features — which requires users to provide more than one form of verification to access a site or service — and much more, said Alex Whitaker, the director of government affairs at the National Association of State Chief Information Officers.
“This has been a really great program because we’re seeing a lot of great evidence for how states and their counterparts in local government are improving their cyber defenses,” Whitaker said.
Counties also rely on a number of federal resources to strengthen their defenses, including services provided by CISA, said Rita Reynolds, the chief information officer at the National Association of Counties and managing director for County Tech Xchange. NACo is an organization that represents county governments across the United States.
The Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center, for instance — a key collaboration between CISA and the Center for Internet Security to help state and local governments with cybersecurity operations — lost some of its federal funding for certain programs last month, Reynolds said.
In trying to keep up with emerging threats, counties are still trying to find resources to help them implement multi-factor authentication, convert government pages to “.gov” domains and other methods of protecting their infrastructure, she said.
“Are counties prepared?” Reynolds asked. “I would say they’re not as prepared as they’d like to be. And in some cases, they are looking at how to strategically approach this now that resources are disappearing.”
In a statement, CISA spokesperson Jared Auchey said Trump’s executive order empowers state and local governments “to make risk-informed decisions and investments to improve their preparedness.” The agency will work with state and local officials to ensure they have the information and support they need, Auchey added.
Lawmakers step up
In 2024, 33 states adopted resolutions or enacted legislation regarding cybersecurity, according to a database from the National Conference of State Legislatures, a nonpartisan public officials’ association.
Many of those measures sought to protect states’ critical infrastructure, including water systems, government services, health care and more. Florida, Louisiana, West Virginia and other states created new criminal and civil penalties for people who attempt to tamper with critical infrastructure.
In Minnesota and Washington state, lawmakers passed measures allowing or requiring state and local governments to invest in cybersecurity protections related to election administration. Connecticut and Florida also passed legislation to secure health care facilities from cyberattacks by having hospitals create plans or by supporting investments in new technologies.
Other states are looking for solutions from outside vendors. South Dakota has set aside $7 million for a company to examine local governments for vulnerabilities to hackers.

With attacks occurring at every level of government, New Mexico Democratic state Sen. Michael Padilla, the Senate majority whip, sponsored legislation in 2023 to create the state’s office of cybersecurity. As chair of the Senate Science, Technology and Telecommunications Committee for 10 years, he plays a significant role in most of the state’s cybersecurity legislation.
Through the committee’s work, Padilla says New Mexico is in good shape to fend off cyberattacks — and the state’s cities and counties are joining in.
“I think New Mexico is in a very good position because what we decided to do by creating that office is to ensure that any transactions that occur with state government here [in New Mexico] have to meet a minimum set of security standards,” he said.
In Indiana, Republican state Sen. Liz Brown filed legislation that would encourage state agencies and groups to develop cybersecurity policies. The bill was approved by both chambers, with the Senate agreeing to changes sent from the House.
“You have to protect your infrastructure,” Brown said. “We don’t want utility systems to be shut down. We don’t want wastewater or freshwater treatment plants or even the water supply being contaminated or harmed in some way. Our systems all have backups, but even so, we know there are bad actors.”
Some states are also preparing to reshuffle their offices or create new ones to centralize their cybersecurity efforts. Arkansas, for example, enacted legislation this month to create a new state cybersecurity office, which will monitor the state’s computer networks and respond to cyberthreats.
In Alabama, rather than having information technology people scattered throughout the government, Republican state Rep. Mike Shaw wants cybersecurity personnel centrally managed.
Shaw’s legislation, which passed the House and is currently in the Senate, would give the Alabama Office of Information Technology central authority to maintain the needs of all of the state’s departments.
The centralization would make it easier to pursue cybersecurity initiatives in the future, Shaw said.
“The federal government is really big, and it’s really hard to come up with a one-size-fits-all solution for things like cybersecurity, data privacy and technology in general,” Shaw said. “So, in some sense, it’s good that the states are coming up with their own.”

Hatch United States Courthouse is pictured in Salt Lake City on Wednesday, April 9, 2025. (McKenzie Romero/Utah News Dispatch)Eight international students in Utah whose permits to study in the country were revoked have sued the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for the “unilateral” and abrupt termination of their legal status in the country, forcing them to lose school time and jobs while subjecting them to detention and deportation. 
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) filed the lawsuit in federal court in Utah on behalf of the students on Friday, asking for a temporary restraining order halting the removal of the individuals’ records from Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVIS), a database that tracks their visa compliance and allows them to stay in the country while they complete their studies, or in the case of recent graduates, maintain an early career job.

That, after more than 50 students were reported to be impacted by status revocations in Utah, many without any type of notice. Some of them didn’t have links with protests or a criminal background, generating confusion on campuses. 
According to the suit, the Department of Homeland Security action violated the students’ rights for due process since they didn’t get a chance to contest the decision. It also alleges that erasing the SEVIS records was against federal law and violated the Constitution. 
“(The students) were following all their visa requirements and had committed nothing that should have changed their status,” Aaron Welcher, communication director for the ACLU of Utah, said on Friday.
The ACLU declined to release some details about the students to protect their privacy. However, the organization said they are from China, Nigeria, Mexico and Japan and are attending different universities across the state, including the University of Utah, Brigham Young University and Ensign College. A ninth student from BYU-Idaho was also included in the complaint. 
Cox asks for clarity from Trump administration on revoked student visas

The students have been experiencing high levels of stress and anxiety after learning about their status terminations, and are uncertain about their futures, including fears of being labeled a national security or foreign policy threat, forbidding them from reentering the United States or other countries.
“The abrupt and unexplained termination of these students’ lawful SEVIS registration is profoundly concerning. These students now face deportation or worse, placing their education and futures in jeopardy,” Tom Ford, staff attorney at the ACLU of Utah, said in the release. “Coordinated attacks on due process are paving the way for the kind of tyrannical government our Constitution was meant to prevent — and the ACLU of Utah is taking action to stop that abuse of power and keep rights intact for all of us.”
The termination of SEVIS records effectively ends the students’ permits to be in the country. While the students have the option to apply for reinstatement of status with USCIS, according to the lawsuit, the federal government has informed multiple schools that they will deny all reinstatement applications for students in this specific situation.
The new process of removing SEVIS records was also criticized in the suit.
“If ICE believes a student is deportable for having a revoked visa, it has the authority to initiate removal proceedings and make its case in court,” the lawsuit reads. “However, it cannot misuse SEVIS to circumvent the law, strip students of status, and drive them out of the country without process.”

Black maternal health advocates and researchers worry about federal funding cuts. (Courtesy of Birthlooms)Before everything went black, Tamika Jackson felt like she was drowning. While in labor giving birth to her baby boy, her body felt heavy and her breaths shallow.
“I can’t breathe,” she croaked to the anesthesiologist.
“If you couldn’t breathe, you wouldn’t be able to speak,” she recalled the doctor telling her, dismissing her as having a “panic attack.”
Minutes later, the 37-year-old’s lungs gave out. Her heart stopped beating.
Clinicians were able to resuscitate Jackson. Her baby boy was born via C-section, and the Michigan mom lived to tell her story of giving birth to Cree, who’s turning 3 next month.
Jackson is now a maternal health organizer at Mothering Justice, a Michigan-based nonprofit. She spoke with Stateline while on a bus to the Michigan Capitol, where she participated in a Black Maternal Health Week panel and pushed for a legislative package — nicknamed the Michigan Momnibus — which aims to increase obstetric patient protections and improve care for moms of color.
The Michigan Senate passed the package Thursday, and it now heads to the House.
Black moms like Jackson are three times more likely to die than white mothers and suffer higher rates of pregnancy-related complications.
But in its bid to eliminate federal diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, initiatives, the Trump administration has terminated community health grants and closed federal offices that support state efforts to tackle racial health disparities. Experts say the moves will hinder efforts to improve Black maternal health.
“DEI is not about politics. It’s about survival,” Jackson said. “This is about community-based solutions — and they’re undoing that.”
Jackson added that without federal dollars, “We’re going to be left trying to do a whole lot with a whole lot of nothing.”
The Trump administration has cut grants for maternal health studies and research on health disparities in various populations, including patients of color and LGBTQ people. It has laid off most staff at the federal Division of Reproductive Health, and removed maternal health data from federal agency websites.
It also is considering cutting next year’s budget for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services from about $121 billion to about $80.4 billion, according to The New York Times. The administration plans to create a new Administration for a Healthy America, which would focus on maternal and child health, among other issues.
HHS and its National Institutes of Health did not return requests for comment in time for publication.










DEI is not about politics. It’s about survival. 


– Tamika Jackson, Michigan mom and maternal health organizer at Mothering Justice 


Researchers and advocates like Jackson say that amid the Trump administration’s erasures, their work will continue.
Among those losing grants are nonprofits, health care systems and universities, including the Morehouse School of Medicine, a historically Black medical school in Atlanta, which received a $2.96 million grant for a center to improve the health of Black pregnant and postpartum women. Georgia has one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the nation.
“We are reviewing the situation to assess how it may affect our research,” a Morehouse spokesperson wrote in an email. “More broadly, it is important that we all recognize the critical role medical research plays in developing potential life-saving innovation that will mitigate disease and improve the health and well-being of many people.”

The Morehouse center was selected among an initial 10 research centers funded under the NIH’s Maternal health and Pregnancy Outcomes Vision for Everyone, or “IMPROVE,” Initiative.
Columbia University and community groups throughout New York also received the grants. One goal was to connect postpartum moms with doulas to detect conditions such as postpartum preeclampsia, according to principal investigator Dr. Uma Reddy, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Columbia. Reddy said the grant was developed with communities who voiced their needs.
“We can actually prevent these deaths and these serious complications,” Reddy said. “This is a way to focus on a high-risk population and provide them with the resources that they don’t have available.”
Maternal death reviews get political as state officials intrude

Tufts University maternal health scholar Ndidiamaka Amutah-Onukagha said she’s had several meetings in Washington, D.C., get canceled, and while she’s thankful to have almost completed one federal grant project, there’s uncertainty about other grants she’s applied for, including a Black postpartum support research initiative.
The professor runs the Maternal Outcomes for Translational Health Equity Research (MOTHER) Lab and Center for Black Maternal Health and Reproductive Justice at the Tufts University School of Medicine.
“It not only stalls progress, but it actually actively endangers the most vulnerable among us,” she said. “These policy decisions can cause and will cause lasting harm to people who are already underserved by our health care system.”
Amutah-Onukagha said she is urging researchers and advocates to have “cautious optimism.”
“Most people are in the space of gloom and doom. I do get that, and I’m vastly in and out of that,” she said. “But because of the work that I do in maternal health, we have to remain optimistic. That lens cannot die. If it does, then the communities that we serve are going to be even more disadvantaged.”
Amutah-Onukagha, who recently testified before the Massachusetts Joint Committee on Public Health, said her team will continue to work with organizations around the state, such as Birth Equity & Justice Massachusetts and Resilient Sisterhood Project.
“We’re stronger in numbers,” she said.
Diana Greene Foster, research director in reproductive health at the University of California, San Francisco, conducted the seminal Turnaway Study documenting the harms women suffer from abortion denials.
She was in the middle of another study, funded by a federal grant, tracking post-Roe abortions and the efficacy of health exceptions in abortion ban laws. Her team was interviewing emergency room doctors about whether they could provide abortions amid major pregnancy complications such as eclampsia, a serious consequence of preeclampsia, which is a dangerous form of high blood pressure that disproportionately affects Black mothers.
The administration pulled her grant.
Foster, who is fundraising to continue her study, said she feels the administration’s actions send a message of “turning their back on science, on compassion, on caring about women.”
To close racial gap in maternal health, some states take aim at implicit bias

Tina Sherman, a doula and national director of maternal justice at MomsRising, a nonpartisan women and mothers advocacy group, said she worries about data the administration has removed, including the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System.
The surveillance system is a comprehensive tool states use to track maternal health and formulate policies to improve it.
“An attempt to erase the data,” said Sherman, “doesn’t erase the harm that has been done and creates additional harm.”
Without data, states can’t target where resources are needed and which communities are disproportionately harmed and how, said Sherman, who co-chairs the North Carolina Maternal Mortality Review Committee.
“We’re going to be going backwards,” she said.
The Trump administration also canceled several grants focused on intimate partner violence, a leading cause of pregnancy-associated death which disproportionately affects people of color.
One such grant was supporting a University of North Carolina project studying intimate partner violence against pregnant women shortly before they give birth.
“The issues remain. The urgency is pressing as it ever was. The reality is this: Black mothers and birthing people continue to carry the weight of a crisis that we did not create,” Amutah-Onukagha said. “We did not create it, but we are leading the fight to solve it and dismantle it, and we know that the systemic barriers existed before this administration.
They will continue to show up — but we will also continue to produce cutting-edge research here at the center.”

(Photo by Blair Miller, Daily Montanan)A stalemate over property tax relief in both Montana Legislative chambers continues with little end in sight as disputes and heated floor sessions continue. 
Montana Senators left a marathon session on the floor without any property tax relief on Thursday after voting down two major pieces of legislation — House Bill 155 and House Bill 231.
In another twist, the House Taxation Committee on Friday morning amended Senate Bill 542, originally a two-year freeze on property taxes, into HB 155 and HB 231. House Bill 155, as amended, would reduce tax rates on residential and agricultural property.
“I think I’m optimistic it’ll be the vehicle,” Rep. Mark Thane, D-Missoula, who sponsored HB 155 said on Friday morning.
The Senate indefinitely postponed HB 231 on Thursday night, but HB 155 in amended form is technically still alive in the chamber. HB 231 was the preferred bill from the governor, and it would have shifted some tax burden onto those with multiple homes.
The 69th Legislative session began with a mandate — both self-imposed by legislators and by the Governor — to develop property tax relief. While movement has been slowly made on the issue, neither chamber has pushed through expansive property tax relief to the executive branch.
The House has had long discussions over the merits of Senate Bill 90, legislation that would take tourism tax dollars and use them for tax relief. That bill has yet to technically see the House floor, but has been discussed for around an hour total during failed blast motions on Wednesday and Thursday.
SB 90 and House Bill 924, legislation that would create a large trust, are also connected.
The discussions on the major bills have been occasionally emotional and often frustrated. It’s also been repeated many times in the hallways, in committee meetings and on the floor that Montanans will hold their elected officials accountable if they don’t pass real tax relief.
In the most recent reappraisal cycle, property taxes increased significantly, even leading to a lawsuit against the state. The worry for many Montanans? Being priced out of their homes with no place to go. Legislators on both sides of the aisle promised property tax help this session.
In the background, deals and arguments over what type of assistance is right for the state reign supreme. But the session is days from concluding and there is no consensus. 
“I think that this is going to be changing every five minutes for the next week,” Sen. Wylie Galt, R-Martinsdale said on Friday.
 ‘A thoughtfully developed solution’

Even before the session started, Gov. Greg Gianforte formed a task force to help, and from the beginning of the session this year, he looked to push and prod the Legislature to pass property tax reform, specifically in HB 231.
But both political parties are split into their own factions, responding to different political pressures and interests, and a majority has yet to coalesce around HB 231 or any other proposal. 
Some are interested in giving property taxpayers cash in the form of a credit or rebate, some want structural relief, some don’t understand why Montanans can’t have both, and some worry that plans to help residential payers will just hit industry instead.
That impasse has yet to be fully resolved.
There has been some friction between the branches, with legislative Republicans going so far as to issue a press release after the governor made comments about the slow pace of property tax legislation in March.
“The Governor understands the legislative process and should have submitted his proposals earlier if he wanted them enacted more quickly,” the press release stated.
In the meantime, legislators are cobbling together ideas. HB 231, brought by Rep. Llew Jones, R-Conrad, was recently described as a “Frankenstein” bill by Senate Taxation Committee Chairman Sen. Greg Hertz and has faced significant scrutiny.
For Hertz, who represents part of the Flathead, second-homes, including rentals, are common in his district and HB 231 would tax those at a higher rate.
He also said Jones had taken control of the finance and claims process, as well as the budgeting process.
“Now I believe he’s gotten himself into trouble,” Hertz said. “Because now we can only control the budget, but he has no balance over here to allow conservative Republicans to readjust the budget that happens this session.”
During a Thursday press conference, Gianforte reiterated his support for the Homestead exemption in House Bill 231.
“I continue to urge the legislature to keep its focus on Montanans who live in their primary residence, the place that they call home, and not on those who only live here part of the year,” Gianforte said. “Our homestead rate cut was a thoughtfully developed solution and a result of a diverse, bipartisan effort.”
 ‘Why can’t we do both?’

Republican Senate President Matt Regier has pushed Senate Bill 90, a tax rebate proposal.
Hertz has also said he’s in favor of SB 90, as are some House Republicans, including Billings Rep. Katie Zolnikov.
She brought the first motion to bring the tabled bill to the House floor and said the conversation around the legislation has become convoluted, challenging and difficult.
“The most frustrating part of the discussion is that most of the arguments against the bill basically utilize the assumption that this is the only property tax bill that we’re going to pass,” Zolnikov said in an interview. “And so it’s talked about as if it’s this mutually exclusive thing … SB 90 or nothing.”
She also said people then criticize the bill as not being meaningful reform.
“Of course it’s not meaningful reform,” she said. “You’re comparing apples to oranges here. But why can’t we do both?”
Some Democrats have also supported SB 90, including a cohort who has voted in favor of blast motions to move it to the House floor.
That coalition seems to have taken cues from House Minority leader Rep. Katie Sullivan, D-Missoula, who has voted in favor of bringing SB 90 to the floor twice.
But her caucus has not completely followed her lead. Sullivan had no comment on SB 90 when reached through staff.
For Rep. Jonathan Karlen, D-Missoula, who has been against SB 90, it’s a general fund issue. He’s concerned the rebate will just eat up more of the fund over time, and that it’s simply not enough relief.
“To me, it’s almost an insult to my constituents,” Karlen said. “If I’m like, ‘Hey, you know, guess what, the rates are still going to be the same, residential property taxpayers keep paying more and more of the total tax share. But don’t worry, we’re gonna give you $250 bucks.’”
When asked if he’d consider rebates as a property tax relief option, Gianforte said, “We’ve been pretty clear we need permanent, meaningful relief.”
 ‘The unique issue of Billings’

Local government policies are playing a role too.
A cohort of representatives from Montana’s largest city have an interest in avoiding the potential legal and constitutional issues related to language in HB 231 and HB 155. 
Under both bills, cities with a charter that has specific stipulations around how many mills they can levy without voter approval could stand to lose millions. This has Billings legislators on both sides of the aisle and in both chambers looking for answers.
“We feel that the unique issue of Billings needs to be taken into consideration when trying to come to a final resolution on property taxes,” Rep. Denise Baum, D-Billings, said in a Thursday text message. “We are hoping that SB 90 will become part of the solution in conjunction with an overall property tax reform.”
There’s also worry about the constitutionality of legislation surrounding solutions proposed for “the Billings problem,” something Hertz has repeatedly said in committee meetings.
During an impassioned Senate floor discussion on HB 231 on Thursday, Sen. Dave Fern, D-Whitefish, pushed back against the idea the potential city charter fixes would be unconstitutional. Fern was carrying the bill in the Senate. Karlen had similar thoughts on Billings Friday morning.
Charters were a problem with HB 155, too, and an amendment was added to that bill to address the issue.
“What I would say to folks in Billings is: You’ll be included in long term property tax relief,” Karlen said in an interview. “It’s just a little bit wonkier in how that happens.”
One of the proposed solutions is reimbursing local governments impacted by the issue with state money, an idea Gianforte indicated he wouldn’t support.
“The other hard line we’ve drawn is that we do not think we should take someone’s income tax dollars and use it to backfill local spending,” Gianforte said. “So that’s something we will not do.”
 ‘Plenty more work to do’

Galt also had a two year-property tax freeze bill he described April 3 on the Senate floor as a “backstop” and “Plan D.” 
It’s now dead, he said on Friday.
Some Republicans had considered the idea as an option — and not just as a last-ditch attempt to show the Legislature did something on property taxes.
“We’re looking at two weeks, if even less, and being out of here,” Regier said on Tuesday. “And so when things come together and come together fast, and that’s obviously one piece that needs to be talked about.”
But all language regarding a tax freeze was cut out, and while Galt’s name is at the top of House Bill 542, it’s a very different piece of legislation. The House Taxation committee approved a large amendment on Friday morning that creates a $400 tax credit for 2024 taxes paid and takes parts from other pieces of tax legislation. 
Residential rates in HB 542 for 2025 mirror language in House Bill 155, starting at 0.76% rate for residential properties. The calculation for 2026 rates are similar to what’s in HB 231. There’s also a fix in HB 542 for Billings and other cities where there has been conflict between bill language and a charter, though its legality is unclear.
House Speaker Brandon Ler, R-Savage said in the House Taxation committee on Friday morning that it was a good amendment and a step toward how the legislature is going to address property taxes.
“This amendment here kind of has a lot of fixes in it for a lot of different concerns that we’ve heard in the last 78 days,” Ler said.
Other supplementary property tax legislation beyond direct relief has passed out of the Legislature.
SB 117, which is on the Governor’s desk, will allow property taxes collected on new development to be used to offset taxes paid by existing homeowners and businesses. Regier has mentioned it several times as part of a fix for property taxes, and sponsor Sen. Daniel Zolnikov, R-Billings, said he was pleased it passed.
“We’ve got plenty more work to do on property taxes before we wrap up the session, but SB 117 is an important structural reform that will help contain property tax increases heading into the future, and we got it across the finish line,” Sen. Zolnikov said in a press release. “This is a long-term solution to a long-term problem of endless government growth.”
While bits and pieces of property tax legislation have gone through both chambers, no final long-term solution has gathered enough support to get it to the governor’s desk.
“A lot of times you don’t feel like you actually have input,” Rep. Zolnikov said. “Because things have been decided prior. Prior to a committee meeting, prior to a floor vote, prior to the session in general.”
What may have been decided remains to be seen as frustration mounts.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/property-tax-task-force-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-18 20:07:15.493540

Free bus passes
Sean Tommany, principal of University High School of Science and Engineering in Hartford, remembers how he scolded a student who came into school late. The student insisted that the bus he’d tried to board was packed. “The bus was so full, he couldn’t get on,” Tommany told the Juvenile Justice Policy and Oversight Committee on Thursday.
Tommany was speaking in favor of SB 1243, a bill that would set up a state program allowing school districts to apply to the Department of Transportation for bus passes, which the schools could either distribute to students for free or sell to them at a low cost.
Last year, the state of Connecticut granted Hartford Public Schools $175,000 for a pilot program to give students free bus passes. Tommany said that the first month, students rode the bus about 4,500 times.
Oluwaseyi Oluborode, said that her high school has a dual enrollment program with the University of Hartford. Since many of the classes take place after school, students often can’t attend without bus passes. She also recounted her own experience of losing transportation when her parents’ work schedules changed. “I would hesitate to commit to things after school, and I dropped out of volleyball,” she said.
The bill would require the school districts to pick up any additional costs that the reduced or free passes would put on the state. It’s not clear how much the passes would cost each municipality.

PURA ordered to turn over records
A New Britain Superior Court judge this week ordered the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority to turn over certain records to Avangrid’s two gas utility companies in their appeal of regulators’ decision to cut gas rates.
In February, those utilities requested discovery of documents relating to their claims that PURA Chair Marissa Gillett bypassed other members of the commission by issuing unilateral decisions during the rate case, and that she secretly helped review an op-ed published in The Connecticut Mirror by two lawmakers critical of the utilities. (Both lawmakers have denied that Gillett helped write the piece).
Attorneys for PURA objected to the motion, arguing that it was premature and part of a larger campaign by the utilities to discredit PURA and Gillett.
In his decision on Wednesday, however, Superior Court Judge Matthew Budzik wrote that there was some merit to the utilities’ request and ordered PURA to hand over documents detailing the agency’s decision-making procedures in rate cases, as well as any documents related to the “drafting or authorship” of the op-ed. Those records must be turned over in 15 days, Budzik said.
Bodzik denied a third request for discovery regarding allegations of ex-parte communications between Gillett and a PURA staffer about language that appeared on the agency’s website.
In January, Avangrid and Eversource both sued PURA making similar claims that Gillett was wielding unilateral control over the agency. That case has yet to be decided.Representatives for PURA did not immediately respond to requests for comment Friday.

(Courtesy of the Shoshone-Pauite Tribes)The Shoshone-Paiute Tribes are developing their first resort and casino along Interstate 84 halfway between Boise and Mountain Home. 
For decades, the Shoshone-Paiute Tribes were the only tribe in Idaho without revenue. But the proposed resort and casino is estimated to generate tens of millions of dollars annually for Idaho’s economy and create thousands of regional jobs. The Shoshone-Paiute Tribes also plan to share 5% of their net gaming revenues to support local schools and education programs.
Shoshone-Paiute Chairman Brian Mason said in a press release he dreams of a future where tribal members have the resources, education, health care and employment opportunities they need to sustain their families and preserve their culture. 
“Today, we have no meaningful economic opportunities and our community is facing some heavy challenges because of it,” Mason said. “We want to solve our own problems and provide for our people. Tribal gaming will allow us to make these dreams into a reality.”
 Shoshone-Paiute Tribes partner with Coeur d’Alene Tribe

The tribes are partnering with the Coeur d’Alene Tribe, who has successfully run gaming operations in North Idaho for more than 30 years. 
The Coeur d’Alene Tribe is providing a large upfront investment to help with the permitting and development process, and once it is built, the Tribe will enter into a management contract with the Shoshone-Paiute Tribes to help sustain the casino. 
Coeur d’Alene Chairman Chief Allan said the tribe is honored to help its “brothers and sisters” secure the same benefits they have experienced from gaming. 
“When I was growing up, many tribal members lived in poverty and could not find jobs,” Allan said in the press release. “Today, we have a state-of-the-art medical center, ample employment for tribal members and can financially support every tribal member who wants to earn a college degree. None of this would be possible without tribal gaming.”
Tribal gaming already contributes more than $1.4 billion of annual economic activity to the state, over $47 million in annual tax revenue and it sustains 12,500 Idaho jobs, according to a press release from the Shoshone-Paiute Tribes. 
 Tribe chairman says casino will provide resources to strengthen community

The Duck Valley Indian Reservation spans about 450 square miles in the southwest corner of Idaho, half split into parts of Nevada.
The tribes, according to the press release, face high rates of suicide and unemployment, and given its isolated location in the high desert, the Shoshone-Paiute community struggles to provide emergency services to its members.
Medical emergencies require lifesaving air transportation to Boise, which takes at least 45 minutes. A typical 911 call can take two hours to be answered because there are no tribal law enforcement officers exclusively dedicated to serving Duck Valley. Education funding is another major issue, and the school cannot attract enough certified teachers because of limited housing and other resources in the area, according to the press release
“The challenges we face daily are not insurmountable. We simply need resources to invest in long-term solutions for our people,” Mason said. “Gaming will give us the tools we need to strengthen our community, grow our infrastructure and provide more opportunities to our youth for generations to come.”  
The planned location is where the Shoshone-Paiute Tribes used to live, hunt and care for the natural resources. The planned casino will include gaming machines, luxury hotel rooms, a spa, entertainment center and fine dining options. 
To build this project on tribal land outside of the reservation, the Shoshone-Paiute Tribes will follow the established process set out by the U.S. Department of the Interior and plan to submit their initial application later this year.

,Kansas Reflector,2025-04-18 23:03:48+00:00,Kansas Reflector,Kansas abortion clinics saw sizable majority of clients from out of state in 2024,Anna Kaminski,,,,,https://kansasreflector.com/briefs/kansas-abortion-clinics-saw-sizable-majority-of-clients-from-out-of-state-in-2024/,A Planned Parenthood clinic that opened in August in Pittsburg marks Kansas' fourth clinic and has increased access to abortions for the region(Grace Hills/Kansas Reflector),"TOPEKA — More than 70% of abortions performed in 2024 in Kansas were for out-of-state residents, according to monthly estimates of clinician-provided abortions in states without total bans.
Overall, Kansas was among the top five states in the country with the most substantial increases in abortions performed between 2023 and 2024, with about an 18% increase.
That increase was driven by non-Kansans seeking care, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a health policy research and advocacy organization, that released a report of monthly abortion estimates on April 15.
The report found that clinicians provided more than 1 million abortions in the United States in 2024, an increase of less than 1% from 2023.
Across the country, fewer people generally traveled across state lines seeking abortions in 2024 than in 2023. However, Kansas was an outlier.
Kansas clinicians provided more than 16,000 abortions to out-of state residents in 2024, a 3,300-case increase from 2023. Those abortions accounted for 71% of all abortion performed in the state.
“The latest abortion travel data are a clear reminder that the impact of a state’s abortion policies extends far beyond its borders,” said Kimya Forouzan, the institute’s principal state policy advisor.
The report specifically called out Kansas and Virginia as states with substantial abortion growth driven by out-of-state residents.
“This increase in travel from other states was the main driver of increased abortion counts overall in both states, although other factors like expanded clinic capacity also may have increased access for state residents,” the report said.
Emily Wales, the CEO and president of Planned Parenthood of the Great Plains, said the increase was expected.
Planned Parenthood’s clinics saw people seeking miscarriage management, victims of sexual assault and pregnancies with fetal anomalies. All were in need of care in Kansas because restrictions in their own states were too narrow.
“Too often those patients are being turned away,” Wales said.
Kansas has been a “critical point of access,” she said. Planned Parenthood opened a fourth clinic in August in Pittsburg, creating further regional support. 
People living in states with total bans have few states to choose from, Wales said, so proximity to a major highway or airport and travel affordability become major factors in the decision to seek out-of-state care.
An inflow of more than 5,800 Texans, almost 3,000 Oklahomans, 2,860 Missourians, about 520 Arkansans and 150 Louisianans visited Kansas for an abortion in 2024. States with fewer than 100 people seeking care in Kansas were not identified in the report. Most of those who traveled — more than 14,500 people — received care at a Planned Parenthood clinic, Wales said.
While federal and state restrictions continue to settle, Wales believes people are still frustrated and paying attention to government’s involvement in private health care decisions.
“But also,” Wales said, “I do think people have been somewhat removed from how emotional it can be to get in your car and drive 12 hours to access care.”
The uptick in abortion access comes on the heels of the Kansas Legislature’s 2025 session, during which Republicans made several, mostly unsuccessful, attempts at clamping down on reproductive health care access.
“The data reflects that Kansans were more empathetic and insightful when they voted on this issue than the Legislature seems to be,” Wales said, referring to the 2022 ballot question attempting to limit abortion access, which Kansas voters rejected.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Planned-Parenthood-Pittsbgurg-2-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-04-18 19:07:12.963053

(Spencer Platt/Getty Images) As Republicans in Congress consider cutting the federal share of Medicaid funding, states are weighing numerous options to scale back their programs. But voters in three states have significantly limited those options by enshrining Medicaid expansion in their constitutions — creating a potential budget disaster and a political challenge for the GOP.
Over the past several years, voters in conservative Missouri, Oklahoma and South Dakota have amended their state constitutions to require their Medicaid programs to cover all adults below the age of 65 who earn equal to or less than 138% of the federal poverty level ($21,597 for an individual in 2025). Those states are among the 40 plus the District of Columbia that expanded Medicaid eligibility under the 2010 Affordable Care Act, with the federal government picking up 90% of the cost.
But much of that federal funding could soon vanish. Republicans in Congress are debating several options to achieve $880 billion in Medicaid cuts. One proposal would slash the 90% rate to the lower match rates states get for the traditional Medicaid population, mainly children and their caregivers, people with disabilities and pregnant women. Those percentages range from 50% for the wealthiest states to 77% for the poorest ones.

If Congress goes that route, states would have to come up with $626 billion over the next decade to keep the roughly 20 million people in the expansion population on the rolls.
Nine states (Arizona, Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Montana, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Utah and Virginia) already have laws on the books that would automatically roll back Medicaid expansion if the federal funds dip. Some states are considering requiring people to work, go to school or volunteer in order to receive Medicaid benefits, a condition that would trim the rolls and save money.
But because Missouri, Oklahoma and South Dakota have put Medicaid expansion in their constitutions, they can’t easily take those steps.

“Legislators cannot change that law without going back to voters for a whole other campaign to change the constitution,” said Kelly Hall, the executive director of the Fairness Project, a nonprofit that helped put the constitutional amendments on the ballot in all three states.
“Even if the federal government cuts their contribution towards funding Medicaid expansion, those three states do not have the option to reduce eligibility or benefits for the Medicaid expansion population,” she told Stateline. “They will have to find those resources.”
Medicaid is a huge component of state budgets. Including the federal matching money, states spend an average of nearly a third of their budgets on Medicaid. And the program is also the single largest source of federal funds for states.
Missourians voted in favor of a constitutional amendment to expand Medicaid in August 2020. When state lawmakers refused to fund the expansion, residents sued the state’s Department of Social Services. In 2021, the state Supreme Court ruled that the legislature had to find the resources for Medicaid expansion — a huge win for progressives.
For 2025, Missouri allotted $18.2 billion for Medicaid, with the federal government covering $12.7 billion of that, or about 70%. If Congress cuts the federal share of Medicaid funding by $880 billion over the next decade, it would leave Missouri with a budget hole of around $1.7 billion next year, according to research from nonprofit group the Commonwealth Fund. That would force the state to come up with some options to avoid fiscal disaster.
Timothy McBride, a health policy analyst and co-director of a program at the Institute for Public Health at Washington University in St. Louis, told Stateline that these include raising taxes, cutting enrollment for other Medicaid populations, diminishing reimbursements to providers, getting rid of optional medical services such as dental care or ceasing payments for equipment like wheelchairs.

Raising taxes is not a likely or popular choice in Republican-leaning Missouri, McBride noted, while adding that cuts to providers would further endanger struggling hospitals.
“We lost 10 hospitals in Missouri in the last few years. And if you start cutting their payment rates, that’s going to just put them at risk,” McBride said. “The real money is in the disabled and the elderly populations. And so if you really wanted to quote-unquote save money, that’s probably where you’d have to look. But that’s really controversial.”
The state budgetary implications of a potentially sharp decline in federal Medicaid funding have influenced some prominent opponents of Medicaid expansion to have a change of heart. U.S. Republican Sen. Josh Hawley supported efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act in 2018 when he was Missouri’s attorney general. Now, Hawley has said he would refuse to vote for any Medicaid cuts.
“I’m not going to vote for Medicaid cuts, benefit cuts. Work requirements are fine. But 21% of the residents in my state receive Medicaid or [the Children’s Health Insurance Program]. That’s a lot of people,” he told reporters on Capitol Hill in February.
Republicans in the closely divided U.S. Congress might have trouble pushing through Medicaid cuts if other conservative lawmakers from Missouri, Oklahoma and South Dakota follow Hawley’s lead.
Oklahoma voters expanded Medicaid via a constitutional amendment in 2020. South Dakota followed suit in 2022. Republicans in all three states want to impose work requirements on able-bodied Medicaid recipients, but doing so would not save enough money to make up for the loss of federal dollars.
South Dakota Republican state Rep. Will Mortenson said he respects that voters chose to expand Medicaid, and added that the state has “faithfully” implemented it. But the decision to amend the state constitution “can only be described as a foolish decision,” he said in an interview.










Now, as we're staring down the barrel of the federal government contemplating changes to Medicaid … our state is hamstrung.


– South Dakota Republican state Rep. Will Mortenson


“A constitution is not meant to be a flexible document that you change annually or even every other year,” Mortenson said. “And so now, as we’re staring down the barrel of the federal government contemplating changes to Medicaid, including for the expansion population, our state is hamstrung in that we cannot effectively respond to those changes.”
Mortenson is one of the lead sponsors of a bill that would ask voters to consider a ballot measure in the next general election to amend the constitution again, this time conditioning Medicaid expansion on the level of federal assistance. The measure has passed both chambers of the legislature.
But some of the supporters of the original constitutional amendment say they would fight any attempt to change it. Any restrictions, including work requirements, would severely harm working-class people, said Doug Sombke, head of the South Dakota Farmers Union. Sombke told Stateline that most farmers in the state struggle to make ends meet and certainly cannot offer high wages or health care benefits to their workers.
“There’s just no extra income,” Sombke said. “And, in South Dakota, we’re a right-to-work state, so you can get fired for any reason. As a worker, you really don’t have a lot of choice.”
Hall, of the Fairness Project, said amending the constitution is the most effective way to expand Medicaid in states where conservative-leaning lawmakers have been reluctant to do so. She said she suspects that voters in other states might pursue the constitutional amendment strategy if their state lawmakers try to roll back expansion.
“I do think that it’s possible that if we see these cuts move forward in D.C., and states are making highly unpopular choices to cut benefits for people, that we will see this issue back at the ballot box,” Hall said. “But for right now, I would say we’re seeing the power of constitutional amendments to protect benefits in action in real time.”

But during busy summer weekends, turning traffic backs up on the Banks Lowman Road, forcing drivers to wait extended periods of time to turn left onto Idaho Highway 55 and return to the Treasure Valley.
Idaho Transportation Department officials said the new, interim traffic signal will provide safer, more predictable turning options for drivers during busy times.
“The new signal will help mobility and safety at this historically busy summer SH-55 river access intersection,” Dan McElhinney, ITD chief deputy and chief operations officer, said in a written statement. “This signal will provide a turning solution for those drivers on Banks Lowman Road, which will help reduce long lines and delays.”
As of Friday, crews were finishing installing the traffic signal poles and making final preparations to activate the traffic signal, ITD officials said. 
Transportation officials said the new traffic signal was based on a study and public feedback. 
In addition to activating the new interim traffic signal, Idaho Transportation Department officials are working on a long-term intersection widening project to meet the growing traffic throughout the region and along the river.
In the past, traffic got so bad at the Bank Lowman Road intersection on summer weekends that the Idaho Transportation Department deployed flaggers to manually direct traffic.

(Kyle Martin/For the North Dakota Monitor)The North Dakota Senate voted down a resolution Thursday that related to mandated reporting requirements for public officials, a proposal prompted by the sex crime conviction of former Sen. Ray Holmberg.
The North Dakota Young Republicans proposed House Resolution 3037 after reading a sentencing memo filed by a federal prosecutor last month that alleged Holmberg had a pattern of exploiting boys and young men. Holmberg, a Grand Forks Republican, pleaded guilty to traveling to Prague with intent to engage in illicit sexual conduct with minors and was sentenced to 10 years in federal prison.
The resolution urged the 2027 Legislature to consider making public officials mandated reporters. North Dakota law requires mandated reporters to report abuse, neglect and exploitation of vulnerable people to local authorities or law enforcement. 
Sen. Janne Myrdal, R-Edinburg, said the resolution seemed like a “political knee-jerk reaction” that does not accomplish anything of substance, only to ask future lawmakers to think about crafting a new law.
Former ND Sen. Ray Holmberg sentenced to 10 years in prison for sex crime

“I just want to remind this body today as we consider this resolution that we are working on these things and we’re doing fruitful things on these things,” said Myrdal, who highlighted other legislation that aims to protect children from exploitation. 
Myrdal acknowledged that people were horrified to learn about their legislative colleague’s behavior. But she said many of the positions that require mandated reporting are for positions that work directly with children, which lawmakers do not generally do.
Sen. Kristin Roers, R-Fargo, said she is a mandated reporter as a nurse but worries that if the requirement was expanded to include lawmakers she would need to report testimony she receives as chair of the Senate Human Services Committee that may have already been reported.
“Are we going to end up creating a system in which we are bogging down our system and pulling away people who are doing the really, really important work, those child protection workers?” Roers said. She added the Legislature may not want to insert itself into a system that is working well today.
Mandated reporters are required to get updated training, said Sen. Tim Mathern, D-Fargo.
“People need training,” Mathern said. “It’s not that simple to differentiate these cases.”
The Senate killed the resolution on a majority voice vote.
The resolution passed the House unanimously on April 7.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) Research from The Nature Conservancy found current clean energy tax credits, if kept in place through 2032 would add more than $238 million in annual economic value to Iowa. 
Some folks fear the tax credits will be slashed by congressional leaders as they stare down hefty budget cuts and eye Biden-era environmental policies, but advocates of the clean energy credits say they are essential to reaching American energy dominance.
The study looked at clean energy tax credits impacting transportation, power generation, industry and buildings. Those categories comprise sectors from renewable vehicle fuels, to carbon sequestration, to home solar installations and electric vehicles. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Amber Markham, director of external affairs and climate for The Nature Conservancy, said most of these tax credits were established with bipartisan support, but are under attack by Republican officials because they were extended by the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act. 
“Rather than just lumping them all together and throwing them out, because somehow it seems like it’s an environmental thing … we need to really, take not a sledgehammer approach, but a scalpel approach, and go in and look at each of them and their impact and what makes the most sense to keep and support.” 


The tax credit programs analyzed in the study include: 
Power:

45Y: credits for energy generated with little to no greenhouse gas emissions. 
48E: a tech-neutral credit for energy generated with little to no greenhouse gas emissions.
45U: credits for nuclear energy facilities with zero emissions.

Industry: 

48C: credits for projects that expand clean energy manufacturing or recycling.
45X: credits for solar and wind energy components.
45V: credits for clean hydrogen production. 
45Q: credit for projects that sequester carbon dioxide by injecting it into underground geological formations. 

Buildings: 

25D: credits for residential clean energy updates like solar panels, wind turbines, etc.
25C: credits for residential energy efficiency updates like new windows, doors or insulation.
179D: credits for energy efficiency updates to commercial buildings.
45L: credits for building or reconstructing energy efficient homes.

Transportation:

45Z: credits for domestically produced fuel, including sustainable aviation fuel, with lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions below a certain level.
EV tax credits: credits for individuals who purchase electric plug in or fuel cell vehicles.



According to the study, the tax credits in the power category, followed by the industry category, account for the greatest share of annual economic value added to Iowa. 
Markham said cutting the tax credits now would be like “pulling the rug out from under” the individuals, business owners and industries that have already invested in this technology with the expectation of the tax credits. 
Monte Shaw, executive director of Iowa Renewable Fuels Association, said this is true for ethanol facilities in Iowa, which he said have invested “tens of millions of dollars” to be able to receive 45z tax credits for manufacturing sustainable aviation fuel. 
“That is why we’re fighting so hard to push back against the people who (want to) rip it out,” Shaw said. “These facilities made good faith investments based on the law of the land.”
Conversely, opponents of the carbon pipeline projects in Iowa are gathering signatures on a petition, specifically urging Senators Joni Ernst and Chuck Grassley to cut the 45Q tax credits, which incentivize the carbon sequestration pipelines. 
IRFA and other commodity groups associated with the ethanol industry have been pushing for final guidance on the 45z program, which Shaw said would said is “the best tool” to “maximize the Midwest contribution to American energy dominance.”
A comment period for 45z guidance closed April 10. Shaw said the association asked for a long term extension of the program and for the inclusion of the climate smart agriculture practices. He said the climate smart agriculture practices program would help the ethanol facilities meet the low emission standards it needs to qualify for 45z, and it would allow farmers to compete in a global market by quantifying the carbon impacts of regenerative farming practices. 
Shaw said it seems like the president doesn’t care about the impacts these tax credits have on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, but he should care about the economic benefits they represent to the country. 
“If you want to get to American energy dominance, this is a tool that’s right here, in law, that can be implemented aggressively, that will achieve your American energy dominance goals,” Shaw said, speaking specifically about 45z. 
Another study, released by the Clean Energy Buyers Association, found that residential energy prices in the U.S. would increase by nearly 7% in 2026 if the tax credits were done away with. 
Markham with TNC said renewable energy needs to be in the mix to meet American energy demand, which is expected to increase by at least 2% each year in 2025 and 2026. 
“We know that more energy is needed across our nation, so it’s not an either or, it’s an all of the above approach that we need to be taking,” Markham said. 
U.S. Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks of Iowa is one of a group of GOP lawmakers advocating for the energy tax credits. Miller-Meeks testified in favor of the credits, in the House Ways and Means Committee, urging her colleagues to develop an “any of the above” strategy to meet energy demands.
“Our energy sector faces significant challenges that demand bold action,” Miller-Meeks said.  
She noted the Inflation Reduction Act of the previous administration created some “important energy tax credits that are already driving transformative investments across the U.S. energy sector.” 
Miller-Meeks, along with 20 other Republican lawmakers wrote to the House Ways and Means Committee Chair, Rep. Jason Smith, R-MO, asking that any changes to energy tax credits be done in a “pragmatic fashion” without “undoing” programs that are already promoting energy innovation and lowering utility costs. 
Markham said the environmental group was grateful for the support of the Iowa representative.
“We need more Republicans to stand up and support these clean energy tax credits, specifically because they are bipartisan, they always have been, until now,” Markham said. 
The U.S. House of Representatives adopted a budget resolution April 10, just before leaving for a spring recess, that will allow both chambers to work on a reconciliation package upon their return. Per the adopted resolution, Congress must make $1.5 trillion in cuts to federal spending.

(Lexi Browning | West Virginia Watch)The American Civil Liberties Union of West Virginia has filed a federal lawsuit on behalf of a Marshall University graduate student whose visa was “unlawfully” revoked as a part of an immigration crackdown by President Donald Trump’s administration. 
More than 1,000 international students at 160 colleges and universities across the country have had their visas revoked or their legal status terminated since March, according to a report by the Associated Press.  That includes students at colleges and universities in West Virginia. 
The Marshall student, identified in a Friday news release as S.V., was one month away from graduating when his visa was revoked, according to the ACLU-WV. The student received an email stating that his F-1 visa was being revoked and later learned that he was “identified in a criminal records check,” the news release said.
S.V., 28-year-old data science student originally from India, was sentenced to probation in 2020 in Indiana for operating a vehicle under the influence, a misdemeanor, according to the release. He left the United States and returned in 2023 to study at Marshall. 
ACLU-WV legal director Aubrey Sparks said that having been identified in a criminal record check is not legal ground for terminating a visa.  
“Our client was not convicted of a crime of violence, nor was he convicted of a crime for which the potential sentence is more than one year, meaning that he categorically is not subject to termination of his F-1 status on those grounds,” Sparks said. 
According to the ACLU, S.V. disclosed the previous charge when re-applying, satisfied all requirements, and was permitted to re-enter the country under the new visa. The student was  in the process of applying for post-graduate work in the United States when he received the  email ending his visa.  
The situation caused chaos for his education and career plans, he said. 
“I desperately want to complete my graduate degree and pursue work in the United States,” he  said in the news release. “It is clear this wasn’t a decision based on my circumstance or experience — this was a predetermined outcome and they just said whatever needed to be said to justify it, even when it  didn’t apply to me.” 
The ACLU-WV filed the lawsuit Friday in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia. The complaint names Kristi Noem, secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Todd Lyons, acting director of the U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement, and U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi. 
Across the country,  lawsuits have been filed and rallies held in response to the student visas being revoked. 
Government officials have not specified the reasons the administration has canceled visas, but U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said last month that participating in protests against Israel’s war in Gaza will not be tolerated.
“They’re here to go to class. They’re not here to lead activist movements that are disruptive and undermine our universities. I think it’s lunacy to continue to allow that,” Rubio said. 
In the news release, ACLU-WV executive director Eli Baumwell said international students and scholars are a vital part of the nation’s universities, economy and communities.
“Unfortunately, it has become increasingly clear that the Trump administration is simply taking the law into its own hands in its crusade against noncitizens,” he said. “Never before has a president taken such sweeping actions to revoke student visas, and that’s why we need the courts to step in and protect their rights to due process under the Constitution.”

Motel managers are hiring their last employees as the summer tourism season begins with the opening of Yellowstone’s West Entrance today.
After park crews plowed a winter’s worth of snow from roads, visitors are now motoring to Old Faithful, Canyon and Norris, marking the unofficial start to the summer. This year, fewer of those tourists, ogling at “red dog” bison calves, delighting in a geyser’s eruption and soaking up spectacular mountain views, will likely be international travelers.
Overseas travel to the U.S. nosedived 11.6% in March, reflecting jitters over Trump administration tariffs, stock market turmoil and foreign bitterness toward the country’s altered relationship with the rest of the world.

Several data points reveal a sluggish start to the summer tourism season.
The International Trade Administration, an arm of the U.S. Department of Commerce, reported the 11.6% drop in overseas visitation in March. (The figure, compared to the same month last year, does not reflect travelers from Canada and Mexico.)
“U.S. Economy to Lose Billions as Foreign Tourists Stay Away,” Bloomberg headlined an April 14 story.
Mike Gierau, a Wyoming state senator, restaurant owner and co-chairman of JH AIR, a nonprofit business consortium that coordinates service to Jackson Hole, sees the tide. “International travel is dropping like a stone based on all the stuff coming from Washington,” he said.
Moreover, at the South Entrance to the world’s first national park, the Jackson Hole Chamber of Commerce reports a dip in the 60-day outlook for already booked hotel rooms compared to 2024.
Rick Howe, the chamber’s president, said June and July “are not as strong as we would expect — they’re not picking up as quickly as they [usually] do.”
That 60-day outlook, released March 31, shows about 54% of coming days falling shy of last year’s numbers based on bookings at 16 hotels.
“It’s not going to be a record year,” Howe said.
 Not giving up hope on tourists

In 2024, travel spending in Wyoming amounted to $4.9 billion, according to the Wyoming Office of Tourism. Travel and tourism supported 33,610 jobs, generated $278 million in tax receipts and resulted in 8.8 million overnight visitors, the office said in a review of last year.
Tourism, Gierau said, is the second-largest revenue-generating industry in the Equality State behind energy development. “In tourism, everything you do is taxed,” he said, “everything we buy, everything we sell.”
Despite the data dips, industry officials hope and believe in redemption. If overseas visitors aren’t coming to the U.S., Americans could forego foreign travel as well, spending their time vacationing closer to home instead.
“One door closes, another opens,” Gierau said.
Also, the outlook for visitors to Jackson Hole, while not yet documented by the chamber, is upbeat for August and September, Howe said. Overall, “we’re pretty much on par with last summer — for the moment,” he said.

At Yellowstone’s East Entrance near Cody, lodge owners have seen “a little bit of a drop,” in reservations, said Jennifer Thoma, the executive director of the Cody Country Chamber of Commerce. There’s now a glimmer of relief.
“It seems like reservation numbers are back up,” she said.
In addition to tariffs, market turmoil and foreign enmity, DOGE cuts to the National Park Service and U.S. Forest Service have rattled travelers. Those indiscriminate firings and resignations have sparked worries that campgrounds won’t open and toilets won’t be cleaned.
Tourism industry leaders seek to assure potential customers that DOGE disorder won’t affect their vacations. Yellowstone National Park Lodges General Manager Mike Keller acknowledged in an email that Park Service “staffing uncertainty” has generated worries.
“We are here to assure you that our operations are unaffected and we are ready to welcome you to a memorable Yellowstone experience this spring and summer,” his email reads. “The park remains open, the views are as breathtaking as ever, the wildlife is flourishing, and the sense of wonder that Yellowstone National Park evokes is unchanging and eternal.”
 COVID redux?

For Howe at the Jackson chamber, the season could mimic the surge in RV campers and regional travel that accompanied the COVID-19 pandemic. “People are not worried services won’t be available,” he said.
“We are not hearing the concerns that we were two to three weeks ago,” Howe said. “Those calls are not happening anymore.”
He also asked innkeepers a month ago to report whether they’re getting calls from people cancelling reservations because of economic hardships. “The answer is ‘no,’” he said.
Reflecting information from airlines, Gierau predicted “a good summer,” but also one that’s “just different.”
There will be fewer bus tours filled with foreigners and, instead, more people “on the senior circuit,” he said.
The next Jackson chamber 60-day outlook through mid-June, compiled by consultants DestiMetrics, publishes April 20. A crash is “not a major concern at the moment,” Howe said. “It’s kind of a moving target,” Howe said of the summer forecast. “With all the things going on, things changing rapidly, it’s hard to know.”

(Photo courtesy New Mexico Wild)New Mexico Democrats U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich and U.S. Rep. Gabe Vasquez on Friday announced the reintroduction of the M.H. Dutch Salmon Greater Gila Wild and Scenic River Act, which would designate approximately 450 miles of the Gila and San Francisco Rivers and their tributaries “wild and scenic rivers.” That designation would protect the area under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act. The bill has been introduced three prior times with support from the entire delegation.
“The Gila and San Francisco Rivers are among the last wild, free-flowing rivers in the Southwest— vital to the region’s wildlife, communities, and culture. To truly safeguard the Gila’s wild character, we must also protect its rivers,” Heinrich, ranking member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, said in a statement.
Vasquez, who held a news conference with members of the Wild Gila River Coalition in Silver City on Friday, called the Gila River “a symbol of everything we love about New Mexico—wild, beautiful and full of life. This legislation is about protecting that legacy for future generations.”
Reintroduction of the bill came with support from a myriad of sources, including New Mexico Wild Executive Director Mark Allison, who said the bill “honors the original vision of Aldo Leopold and river champions like the late Dutch Salmon, without whose efforts this river we love would have been greatly diminished. The legislation also aims to preserve sites held sacred to communities that have called the Gila region home for centuries. New Mexicans know how irreplaceable our natural and cultural heritage is and overwhelmingly support this effort.”
(For more on Leopold and the Gila, be sure to read his 1921 essay “The Wilderness and Its Place in Forest Recreational Policy.”)
Fort Sill Apache Tribe Chairwoman Jennifer Heminokeky noted in a statement that “much of the Gila and San Francisco rivers are located within the Fort Sill (Chiricahua-Warm Springs ) Apache Tribe’s original 14-million-acre homeland that our ancestors were removed from by force. The Gila River and its tributaries provide a cultural roadmap to our ancestors who thrived in the surrounding lands for centuries. This legislation reflects my belief that it is our responsibility to protect these cultural and natural resources for future generations, just as our ancestors cared for these lands and rivers before us. We will continue to stand with others in this community to protect the Gila and San Francisco rivers.”
Residents and local governments also commended the legislation and remarked on its importance. “Each member of this community has a different story of their experience and connection to the forest and the river, but protection of the Gila is extremely important to all of us,” Silver City Councilor and Mayor Pro Tem Guadalupe Cano said in a statement. “As our community continues to grow and evolve, our love of the Gila is the one thing that stays the same.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Gila-River-Middle-Fork-Sara-Bergthold-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-18 18:07:53.748274

(Murray State photo)Another international student’s visa has been revoked in Kentucky, this time at Murray State University.
According to local news reports, Murray State shared information about the student’s visa being revoked by the Department of Homeland Security on Wednesday. A university spokesperson declined to give further information to protect the student’s privacy. 
The news comes amid Trump administration efforts to ramp up deportations. Inside Higher Ed reported that as of Friday, more than 1,550 international students and recent graduates have had their legal status changed by the U.S. State Department. 
Murray State College Democrats penned an open letter criticizing the university administration for not alerting students sooner to the visa revocation and asking for clearer information about the university’s response. “To be clear, we are not asking that personal information be released, just notification of when law enforcement is present and/or actively targeting students on campuses,” the letter says.
The College Democrats said students and their families choose colleges like Murray because they trust they will be safe there and that Murray “boasts about having international students from over 50 different countries.”
“Every student that seeks to learn at MSU has the right to do so without fear of persecution,” the letter reads. “Actions taken by administration are the only way to prove that the university cares about and will protect those rights.” 
A Murray spokesperson did not immediately return a request for comment Friday afternoon. 
Earlier this month, the University of Kentucky reported a “small number” of graduate students had their visas revoked by the Department of Homeland Security.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images) (This image cannot be republished unless you have a Getty subscription.)For the first half of his career in law enforcement, working as a police officer in South Florida, Chase Fopiano did not think cyberattacks on police agencies were a serious threat.
Many of his law enforcement colleagues were under the same impression — that since they were the most likely to investigate the attacks, there was no way cybercriminals would go after them.
By about 2015, as technology advanced and hackers became more creative, that changed, Fopiano said. Now, from the U.S. Secret Service to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, there are thousands of attempts to compromise networks or organizations every day, he said.
“A lot of those [attempts] are toward government or even police, especially because they know that we’re not as prepared as we should be,” said Fopiano, who now oversees cybersecurity as part of a regional task force.
Spanning health care facilities to court systems, states and local communities are facing a rise in cyberthreats. They include threats to critical infrastructure, increased activity from foreign actors, continued ransomware attacks and more, according to a recent report from the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center.
But President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order shifting some of the responsibility from the federal government to states and localities to improve their infrastructure to address risks, including cybercrimes. And federal cuts have reduced resources for state and local officials, including a cybersecurity grant program and a key cybersecurity agency.
States and localities are taking steps to address the problems, such as establishing new penalties for tampering with critical infrastructure, centralizing state IT personnel and setting standards in areas from elections to health care.
But the Trump order and federal funding cuts, a shortage of IT experts at the local level and an overall lack of preparedness could weaken their efforts.
In December, a major cyberattack forced Rhode Island to take down its online portal used by residents to obtain Medicaid benefits and SNAP, commonly known as food stamps. The personal data stolen from Rhode Island’s public benefits network — including Social Security numbers and banking information — was later found on the dark web.
In February, a “sophisticated cyberattack” hit the office of Virginia Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares, which led agency officials to shut down computer systems and resort to paper court filings.
Last week, hackers also breached the computer network of the Fall River School District in Massachusetts. The school district is working with third-party experts and law enforcement to determine if anyone’s personal information was targeted, according to MassLive.
In 2023, of the 48 states that participated in the Nationwide Cybersecurity Review, a voluntary self-assessment conducted by federal agencies that examines how well governments are prepared to respond to cyberattacks, only 22 states reached or surpassed the recommended levels of security in their systems.
Cybersecurity has become increasingly important over time because more government services and data are digitized, said Samir Jain, the vice president of policy at the Center for Democracy & Technology, a nonprofit that advocates for digital rights and freedom of expression.
But a national shortage of people with that expertise — especially at the local level — creates a challenge.
“The federal government has traditionally played at least some role in trying to fill some of those gaps,” Jain said. “And so the notion that the federal government could just withdraw and expect states and localities to step in is just not realistic.”
Local governments and law enforcement agencies also have other priorities, Fopiano said. The police need cars, guns, shields and other resources that generally take precedence over cybersecurity.
Today, Fopiano is the cybersecurity chair of the Southeast Regional Domestic Security Task Force in Florida, overseeing cyber activity from South Florida to the Florida Keys. The attacks continue to rise, he said.
“Terrorist groups are getting into cybercrime, cartels are getting into cybercrime, you have kids just learning about hacking and just fooling around,” he said. “The audience of who’s doing it has definitely expanded and led to that rise in overall cybercrime.”
 Cuts to federal resources

In 2022, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced a first-of-its-kind cybersecurity grant program, providing more than $1 billion in funding for states, localities, tribes and territories to address cybersecurity risks and threats.
The State and Local Cybersecurity Grant Program, created under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, awarded $279 million to states and localities in fiscal year 2024. The Tribal Cybersecurity Grant Program awarded another $18 million for tribes in its first year.
But the grant program is set to expire in September, with no current plans to renew it. At a hearing this month, several state and local officials urged Congress to reauthorize the program. But U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who refused the federal aid during her tenure as governor of South Dakota, questioned the program’s efficacy.
The Trump administration is also cutting as many as 1,300 employees from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, which administers the grants alongside the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
The program has allowed states to assess the security of their networks, develop cybersecurity training, implement multi-factor authentication features — which requires users to provide more than one form of verification to access a site or service — and much more, said Alex Whitaker, the director of government affairs at the National Association of State Chief Information Officers.
“This has been a really great program because we’re seeing a lot of great evidence for how states and their counterparts in local government are improving their cyber defenses,” Whitaker said.
Counties also rely on a number of federal resources to strengthen their defenses, including services provided by CISA, said Rita Reynolds, the chief information officer at the National Association of Counties and managing director for County Tech Xchange. NACo is an organization that represents county governments across the United States.
The Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center, for instance — a key collaboration between CISA and the Center for Internet Security to help state and local governments with cybersecurity operations — lost some of its federal funding for certain programs last month, Reynolds said.
In trying to keep up with emerging threats, counties are still trying to find resources to help them implement multi-factor authentication, convert government pages to “.gov” domains and other methods of protecting their infrastructure, she said.
“Are counties prepared?” Reynolds asked. “I would say they’re not as prepared as they’d like to be. And in some cases, they are looking at how to strategically approach this now that resources are disappearing.”
In a statement, CISA spokesperson Jared Auchey said Trump’s executive order empowers state and local governments “to make risk-informed decisions and investments to improve their preparedness.” The agency will work with state and local officials to ensure they have the information and support they need, Auchey added.
 Lawmakers step up

In 2024, 33 states adopted resolutions or enacted legislation regarding cybersecurity, according to a database from the National Conference of State Legislatures, a nonpartisan public officials’ association.
Many of those measures sought to protect states’ critical infrastructure, including water systems, government services, health care and more. Florida, Louisiana, West Virginia and other states created new criminal and civil penalties for people who attempt to tamper with critical infrastructure.
In Minnesota and Washington state, lawmakers passed measures allowing or requiring state and local governments to invest in cybersecurity protections related to election administration. Connecticut and Florida also passed legislation to secure health care facilities from cyberattacks by having hospitals create plans or by supporting investments in new technologies.
Other states are looking for solutions from outside vendors. South Dakota has set aside $7 million for a company to examine local governments for vulnerabilities to hackers.
With attacks occurring at every level of government, New Mexico Democratic state Sen. Michael Padilla, the Senate majority whip, sponsored legislation in 2023 to create the state’s office of cybersecurity. As chair of the Senate Science, Technology and Telecommunications Committee for 10 years, he plays a significant role in most of the state’s cybersecurity legislation.
Through the committee’s work, Padilla says New Mexico is in good shape to fend off cyberattacks — and the state’s cities and counties are joining in.
“I think New Mexico is in a very good position because what we decided to do by creating that office is to ensure that any transactions that occur with state government here [in New Mexico] have to meet a minimum set of security standards,” he said.
In Indiana, Republican state Sen. Liz Brown filed legislation that would encourage state agencies and groups to develop cybersecurity policies. The bill was approved by both chambers, with the Senate agreeing to changes sent from the House.
“You have to protect your infrastructure,” Brown said. “We don’t want utility systems to be shut down. We don’t want wastewater or freshwater treatment plants or even the water supply being contaminated or harmed in some way. Our systems all have backups, but even so, we know there are bad actors.”
Some states are also preparing to reshuffle their offices or create new ones to centralize their cybersecurity efforts. Arkansas, for example, enacted legislation this month to create a new state cybersecurity office, which will monitor the state’s computer networks and respond to cyberthreats.
In Alabama, rather than having information technology people scattered throughout the government, Republican state Rep. Mike Shaw wants cybersecurity personnel centrally managed.
Shaw’s legislation, which passed the House and is currently in the Senate, would give the Alabama Office of Information Technology central authority to maintain the needs of all of the state’s departments.
The centralization would make it easier to pursue cybersecurity initiatives in the future, Shaw said.
“The federal government is really big, and it’s really hard to come up with a one-size-fits-all solution for things like cybersecurity, data privacy and technology in general,” Shaw said. “So, in some sense, it’s good that the states are coming up with their own.”

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)A North Dakota federal judge ruled this week that a group of Catholic employers do not have to follow new federal regulations meant to protect workers’ access to abortion and fertility treatment, and to shield LGBTQ employees from discrimination.
The order, released Tuesday by Judge Daniel Traynor, relates to two documents issued by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission last year. One is a rule implementing the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act and the other updated non-binding guidance on Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which outlaws workplace discrimination.
The Diocese of Bismarck and the Catholic Benefits Association took issue with both of the regulations, arguing in an August federal court complaint that they force Catholic employers to go against their religious beliefs.
Bismarck Diocese Bishop David Kagan said in a statement the diocese is thankful for the verdict.
“The Court has upheld our religious freedom rights and that is all we ever wanted,” he said.
Judge sides with North Dakota Catholic diocese, suspends abortion, IVF and LGBTQ protections

The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, signed into law by President Joe Biden in 2022, requires employers to provide workplace accommodations for pregnant and postpartum mothers — like food, water and bathroom breaks, reduced physical labor and medical leave.
The EEOC was tasked with implementing the law through an administrative rule, which was finalized last spring.
The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act does not specifically say employers must accommodate employees who seek abortions or infertility treatments. The rule does, however — which prompted the Diocese of Bismarck and Catholic Benefits Association to sue.
The plaintiffs alleged that in including protections for employees who seek abortions and infertility treatments, the EEOC went against the will of Congress. They also called the rule a violation of their religious freedoms, since the Catholic Church opposes abortion and certain kinds of fertility procedures.
The EEOC’s rule doesn’t include blanket exemptions for religious employers, though the agency has said religious exemption claims will be addressed on a case-by-case basis. Laura Bakst, an attorney for the Department of Justice, said at a September federal court hearing that this allows the federal agency to handle cases more fairly.
The plaintiffs argued it’s unfair for employers to only be able to request an exemption when they’re already facing enforcement action.
The lawsuit also took aim at updated workplace harassment guidance published by the EEOC last year. It states that harassment based on reproductive health care decisions — including abortion, fertility treatments and contraception — as well as sexual orientation and gender identity may now be considered sex discrimination under Title VII. 
It lists refusing to use transgender people’s preferred pronouns or not allowing them to use bathrooms that align with their gender identity as examples of possible discrimination, for example.
Plaintiffs claimed this guidance would restrict them from following the Catholic Church’s religious teachings on reproductive and LGBTQ issues.
The guidance “effectively requires Catholic employers to use false pronouns, to avoid speaking the truth regarding human sexuality around certain employees, and to permit opposite-sex employees to intrude into private spaces reserved to those of the other sex,” their complaint states.
Title VII does include an exemption for religious employers, but the Diocese of Bismarck and Catholic Benefits Association said the new guidance flouts this exemption.
Employers who don’t comply with the regulations can face enforcement action from the EEOC. They can also be sued by their employees.
At the September hearing, an attorney for the plaintiffs argued his clients will be forced to choose between accommodating practices they consider immoral or being accused of workplace discrimination.
“We’re living in fear that we’ll go through thousands of enforcement actions,” Andrew Nussbaum said during the hearing.
The EEOC has said that it considered public comment, the intent of Congress and guidance from the courts in writing the regulations. It also rejected the notion that either the rule or the guidance would infringe on employers’ ability to practice their faith. 
Traynor last fall temporarily blocked the EEOC from requiring Catholic Benefits Association members to comply with the challenged portions of the regulations. Tuesday’s ruling made those exemptions permanent.
In his September order, Traynor found that the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act rule and the Title VII guidance “place a substantial burden” on the plaintiffs’ ability to practice their religion.
He also wrote that the federal agency did not show it has a compelling interest in leaving the regulations in place, or that the rule and guidance sufficiently minimize the burdens they place on religious organizations.
Traynor was appointed a federal judge in 2020 by former President Donald Trump. He served on the board for the North Dakota Catholic Conference from 1999-2001, according to a questionnaire for judicial nominees.

Spencer Cox says he’s working on issuing an emergency declaration. 
Despite northern Utah seeing average snow this year, counties in the south are exceptionally dry. Cox said he’s currently working with local officials on the declaration, which could extend to a handful of counties in the southwestern corner of Utah that have seen a meager snowpack this winter. 
“We feel really good about where we are,” Cox said about water conditions on Thursday during his monthly PBS Utah news conference, calling it a “pretty normal year for most of the state.” 
“However, I will say it wasn’t a great year for all of the state. And southern Utah, especially southwestern Utah, was well below average and they are seeing some elevated drought conditions there. I would say, yes, there is a very real possibility; in fact, we’re working on it right now, of an emergency declaration,” the governor said. 
Statewide, the snow water equivalent — which is basically the amount of water currently in the snowpack — is at about 78% of normal, according to the Natural Resources Conservation Service, or NRCS, which tracks the snowpack at sites around the state. Much of northern Utah is between that or higher, with Snowbird’s site at 96%, and a site in Big Cottonwood Canyon at 115%. 
But many NRCS sites in southern Utah are below 50% of the median snow water equivalent, some with just 1%, even 0%. Much of Washington and Iron counties are currently in extreme drought, according to the Utah Division of Water Resources, while swaths of Beaver, Millard, Juab, Tooele, Uintah, Grand and San Juan counties are in severe drought. 
The rest of the state is either in moderate drought or abnormally dry, except for a sliver of northwestern Box Elder County and the high elevation portions of Salt Lake, Utah, Morgan, Wasatch and Summit counties.

“The Drought Response Committee has been meeting more regularly to address concerns in drought-impacted areas,” said Candice Hasenyager, Utah Division of Water Resources director, in a statement Friday. “Many state agencies are coordinating their response to drought conditions that will likely intensify heading into summer.”
Hasenyager reminded Utahns to hold off on irrigation until “your landscape needs it.” 
“Most of northern Utah can hold off on irrigating until Mother’s Day or until temperatures are in the mid-70s for several days,” she said. 
The state’s reservoirs somewhat mirror the snowpack, with northern Utah looking good and southern Utah falling behind. In the north, the larger lakes and reservoirs — Strawberry, Bear Lake, Jordanelle, Flaming Gorge, Utah Lake, Deer Creek, Starvation and Pineview — are all above 75% capacity, with some hovering just below 100%.
But south of Price, all but five reservoirs — Huntington, Joes Valley, Otter Creek, Quail Creek and Sand Hollow — are above 75%. Some, like Yuba Reservoir or Panguitch Lake, are below 50%. 
The outlook is particularly bad for the country’s second-largest reservoir, Lake Powell, which is federally controlled by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation. As of Friday, the reservoir was at about 32% capacity.

According to the Utah Rivers Council, Lake Powell is about 70 feet above the minimum level for the Glen Canyon Dam to generate hydroelectric power. That level will continue to decline into the summer and fall, the council said, pointing to an “increasingly dire runoff future.” 
“The countdown can start on Utah having to cut its portion of Colorado River water,” said Zach Frankel, executive director of the Utah Rivers Council. “Other states in the basin are putting odds on how soon that will happen and it’s definitely coming, alongside the shutdown of Glen Canyon hydropower.”
During the news conference on Thursday, Cox said he is “always worried about Lake Powell,” and has been for years, with the Colorado River plagued by drought and decreased flows.
“The good news is that Lake Powell, that water going into Powell does not come from the southwest side of the state,” said Cox, referring to the source of the Colorado River, which is in alpine areas of Colorado, Utah and Wyoming. “The water content in the mountains is a little bit better there.”
The governor can declare a state of emergency in response to natural disasters or public health threats. However, after tension brewed between the Legislature and former Utah Gov. Gary Herbert over his response to the COVID-19 pandemic, lawmakers passed a law in 2021 limiting emergency declarations to 30 days. 
The Legislature could extend that emergency declaration if lawmakers pass a joint resolution. 
Cox hinted that lawmakers could convene in May for a special session — so if he issues an emergency declaration this month, he’ll have the opportunity to work with legislators to extend the declaration, since it’s likely drought conditions will worsen during the spring and summer months.

(Courtesy of The Playing Field)Federal payments to Wisconsin’s Head Start programs in the first three and a half months of 2025 are half what they were a year ago, exacerbating worries about the future of the program that provides child care and early education to low-income families.
The Office of Head Start’s payments to Wisconsin program operators from Jan. 1 through April 15 of this year were down by $35 million from the same period in 2024, Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wisconsin) said this week.
Nationwide, Head Start program operators have received $943 million less during that period this year compared with the period a year ago, according to Sen. Patty Murray (D-Washington), who published a table of calculations comparing disbursements for every state in a press release. The table shows Wisconsin disbursements of $34.5 million as of April 15, compared with $69.5 million in the 2024 period.
Baldwin contrasted the potential impact with the pledge by the White House and the Republican majority in Congress to extend tax cuts enacted in 2017 during Trump’s first term.
“The idea that the president is actively working to give the biggest corporations and wealthiest Wall Street guys a new tax break while taking away preschool and child care from Wisconsinites is beyond the pale,” said Baldwin, vowing to fight actions of President Donald Trump she described as “defunding Head Start.”
The calculations in Murray’s table are based on Head Start disbursement data that Senate Democrats pulled from the Tracking Accountability in Government Grants System (TAGGS) website at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).
While most states in Murray’s table had lower disbursements compared with a year ago, Alabama, Delaware, New Jersey, Rhode Island and the District of Columbia all showed increases.
The calculations put the big-picture numbers on funding disruptions that Head Start providers have been experiencing in the last three months, said Jennie Mauer, executive director of the Wisconsin Head Start Association.
Those disruptions first surfaced after Trump took office, with delays of up to two weeks in late January and early February for Head Start programs seeking authorized payment for their expenses.
More recently, the disruptions have continued as providers who have submitted the required documents for payment have been confronted with unexpected demands for “more information” Mauer said Friday.
“The [federal] administration is really messing around, pulling out the foundational blocks of grant operation,” Mauer said.
In order to get approved for a grant, recipients must provide a detailed accounting of how it will be spent, she said. To get payment, providers must submit detailed documentation that the expense it covers has already been incurred. 
“This is a highly regulated system,” Mauer said. “There’s a very rigorous initial grant application process, and then on an ongoing basis grantees are demonstrating, ‘We told you what we’re going to spend the money on. Now based on what I told you, I’m asking for that money.’”
The disclosure of the drop in Head Start funding comes a week after a published report raised the possibility that Head Start will be zeroed out of the next federal budget.
It also comes as some providers wait for information about their upcoming grant replenishments, Mauer said.
Head Start grants are provided under multi-year contracts signed with providers. The money itself, however, does not come to providers in large lump sums but in smaller amounts paid upon the submission of documented expenses, Mauer said.
Every six months, an allotment from the provider’s grant is made available, she said. Those funds are not paid directly to the provider, however. The money is set aside for the provider to draw on after submitting expense documents through the federal online payment system.
Providers’ grant cycles start on the first of the month. In Wisconsin, providers whose grant cycle started Nov. 1 have now received confirmation of their next grant allotment for the six months starting May 1, Mauer said Friday.
But with the previous funding access problems and then the sudden closing three weeks ago of half of Head Start’s national offices, including the Chicago Region 5 office that served Wisconsin and five other states, providers were apprehensive.
“The level of uncertainty and chaos is so dramatic,” Mauer said — in contrast not only to the Biden administration, but also the previous Trump administration. Until this year, “these kinds of questions and uncertainties didn’t exist.”
Three providers whose grant cycle started Dec. 1 are waiting to learn whether their next allotment will become available starting June 1 as scheduled.
Mauer said the Senate Democrats’ calculations appear to be “showing the cumulative effect” of the access to HHS funding streams by the team working for DOGE, an agency directed by billionaire and Trump ally Elon Musk.
DOGE is the acronym for the Department of Government Efficiency, although the office is not a cabinet department, and many of its claims of government savings have been questioned.
The hold-up on information is having “a tremendous negative effect on our programs and it’s alarming,” Mauer said. “When we think of what are the impacts of Region 5 closing and that we continue to have very, very minimal and slow communication from the Office of Head Start — they need to start communicating with grantees in a much more substantive way.”
The Wisconsin Examiner contacted the federal Department of Health and Human Services using the HHS website for journalists’ inquiries and has not yet received a response. This report will be updated when a response is received.

As United States immigration officers called out countries, more and more of the crowd gathered in the University of Northern Iowa Mauker Union ballroom stood up. There were 25 countries represented among the almost 70 immigrants attending their naturalization ceremony Friday, having come together to complete their journey to becoming a U.S. citizen.
Family, friends and members of the UNI community cheered as participants received their certificates of naturalization and shook hands with Judge Mark Roberts, who presided over the ceremony. Chance Amani, a 21-year-old from Tanzania celebrating her naturalization, said her little sister was watching in the crowd and she had more family waiting at home in Cedar Rapids to congratulate her.
“I’m so happy,” Amani said, clutching her documents and a small American flag.

During his remarks, Roberts said despite having the honor of presiding over several ceremonies like Friday’s every year, he still gets emotional when he gets to be the first person to tell candidates they are U.S. citizens. Every single person, the youngest being 20 years old and the oldest 74, should be proud of what they accomplished and aware of what it means to be a U.S. citizen, he said.
“We hear a lot these days about what rights we have, but maybe we don’t speak enough about what we owe,” Roberts said. “With the benefit of citizenship comes responsibility of citizenship.”

Those receiving their naturalization certificate Friday were led through the Oath of Allegiance, in which they renounced allegiance and fidelity to any foreign land and pledged to support and defend the U.S. Constitution and law and bear arms, participate in military service and “perform work of national importance under civilian direction” when required.
Other duties U.S. citizens are responsible for include paying taxes, voting for leaders whenever they have an opportunity and following the law, Roberts said.
This was the first in-person naturalization ceremony held at UNI since before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic five years ago, and university professor and political science department head Scott Peters said it was wonderful to invite people back again to celebrate together.
The ceremony was sponsored by the new UNI Center for Civic Education, Peters said, as it aligns with the center’s goals of enhancing civic education on campus, expanding public outreach and broadening civics education for K-12 students throughout the state.
Seeing all of the people come together for an occasion like this is “an amazing feeling,” Peters said, and it helps remind him not to take what he has for granted.
“I just feel privileged that I even have the opportunity to have a small part in this day that I know is so important for them,” Peters said.
Chelsea Galoni, an immigrant from Canada who earned her citizenship while her wife, daughter, mother and grandmother cheered from the crowd, said she’s been waiting 14 years for this moment. She moved to the U.S. in 2011 to pursue her PhD from Northwestern University and now works as a business professor at the University of Iowa.

During the ceremony, Galoni’s daughter ran about in an empty area between rows of seats, an American flag from her mother waving in her hand. Having her family right there to share in the special moment with was an important aspect of the ceremony that Galoni said she may have missed if it was online.
“There’s an element of humanity that happens when they’re in person that’s nice,” Galoni said.
Ramon Pellizzaro, who moved to the U.S. with his mother and sister from Brazil when he was 11 years old, has Galoni beat for waiting for this day to happen — 22 years. His sister completed her citizenship process during the COVID-19 pandemic, Pellizzaro said, and it felt less formal. Pellizzaro enjoyed having a special event to commemorate this milestone, as it is a big undertaking.
One of the reasons Pellizarro was able to stay in the country for as long as he did before becoming a citizen was his participation in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program. He said the program allowed him to “create a life here,” leading to him meeting his wife and working as a data and analytics project manager at John Deere.
“It’s a good country,” Pellizzaro said. “Don’t take it for granted.”

After a number of revisions to the summary language, the board, which is made up of two Democrats and two Republicans, voted unanimously to approve the proposal language and the form. 



The final language approved by the board reads:
“Constitutional amendment to: add requirement to verify citizenship by showing a birth certificate, passport and/or other documents for voter registration; eliminate affidavit alternative for those without photo ID when voting; add requirement to provide photo ID or driver’s license or partial social security number to receive our vote in absentee ballot; require Secretary of State to review voter rolls to verify citizens and remove non citizens using documents and government records; prohibit counting ballots from voters without citizenship documents and photo ID unless voters show documents within six days after election; require hardship program for obtaining required documents at state expense.” 



The proposed amendment mirrors an effort introduced by state Rep. Bryan Posthumus (R-Rockford) after a Chinese citizen attending the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor cast a ballot in the previous election.When Posthumus’ proposal was put forth in December, an organization called the Committee to Protect Voters’ Rights launched a website proposing a petition drive to get an amendment on the ballot if lawmakers do not take up the proposal.
While Posthumus reintroduced the proposal in January, the effort has yet to come up for a vote on the House floor, with Democrats calling its provisions akin to a “poll tax”. Meanwhile, the Committee to Protect Voters’ Rights has moved forward with a ballot proposal effort. 
In order to appear on the 2026 ballot, the committee must gather 446,198 signatures within 180 days and file them with the Secretary of State. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
During the meeting, the board’s Democratic members as well as representatives from several voting rights groups argued the initial summary, as well as edits proposed by the group sponsoring the proposal, failed to capture the full impact of the amendment. 
Alongside concerns that the proposal would disenfranchise married women, low-income individuals, seniors, people living in rural communities and people who are homeless and cannot access the documents needed to prove their identity, board members and opponents raised concerns about how the proposal would impact individuals who have signed up to vote absentee in every election, as well as what documents could be used to prove citizenship. 
Democrat Mary Ellen Gurewitz, the board’s vice chair, specifically raised concerns about birth certificates being listed in the summary, as married women who change their names would be required to submit both a birth certificate and a marriage license to verify their identity, though Committee to Protect Voters’ Rights attorney Charles Spies said this process was not unique to voting alone. 
  Mary Ellen Gurewitz, vice chair of the Michigan Board of State Canvassers during an April 18, 2025 meeting | Screenshot.
Gurewitz further argued that the proposal would strip voters of their rights, pointing to Proposal 18-3 and Proposal 22-2, where Michigan residents voted to expand voting rights to include no-reason absentee voting, nine days of early voting, use of a photo ID or signed affidavit to verify their identity, placement on a permanent absentee voter list and access to ballot drop boxes. 
However, Spies argued the proposal was not removing any right, but rather was protecting the rights of Michiganders to “not have their votes diluted.” 
While noncitizens are not eligible to vote in federal, state or most local elections, some municipalities do allow them to vote in their elections.
Instances of noncitizen voting are exceedingly rare, with Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson issuing a press release on April 3, noting that the state saw 16 credible cases of noncitizen voting in the November 2024 election out of more than 5.7 million total votes cast, though several members of the public who spoke up at Friday’s meeting argued that any instance of noncitizen voting watered down their right to vote.

Paul Cordes, one of the board’s Republicans members, also argued that any number of voters cast illegally within the state is a problem with the system.
Heather Cummings, the other Democrat on the board, concurred with Gurewitz, arguing that characterizing the proposal as an effort to protect voter rights is misleading. She later questioned how the proposal would impact the ability for Michigan residents to register to vote online. 
Charles Thomas Jr., the founder of the voter rights organization When You Vote – I Win, testified on his own behalf pointing to discrepancies between his and his father’s name on his birth certificate, his name on his driver’s license and his name on his passport. 
“I’m a junior. I love the fact that you know, you all asked me to spell my name. On my birth certificate. I found that my father’s name is spelled C, H, A, R L, E, Y. My name is spelled C, H, A, R, L, I, E. On my license is C H A R L, E, S.  I got a passport, C, H, A, R, L, E, S.  I’m not sure which one would count if I had to produce information to say who I was in order just to be able to obtain the right to vote,” Thomas said. 
Erica Peresman, the Senior Advisor for Promote the Vote, which successfully backed both the 2018 and 2022 voting rights amendments, told the Michigan Advance that these difficult-to-correct discrepancies should not be a barrier to voting. 
While the proposal would have the Legislature craft a program to ensure citizens facing hardship have the documents needed to cast their ballot, the way that program would operate remains up in the air, Peresman said, predicting that state officials would not be the ones helping residents from out of state retrieve their birth certificates from the place where they were born. 

“They’re just going to pay the cost of it, the legwork and dealing with the bureaucracies in these various states, that all has to be done by the individuals.…Our concern is always that people might just give up. They might not have the time, the energy, the resources to be able to run down all of these things, even if the actual cost of the document itself is being covered by the state,” Peresman said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/election-2022-voter-scaled-e1667935206448-1024x7681671667081-1.jpeg,,,2025-04-18 18:07:53.748274

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — A new superintendent at Edmond Public Schools will start his tenure with a higher base salary than the retiring district leader he will replace.
Josh Delich will earn a base salary of $236,903 when he takes office July 1, along with a $20,000 relocation stipend to move to Edmond from Minnesota, where he is an associate superintendent in the state’s largest school district.
Delich will succeed Superintendent Angela Grunewald, who earned a base salary of about $221,000 in 2024 and in 2025 received a total compensation of $248,144 when factoring in the total value of her benefits as well as her base salary, state records show. Grunewald is retiring after four years in charge of Edmond schools.
After hiring Delich on Monday, the district released his contract Friday afternoon to Oklahoma Voice, showing the incoming superintendent’s salary, benefits and additional stipends.
It’s unclear how much Delich’s total benefits will cost on top of his base salary. His contract states the district will cover the full price of premiums for his health, vision and dental insurance, and it will pay both the employer and employee’s portions of his contribution into the state’s Teacher Retirement System. He also will receive $500 per month as an automobile allowance.

In addition to his relocation stipend, the district will pay Delich $3,000 per month for up to six months to maintain his home in Minnesota until it is sold.
Delich will earn $987.10 per day for an expected 23 days for work completed before he takes office as superintendent. A temporary contract lasting until June 30 states he will consult with district officials as he transitions into the administration, including assisting with new employee hires, budget work, facility planning and opening, strategic planning and other tasks deemed necessary. 
Because Delich will be working with Edmond schools during the transition, he will forgo compensation from the Minnesota district, the contract states. His Edmond contract includes a buyout stipend of no more than $18,000. The final amount of the buyout stipend is still to be determined, according to the contract.
Once he takes office, he will be subject to a yearly performance evaluation after which the school board could agree to raise his base salary, which is a common practice for district superintendents. His salary could only decrease through a mutual agreement, according to the contract.
Delich will be near, if not among, the top 20 highest-earning Oklahoma superintendents when he becomes the chief executive in Edmond, the state’s fourth-largest district with 25,700 students.
Norman Public Schools Superintendent Nick Migliorino tops the list with $411,955 in annual salary and benefits, according to compensation data the Oklahoma State Department of Education compiled. 
The state agency’s list, though, doesn’t include Jamie Polk, who leads the state’s second-largest district, Oklahoma City Public Schools. At the time Polk was hired last year, her contract set out a $250,000 base salary, not including benefits and a potential performance bonus.
Like Polk, Delich is a first-time superintendent. He has 21 years of experience in education as a teacher, coach, principal and district administrator. He was an assistant superintendent in St. Paul Public Schools in Minnesota before joining Anoka-Hennepin Schools, Minnesota’s largest district.

While introducing him as the district’s next leader, Edmond school board President Courtney Hobgood praised Delich’s experience, his heart for education and his “passion for continuing the forward progress in Edmond and building on our history of success.”
Delich said Monday he is “blessed and humbled” to become the superintendent of Edmond, which he called a destination district with an “immense amount of excellence.” He and his wife, Desirae, will have their two daughters start school in Edmond in the coming year, according to a letter he penned to district families.
“I want to infuse myself and integrate myself into (the) system to best learn what is going on with Edmond in terms of the excellence that’s happening and also look at the areas that we need to improve and advance while at the same time giving a sense of calm to a district that I know, when you have a new leader, there’s that sense of anxiety,” Delich said while speaking with news media Monday.

(Photo by Jacquelyn Jimenez Romero/Washington State Standard)Washington began to offer Medicaid-like health care coverage last year for thousands of low-income immigrants living in the state without legal status.
Now, with talks over the next two-year state budget in their final stages, lawmakers are looking to maintain the expansion. But enrollment in the program remains capped based on available funding and legislators are not on track to change that this year.
Rep. My-Linh Thai, D-Bellevue, introduced a bill early in the session that would have opened the program to all immigrants who meet the income eligibility guidelines and other requirements. 
Her bill, which would have created additional costs for the state at a time when lawmakers are trying to solve a budget shortfall, never got a hearing. Thai also said there was controversy about language referring to noncitizens as “Washingtonians.” 
“We cannot just keep paying for emergency room visits, no coverage,” said Thai. “Charity can only extend for so much, right? I mean, this is responsible governing.” 
Federal law largely prevents noncitizens from accessing benefits through Medicaid, but states can use state dollars to create programs for this population. 
Medicaid, known as Apple Health in Washington, provides health care coverage to people with lower incomes. In Washington, about 1.8 million residents are covered by Medicaid or the related Children’s Health Insurance Program.
On July 1, 2024, Washington launched a program to offer Apple Health benefits to immigrants in the U.S. without legal authorization who meet certain eligibility guidelines. But the program, which is designed to mirror Medicaid, only had enough funding to cover up to 13,000 people. 
Within the first 48 hours, all slots were filled, and an additional 17,000 people signed up to be on the waiting list, according to Sasha Wasserstrom, policy director at the Washington Immigrant Solidarity Network. 
Funding for the program is currently around $76.8 million a year. House-approved budget legislation would provide funding in line with that amount. The Senate’s operating budget bill would commit less — $67.5 million and $64.6 million in the next two fiscal years. But the Senate plan banks on changes that would achieve savings in costs for care.
The Apple Health Expansion program, as it’s known, operates only using state funds, as opposed to the traditional Medicaid program, which relies on a combination of federal and state dollars.
Advocates say that since the expansion took place, people have been able to access cancer and dialysis treatments that have extended their lives. 
“It sounds so extreme, but it’s genuine, that people will die as a result of not receiving health care access,” said Kaitie Dong, a policy analyst at the Washington State Budget and Policy Center. 
Republicans argue that the state needs to be careful with its spending during a year with a substantial budget deficit and that the state shouldn’t be giving services to people who are noncitizens while cutting services for others. 
“We should have compassion, but we should also make sure we follow the rule of law,” said Senate Minority Leader John Braun, R-Centralia. 
In Washington, immigrants without legal authorization to work in the U.S. contributed nearly $1 billion to state and local taxes in 2022, according to estimates from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy.
“The dominant narrative is that people don’t believe that undocumented immigrants pay taxes, but they’re actually some of our greatest tax contributors and economic drivers,” Dong said. 
Expanding health care coverage to noncitizens can also save the state money by reducing emergency medical care costs, said Wasserstrom. 
“We know that providing preventative medical care is more beneficial to the individual and to the system as a whole, and that causes less strain on the system as a whole,” they added.
Federal law requires emergency rooms to treat people regardless of immigration status. But a lack of health insurance often leads to people waiting until their health concerns worsen to seek care, and they then end up in the emergency room. This can contribute to emergency rooms becoming overwhelmed. 
“It’s hard to actually see emergencies when you’re really stuck seeing people who can’t access primary care because they don’t have insurance or feel safe,” said Dr. Shaquita Bell, a pediatrician and director at Odessa Brown Children’s Clinic in Seattle.  
At the clinic where Bell works, some of her patients have parents who lack legal status. During her time as a pediatrician, there have been instances where a parent has expressed their own health care concerns. When this happens, she will either connect them with a social worker who will help them or if someone’s in urgent need of care, she will try to help. 
Advocates hope that the funding cap for the Apple Health program is removed so that anyone who qualifies, regardless of their immigration status, can have access. 
“Caring for immigrants helps everyone, and it’s the right thing to do,” Bell said. “These are people, and every person deserves health care.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_0211-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-04-18 18:07:53.748274

Patrick Morrisey, seen giving his State of the State address on Wednesday, Feb. 12, 2025, cut millions of the state budget with line item vetoes before signing the bill into law. (Perry Bennett | West Virginia Legislative Photography)Gov. Patrick Morrisey signed the budget bill Thursday night, but not before slashing millions of dollars in funding through his line-item veto power. The Republican governor’s cuts were wide sweeping across state programs, and services for vulnerable children were among those surprisingly hit.
“When I took office, I inherited a $400 million structural budget gap in the upcoming fiscal year, which would grow to nearly $600 million in the years ahead if it was not immediately addressed,” Morrisey said in a statement released by his office. “The fiscally conservative budget I signed tonight makes progress tackling structural gaps and begins to place us on a pathway toward financial stability in the future.”
The 29 separate line-item vetoes included slashes in funding for roads, school safety and tourism projects. There were also millions of dollars in cuts to programs that serve foster kids, families impacted by substance abuse and sick children. 
Morrisey cut $250,000 in funding for Lily’s Place, a nonprofit organization in Cabell County that provides treatment for newborns with neonatal abstinence syndrome and support for families dealing with substance use disorder. West Virginia has the highest rate nationally of infants born with neonatal abstinence syndrome amid the state’s ongoing substance abuse crisis.
House Finance Chairman Vernon Criss, R-Wood, called it one “the most insulting” of Morrisey’s line-item vetoes. 
“This one should be right at the top — to be able to take newborns that are drug-afflicted and be able to help them,” Criss said. “[It] seems to have a very high success rate of helping newborns getting off the drug situation.” 
Morrisey also decreased funding for the Ronald McDonald House in Morgantown and In-Home Family Education, a parent and child support program in West Virginia.

“It’s almost like you’re picking on kids who can’t speak up for themselves,” said House Minority Leader Sean Hornbuckle, D-Cabell.
The legislative session adjourned with little action on the state’s abundant foster care issues despite bills introduced to address a myriad of problems, including too many foster children living in hotels. 
Lawmakers wanted to give $1.1 million in state funding to West Virginia’s Court Appointed Special Advocates, or CASA, a program that helps foster children in the court system.
Morrisey cut 75% of that funding in his line-item veto. His office did not respond to an email from West Virginia Watch seeking information about the funding decrease. In his veto message, the governor said the program relies on grants and could seek additional grant funding.  
Shanna Gray, executive director of West Virginia CASA, said she was grateful to the Legislature for creating a dedicated line item for the program. 
“We could not be more appreciative of our state lawmakers for prioritizing support for children in foster care,” she said. “Albeit significantly reduced, the governor‘s final allocation of $300,000 establishes a crucial foundation of state support. We remain optimistic about this initial investment and thankful for the state’s recognition of CASA’s essential role in ensuring children’s best interests are represented and heard.”
In total, Morrisey cut $800,000 in foster care funding. 
“The fear is that we’ve got programs out there right now that we do not know if they’ll be able to continue because the federal dollars are going to dry up,” Criss said. “[Morrisey] needs to be able to take a very hard look at all the programs.”
In a news release on Friday, the West Virginia Democratic Party called on the governor to “reconsider these harmful decisions and focus state resources on supporting vulnerable citizens and vital community programs.”

Disagreement among GOP supermajority about budget 
The Republican-led House and Senate passed their $5.3 billion general revenue budget bill last week.
Morrisey’s line-item veto messages used similar language often, saying, “it is imperative that a cautious and prudent approach be taken” while citing concerns about future uncertainties, like the federal stock market fluctuations and federal uncertainty. He also said that there are “ongoing budget challenges.”
The spending vetoes also included $500,000 reduction to Mountwood Park in Wood County for Jeep trails, and a $187,000 reduction to the more than $11 million allocation to the state Veterans Nursing home, and a $250,000 cut for a nursing program at West Virginia State University.
“He decided nursing programs are not where he wants to spend money,” Criss said. 
There was a $25 million reduction to the State Road Fund; Criss said that funding cuts may damage the state Division of Highways’ ability to draw down federal funds for projects. 
Morrisey eliminated $250,000 allocated for the West Virginia University College of Law but did not touch the $1.5 lawmakers gave the university to build a civics learning center overseen by a political appointee. Lawmakers passed a bill mandating the center, but it hasn’t yet been signed by the governor. 
He slashed more than $110 million approved in three surplus funds, which included the funding for Lily’s Place. Morrisey said those funds may be needed for anticipated gaps in Medicaid, Public Employees Insurance Agency and federal changes. 
Morrisey is a staunch supporter of President Donald Trump; Hornbuckle said the governor’s decision to slash state spending because concerns about Medicaid and federal changes showed, “Even the governor doesn’t believe his good friend is going to be able to help West Virginians.”  
“We might have to fill back in dollars to Medicaid or PEIA,” Hornbuckle continued. “People need to be really paying attention to what’s going on there, and he doesn’t trust the Trump administration.”
Hornbuckle added that Morrisey’s line-item vetoes showed disagreement among the state’s GOP-supermajority in power. 
Criss continues to refute Morrisey’s projected $400 million structural deficit.
“I am the last finance chairman still in place from the previous administration, I take that a personal cut,” he said. “[Morrisey] doesn’t understand how we have been budgeting and doing the budget process for the last seven years when we’ve tried to keep our ‘operating portion’ of our budget.” The House wanted the state to have surplus money in the back of the budget that could be used for one-time projects.
Senate Finance Chairman Jason Barrett, R-Berkeley, wasn’t available for comment. 
Funds slashed for safe schools, educational programs 
Morrisey’s line-item vetoes included several education-related projects, including funding decreasing to the Mountain State Digital Literacy Program, a math education program and computer science education. In a veto of $200,000 in funding for Safe Schools, Morrisey said it is, “imperative that we limit new spending.” 
West Virginia’s public schools can’t afford to implement millions of dollars in safety upgrades, including secure front entries and weapon detection systems. There are more than $200 million in school safety requests in need of funding.
“How can we in good faith cut money to safe schools and that is something that goes to all of our public education when we are pumping millions of dollars into the Hope voucher program?” Hornbuckle said. 
The budget passed by the Republican-led Legislature opted to put away about $33.6 million from general revenue to the state Personal Income Tax Reserve Fund. That money, Criss said, can be allocated by the Legislature at any time. The fund has more than $500 million in it, drawing frustration from Del. Kayla Young, D-Kanawha, during budget debate since other programs had gone unfunded. 
The budget didn’t include $100,000 for clean drinking water in Wyoming County. Funding was cut for the state’s Jobs and Hope Program.
Hornbuckle voted against the budget when it passed the House, citing concerns about a lack of funding for child care. 
“I didn’t think it had a lot of fiscal logic and appropriate the dollars that we do have to public education or child care,” he said. “I’m also confused why we went further down the hole right now in making the current cuts that we did.”
In a statement on Thursday, Morrisey said that “much work remains in the next fiscal year to address budget shortfalls.” 
“ … I applaud the Legislature for sending me a budget that closely resembles my original proposal and begins to address long term issues while funding West Virginia priorities,” he said.

(Photo by Mike Clark for the Daily Montanan)A bill to create an exemption for cigar rooms from the Montana Clean Indoor Air Act is headed to the House floor — and legislation to strengthen the Act by including e-cigarettes and vape pens in the definition of smoking is headed to the governor’s desk.
Senate Bill 150, sponsored by Sen. Wylie Galt, R-Martinsdale, is an attempt to help the hospitality and tourism industry in the state by allowing places where cigar aficionados can legally smoke indoors.
Galt said cigar bars are legal in many states, and a supporter representing the hospitality industry said the lack of an exemption here means Montana is at a competitive disadvantage.
In a statement Friday, Galt said he’s pleased with the progress the bill has made.
“Adults over 21 years of age would have the option to enjoy a cigar in a contained location that meets proper ventilation requirements separate from an established bar or restaurant,” Galt said.
Opponents of the bill argue it undercuts an agreement made decades earlier among legislators, some health advocates and the Montana Tavern Association to put the Clean Indoor Air Act in place in 2005 but allow four years for bars to comply.
The Department of Public Health and Human Services describes it as “one of the most important public health policies in state history.”
Montana Tavern Association spokesperson John Iverson could not be reached for comment Friday.
However, at a hearing in March, Iverson told the House Committee on Business and Labor that his board had a robust debate about the bill and didn’t support it because it undercuts the Clean Indoor Air Act.
“It does that by exposing employees to smoke in their workplace,” Iverson said. “For a long time now, our employees have not been exposed to smoke in their workplace.”
But Iverson said the organization would support the bill if it was amended to prohibit employees from entering the room where patrons are smoking and the room had separate ventilation.
This week, the committee voted on an amendment that changed the venue from “cigar bar” to “cigar room” and said employees can’t enter the room while smoking is taking place unless there’s an emergency.
As currently drafted, the bill would allow smoking of premium cigars in “cigar rooms,” separate enclosed spaces on premises that have a license to serve alcohol.
Patrons wouldn’t be able to smoke anything but premium cigars in those rooms, as the bill is written. So no marijuana or cigarettes.
The bill requires a cigar room to be enclosed and have “a solid door” and a ventilation system that doesn’t send exhausted air to nonsmoking areas.
Thursday, the committee approved the bill on a 12-8 party line vote.
In a phone call Friday, CB Pearson, a public health advocate, said the legislation is worse than originally drafted for the health of workers.
“It is the biggest intrusion into the Clean Indoor Air act and the biggest threat that we have faced over the last 20 years,” Pearson said.
Pearson said one reason he believes the current draft is worse is the original bill required a cigar bar to be a separate, standalone structure, and the amended version allows for a separate room in a building.
But he said rooms leak toxic particulates, such as when someone opens a door.
The American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers’ position is that even when “all practical means of separation and isolation of smoking areas are employed, adverse health effects from exposure in non-smoking spaces in the same building cannot be eliminated.”
It also means an employee who enters the room after hours to clean is exposed to particulates because they fall on the floor and stick to the walls, Pearson said.
“There is no way to have a facility that can protect workers if they have to go in and clean up or attend to a site,” Pearson said.
Before it was amended, Galt told the House committee he had been running a version of the cigar bar bill since he first started in the legislature in the House.
“We have continued working on it, trying to tweak it where we can,” Galt said.
Friday, Galt said the idea the bill is worse for public health than when it started is incorrect because it bans employees from entering those rooms.
“During the legislative process, the bill was amended to be contained to a single room in which employees aren’t permitted to enter,” Galt said. “While this wasn’t my original language, it is the result of the legislative process, and I am glad to see it one step closer to becoming law.”
The bill will head to the House floor as amended.
Another bill that affects the Clean Indoor Air Act is Senate Bill 390, sponsored by Sen. Willis Curdy, D-Missoula. It regulates vapes and e-cigarettes.
It passed out of the Senate on Tuesday on a bipartisan 34-16 vote after being amended in the House.
Rep. George Nikolakakos, R-Great Falls, carried the bill in the House, and he said he’s generally a fan of vices.
However, he said he believes there’s a social contract that needs to be honored when it comes to freedom and vices, and the deal includes regulation.
He said Montanans support the Clean Indoor Air Act — a poll said as much as 89% — and Montana has the second highest rate in the nation of vape use, and four times the rate of smoking among adolescents.
“E-cigarettes came into the market just after we passed the Clean Indoor Air Act, so honestly, they probably would have been included had this been on the market at the time,” Nikolakakos said.
The Governor’s Office did not respond to a question Friday about whether Gov. Greg Gianforte would sign SB 390, which is headed to his desk, or if he would have any concerns about an exemption to the Clean Indoor Air Act in SB 150.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/230426-CapitolStockPhotos01-scaled-e1731707160413-1024x577.jpg,,,2025-04-18 17:08:00.694955

(Photo via Google Earth)  Catholic Health Initiatives-Iowa has dropped its argument in a medical malpractice case that the loss of an unborn child does not equate to the death of a “person” for the purpose of calculating damage awards.
The nonprofit, tax-exempt entity is one of several defendants in a Polk County malpractice case involving the death of an unborn child.
Last month, attorneys for CHI and MercyOne Des Moines Medical Center argued an unborn child should not be considered a “patient” for purposes of calculating damages in the case. They also argued that “finding an unborn child to be a ‘person’ would lead to serious implications in other areas of the law.”
That position appeared to clash with CHI’s mission statement and ethics guidelines, both of which are based on the concept that human life begins at the moment of conception.
In Iowa, court-ordered awards for noneconomic losses stemming from medical malpractice are capped at $250,000, except in cases that entail the “loss or impairment of mind or body.” Initially, CHI and MercyOne argued the cap on damages applied in cases where the “loss” was that of a fetus or an unborn child.
However, during a court hearing on Friday, an attorney for CHI and MercyOne, Christine Conover, informed the court it was withdrawing from the motion to cap damages in the case on that basis.
“We are a Catholic hospital and obviously the Catholic faith believes that life begins at conception,” Conover told Polk County District Judge Scott J. Beattie.
“To be honest, I had wondered about that stance,” Beattie told Conover, referring to the hospital’s previously filed motion seeking to cap damages. “It seemed like kind of an odd stance,” he added, noting that it seemed to contradict the position that CHI had taken in other legal matters.
In a written statement issued Friday, Bob Ritz, president and CEO of MercyOne, stated “we are heartbroken that our belief that human personhood begins at conception would ever be called into question. As a Catholic health system, the sanctity of life is not just a belief we hold; it is the foundation of every action we take.
“While the motion (to limit damages) was accurate from a purely legal standpoint, it has caused confusion and concern. That is why we have asked our counsel to withdraw the motion with respect to MercyOne. No courtroom argument should ever cast doubt on the deeply held Catholic values that guide MercyOne.
“At MercyOne, our Catholic identity is not something we set aside. It is central to who we are. It shapes how we serve and care for people in their most sacred and vulnerable moments. We are more than a health system. We are a health ministry. Our commitment to respect the dignity of every human life, from the very beginning, is unwavering. And it will continue to guide us in everything we do.”
The question of whether the cap on damages would apply in the case is still an issue for other defendants in the case, including Pella Regional Health Center.

Lawsuit stems from 2021 incident
The lawsuit involves the treatment provided to Miranda Anderson of Poweshiek County. Anderson was 34 weeks pregnant when, on April 13, 2021, she arrived at Pella Regional Health Center for evaluation due to elevated blood pressure, headaches and edema.
Citing concerns that she was experiencing preeclampsia — a condition that can lead to serious complications for both mother and baby and may require early delivery — Anderson was transferred to MercyOne’s Obstetrics Emergency Unit via ambulance.
According to the lawsuit later filed by Anderson and her husband, Landen, Miranda Anderson was discharged after two days of monitoring and testing. After further evaluations over the course of the next several days, she was again discharged to her home — until, during an April 21 evaluation, her doctor was unable to detect any fetal heartbeat. The next day, she underwent a cesarean delivery of a nonviable baby girl, Eloise.
The Andersons’ lawsuit seeks damages for negligence, alleging CHI, MercyOne and its physicians failed to recommend early delivery of the baby while it was still viable and Anderson showed evidence of preeclampsia. The defendants have denied any wrongdoing.
Citing the state’s $250,000 cap on noneconomic damages in malpractice cases — a cap that was approved by state legislators in 2017 — the defendants have argued that while the cap on damages includes an exemption for cases that entail the “loss or impairment of mind or body,” that exemption should not apply to a case where a fetus or unborn child is lost.
They argue the Iowa Legislature did not intend for the loss of a baby prior to delivery to be included within the exemption. As evidence of this, they cite the fact that in 2023 — two years after the Anderson pregnancy — state lawmakers explicitly added “loss of pregnancy” to the exemption on the cap for damages.
Attorneys for Anderson argue the 2023 change was enacted merely to clarify the scope of the 2017 statute, not to expand the exemption on the caps for damages.
The case is scheduled for trial on May 12, 2025.
At Friday’s hearing, Beattie indicated he will rule on the question of damages, as well as other unresolved pretrial disputes, as quickly as possible.

Maddock had been given two parking spots in the garage as he normally drives a large truck, Gideon D’Assandro, spokesman for Republican House Speaker Matt Hall said in a statement. However on Thursday, Maddock drove a different car and parked it between one of his spots and Brixie’s.

Why are both parties split?",John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/18/ct-electric-rates-2025-bill/,"The bill, raised by Sen. John Fonfara, would have CT borrow $2.4B over the next three years to pay off a chunk of residents’ electric bills.","Following months of public angst over Connecticut’s high energy prices, both Republicans and Democrats this week rallied behind what many saw as an audacious proposal: Have the state borrow $2.4 billion over the next three years to pay off a chunk of its residents’ electric bills.
The proposal, Senate Bill 1560, is the work of state Sen. John Fonfara, D-Hartford, a veteran lawmaker who serves as co-chair of the legislature’s Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee.
During a press conference Wednesday, where he was flanked by leaders from both parties, Fonfara said his bill would immediately cut electric costs up to 20% by removing the controversial public benefits charge from customers’ bills and paying for it through state-issued bonds. The public benefits charge covers the cost of state-mandated energy-efficiency programs, clean energy investments and support for low-income ratepayers.
Additional provisions of the bill would save ratepayers even more in the long run, Fonfara said. Those include revamping the process through which the utilities purchase power for their customers, mandating variable time-of-use electric rates, eliminating certain solar credits and the sales tax on electricity bought by commercial and industrial users, along with other changes. The combined savings could be as much as 40% of customers’ current bills, the senator said.
“There are certain fundamental truths that we must acknowledge and act on if we want to reverse the path we are on,” Fonfara said. “If we choose to do nothing, electricity costs will continue to increase.”
Almost immediately, however, members of both parties began to question Fonfara’s promises of savings and the wisdom of borrowing what would amount to nearly one-third of the state’s annual bond cap — which is currently $2.5 billion — exclusively for this purpose.
Others pointed out that Fonfara is at the center of controversy surrounding a deal with Gov. Ned Lamont’s office to place him on a vacant seat at the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority, which is in charge of approving electric rates. After that deal was announced last month, press reports revealed that Fonfara owned a company which racked up more than $1 million in fines and late fees from PURA.
In a statement released Tuesday, a spokesman for Lamont said the governor was open to considering some aspects of the bill such as improving the energy procurement process and addressing variable demand for electricity at different times of day.
But the spokesman, Rob Blanchard, made it clear that the governor does not view the creation of a new government entity or more borrowing as viable solutions to the state’s energy affordability issues.
“Rather than putting annual expenses on our ‘credit card’ or crowding out bonding for municipal parks, roads, and school construction with items in the public benefits charge, as proposed, the Governor would prefer we explore ways to reduce [public benefits] charges that may be outdated or unnecessary,” Blanchard said in his statement.
House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, was similarly skeptical of the amount of new debt proposed in the bill and whether it would be paid back with taxpayer funds or revenues drawn from utility bills.
“If there’s state general fund contributions, we can’t afford it,” Ritter said. “If it’s something about the ratepayers paying it back over 30 years as opposed to three, I mean, I’d look at that.” 
Despite those concerns, the bill gained traction this week with the backing of a bipartisan slate of key lawmakers including Senate President Pro Tem Martin M. Looney, D-New Haven, Senate Majority Leader Bob Duff, D-Norwalk, and House Republican Leader Vincent Candelora, R-North Branford.
Candelora said that his caucus had been discussing the bill with Fonfara over the last six or eight weeks. In March, Republicans were angered when Democrats on the legislature’s Energy and Technology Committee opted not to go forward with any of the Republicans’ proposals to reduce residents’ electricity bills.
“This piece of legislation does that, and we look forward to that bipartisan conversation that is so needed to try to address the concerns of our business community and our residents and the impacts that high electric costs have had on the state of Connecticut,” Candelora said.
Fonfara has until April 24 to schedule a vote to advance his bill out of the committee he chairs. 
Utilities weigh in
In his comments to the press Wednesday, Fonfara outlined two key pillars of his legislation that he said would work to reduce electricity costs.
First, it would remove portions of public benefits charge from customers’ bills and shift those costs onto the state through new bonds issued over the next three years. Those bonds would be capped at $800 million a year, for a total of $2.4 billion.
Secondly, the legislation would create a new quasi-public agency known as the Connecticut Energy Procurement Authority that would be work with electric utilities, the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection and local electric cooperatives to create a new method of purchasing electric power supply at lower rates for customers. 
The switch, Fonfara said, would in essence take the utilities’ job of buying power and turn it over to public officials who could work year-round to find the best deals on wholesale electric market, rather than than the competitive auctions the utilities currently participate in twice a year.
“The utilities are being taken out of the procurement business,” Fonfara said. “They’re going to say ‘thank you,’ because it’s a thankless job for them. They make no money on it. They get criticized when rates go up and they don’t get any recognition when rates go down. I’m no apologist for them, but that’s the reality.”

Under Connecticut’s deregulated energy system, customers’ bills are split into four parts: the cost to procure power supply, the transmission and distribution of that power and a public benefits charge.
The utilities must pass on their supply and public benefit program costs to their customers without any markup. The companies earn profits only on the transmission and distribution of the that electricity.
During a public hearing on the bill Wednesday, representatives from United Illuminating and Eversource did, in fact, praise Fonfara’s legislation, which they said offered solutions to reduce customers’ bills while focusing on those areas where they don’t earn a profit. 
“We are hopeful that the concepts in this bill would turn into a reality where we would end up seeing some significant reductions in perhaps the supply charges and other areas that are meant for grid modernization,” said Christie Prescott, the director of wholesale power contracts at United Illuminating. 
Both of the utilities also supported another provision in the bill that would limit the amount of credits that customers with solar panels could earn on their bill by sending excess power back into the grid.
As more customers install solar panels and purchase less electricity from the grid, utility officials said the cost to maintain transmission wires, utility poles and other infrastructure has shifted onto customers without solar panels. The amount of electricity Eversource sold to its customers last year — about 20,000 gigawatt hours — was roughly the same as in 1993, according to data presented to lawmakers from the utility. 
“We have this predicament and it’s not specific to Eversource,” said Doug Horton, the utility’s vice president for distribution rates & regulatory requirements. “The fact of the matter is that we have a declining sales base and a need to continue to invest in the system.”  
That same proposal, however, drew a sharp response from environmental advocates and the solar industry. Both groups said it would dismantle solar incentives while placing further strain onto the grid.
“Energy efficiency and solar have been essential for keeping costs down for customers, because you have to think about the investments in distribution and transmission systems that otherwise would of had to be made over the those 20 years,” said Charles Rothenberger, a climate and energy attorney for Save the Sound, a local environmental group. 
Other critics raised concerns that the cap of $800 million a year on the bonds would not be enough to cover the full cost of public benefit programs — which is currently more than $1 billion a year — leaving the future of those programs in doubt.
Claire Coleman, the head of the Office of Consumer Counsel that advocates on behalf of ratepayers, submitted written testimony to Fonfara’s committee stating that those costs can also shift largely from year to year, making it difficult for officials to know how much money they would have to borrow ahead of time to pay for the programs.  
“Even if it were permissible and the proposed bill was amended to increase the bonding limits to reflect the necessary expenditures, it is not clear that state bond process is best suited to fund the programs indicated in the proposed bill,” Coleman said.
Fonfara said the intent of the bill was to give ratepayers a three-year window of relief. Meanwhile, lawmakers, in conjunction with the new Connecticut Energy Procurement Authority, would determine whether the programs under the public benefits charge are necessary and whether the costs to run those programs should be borne by the state or by ratepayers through their electric bills. If they’re determined not to be necessary, he said lawmakers could opt to discontinue them.
“That’s for the legislature to decide,” he said. “But it will be a prudent decision, with a lot more information.”
Party infighting
The top two Democrats in the Senate, Looney and Duff, had previously pledged their support for another bill addressing electric prices — Senate Bill 4 — that is still being drafted by members of the legislature’s Energy and Technology Committee. When asked during Wednesday’s press conference whether the Fonfara legislation had supplanted that effort, Looney said there was no competition between the two bills.
“Eventually, they will all go into the hopper and provide something that I think the people of Connecticut will recognize as a legitimate response to the crisis that we face,” Looney said.
Within a matter of hours, however, tensions between the two committees and their leaders flared into the open.
About midway through Wednesday’s hearing, Sen. Norm Needleman, D-Essex, the leader of the Energy and Technology Committee, began questioning Horton, the Eversource executive, about a section of the bill dealing with the securitization of storm costs that he said closely resembled a proposal pitched by the utility following Tropical Storm Isaias in 2020. “I just want to be clear where a lot of this comes from,” Needleman asked, when Fonfara interjected.
“Senator, where it comes from is this person right here, it’s my bill,” Fonfara said. 
After more back-and-forth with Horton, Fonfara eventually cut off Needleman’s line of questioning saying that he had surpassed the committee’s five-minute time limit.
“I hope this bill comes to our committee where it belongs and we have a robust conversation about this,” Needleman responded. “This is not the way to solve these problems.”
When asked later about the spat, Looney issued a statement through a spokesman saying that such disagreements are part of the normal legislative process. 
“Forging consensus is a difficult process, but one that is necessary for any bill to become law,” Looney said. “Sometimes we do not know how issues will be framed and resolved until late in the session, whether they are merged into one bill, run separately, or have elements combined into a different vehicle altogether. Unlike the Republicans, we are not free to merely complain and offer unworkable pie-in-the-sky proposals.”

Candelora, the House Republican leader, blamed Needleman’s committee for blocking a number of proposals put forward by Republicans, including a plan that would have made the public benefits charge an annual expense, paid for out of the state’s budget. 
Speaking to a reporter later, Candelora clarified his support of Fonfara’s bill as “a work in progress,” and said he believes some public benefits programs, such as funding for electric vehicle charging stations, are appropriate bonding expenses while others should be budgeted for.
“What has been frustrating about this entire process is that you have a completely dysfunctional energy committee that has made all of these issues highly partisan and highly toxic,” Candelora said.
No Senate Republicans were present at Wednesday’s press conference with Fonfara. The day before, members of that caucus publicly accused Fonfara, their fellow senator, of being complicit in a scheme to provide political support for Lamont’s reappointment of PURA Chair Marissa Gillett in exchange for a job as one of five commissioners at the authority.
Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield, told reporters he believed that deal likely violated the state’s bribery statutes. But in the same press conference, Harding did not discount the idea of working with Fonfara on energy policy.
“We will do anything possible to reduce people’s electric bills in the state of Connecticut,” Harding said. “We don’t care who we have to work with.”
Later in the week, Harding and a top Republican on the Energy and Technology Committee, Sen. Ryan Fazio, R-Greenwich, said there are “several concerning aspects” of S.B. 1560 and that they would not support the bill in its current form. 
Specifically, Fazio said that Fonfara’s proposed Connecticut Energy Procurement Authority would have overlapping duties with existing state agencies. He also said a proposed fund administered by that authority to adopt smart metering technology and other infrastructure upgrades would result in the creation of what he called a “mini public benefits charge” that would still appear on electric bills.
Still, Harding and Fazio said they welcomed Fonfara’s efforts to address the issue.
Harding said he, too, was concerned with the creation of the new quasi-public authority, which he said he sees as a potential landing ground for Fonfara amid the scrutiny into the senator’s bid to obtain a seat on PURA. “It is quite suspect,” he said.
Tom Swan, the executive director of Connecticut Citizen Action Group, called Fonfara’s promises to save residents money “horribly dishonest,” and he said he thinks the legislation raises several “ethical red flags,” given the senator’s business ventures in the energy industry.
“There is absolutely no trust for Sen. Fonfara to be playing a role in this,” Swan said.
Fonfara told reporters on Wednesday that he has no interest in serving on the new authority. He did not respond to additional requests for comment about the legislation this week. 
A third bill addressing electric prices, drafted by members of the Government Administration and Elections Committee last month, would have prohibited Eversource and United Illuminating from owning both electric and gas utilities, and it imposed new qualification requirements for members of PURA’s board. Ritter, the House speaker, said this week he does not expect that legislation to move forward.
“That was not rightfully raised, and it will crumble,” Ritter said. 
But with respect to the other two bills, Ritter said both have the potential to produce worthwhile ideas. “I think you have two major pieces of energy legislation: S.B. 4 and Sen. Fonfara’s bill,” he said. “My thing would be, let’s put them all together and get a great bill.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_4441-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-18 17:08:00.694955

The Utah Lt. Governor’s Office earned the commission’s 2024 Clearinghouse Award for distinguished voter education initiatives and the Salt Lake County Clerk Election Division won for best practices for improving accessibility for voters with disabilities. 
Salt Lake County’s “Try Before You Vote: Accessible Vote Outreach” program earned it a spot on the list. With the initiative, the county’s election division offered live demonstrations of voting equipment and other resources at events for individuals with disabilities, allowing them to test out the tools, ask questions and register to vote.

“This outreach was all about meeting voters where they are,” Salt Lake County Clerk Lannie Chapman said in a news release. “We know that confidence and familiarity are key to participation, especially for voters with disabilities. Our team is proud to be recognized for helping make the voting process more accessible, approachable, and inclusive for everyone in our community.”
The election division wrote in its award entry that the program substantially increased confidence and participation in the election process. It also had benefits for election officials by “reducing the need for last-minute accommodations and increasing overall efficiency.”  
The lieutenant governor’s office earned its award for its “12 Days of Election Improvements,” or “Votemas,” a social media campaign nodding to “12 Days of Christmas” traditions, highlighting new voting technologies, procedures and laws in Utah elections. 
“While election-related posts tend to flood social media in the weeks leading up to Election Day, after the dust settles, it’s easy for people to forget that election work continues year-round. Voter records need constant upkeep, and preparation for future elections never stops,” the office wrote in its award entry. “Our goal with Votemas is to remind voters that the work doesn’t end with Election Day — every year is an election year.”

(Photo by Austin Fisher / Source NM)Christina Gill says life continues after losing someone to gun violence, but the pain remains and her experience of joy is different.
Gill lost her 39-year-old son Joseph Aieloo on Oct. 4, 2021, after Jay Wagers, 29, shot him in the Santa Fe neighborhood where Aieloo grew up.
Gill, a member of Moms Demand Action, said she still lives in that same neighborhood, because her son was such a dynamic person “there’s no place I can go in Santa Fe that I’m not reminded of his presence.”
Gill spoke on Wednesday morning at an event organized by New Mexico Democrat U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich’s office outside of Robert F. Kennedy Charter School’s middle school campus just outside the Albuquerque city limits, near the South Valley. They were joined by students from the middle school, from the advocacy organization Students Demand Action, and from ACE Leadership High School.
A week earlier, Heinrich re-introduced two pieces of legislation in Congress intended to address gun violence: the GOSAFE Act, which would regulate the sale, transfer and manufacture of gas-operated semi-automatic firearms; and the BUMP Act, which would ban the sale of “bump stocks” and other devices or modifications that convert semi-automatic firearms into fully automatic ones.
“It is not only our right but our duty to advocate for gun safety laws,” Gill said. “I ask you to stand with me today in urging our legislators to pass GOSAFE, to protect our communities and children from the tragedy of gun violence, to protect not just the rights of those who champion the Second Amendment, but to acknowledge their duty as elected officials to pass legislation that protects the equal rights of all of their constituents, especially children, to feel safe in our communities.”
Heinrich said Wednesday that the previous assault weapons ban, which expired in 2004, prohibited things that were “purely cosmetic,” while the true deadliness of some firearms comes from the mechanisms they use to quickly load a new round after firing the first one.
“It won’t change things overnight but it would move us on a trajectory where there would be far fewer of these weapons of war on the streets over time,” he said.
Gill said Heinrich’s legislation targets particular and especially lethal gas-operated semi-automatic firearms, leaving numerous options for people to buy other kinds of guns to hunt, compete or protect their families
The legislation would require that if a firearm is gas-operated — meaning it uses the gas expended by the first fired round to quickly cycle the firing mechanism and load the next one — it must have a magazine that is not detachable and only holds 10 rounds, Heinrich said.
“We know time and time again that the moment that these mass shootings actually come to an end is when the shooter has to stop, take stock and get reloaded without being able to just slide another high-capacity magazine in,” Heinrich said.
Ken Jones, a hunter and firearm owner, said large magazines are not needed for target practice or self-defense.
“To solve the gun crisis in our country today, in my opinion …we need to have better access to mental health care, we need strong red flag laws and yes, we need to keep the most violent criminals off our streets and out of our communities,” Jones said.
Monicia Henley, senior vice president of corporate affairs with Everytown for Gun Safety, said Heinrich’s bill will prevent more mass shootings, and she called on his colleagues in Congress along with New Mexico state lawmakers to join him.
“This isn’t about taking away our rights, it’s about saving lives,” Henley said. “We need to make a special session happen in Santa Fe, and focus on preventative measures that will save lives.”
Miranda Viscoli, co-president of New Mexicans to Prevent Gun Violence, said Heinrich’s legislation represents “the first critical steps to remove weapons of war from our civilian population, weapons that never should have been available to any of us in the first place.”

‘My life would be different’
Gill on Wednesday talked about the other people who were hurt in the shooting that killed her son, and the people left to live with his absence.
She said he volunteered for tenant advocacy group Chainbreaker Collective, she said.
“He helped people get off the street,” she said. “He really cared about people who are marginalized. So I am much more empathetic and compassionate as a result of this loss in understanding why he cared so much for people who struggled.”
Gill said Wagers “went on a rampage,” shooting another random victim through the eye who survived with permanent brain damage, injuring another with shattered glass and traumatizing two more people by barely missing them with bullets.
Wagers ultimately pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in Aieloo’s shooting death, and also pleaded guilty to attempted first-degree murder; two counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon; and shooting from a vehicle in the same incident. A state district court judge sentenced him to 30 years in prison.
Gill read from 15-year-old Landon Garcia’s victim impact statement in the case.
“Joey was, and still is, a very important person in my life,” Garcia wrote. “The night I found out he died, I bawled my eyes out. I cried and cried. He was one of my role models and my friend. If this man would not have murdered him, my life would be different.”
Gill told reporters that it’s her duty to do anything that might prevent a similar tragedy from affecting anyone else.
“I stand here for my son, all the Landons and community members, families and friends whose lives would be different if not for the devastation of gun violence,” Gill said. “We’re always going to have conflict, but it doesn’t mean we have to have violence.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/20250418_141509-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-18 17:08:00.694955

It has been edited for length and clarity. You can also listen to a version of this interview on our new podcast The […],"University of Louisiana System President Rick Gallot speaks at the Baton Rouge Press Club (Piper Hutchinson/Louisiana Illuminator) This is an interview with University of Louisiana System President Rick Gallot that took place earlier this month about how the legislative session and federal changes will impact higher education in Louisiana. It has been edited for length and clarity.
You can also listen to a version of this interview on our new podcast The Light Switch.
Piper Hutchinson: What do you think is coming for higher education this session? 
Rick Gallot: I think certainly starting with a standstill budget is always better than starting with a proposed cut. So, you know, we’re certainly very grateful for that. I think there’s a lot of uncertainty, coming out of Washington and with the constitutional amendments that did not pass, obviously that has created some angst in terms of what do we do now, right? And so I think there is, again, just an overall level of uncertainty that we’ll see it … kind of play out over time. 
I think if you look at the increased revenue from the sales, sales taxes and other things, we’re certainly not in a real bad spot right now as a state in terms of our finances. So I’m still optimistic that we will work through the challenges in the session, and we will come out good on the other side. 
Hutchinson: Looking at the bills that we have so far, what do you think is going to be the most impactful for higher education?
Gallot: It’s hard to say, and when you look at what’s filed versus what ultimately makes it through the process; all bills filed on the front end don’t always make it. Rep. (Emily) Chenevert has come back with another diversity, equity and inclusion bill. We will certainly have to see how that plays out. The bill she had last year started one way and ended up another. … Certainly with all other higher ed leaders, she was very receptive to meeting with us and working through some of those challenges last year. At the end of the day, I think the budget is always going to be the main focus that could impact the trajectory going forward.
Hutchinson: There’s one bill that’s going to have a big impact for your system, talking about transferring UNO back to the LSU System. What should we expect on that front? 
Gallot: For me personally, it’s a full-circle moment. I was in the house when UNO was transferred from LSU to the University of Louisiana System. You know, I just want what’s best for the students, for the campus community at the University of New Orleans. It is a legislative prerogative. They have the authority to transfer universities from one system to the other. So if this legislation is successful, we will certainly do our part to ensure that it is a seamless transition. We will work with LSU, with Board of Regents and with the legislature to ensure that the transition is as smooth as it could possibly be. 
Hutchinson: What’s that like for you [as a former legislator] during the legislative session, being kind of outside the rails?
Gallot: Well, I certainly have a lot of respect for our legislators and the sacrifices they all make in serving. I’m a huge fan of Stephen Covey’s “Seven Habits,” and one of those is: “Seek, first to understand then to be understood.” And so I think that’s helpful to understand the pressures that our legislators are under, knowing that there’s a lot that they have to balance. I think it’s helpful, quite frankly. And I don’t think I burned any bridges while here. 
I mean, I did oversee redistricting, so maybe I did [burn] one or two. But for the most part, I still have good relationships with many of my former colleagues … who are still there. I’m grateful to have the opportunity to be a part of the process but from this side. 
Hutchinson: There has been a little bit of controversy in the LSU System lately, that’s reignited these conversations about curbing tenure. What are you hearing on that front, and what would that mean for higher education as a whole if they did take an axe to tenure? 
Gallot: Going back to COVID, and you think about faculty members, who go through the process of, not only a bachelor’s and a master’s and a terminal degree. You know, they get hired, they’re on a tenure track, they’re researching, they’re writing, they’re building their portfolio, and at the appropriate time they apply for tenure. I think we have to respect that process. 
I think it is one that is deeply rooted in higher education, and so I think we certainly have to respect faculty and that they have earned this. 
Now, having said that, it’s always one or two bad apples that will spoil the barrel, as they say. I don’t know that simply doing away with tenure is the answer. 
If the legislature passes something, then we, as a state system, will certainly abide by whatever changes may be made. I think we want accountability at all levels, that we want our students to be in the best position to learn. We want our faculty to be in the best position to teach, and that our students would graduate and go out and make a difference in society. So we’ll certainly be watching it closely, and hopefully we will see thoughtful debate throughout the process. And again, with whatever the ultimate result is, we will work with it.
Hutchinson: I can’t not talk about what’s going on at the federal level. We’re talking about cutting research funding. There are concerns about immigration and graduate students, and certainly tariffs could increase expenses for higher education. How is the UL System adapting to all of this? 
Gallot: Right now there’s so much uncertainty just across the board. Whether it’s the potential loss of research funding and indirect cost, for instance, universities build their budgets based upon what they believe the revenue stream will be from these research grants. I’m hopeful that we will sort of get through this period of uncertainty, and we will see things sort of settle down to be a little more predictable. But you know, at the same time, we will have to adjust if the rules are changed. If the funding formulas are changed, we will just have to adapt. We always have and we always will.

(Courtesy NPS)More than 85,000 out-of-state hunters descend on the Treasure State each year for the chance to take a shot at a Montana elk, antelope, bear or bird.
To pay for that opportunity, they fork over $15 as a base license fee, in addition to buying a tag — ranging from $5.50 for a college student migratory bird license to $1,250 for a moose or bighorn sheep. 
But the Montana Legislature has approved a bill that will increase the base license fee for nonresidents to $100 — a 566% increase. 
The change is expected to bring in an additional $7.2 million in revenue according to the bill’s fiscal note, of which $6.8 million will be allocated to the state’s block management program. 
“The idea of identifying these dollars to go to block management is a concerted effort to try to open up more lands for the public in Montana,” sponsor and Rep. Gary Parry, R-Colstrip, told the House Fish Wildlife and Parks Committee earlier this session. 
The state’s block management program was developed 40 years ago as a way to increase access to private land and isolated parcels of public land through voluntary contracts with private landowners. It provides financial incentives for landowners to allow hunters on their property. 
Between 2001 and 2011, land owners enrolled more than 8 million acres in the program, earning up to $12,000 from enrollment fees and compensation based on hunter-day counts. Since 2011, the number of acres enrolled has steadily declined, despite efforts by the state to bolster the program by increasing the compensation cap for landowners to $25,000 in 2021 and $50,000 in 2023. 
In 2024, 1,314 landowners enrolled fewer than 7 million acres costing Montana FWP more than $12 million. 
Boosting payments could be a way for the department to offer more incentives for landowners to participate in the program, according to Quentin Kujala, FWP chief of conservation policy. 
Kujala told lawmakers at a House committee hearing that the staff who work on block management say the biggest reason for loss of access in the program is land sales, and while there are many motivations for selling land, money is certainly a factor. 
Opposition to Parry’s bill came from the Montana Outfitters and Guides Association, where one lobbyist, Scott Boulanger, said the increase was “drastic.” Representatives of the outfitters association told lawmakers that they would support a more modest increase to $50.
But Frank Szollosi, with the Montana Wildlife Federation, told Senate lawmakers that surrounding states already charge much higher rates for nonresident hunters.
In Idaho, nonresident hunting licenses cost $185; in Utah they cost $144, and in Oregon, $160. 
“We’ve got better hunting than they do,” Szollosi said. 
Wyoming is similar to Montana, charging nonresident hunters a base application fee of $15, and a bill introduced to the legislature earlier this year seeking to increase that to $75 did not advance. 
Parry said that $100 fee is “lint in the pocket” for many out-of-state hunters, who come specifically for the state’s big game and often are hiring outfitters and guides, as well as spending money on their travels to the state to begin with. 
“These folks do come here to hunt in our places. If it’s too much, they can stay in their own states. We need to look out for the people of Montana, and this bill pushes that forward.”
The bill is headed to Gov. Greg Gianforte’s desk.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/51326841831_adf49d4ff0_k-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-18 17:08:00.694955

The news was first reported by The Providence Journal, and confirmed to Rhode Island Current Friday afternoon by Greg Paré, a spokesperson for Ruggerio.
Paré was unable to confirm what date Ruggerio was readmitted to Our Lady of Fatima Hospital, but said it was due to a reaction to a treatment he was undergoing for his cancer diagnosis.
“They’re working to help him regain his health,” Paré said.
Senate President Ruggerio takes more time off to focus on ‘rebuilding his strength’

The news comes five weeks after Ruggerio, 76, was last released from the same hospital’s rehabilitation center after a bout with pneumonia. The North Providence Democrat has been absent for a majority of the 2025 sessions, attending just four of the 17 regularly scheduled Senate gatherings since January. He last presided over the chamber’s regular session on March 25. Ruggerio declined recent interview requests about his health, though Pare said he was doing better, with plans to focus on “rebuilding his strength” ahead of the final stretch of the session.
An email sent from Ruggerio’s Senate email address to lawmakers at 1:39 p.m. Friday, and obtained by Rhode Island Current, stressed the need for the chamber to address the primary care doctor shortage, noting recent actions by insurance companies and Gov. Dan McKee. The email is signed “Donny, Val and David,” referring to Ruggerio, Sen. Majority Leader Val Lawson and Senate Majority Whip David Tikoian. 
Less than 90 minutes later, Paré sent another email to senators letting them know Ruggerio was back in the hospital ahead of the news being publicly reported.
Ruggerio originally planned to return to the chamber following its April recess this week. Paré was unsure when asked Friday whether that was still the plan, given his hospitalization. 
Additional information regarding his condition from Fatima hospital was not immediately available.

(Photo by Ruth Conniff/Wisconsin Examiner)The Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction rejected the Trump administration’s request to certify compliance with a ban on diversity, equity and inclusion in K-12 public schools. 
State Superintendent Jill Underly said in a statement that Wisconsin schools are following the law. 
“We’ve put that into writing to the USDE,” Underly said. “We believe in local control in Wisconsin and trusting our local leaders – superintendents, principals, educators – who work together with parents and families every day to support students. They know their communities best. Washington, D.C. should not dictate how schools educate their kids.” 
The U.S. Department of Education sent a letter earlier this month to state agencies across the country requesting that agencies check with local school districts to ensure they don’t have diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs. 
The federal administration is trying to apply the U.S. Supreme Court’s Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard decision, which said race-based programs in higher education violate the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment, to K-12 education. The administration said state agencies needed to ensure compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act and the Supreme Court decision. 
Wisconsin is one of several states, mostly led by Democrats, that have pushed back on the request. The Trump administration, which has been targeting diversity efforts in K-12 schools as well as in higher education and other sectors, has threatened that it could pull funding from states that don’t comply with the request.
Wisconsin schools receive $841.9 million from the federal government, making up about 8% of the total funding for schools across the state. Funding from the Department of Education makes up $568.2 million of that, and according to DPI, this is equivalent to 6,106 educator jobs. 
According to the letter, DPI provided the Department of Education with copies of previous certifications of compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 and the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act.
The agency said that its repeated requests for additional information about the new certification request went unanswered. In an April 9 letter, DPI asked for clarification on why the federal government was requesting another certification and asked the Department of Education to answer questions including whether the requested certification seeks to enforce any requirement beyond what is required by federal law and regulation and what legal authority the Education Department is using to make the request a condition of federal aid. 
“If the certified assurances are insufficient to meet the conditions of federal funding imposed by USDE, please articulate the basis in law for imposing these conditions, as well as an explanation as to why these assurances do not fulfill those requirements,” DPI General Counsel Benjamin Jones wrote to the Department of Education.
Underly said the new certification is a way for the federal government to “directly control the decisions in our schools by conditioning federal dollars. This is a serious concern – not just for the DPI, but for anyone who believes in lawful, transparent government.”

Goodwine reflected on her life of overcoming obstacles when speaking Friday, and promised to carry “the importance of faith and education and perseverance” with her in the future.

“I always say I don’t give up on my dreams when life gets hard, I simply work harder to make my dreams come true,” she said. “If there is one philosophy and action I would like to be known for and for you all to recognize and live by as well, that is it. No matter what life brings your way, keep dreaming, keep working for your goals.” 
Goodwine spent time in foster care as an infant and was later adopted by her foster parents, the Lantern previously reported. The Youngstown, Ohio, native and high school valedictorian gave up a college scholarship to support her adoptive father who was dying of lung cancer. About six months after her father was diagnosed, he died. After his death, his brother killed her mother. 
At 24, she was diagnosed with Crohn’s disease, an incurable bowel inflammation condition that can be painful and disruptive to life. After that diagnosis, she spent two  months hospitalized and had to re-learn how to eat and walk. 
She began working in the courts  as a legal secretary and court stenographer. She earned undergraduate and law degrees from the University of Kentucky and in 1994 entered private practice with the firm Wyatt, Tarrant & Combs until her appointment to the district court bench in 1999. Goodwine won her circuit judge seat in 2003. She became the first Black woman to serve on the Kentucky Court of Appeals after being elected in 2018.
“I have often been called a trailblazer,” Goodwine said. “More important than achieving any individual accomplishment, I have always believed that it is each of our responsibility to live and serve in ways that make the world a better place for generations that follow us.”

Praise for Goodwine 
During her investiture, Goodwine’s fellow justices praised her for her tenacious character and long career of firsts. They also applauded her for making history yet again in officially donning her Supreme Court robes and inspiring broader trust in the court
Justice Angela McCormick Bisig said race and gender aren’t usually part of the discussions justices have about cases on their docket.

But, she said, “for this court to do that very important work, it is best to have all lived experiences and points of view at the table, because we can all strive to be compassionate and understanding, but we really can’t know what it’s like to be someone else.” 
Gov. Andy Beshear said Goodwine’s win is a “cause for celebration” but “it’s also a reminder of our reality, that nearly 250 years into the history of this great country, we are still recognizing firsts.” 
“Because of Justice Goodwine’s tenacity, pushing through personal tragedy, struggle and, yes, discrimination that still exists in our world, we are closer to the promise of our country that every child no matter their circumstances can dream of being a Kentucky Supreme Court justice,” Beshear said. “I’d like to thank her for making us a little bit better here in the commonwealth today.” 
Chief Justice Debra Lambert called Goodwine’s presence a “gift to our court” and “a reminder that the court should be principled and deliberate and deeply human.” 
While judicial races are nonpartisan, both Goodwine and her opponent received partisan support. Democrat Beshear’s political committees contributed $510,000 to help Goodwine win. Her donors also included former Democratic Govs. Steve Beshear and Paul Patton, as well as some Democrats in the legislature.
Goodwine won her race for the 5th District seat in November, becoming the first woman and fifth person in history to serve at every level of the judiciary. The Kentucky Supreme Court also has a majority of women now, for the first time ever. Goodwine’s investiture was originally scheduled for January but was delayed because of weather. 
During the ceremony, Fayette County District Judge Melissa Moore Murphy led the crowd in singing “Lift Every Voice and Sing,” the Black National Anthem.

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)Jaimie Bartmann planned to quit her job in education.
She loved being a paraprofessional in the Montrose School District in southeastern South Dakota, but after nine years assisting teachers and students, she wanted to make a bigger impact.
“I felt limited,” Bartmann said. “A family trusts you with their child — whether you’re a paraprofessional or a teacher. But as a ‘para,’ you only assist them. I couldn’t make suggestions or make changes I thought would help them.”
A day after she made up her mind, but before she submitted her resignation, her district emailed her with an opportunity: the South Dakota Teacher Apprenticeship Pathway.
The 3-year-old state program allows full-time paraprofessionals to pursue a teaching degree online through Dakota State University in elementary or special education, or through Northern State University in secondary education at a steep discount while retaining their position.
The program’s mission is filling teaching vacancies in school districts across the state, which have worsened in recent years. More than 350 positions were unfilled in July 2024, weeks before the school year started, according to the Associated School Boards of South Dakota. There were 256 the same time in 2023, 225 in 2022 and 174 in 2021.










The solution was to identify a group of people who otherwise wouldn’t get into the profession who belong in it.


– South Dakota Department of Education Secretary Joe Graves


South Dakota Department of Education Secretary Joe Graves is optimistic that the apprenticeship program will help.
“I’m hoping this year, because we’ve already graduated seven out of the program and believe we might be able to see another 56 to 60 graduate this spring, that would take a large whack out of the shortage,” Graves said.
All seven graduates, including Bartmann, are working in classrooms as teachers or have contracts to begin teaching in a South Dakota school district in the fall.
The program does not contractually require graduates to stay in the teaching profession or in South Dakota. The assumption is that paraprofessionals who’ve worked in the profession for years care about the children in their school, and have built their lives in the community where they work. 
“The solution was to identify a group of people who otherwise wouldn’t get into the profession who belong in it,” Graves said.

The state Department of Education accepted Bartmann in its first cohort of 90 participants in 2023. Another 70 enrolled in the 2024 cohort. Up to 50 more will enroll in the next cohort this year.
Bartmann moved from the Montrose School District to the nearby Canistota School District in the fall to teach special education for fifth through seventh graders. She taught her students under an advanced teaching certificate before earning her degree in December.
Now she teaches 18 children. She works with two other special education teachers at the elementary and high school levels, and nine paraprofessionals.
Her background is a strength, since “paras are the heart” of special education. She knows the challenges paras face, and listens to them because she understands they see a different side of a student.
“I’m passionate about making sure that I’m fully taking care of a student emotionally and socially, while making sure I see them academically,” Bartmann said.
Graves, with the state Education Department, said the future of the program is uncertain. It was originally intended as a one-time effort, using $815,000 in federal funds and about $446,000 in state funds. 
The program launched its second cohort under the state Department of Labor and Regulation in 2024 due to demand after the Legislature appropriated $800,000 of state funds for the program. The second cohort cost another $410,000 in funding from the department and $9,000 from the federal government.

A spokeswoman for the state Department of Labor and Regulation said the third cohort will be funded with a combination of federal and state grants, though she said the exact amounts will be determined after the apprentices start their coursework. The federal funding will come from the U.S. Department of Labor’s Apprenticeship Building America grant. School districts pay $1,000 a year per employed apprentice.
If federal funding is cut, Graves said, the program would end or universities might take it over. The department lost $58,178 in funds last month intended for the program, after the federal Department of Education dissolved approved extensions of COVID relief funding. South Dakota lost more than $5 million intended for several education programs.
Graves questions whether the program should continue indefinitely, saying it could be abused to avoid a traditional, more expensive college education.
State cancels teacher trainings for new social studies standards due to federal funding cuts

Students are responsible for up to $1,000 a year in tuition, books and state assessments. Bartmann completed 81 credits of classes within 15 months, costing her a total of $1,500. Sometimes she took more than a full course load in a semester while working full time and raising one of her four children who’s still at home.
“I’d go to school, come home, stay up until 2 a.m. studying and doing homework, sleep until 6 a.m. and then go back to work,” Bartmann said. “Weekends were focused on studying to get done faster.”
Instead of discontinuing the program entirely, she wonders if it could be limited to paraprofessionals who’ve been in the field for a few years. Experienced paras would be less likely to use the pathway as an alternative to the traditional college courses, she said, and the people who would apply would be committed, yet could be financially limited and likely to have obligations — such as children — that might prevent them from pursuing a traditional degree.
Less than four months after earning her degree, Bartmann is already considering earning another degree or certification to improve her teaching. After most workdays, she walks through the school hallways, looking at the colorful student artwork on display and feeling grateful for the new life breathed into her career.
At 46, she has colleagues her age who’ve been teaching for two decades and are planning ahead for retirement.
“I have to pack all those years of experience and impact they made into the years I’ve got left,” Bartmann said. “I want to reach as many students as I can.”
 



 State efforts to address South Dakota’s teacher shortage

Aside from the Teacher Apprenticeship Pathway, the state Department of Education and school districts have made other investments to alleviate the teacher shortage in the state, according to Secretary Joe Graves. 
Paying student teachers and making them the teacher of record
South Dakota lawmakers and the governor approved $500,000 for the creation of a statewide student-teacher stipend program this session. The state Department of Education can use the money to provide grants of up to $5,000 per school district, for payment to one or more student-teachers. The program is intended to keep South Dakota school districts competitive with other states.
“Where you begin your teaching profession is often where you continue it,” Graves said.
School districts can also establish student teachers as the “teacher of record,” meaning the student is the main teacher for a classroom, developing lesson plans and instructing students. If a student teacher becomes the “teacher of record,” a district is required to pay them, Graves said. Student teachers who are paid and regarded as an official teacher of record, he added, are more likely to commit to the district after they graduate, Graves said.
Employing international teachers
School districts across the state are increasingly employing teachers from different countries under working visas. The state Department of Education offers an International Exchange Teacher Permit. About 50 public school districts had international teachers on staff in 2024, according to the department.
Setting a minimum teacher salary and mandating annual increased compensation
The department was a major player in passing legislation in 2024 requiring school districts to meet a minimum teacher salary and increase teacher compensation yearly based on increased funding in state aid.
“We saw immediately that a bunch of school districts moved their minimum teacher salary up, even though the requirement is not going into effect until next year,” Graves said.
Mentoring new teachers
The state department’s mentoring program connects a veteran educator to a new teacher to help guide them through challenges in their first few years of the profession. The first five years is “really the test,” Graves said. When new teachers are mentored, there’s a 15% increased chance they’ll stay within the profession.
Supporting a high school teaching career interest
Educators Rising is a career interest group working to entice high school students to become South Dakota educators. The group holds a “sign up day” similar to athletes for high school members dedicated to earning their teaching degree. The South Dakota Board of Regents approved a program last year to give high school students a jump-start toward their teaching degree by taking career-specific dual credit courses that will count toward a college degree and high school graduation.
Streamlining state reciprocity
Graves said the department has worked to streamline the teacher certification reciprocity process, getting out-of-state teachers employed at local school districts more quickly.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/591A9467-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-18 16:07:21.155793

(Photo provided by Wells County Emergency Management)The North Dakota Senate this week added funding to a budget bill to help communities that lost federal grants for infrastructure projects.
Sen. Jeff Magrum, R-Hazelton, who introduced an amendment to House Bill 1577 on the Senate floor Thursday, said he’s noticed some “hiccups” involving federal fund distribution.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency canceled about $20 million in grants designated for North Dakota projects. The pulled federal grants announced earlier this month were from FEMA’s Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program, designed to help state and local governments with projects that reduce risks to hazards.
Loss of $20 million in FEMA infrastructure grants ‘devastating’ to North Dakota communities

“They had gotten these grants and they were ready to build their projects and the money was pulled out from under them,” Magrum said.
The amended bill authorizes the state-owned Bank of North Dakota to issue up to $9.7 million in loans through the Department of Environmental Quality for wastewater projects affected by the funding cuts. Two wastewater projects that lost funding are a $7.8 million wastewater treatment project in Lincoln and a $1.9 million wastewater lagoon erosion project in Fessenden.
The bill directs the Department of Environmental Quality to seek state funding in 2027 to repay the loans. If federal funds are restored to the projects, the bill requires those funds to be used to pay back the loans.
The bill does not address the other FEMA grants that were cut, which included $7.1 million for a water intake project in Washburn. Lawmakers plan to add funding for the Washburn project in another bill, said Sen. Brad Bekkedahl, R-Williston, chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee.
Sen. Tim Mathern, D-Fargo, told lawmakers that backfilling the projects with state-backed loans is a major decision to help those communities. He pointed out that the state Department of Health and Human Services also lost federal funding that has not yet been replaced by the state.
“Get prepared for a special session because there will be a load of these,” Mathern said.
The bill also includes the option for the interim Legislative Management Committee to conduct a study on the potential creation of a wastewater project fund for the state. The study would be presented during the 2027 legislative session and include input from cities, counties, townships and water resource districts. The bill returns to the House.

Tony Evers after signing the 2023-25 budget bill with 51 partial vetoes on July 5, 2023. (Baylor Spears | Wisconsin Examiner)A split Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled Friday that Gov. Tony Evers’ partial veto in the last state budget extending school funding increases for an additional 400 years was within his constitutional powers. 
The executive partial veto powers granted in the Wisconsin State Constitution are uniquely expansive, though they have been limited in the past through Supreme Court decisions and constitutional amendments passed by the Legislature and approved by voters.
In the 2023-25 state budget bill, Evers used his partial veto power striking two digits and a dash from the years to extend the annual increases through 2425, saying the action would help provide ongoing financial support to schools. The initial bill had included a $325 increase to schools’ revenue limits for the 2023-24 and 2024-25 school years.
Justice Jill Karofsky wrote in a majority opinion that the partial veto was within the power given to Evers in the state constitution, which says “appropriation bills may be approved in whole or in part by the governor.”
“We uphold the 2023 partial vetoes, and in doing so we are acutely aware that a 400-year modification is both significant and attention-grabbing,” Karofsky wrote. “However, our constitution does not limit the governor’s partial veto power based on how much or how little the partial vetoes change policy, even when that change is considerable.”
The case challenging the partial veto was brought by Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce on behalf of two Wisconsin taxpayers, Jeffery A. LeMieux, a retired professor, and David T. DeValk, a Fox Valley substitute teacher — arguing that the action was unconstitutional and undemocratic. 
WMC Executive Vice President of Government Relations Scott Manley said they were disappointed by the ruling, and that Evers “exceeded his authority at the expense of taxpayers, and now our great-great-great-great-grandchildren will still be paying the price for his reckless disregard for the law.”
Karofsky laid out several options that lawmakers could take if they want to address the issue further, including by addressing it in a future budget — such as the 2025-27 budget that is being worked on now, by passing a constitutional amendment or by drafting bills separate from appropriation bills to avoid the governor’s partial veto or trying to anticipate how the power might be used. 
Lawmakers have introduced a couple of proposed constitutional amendments. One, which passed last session, would bar the governor from using the veto power to create or increase any tax or fee. Another introduced in January would replace current language that says a partial veto may “not create a new word by rejecting individual letters in the words of the enrolled bill, and may not create a new sentence by combining parts of 2 or more sentences” to say the governor may “only reject one or more entire bill sections.” 
Those proposals have to pass in two consecutive sessions of the Legislature before they could go to voters for ratification. 
Karofsky wrote that the Court “takes no position regarding these measures. We merely outline them to illustrate legislative alternatives to the action before us.”
The three conservative justices on the Court slammed the majority opinion, saying that by upholding the veto the Court has given the executive the power to make law separately from legislators.
“How does a bill become a law?” Justice Brian Hagedorn wrote in the dissenting opinion. “According to the majority, one option looks like this: The legislature passes a bill in both houses and sends it to the governor. The governor then takes the collection of letters, numbers, and punctuation marks he receives from the legislature, crosses out whatever he pleases, and — presto! — out comes a new law never considered or passed by the legislature at all. And there you have it — a governor who can propose and enact law all on his own.” 
Hagedorn wrote that the majority’s opinion makes “a mockery of our constitutional order. This is a mess of this court’s making, and it is long past time for us to fix it.” 
In an opinion concurring with the majority, Justice Rebecca Dallet said the precedent set forth in other cases before the court have “emphasized that a partial veto may affirmatively change the policy of the original bill.” Dallet said that she is “open to revisiting” that, but “this case is not a ‘clear opportunity’ to do so.”
“Petitioners do not ask us to overturn any of our prior decisions, let alone reimagine completely our approach,” Dallet wrote. 
Republican leaders and Evers react to decision, upcoming budget
Republican leaders were critical of the decision, saying that the Court had granted the governor unchecked power and that the decision would lead to tax increases for Wisconsinites.
Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R-Rochester) said that the decision was evidence of the Court being partisan and “should worry every Wisconsinite.” 
“Is any Wisconsin citizen surprised that the liberals on the Wisconsin Supreme Court are now a rubber stamp for liberal ally Tony Evers?” Vos asked. “The liberal Justices’ decision itself describes the effects of this decision as ‘significant and attention-grabbing.’ Modest words for a tortured reading of our Constitution that will hurt Wisconsin taxpayers for hundreds of years to come, all in the name of supporting their ally in the Governor’s office.”
Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu (R-Oostburg) said that the Court “proved again that they will rule based on partisanship and politics rather than the rule of law” and that the veto was “an unprecedented overreach that will impact generations of Wisconsin taxpayers.”
Senate President Mary Felzkowski (R-Tomahawk) said that the state cannot afford to provide money for the increases, calling it “wildly unrealistic” and “fiscally unsustainable,” and that increases would be felt by property taxpayers. 
The partial veto applied to increases to schools’ revenue limits, meaning that school districts will have more leeway to bring in funds through property taxes or state funds. The partial veto did not allocate additional state dollars for the increases, though lawmakers could decide to provide state funds for the increases. The partial veto also did not automatically mean school districts would raise taxes, though they would have the option.
Wisconsin has limited school districts’ ability to raise funds through property taxes since 1993. Schools originally received regular adjustments to their limits on an inflationary basis, but that was eliminated in 2009 and since then increases have relied on lawmakers or school districts going to taxpayers for permission to increase taxes.
“It doesn’t matter if it’s via property taxes or income taxes, this money is going to come out of the pockets of Wisconsinites from Tomahawk to Racine,” Felzkowski said. She called on Evers to “come to the table to find a solution to this problem that he created, otherwise average Wisconsinites will be forced to take on the financial burden that he has put on them.” 
Evers said in a statement that schools deserve “sustainable, dependable, and spendable state support and investment” and said the decision was great news.  
“For over a decade, the Legislature has failed to meet that important obligation. Importantly, this decision does not mean our work is done — far from it,” Evers said. “Today’s decision only further underscores the urgent need for Republican lawmakers to approve the K-12 investments I’ve proposed to ensure our kids and our schools have the resources they need now and into the future.”
Evers has called for an additional $3 billion in investments for the state’s K-12 schools, funded with the state’s $4 billion budget surplus. Lawmakers have said the decision would be influential in the shape of education funding in the 2025-27 state budget. 
Department of Public Instruction Superintendent Jill Underly echoed Evers’ sentiment, calling the decision a win.
“The broader need remains: real, usable investments in our schools. That means fair special education reimbursement, meeting the mental health needs of our kids, stronger support for our educators, and access to nutritious school meals at no cost for every child,” Underly said. “These priorities must be reflected in the upcoming state budget. Without meaningful investment and an aid commitment from our Legislature, the burden continues to fall on local property taxpayers.”

(Photo by Carmen Murillo/Getty Images)I am a retired public health nurse with 27 years experience in communicable disease surveillance. I hunted down scary diseases to prevent others from getting sick. I worked with dreaded diseases such as meningitis, tuberculosis, measles, and syphilis. I witnessed the suffering and death of infectious diseases. But good things happened, too. With awe and amazement, I watched vaccination programs eliminate common diseases.
When I became a nurse in 1982, the most common form of infant meningitis was from a bacteria called Haemophilis influenza type b, or HIB. HIB disease causes severe infections, hospitalizations and death. If the baby survived, they were often left with neurological problems. Introduced in 1987, the HIB vaccine virtually eliminated this condition. Medical schools lamented that their interns would complete their entire training without ever having the chance to treat a case of HIB meningitis! 
I worked in the Texas School for the Blind, which cared for children damaged by rubella. Mexico did not have the rubella vaccine until 1985. If contracted in the first sixteen weeks of pregnancy, rubella causes severe birth defects such as profound intellectual impairment, blindness and deafness. The kids I saw in Texas had microcephaly, or abnormally small heads. It marked me forever to sit in a room full of disabled children knowing it was only lack of political will which sealed their fate.
The public health laws are effective! School vaccination requirements have given us a society where we are not afraid of dying from a plague. Polio has become a distant memory in our grandparents lives. Congenital rubella is very rare. Measles was eradicated from the US in the year 2000.
But this can break down if we are not vigilant. Measles is burning through the country. We have handicapped ourselves by firing the people who respond to public health emergencies. We need epidemiologists and nurses on the ground coordinating efforts.
Success of public health victories means that people have forgotten the horrors of disease. No one has seen the lockjaw of tetanus, or infants choking from pertussis, or malformed skulls of congenital rubella. Our very success has opened the door to complacency. Parents are misled by conspiracy theorists. Pockets of susceptible populations combined with malpractice of cutting our essential public health programs puts our country in a precarious position. It is just a matter of time before measles comes to your day care, your school, your church.
This comes at a time when access to health care is being curtailed. Cuts to Medicaid will leave children and pregnant women uninsured. Rural hospitals will be forced to close. Clinics will be shuttered. Nursing Homes will be emptied. This administration is taking us backwards to an unkind past.
An example of what we should not do is from the state of Idaho. A new law prohibits publicly funded medical services to undocumented persons. The law forbids prenatal care, immunizations, and communicable disease testing to “illegals.” This is in direct contradiction to the guidelines of the CDC. The cruel law makes Idahoans less safe, and thereby, surrounding states such as Utah less safe.
By not immunizing everyone, you create a reservoir of susceptible people where measles can thrive. By prohibiting communicable disease testing, you hamstring public health investigators who seek out deadly diseases like tuberculosis. I was a TB nurse for eight years. We treated people who had been contagious for months before diagnosis. A single case of TB can infect hundreds of others. By refusing prenatal care, women can die from gestational diabetes or eclampsia, a dangerous complication of pregnancy. Idaho will have blood on its hands.
We need a coherent, comprehensive public health policy. The drastic cuts to the CDC, NIH, and the safety net programs will adversely affect us all. U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has turned his back on expert advice of the public health pioneers who have wrought health victories that were unimaginable to our grandparents. We must demand that our legislators carry out their responsibility to provide essential services to their constituents.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/hands.jpeg,,,2025-04-18 16:07:21.155793

The child’s vaccination status “has not yet been verified,” according to the press release.
The child, who is not a Missouri resident, was visiting Taney County and was diagnosed “soon after arrival,” Lisa Cox, spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, said in a press release. 
Taney County is in southwest Missouri, and its largest city is Branson. 
“Exposure is believed to be limited, and known contacts have been identified and contacted,” Cox said, adding that the state is supporting Taney County’s health department to investigate possible exposure. 
The case is “associated with recent international travel,” Cox said.
Measles is a highly-contagious virus the country declared eliminated 25 years ago, but that has resurged with falling vaccination rates. 
“For those unvaccinated or those unsure of their vaccination status, now is the time to review records and get caught up if needed,” Dr. George Turabelidze, state epidemiologist with DHSS, said in the press release.
The percent of Missouri kindergarteners fully vaccinated against measles, mumps and rubella has declined over the last several years, from 95% in the 2019-2020 school year to 91% in the 2023-2024 school year, in public schools, per DHHS data. In private schools, the drop has been even larger, from 92% to 85% in the same period.
Nationally, there are at least 800 reported cases of measles across 25 states, according to Center for Disease Control data as of Friday. That doesn’t include Missouri’s case, Cox said, because the state received lab test results Thursday night, after the federal reporting deadline for this week. 
That is the highest number for a single year since 2019 and is still growing.
The majority of measles infections nationally have been reported in a West Texas outbreak. There have been two confirmed deaths, both in Texas. 
Kansas has reported 37 cases, possibly linked to the Texas outbreak.
There are outbreaks in Canada and Mexico, too, and several states have reported isolated cases as the result of international travel.
At the same time, the federal government has cut grant funding set aside for the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services to encourage vaccinations, according to St. Louis Public Radio.

(Photo by Jackie Llanos/Florida Phoenix)A federal judge brought up the arrest in Leon County of Juan Carlos Lopez-Gomez, a U.S. citizen born in Georgia, during a hearing Friday in which she extended her block of the new Florida immigration law until April 29.
U.S. District Court Judge Kathleen Williams expressed frustration about the arrests of Lopez-Gomez and others, said an attorney representing the immigrants and groups suing the state.
At issue is Williams’ April 4 order temporarily barring enforcement of a law passed during a special session earlier this year making it a first-degree misdemeanor to illegally enter the state as an “unauthorized alien.”
A Florida Highway Patrol trooper’s arrest of Lopez-Gomez on Wednesday prompted national attention following Florida Phoenix’s reports that he was set to remain in jail because U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement had placed a 48-hour hold on him — even after a Leon County judge determined there had been no probable cause for the arrest.
Lopez-Gomez was released from Leon County jail on Thursday evening. The 20-year-old held his mother in a tight embrace and wept when they reunited.
“We appreciate that the federal courts have seen through this blatantly unconstitutional law, but the reality is that, without enforcement, it seems that local law enforcement and Florida Highway Patrol are continuing to ignore the judge and order,” said Miriam Fahsi Haskell, an attorney for Community Justice Project representing the plaintiffs, in a phone interview with the Phoenix. “The reality is that once a person is arrested under SB 4C and booked into jail, that person risks then having an ICE hold on them.”
Community Justice Project, the ACLU of Florida, Americans for Immigrant Justice, and Florida Legal Services attorneys are representing the plaintiffs: the Florida Immigrant Coalition, Farmworker Association of Florida Inc., and two women without permanent legal status.
David Matthew Costello, lead attorney representing Attorney General James Uthmeier, declined to comment, and a spokesperson for the attorney general’s office did not respond to the Phoenix’s questions. The other defendants are the statewide prosecutor and state attorneys.
Binding?
During the hearing at the U.S. District Court of the Southern District of Florida in Miami, attorneys representing the state argued that law enforcement is not bound by Williams’ order, Fahsi Haskell said. Another hearing is set for April 29.
“The Court enters a [temporary restraining order] prohibiting Defendants and their officers, agents, employees, attorneys, and any person who are in active concert or participation with them from enforcing SB 4-C,” Williams’ order states.
Two other men were with Lopez-Gomez when the trooper stopped the car because the driver was going 78 mph in a 65 mph zone, according to the arrest report. The driver, Estiven Sales-Perez, and another passenger, Ismael Sales-Luis, were also charged with illegal entry as “unauthorized aliens.” The driver was also charged with driving without a license.
ICE has taken custody of Sales-Perez and is holding him in a Tallahassee field office, according to the online detainee locator system.
“Florida Highway Patrol will continue to work willingly with our federal partners to engage in interior enforcement of immigration law,” a spokesperson for the agency wrote in a statement to the Phoenix.
Florida Democratic Party Chair Nikki Fried called the arrest a kidnapping.
“Where does the lawlessness of this administration stop? If this can happen to an American-born citizen, it can happen to any of us,” she said in a statement.

The Nebraska Department of Labor on Friday announced March’s 2.9% preliminary, seasonally adjusted unemployment rate, noting that it tied Nebraska for the fifth-lowest unemployment rate in the country. The state’s unemployment rate, however, is up from the 2.6% reported a year ago for March 2024. 
Nebraska Labor Commissioner Katie Thurber, in a news release, said the state’s overall labor force reached a record high of over 1,080,000 in March.
“The number of employed workers in the labor force also reached a new high statewide, driven by record highs in the Omaha and Lincoln metro areas,” she said.

The number of employed and unemployed people in the labor force are based on a U.S. Census Bureau survey on employment status. Individuals who are claiming unemployment benefits and those who are not claiming the benefits can be counted as unemployed based on their survey responses.
Those not working or seeking a job are not considered part of the labor force and are not included in the unemployment rate calculation.
Labor data released Friday showed that Nebraska private industries with the most growth over last year were public education and health services and construction and mining.
Nationally, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for March inched up to 4.2%, compared to the February rate of 4.1% and 3.9% the year before in March 2024.
Nevada, with 5.7%, reported the highest unemployment rate, followed by the District of Columbia, Michigan and California.

Arkansas became the first state in the nation to prevent healthcare conglomerates from operating drugstores here when Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders signed House Bill 1150 on Wednesday.
State law already regulates what pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) pay to reimburse independent pharmacies, but pharmacists have complained that the companies violate the law. The state has also fined four PBMs a total of $1.47 million for paying Arkansas pharmacies below the legally required amount for prescription drugs.
PBMs negotiate prescription benefits among drug manufacturers, distributors, pharmacies and health insurance providers, and the biggest ones also own pharmacies and insurers. The Federal Trade Commission released an interim report in July 2024 saying these conglomerates are eliminating competition and increasing drug prices at the expense of patients.
HB 1150 headed to Sanders’ desk April 9 after clearing the Senate with a bipartisan 26 votes, six days after it passed the House with 89 votes. The bill generated hours of discussion and public comment in the House and Senate committees on Insurance and Commerce this month.
“These massive corporations are attacking our state because we will be the first in the country to hold them accountable for their anticompetitive actions,” Sanders said in a statement Wednesday.
CVS Health issued a statement last week urging Sanders to veto HB 1150, calling it “misguided policy.” The organization, which includes the CVS Caremark PBM, issued another statement Wednesday afternoon.
“CVS Health welcomes a good faith discussion with policy makers in Arkansas and across the country on ways to make medicine more affordable and accessible,” the statement said. “Unfortunately, HB1150 is bad policy that accomplishes just the opposite: it will take away access to pharmacy care in local communities, hike prescription drug spending across the state by millions of dollars each year, and cost hundreds of Arkansans their jobs.”
Arkansas has 23 CVS pharmacies that CVS and other opponents of HB 1150 said will be forced to close under the new law. Arkansas Pharmacists Association CEO John Vinson said this is not true and pharmacies can still operate if they detach from PBMs.
Sanders, Vinson and other supporters of HB 1150 have said a lack of sufficient regulation of PBMs has allowed them to monopolize the pharmaceutical industry by setting their competitors’ prices.
OptumRX, Express Scripts and CVS Caremark — the three largest PBMs — are each owned by much larger corporations that each also own a top-10 health insurer. Together they control about 80% of the U.S. prescription market, according to last year’s Federal Trade Commission report.
 
The legal landscape
 


Act 1 and Act 3 of 2018 prohibit PBMs from reimbursing their affiliated pharmacies in Arkansas at a higher rate than their competitors, locally owned independent pharmacies. PBMs routinely break these laws, said Vinson and HB 1150’s Republican sponsors, Sen. Kim Hammer of Benton and Rep. Jeremiah Moore of Clarendon.
PBMs have allegedly also violated Act 900 of 2015, which required PBMs to pay pharmacies at least as much as the national average of what drugstores pay wholesalers for drugs. Pharmacies sent the Arkansas Insurance Department (AID) thousands of complaints in 2024, claiming PBMs either illegally paid them below this national average or paid them at or just above this amount, independent pharmacists and AID’s general counsel told lawmakers last year.
This led the Arkansas Legislative Council to require PBMs to include dispensing fees in their reimbursements for prescription drugs. The panel approved the rule a day after its Administrative Rules subcommittee rejected it.
Hammer told the Senate Insurance committee April 8 that the Legislature should not be “rewarding” violators of state law “by letting them stay in business.”
“Congress is pursuing this issue. Why? Because states like Arkansas are not sitting on the sidelines and being quiet about it,” Hammer said. “[If you say], ‘Let’s sit back and wait for Congress,’ like sitting back and waiting for the Lord to come, it ain’t going to happen soon enough.”
After more than a century serving Hammer’s constituents in Benton, Smith-Caldwell Drug Store closed in August 2023 due to financial insolvency and transferred its clients to Walgreens, a national chain that isn’t part of a PBM.
Brad Lawson, a Little Rock-based healthcare supervisor for Walgreens, told lawmakers in December that unfair PBM reimbursements have forced the company to close several locations and plan further closures nationwide.
Walgreens declined to comment Thursday on HB 1150.
 Opposition

In an April 4 interview with the Advocate, CVS leaders said the Caremark PBM not only complies with Arkansas law but also reimburses independent pharmacies at a higher rate than its own chain pharmacies. They also said employers whose health insurance plans include CVS will face higher costs.
“Patients are choosing us, they have a choice, and I think we’re not allowing patients to have a choice in this bill,” Chief Pharmacy Officer Lucille Accetta said.
When asked about HB 1150’s potential financial impact on CVS, Accetta and Vice President of External Relations David Whitrap said the losses of pharmacists’ jobs and patients’ access to medication are higher priorities than money.
CVS closed 244 stores between 2018 and 2020 and 900 more stores between 2021 and 2024.
CVS District Leader of Pharmacy Operations Ashley Ellis spoke against the bill at both Insurance and Commerce committee meetings, saying she and her colleagues would lose their jobs if HB 1150 becomes law.
Ellis lives in Greenbrier, represented by Sen. Missy Irvin, R-Mountain View. Irvin was in the minority of Senate committee members to vote against HB 1150, and she said she would not vote for a constituent to lose her job.
Hammer said the potential loss of CVS employees’ jobs is “a lie.”
“If they want to argue these local [corporate] pharmacies shouldn’t be going out of business because they get paid adequately, fine,” he said. “Put your money where your mouth is. Prove it. Start paying yourselves like you’re paying these others.”
Several lawmakers said this month that they supported HB 1150 partly because they received emails urging them to vote against it that appeared to be from constituents but turned out to be from lobbyists opposing the legislation. Rep. Richard McGrew, R-Hot Springs, told the House Insurance Committee that CVS clients in his district had not consented to their names being used for this purpose.
Sen. Mark Johnson, R-Ferndale, told the equivalent Senate committee that he received similar misleading emails.
“This is not grassroots opposition to this bill,” Johnson said. “This is astroturf.”
Besides CVS Health, opponents of HB 1150 included the Arkansas Chamber of Commerce, the Navitus Health Solutions PBM, and the Omnicare and Accredo pharmacies.
Omnicare is owned by CVS Health, and Accredo is a subsidiary of Express Scripts.
 Mail order concerns

Several PBMs are affiliated with interstate mail-order pharmacy operations, and House Bill 1150 includes mail-order pharmacy permits among those that PBMs would be prohibited from holding.
Opponents of HB 1150 said it would reduce patients’ access to specialty drugs, some of which might only be accessible via mail-order services — including for military members and veterans who receive pharmaceuticals via the Tricare insurance program’s partnership with Express Scripts.
HB 1150 allows the State Board of Pharmacy to issue limited permits to PBMs if they provide “drugs that are otherwise unavailable in the market to a patient or a pharmacy that would otherwise be prohibited” under the law. Hammer told the Senate this will allow Tricare beneficiaries to continue receiving medications while PBMs transition out of Arkansas.
Despite being a veteran on Tricare, Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin’s pharmacy services have been moved from one provider to another by PBM interference, he said in January at a news conference announcing HB 1150. He also said he would defend the legislation in court if it were challenged.
On Monday, Griffin was the lead signatory of a bipartisan letter to Congress from attorneys general in 39 states and territories, advocating for the policy in HB 1150 to be enacted federally.
Griffin sued Express Scripts and OptumRX last year, alleging that they used data from drug manufacturers and distributors to maximize their financial gain instead of using it to mitigate the opioid addiction epidemic.
 
‘Winners and losers’
 


Irvin was one of nine senators, mostly Republicans, to vote against HB 1150 last week. She disputed the claim that PBMs have a monopoly in the pharmaceutical industry, saying this is only an opinion without a court’s declaration.
Senate Minority Whip Fred Love, D-Mabelvale, was the chamber’s only Democrat to vote against the bill. Love’s district does not have any local independent pharmacies, and his constituents will lose access to medications if corporate pharmacies like CVS close, he said.
“They’ve been talking to me saying, ‘Guess what? This will hurt us,’” Love said. “So we’re going to manufacture a pharmacy desert in southwest Little Rock? That’s not good for my people.”
Irvin also took issue with a statement April 8 from Greg Reybold, vice president of Healthcare Policy at the American Pharmacy Cooperative, that HB 1150 will “take the ball away” from PBMs in Arkansas’ pharmacy industry.
“We’re using the government to say, ‘We’re getting rid of your competition,’” Irvin said. “…It says that we’re denying a permit to be approved for you, but not for you. You’re picking winners and losers.”
GOP Sen. Justin Boyd, a Fort Smith pharmacist and the vice chairman of the Senate Insurance committee, argued that PBMs’ ability to set their competitors’ prices is actually “picking winners and losers.”
Another 2025 Arkansas law that supporters said will increase patients’ access to medication is Act 52, which removed the state’s ban on nonprofit hospitals holding pharmacy permits. The bill, co-sponsored by Irvin, initially failed in the Senate Public Health, Welfare and Labor Committee but later passed after being amended.
The Arkansas Pharmacists Association opposed Act 52 before it was amended. Vinson told the Senate Insurance committee that Act 52 will create new pharmacy jobs that could make up for any job loss brought about by HB 1150. Both laws will go into effect in August.

(Getty Images)LINCOLN — Opposing attorneys laid out starkly different portrayals Friday of campaign mailers sent during the 2020 election that a Nebraska legislative candidate alleged were defamatory and damaged her business, marriage and reputation.
The attorney for the candidate, Janet Palmtag of Nebraska City, told jurors during closing arguments that the Nebraska Republican Party showed a reckless disregard for the facts in sending out the fliers, which he said falsely stated that she had broken the law and lost her license to practice real estate.
The attorney, David Domina, asked jurors to award Palmtag $4.25 million for the loss of real estate listings and damage to her standing in her community and damage to her relationship with her family.

“Other than to call her names, there’s really no defense here,” Domina said.
The attorney for the Nebraska GOP portrayed the mailers as largely true and said the content had been checked against available public records. It was only later, lawyer Kamron Hasan said, that the party learned the back story about the disciplinary steps taken against Palmtag’s real estate firm by the Iowa Real Estate Commission.
He termed it “an honest mistake.”
“The First Amendment and free speech protects honest mistakes … it protects Democrats, it protects Republicans, it protects other political affiliations,” Hasan said.
The closing arguments came at the end of a weeklong trial in Lancaster County District Court over the defamation lawsuit filed by Palmtag against the Nebraska GOP.
A jury of seven men and four women (One juror didn’t return after being picked to serve.) must decide, by clear and convincing evidence, if the statements made in the campaign mailers were false, that the GOP knew they were false and published them with a reckless disregard for the truth.
Verdict as early as Friday
If the jury cannot reach a verdict by 4:30 p.m. Friday, deliberations will continue Monday, according to the trial judge, Lancaster County District Judge Andrew Jacobsen.
The case raises issues of how far political speech can go during a heated campaign and hinges on whether the political party issued the mailers recklessly or with malice, a legal term that essentially means intentionally.
Palmtag lost the 2020 race for the Nebraska Legislature in southeast Nebraska against the then-incumbent, State Sen. Julie Slama.
The race pitted two Republicans against each other, with Slama being backed by then-Gov. Pete Ricketts, who appointed Slama to her post, and the state party. Palmtag, a longtime state GOP volunteer, was supported by former Gov. Dave Heineman, then-U.S. Rep. Jeff Fortenberry, among others.
Palmtag filed her lawsuit three months after the election.
Testimony at trial indicated that Palmtag had called the then-executive director of the state GOP after the initial mailer was sent out on Oct. 8, 2020. The mailer stated that Palmtag had “broke the law” and “lost” her real estate license, which Palmtag said was a lie and needed to be corrected.

Instead, the GOP executive, Ryan Hamilton, refused and instead sent a second mailer to 3,200 households stating that Palmtag was “too irresponsible” to serve as a legislator. That piece cited a 2017 civil fine levied by the Iowa Real Estate Commission paid after one of Palmtag’s agents had failed to obtain all the required signatures for a transfer of an earnest deposit on the sale of a home.
Domina, during his closing argument, said the Nebraska GOP was “reckless” in the campaign flyer because Palmtag never “lost” her license — she voluntarily gave up her personal and the firm’s corporate licenses in 2019 due to a lack of Iowa business after flooding — and because her consent agreement with the Iowa commission admitted no violation of law.
“(The consent agreement) doesn’t end with a license revoked, suspended or lost,” he said. Palmtag and her firm were still in “good standing” for two years afterwards, when the licenses were not renewed, Domina said.
GOP says ads based on public documents
But, Hasan, the GOP attorney, told jurors that what the party sent out was “at least substantially true,” because the consent order read that Palmtag’s real estate firm, J.J. Palmtag, did not contest the “alleged violation” of Iowa law.
“It was a violation. The law was broken,” he said. “You don’t have to admit to being guilty of a crime for it to be true.”
Hasan said that when Hamilton looked up the status of J.J. Palmtag’s Iowa license in 2020, he found that it was listed as “canceled.”
“You don’t have to overthink this,” he told jurors. “Just read the words.”

But Domina said that if Hamilton had researched the Iowa commission’s website further, he would have discovered that Palmtag’s individual license had become “inactive” in 2019, and the company’s license had been listed as “canceled” because that’s how corporate licenses are listed when not renewed.
Palmtag, Domina said, only agreed to pay a $500 fine to resolve the matter, which she testified stemmed from a mistake by one of her salesmen, who was gravely ill.
Domina said Palmtag was being “responsible” for resolving the matter, calling it “preposterous” that she had been “irresponsible” as claimed by the GOP.
Hasan, meanwhile, said that as the supervising agent, it was her mistake that caused the fine.
“Janet is J.J. Palmtag and J.J. Palmtag is Janet,” he said.
The case took so long to get to trial because initially, the judge had granted a summary judgment filed by the GOP, thus dismissing the case.
Domina appealed to the Nebraska Supreme Court, which ruled in his favor that a jury, and not the judge, needed to make that decision, which led to this week’s trial.
This is a developing story.

(Photo by Illustration Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Earlier this week, health officials urged parents to consider seeking one dose of the measles, mumps, rubella vaccine for infants aged 6-11 months who live in Doña Ana County — the fourth and latest New Mexico county with cases — or who will be traveling to either Doña Ana or Lea counties, where the bulk of the state’s cases have thus far taken place. 
Normally, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  recommends infants receive the first dose at 12 to 15 months and a second dose between 4 to 6-years old. Dr. Jana Shaw, a State University of New York professor of pediatrics, notes that babies gain some antibodies from measles when the mother is vaccinated, so the recommendation is often to wait until 1 year of age for the most effective protection. 
Except when there’s an outbreak. 
“If the risk is increased, vaccinating children less than one year of age is recommended; it’s safe,” Shaw told Source. And with no antiviral therapies to treat measles, “the only preventive tool we have is vaccination,” she said. “Once your child is infected, our tools are pretty limited in terms of what we can do to treat, support and help your child to heal.”
New Mexico’s cases as of April 18 stood at 63, with no new cases reported on Friday, according to a Department of Health spokesperson. The bulk of those cases —59 — occurred in Lea County. Of the total cases, 46 afflicted non-vaccinated people; six were vaccinated; and 11 had unknown vaccination statuses. In nearby West Texas, where New Mexico’s outbreak likely began, the health department on Friday reported 597 confirmed since late January, an increase of 36 since the April 15 update.
Nationwide, according to the CDC’s most recent figures, a total of 800 confirmed measles cases have been reported by 25 jurisdictions. The 2019 series of outbreaks totaled 1,249 measles infections, and were the largest in the U.S. since the CDC declared measles eradicated in 2000. 
Shaw praised the strong responses from local health departments and vaccination strategies for bringing that outbreak under control, but expressed concern about misinformation’s impact on public health.
“It was through vaccination how we stopped [the 2019] outbreak,” Shaw said. “Unfortunately, we don’t have such a strong intervention in place now, and certainly doesn’t seem to be very coordinated. I’m concerned this will continue to spread.”
Public health authorities warned about the threats of vaccine safety misinformation even before the COVID-19 pandemic, but the concerns have accelerated since then, according to Jagdish Khubchandani, a public health professor at New Mexico State University. 
Khubchandani co-authored a 2021 paper on vaccine hesitancy during the pandemic and is currently funded by the National Science Foundation grant to further study misinformation impacts on public health. 
“It’s a complicated problem, and I think it needs urgent action at the local, regional and global levels,” he told Source. “We have seen, in the meanwhile, that the rise of misinformation and vaccine hesitancy proliferates at a faster rate than awareness campaigns for vaccination.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-462294288-1024x706.jpg,,,2025-04-18 16:07:21.155793

Credit: Getty ImagesIn 2018, the Florida Legislature reacted to the mass shooting in Parkland by passing major safety regulations. Chances for a such a response to Thursday’s shootings at Florida State University are slim.
That doesn’t mean legislators are ignoring the politics of guns.
Start with Miami Republican state Sen. Illeana Garcia, who joined with three Senate Democrats in a committee vote last month rejecting a proposal sponsored by then-GOP Sen. Randy Fine (SB 814) to allow concealed weapons on college and university campuses.
“I have zero regret,” Garcia said on X late Thursday night about that vote, in which she joined with Democratic Sens. Jason Pizzo, Mack Bernard, and Carlos Guillermo Smith in opposing the proposal. Two other Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee were absent for the vote.
“Proud to have voted against your moronic campus carry bill, that didn’t have a house companion,” Garcia said, referring to Fine. “This decision wasn’t about partisan politics; it was rooted in common sense. The incident at FSU was tragic, but the real issue lies not with the firearm itself, but with the factors that led to it. The individual involved was the child of a deputy sheriff and had knowledge of weapon handling, yet chose to act recklessly.”
Fine noted the vote in a posting on X on Friday, where he included an excerpt of his speech in the Senate Judiciary Committee on March 25.
“There is no magic force field that keeps guns from coming onto our college campuses,” he said. “Less than one month ago, in my last bill presentation as a Florida Senator, I attempted to give adults the same right to protect themselves on campus as they have off. My four-minute closing speech is below. For the first and only time in 8.5 years in the Legislature, I failed. By a vote of 3-4, with two absent, the committee voted to keep universities ‘gun-free zones.’ An offensive name given what happened yesterday. The no vote included all three Democrats plus one so-called Republican. I am incredibly grateful to the law enforcement who ran into the gunfire yesterday to subdue the gunman. But in the time that took, this murderer was able to shoot seven people, two of whom have died. Today, I wonder if one of those seven had been able to defend themselves, the outcome would have been different. In any event, I will continue praying for all.”
Following the Parkland school shooting in February of 2018, within weeks the Florida Legislature and then-Gov. Rick Scott came together to pass the Marjory Stoneman Douglas Public High School Safety Act, a comprehensive measure that included numerous provisions regarding firearms and school safety, plus community mental health resources.
There have been attempts over the past three legislative sessions to repeal a provision of that law that bans individuals under 21 years of age from purchasing rifles and shotguns, and prohibiting licensed firearm dealers, importers, and manufacturers, from selling them to people of that age. Those measures have passed the House in 2023, 2024, and this year. In the past two years, the Senate did not pass a companion measure, and a similar measure has yet to advance in the 2025 legislative session.

The statement also said the university will comply with all laws and cooperate with authorities. 
“This is a fluid situation, and the university will monitor it closely and assess its implications,” she said.
According to the Associated Press, at least 1,024 students at 160 colleges, universities and university systems have had their visas revoked or their legal status terminated since late March.

The backlash was immediate. Some states with Democratic governors refused to comply, arguing that the directive lacks legal basis, fails to clearly define what constitutes “illegal DEI practices,” and threatens vital equity-based initiatives in their schools.
After lawsuits from the National Education Association teachers union and the American Civil Liberties Union, the Department of Education agreed to delay enforcement until after April 24.
But states across the country, both liberal- and conservative-led, are worried about losing other aid: the pandemic-era money that in some cases they’ve already spent or committed to spending.
The Department of Education has long played a critical role in distributing federal funds to states for K-12 education, including Title I grants to boost staffing in schools with high percentages of low-income students, and emergency relief like that provided during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Conservative-led states — particularly Mississippi, South Dakota and Arkansas — rely the most heavily on these funds to sustain services in high-need districts.
The 15 states with the highest percentage of their K-12 budget coming from federal funding in fiscal year 2022 — the latest year with data available from the National Center for Education Statistics — voted for Trump in the 2024 presidential election. Similarly, 10 of the 15 states receiving the highest amounts of Title I funding in fiscal year 2024 also voted for Trump.
Mississippi and Kentucky have sent letters to the Department of Education expressing concern over halted pandemic aid.
The clash over federal funding comes even as the future of the Department of Education is murky, given President Donald Trump’s pledge to dismantle the department.

 DEI-related cuts

In letters to the Department of Education, state officials and superintendents in Illinois, New York and Wisconsin pushed back against the DEI directive.
New York officials said they would not provide additional certification beyond what the state already has done, asserting that there “are no federal or State laws prohibiting the principles of DEI.” Illinois Superintendent Tony Sanders wrote that he was concerned that the Department of Education was changing the conditions of federal funding without a formal administrative process. Wisconsin Superintendent Jill Underly questioned the legality of the order.
New York State Department of Education Counsel and Deputy Commissioner Daniel Morton-Bentley noted that the federal department’s current stance on DEI starkly contrasts with its position during Trump’s first term, when then-Education Secretary Betsy DeVos supported such efforts.
Colorado and California also confirmed they would not comply with the Department of Education’s order.
While some states with liberal leaders are gearing up for legal battles and possible revocation of funding, conservative-led states such as Florida have embraced the federal directive as part of a broader push to reshape public education.
In Florida, anti-DEI laws have been in place dating back to 2023. In fact, many school districts and the state education department say they plan to follow the federal department’s directives, noting the similar state laws.
 Pandemic aid cancellations

In March, the Department of Education abruptly rescinded previously approved extensions of pandemic-era aid, ending access to funds months ahead of the original March 2026 deadline.
When the Massachusetts governor’s office voiced concern over that decision, the federal department’s reply on social media was blunt: “COVID is over.”
Sixteen mostly Democratic-led states and the District of Columbia filed a federal lawsuit against the Department of Education and Secretary Linda McMahon, challenging the abrupt rescission of previously approved extensions for spending COVID-19 education relief funds.
But backlash against abrupt federal cuts to education has not been limited to blue states.
Mississippi’s Department of Education warned the cuts would jeopardize more than $137 million in already obligated funds, slated for literacy initiatives, mental health services and infrastructure repairs. “The impact of this sudden reversal is detrimental to Mississippi students,” state Superintendent Lance Evans wrote in a letter to McMahon.
The letter also outlines the state’s repeated — but unsuccessful — efforts to draw down millions in approved funds since February.
Shanderia Minor, a spokesperson for the Mississippi education department, told Stateline the agency is awaiting next steps and direction about the funds and federal directives.
In Kentucky, state Education Commissioner Robbie Fletcher told districts — which stand to lose tens of millions in pandemic aid — that abrupt federal changes leave them “in a difficult position,” with schools already having committed funds to teacher training and facility upgrades.
According to Kentucky Department of Education spokesperson Jennifer Ginn, the state has about $18 million in unspent pandemic aid funds left to distribute to districts. And districts have about $38 million in unspent funds, for a total $56 million that could be lost.
Lauren Farrow, a former Florida public school teacher, told Stateline that schools that receive Title I money are already underfunded — and the federal threat only widens the gap.
“Florida is pouring billions into education — but where is it going? Because we’re not seeing it in schools, especially not in Title I schools,” said Farrow. “I taught five minutes away from a wealthier school, and we didn’t even have pencils. Teachers were buying shoes for students. Why is that still happening?”
 Effects in the classroom

Tafshier Cosby, senior director of the Center for Organizing and Partnerships at the National Parents Union, a parents advocacy group, told Stateline that while most families don’t fully understand the various school funding systems, they feel the impact of cuts in the classroom.
Cosby said parents are worried about the loss of support services for students with disabilities, Title I impacts, and how debates about DEI may deflect from more urgent needs like literacy and teacher support.
“We’ve been clear: DEI isn’t the federal government’s role — it’s up to states,” she said. “But the confusion is real. And the impact could be devastating.”
Today, as a consultant working with teachers across Florida’s Orange County Public Schools — one of the largest districts in the country — Farrow says many educators are fearful and confused about how to support their students under changing DEI laws.
“Teachers are asking, ‘Does this mean I can’t seat a student with glasses at the front of the room anymore?’ There’s so much fear around what we’re allowed to do now.”
“There’s no one giving teachers guidance or even basic acknowledgment. We’re just left wondering what we’re allowed to say or do — and that’s dangerous.”

(Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)Arkansas formally appealed on Friday the federal government’s denial of funds to aid recovery from March 14-15 storms and tornadoes.
In a letter to President Donald Trump and FEMA Regional Administrator George Robinson, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders asked the administration to reconsider its rejection of her requests for disaster declarations for individual assistance and public assistance.
“Arkansas communities are still recovering from this spring’s tornadoes, as the sheer magnitude of this event resulted in overwhelming amounts of debris, widespread destruction to homes and businesses, the tragic loss of three lives, and injuries to many others,” Sanders said. “To relieve the burden on these counties, cities, and towns, I am appealing FEMA’s decision to deny Arkansas’ Major Disaster Declaration request.”
Sanders originally sought the major disaster declaration on April 2; FEMA issued its denial on April 11.
Sanders’ letter notes that “without the support of a Major Disaster Declaration, Arkansas will face significant challenges in assuming full responsibility and achieving an effective recovery from this event. I
have determined that the severity and magnitude of these storms exceed the capabilities of the State and affected local governments to respond adequately. As such, supplemental Federal assistance is crucial.”
The state’s request includes Baxter, Stone, Sharp, Hempstead, Independence, Randolph, Nevada, Jackson, Clay, Woodruff, Greene, Hot Spring,  Izard and Lawrence counties.
Trump earlier this year called the Federal Emergency Management Agency “a disaster” and suggested it “might go away.” He said states could take care of disaster responses on their own and convened a group to review the agency and recommended changes.

The grant terminations came after President Donald J. Trump signed an executive order to “terminate, to the maximum extent allowed by law, all DEI, DEIA, and “environmental justice” offices and positions.” 

Of the 19 grants terminated in Connecticut, 17 were designated to Yale and two to UConn.
In 2024, the Yale School of Medicine received more than $598 million in NIH funding. The cancelled grants were originally for more than $42 million combined. Slightly more than $11 million was unspent when the awards were terminated.
At the University of Connecticut, the grants totaled $1.7 million, with $1 million left unspent when they were terminated, according to the tracker maintained by Noam Ross of rOpenSci and Scott Delaney of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.
According to the NIH grants policy statement, grant payments are usually awarded as advance payments. “The intent is that recipients draw funds on an as-needed basis —specifically, no more than 3 business days before the funds are needed,” the policy states.
Most of the research cut for both schools were of research projects that dealt with mental health and LGBTQ+ issues. Words like “sex,” “transgender,” “mental health” and “minority” were among the most commonly used words in the titles of the grants.
Some of these projects supported research on AIDS prevention and HIV, alcohol use, and SARS-CoV-2 infection.
These awards support departments such as internal medicine, public health and preventive medicine, psychiatry, pediatrics, emergency medicine, social sciences and engineering.

Green International Airport. (Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)The deadline to obtain a REAL ID is less than a month away, yet more than one-third of Rhode Islanders still haven’t made the switch to the license required for air travel.
Starting May 7, 2025, travelers 18 or older nationwide must present either their U.S. passport or the REAL ID cards marked with a gold star in the top right corner to board domestic flights or enter federal buildings. International travel will still require a passport.
President George W. Bush signed a law mandating REAL IDs in 2005 in response to the security concerns raised by the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The original compliance deadline was in 2008, but has been delayed by the federal government several times. 
This time, federal officials say enforcement is really happening. About 81% of U.S. air travelers now have a REAL ID-compliant or otherwise acceptable form of identification, according to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.

But Rhode Island still lags behind, with just under 62% of credentials issued by the state Division of Motor Vehicles meeting the federal standards. The state began offering REAL ID-compliant licenses in 2018.
On Friday, DMV spokesperson Paul Grimaldi said the state was averaging 268 daily REAL ID reservations across its six offices. The DMV will issue a temporary paper ID, but it may not be accepted at Transit Security Administration (TSA) checkpoints.
Worried about potential delays at airports, U.S. Sen Jack Reed (D-R.I.) wrote to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem Thursday asking what federal officials will do to process travelers who arrive at airport security checkpoints without REAL ID.
The TSA in January said it would conduct “phased enforcement” over two years, with the ability to issue warnings to people without Real IDs to avoid operational disruption.
“TSA will implement REAL ID effectively and efficiently, continuing to ensure the safety and security of passengers while also working to minimize operational disruptions at airports, including at Rhode Island T.F. Green airport,” agency spokesperson Daniel Velez said in an emailed statement Friday.
Assistant Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to Rhode Island Current Friday that the department will “ continue to collaborate with state, local, and airport authorities to inform the public, facilitate compliance, curb wait times and prevent fraud.”
Rhode Islanders who plan to travel after May 7 are advised to schedule their DMV appointments four to six weeks before flying in order to ensure getting their REAL ID mailed in time.
REAL ID appointments are also available at local AAA branches for members. First time applicants will be required to provide one proof of identity document such as a birth certificate, proof of Social Security, and two proofs of Rhode Island residency such as a utility bill.
If your name has changed, you’ll need to provide official documentation, such as a government-issued marriage certificate, divorce decree, or adoption paperwork.
Travelers applying for a REAL ID within their renewal period, which is the 90 days before a license or ID expires, don’t have to pay any additional costs. Outside that renewal period, it will cost $27.50 to upgrade to a REAL ID.

Jared Polis speaks at the state Capitol on March 13, 2025. (Sara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)Colorado Gov. Jared Polis vetoed his first bill of this year’s legislative session, rejecting a bill that would have changed the state’s open records law.
“It would certainly be convenient for the Executive Branch to agree to weaken CORA, but as a representative for the people of Colorado, I support more, not less, openness and transparency,” the Democrat wrote in his Thursday veto letter, referring to the Colorado Open Records Act.
Senate Bill 25-77 was a bipartisan measure that would have extended the timeline that a records custodian has to respond to a CORA request, except for requests from journalists. It also would have given entities more time to respond to a request if they decided the request was for financial gain, like obtaining information on a large group of people in order to solicit  business.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The bill was sponsored by Sen. Cathy Kipp, a Fort Collins Democrat, Sen. Janice Rich, a Grand Junction Republican, Rep. Matt Soper, a Delta Republican, and Rep. Michael Carter, an Aurora Democrat. Kipp and Soper ran a similar bill last year that died in a Senate committee.
“I was really hoping that he would decide not to veto it,” Kipp said. “I think it is a very fair bill that we worked for a couple years on in order to get it into a good place. We have several elements of the bill that are good for both requestees and for requesters, and I think it would make things easier.”
The bill passed on a 45-19 vote in the House and a 27-6 vote in the Senate, which would satisfy the two-thirds requirement to override a veto if the Legislature pursues one. The lawmaking session ends the first week of May.
Kipp said sponsors are having conversations about pursuing a veto override.
Polis took issue with allowing public officials to make those determinations on who the requester is and what their motives are.
“The bill leaves the custodian with far too much power to define who is and is not a member of the media, and what is and isn’t news,” he wrote. “For instance, a public official may deem a request from a media outlet focusing specifically on climate change as not meeting the statutory definitions of ‘newsperson’ or ‘mass medium’ given the perspective of some elected officials that climate change is categorically not news.”
The bill relied on existing definitions of “mass medium” and “newsperson” found in state statute related to courts and court procedures.
Polis also objected to the creation of different CORA response timelines for different types of requests, ranging from three days for journalists and 30 days for businesses seeking records for financial gain.
“A newsperson, a member of the public, and a person seeking financial gain may all request the same information and, under this bill, get access to that information on different timelines,” Polis wrote. “To ensure fairness and confidence in public transparency, all legitimate requests for public transparency under CORA should be treated equally under the law, without preference for some requestors over others.”
But to Kipp, the bill’s intention is for the government to not conduct “market research” for businesses on the same timeline and cost for others seeking public records.
The bill’s bipartisan group of sponsors and supporters had argued that the bill was intended to give public officials a reasonable amount of time to respond to an increasing volume of requests.
“People should be able to get information that they want to get. So what we’re mostly doing with this bill is trying to clarify the processes for requesters, and to give those public entities and records custodians just a little bit more time to fulfill those requests, because it’s become just an overwhelming burden,” Kipp said.
The Colorado Freedom of Information Coalition’s advocacy committee had asked Polis earlier this month to veto the bill, arguing in a letter that it would create unnecessary barriers “for people seeking to gain a better understanding of state and local government activities in Colorado.”

U.S. Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-1st District) raised more than any U.S. House candidate in Pennsylvania in the first three months of 2025. From the beginning of January to the end of March, Fitzpatrick raised $1.22 million and spent just under $275,000.
Fitzpatrick, a Republican from Bucks County serving his fifth term in Congress, also holds the most cash on hand of any incumbent candidate in the commonwealth. Campaign finance records show he entered April with $5.37 million, a significant amount more than other GOP lawmaker who will likely face high-priced reelection bids.
At this point in the previous cycle, Fitzpatrick’s campaign had just $1.91 million cash on hand.

Four of the top five fundraisers in the commonwealth’s congressional delegation in Q1 are being targeted by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) as seats to flip in 2026. Pennsylvania is the only state that the DCCC is targeting more than 3 GOP held seats in its initial list of targets for the next election.
Republicans, who hold a narrow majority in the U.S. House, flipped two seats in Pennsylvania during the 2024 election.
Berwood Yost, the director of the Franklin & Marshall College Poll, told the Capital-Star it’s no surprise Republican incumbents are among the leaders in fundraising for Q1, since they are the most competitive seats in the state.
“They will attract the most interest, particularly to hold the Republican majority,” Yost said. “I mean, if you lose those four seats, you’ve got issues nationally.”
While Democrats are placing a high priority to be on offense in Pennsylvania, the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC), did not include any Democratic held seats in its initial 2026 target list.
U.S. Rep. Rob Bresnahan (R-8th District), who defeated incumbent Democrat Matt Cartwright for the seat in 2024 by roughly 1.5 points, raised the second highest in the state’s congressional delegation for Q1. The GOP freshman raised just under $835,000 from the beginning of January to the end of March, while spending $170,000. Bresnahan’s campaign entered April with $715,000 cash on hand.
Another Republican freshman member of the state’s congressional delegation finished Q1 with the third highest haul. U.S. Rep. Ryan Mackenzie (R-7th District), who unseated incumbent Democrat Susan Wild in 2024 by 1 point, raised just under $675,000 from the beginning of January to the end of March and spent roughly $165,000. His campaign entered April with $615,000 on hand.
  Rep. Scott Perry talking to reporters at the Capitol Sept. 19, 2023 (Jennifer Shutt/ States Newsroom)
U.S. Rep. Scott Perry (R-10th District), who is coming off of his closest race for reelection since winning a seat in the U.S. House in 2012, raised $565,000 from the beginning of January to the end of March and spent just under $95,000. Perry’s haul was the fifth highest in the state’s congressional delegation.
Perry’s campaign entered April with slightly less than $555,000, which is more than he had at this point in the previous cycle when his campaign had just over $360,000.
Yost said he imagines that there’s going to be “ample donors” for challengers in those competitive seats, since it is being targeted by the DCCC.
“It’s a little too soon to make any judgments about Democrats’ interest or enthusiasm, simply because you don’t really have candidates doing that fundraising yet,” Yost said.
“The normal ebb and flow is the incumbents are going to do what they can to solidify their donor base if they are expecting a challenge,” Yost said. “And we’ll know more about how competitive those races will be once we have declared candidates with the infrastructure that they need to report the fundraising.”
The only Republican in the state’s congressional delegation to not raise more than every Democrat is U.S. Rep. Mike Kelly (R-16th District), who raised just over $125,000 from the beginning of January to the end of March.
Although the 2026 midterm elections are 21 months away, national ratings outlets indicate that the races Democrats are targeting in the state should be competitive. The Cook Political Report rates Mackenzie and Perry’s bid for reelections in the 7th and 10th Congressional Districts, respectively, as “toss-ups.”
They also rate Bresnahan’s bid for a second term in the 8th Congressional District as “lean Republican,” and Fitzpatrick’s quest for another term representing parts of suburban Philadelphia as “likely Republican.”
The only Democrat on the radar of that national ratings outlet is U.S. Rep. Chris Deluzio (D-17th District) – a race they describe as “likely Democratic.” Deluzio raised just under $250,000 in Q1, which is more than any other Democratic incumbent in the state’s congressional delegation.

Democrats begin lining up for competitive House races
While the primary election for the House is still one year away, a few candidates have already entered the 2026 race.
Bucks County Commissioner Bob Harvie, a Democrat, announced earlier this month that he’s seeking his party’s nomination to face Fitzpatrick. Northampton County Executive Lamont McClure, a Democrat, declared his entrance into the race against Mackenzie for the 7th Congressional District in February.
As of April 18, no Democratic candidates have filed to run for the 8th and 10th Congressional Districts to challenge Bresnahan and Perry, although rematches for both races could happen. Cartwright told the Scranton Times-Tribune in January that he might run for the 8th Congressional District again in 2026, while Janelle Stelson, the Democrat who lost to Perry by 1.2 points last year, said last month that she is “seriously considering” a second run for the 10th Congressional District.
Yost said it’s too soon to tell how these races are going to shape up, but said he thinks “we can probably suggest” that the Democratic candidates “will be pretty well funded in all of these races,” as well as the Republican candidates, unless a weak candidate makes it through the primary election.
Due to the potential implications of the majority of the U.S. House being on the line, Yost thinks Democratic donors from across the country could weigh in on these battleground races. 
Evans’ future?
U.S. Rep. Dwight Evans (D-3rd District) is the only member of the state’s congressional delegation to raise less than $100,000. The Philadelphia Democrat raised just under $40,000 from the beginning of January to the end of March. His campaign spent about $50,000 in Q1, which is more than it brought in during that time period.
Evans is also the only member to have less than $100,000 in his account. Entering April, his campaign had just under $65,000 on hand. The next lowest is U.S. Rep. Dan Meuser (R-9th District), a potential candidate for governor, who has $206,000 on hand.
  U.S. Rep. Dwight Evans (D-3rd District)
Evans suffered a stroke in May 2024 and was reelected to another term in November. Following his illness, he did not vote for several months as he recovered. Multiple Democrats, according to a Philadelphia Inquirer report in December, would be interested in running for the seat, should Evans not seek reelection in 2026.
The names the Inquirer mentioned as potential candidates included state Sen. Sharif Street, Pennsylvania’s Democratic Party chair, state Rep. Morgan Cephas, the Philadelphia Delegation chair in the Pennsylvania House, and state Rep. Chris Rabb (D-Philadelphia). Dave Oxman, a physician, has already filed to run for Pennsylvania’s 3rd Congressional District.
Rabb set up an exploratory committee in October 2023, but decided against joining the race.
The link to donate to Rabb’s exploratory committee is still active on ActBlue, although he told the Capital-Star that he set it up for the 2024 election cycle “based on persistent rumors that Rep. Evans might not run for reelection. When his name appeared on the ballot, I had no desire to run against him.”
When asked by the Capital-Star if he was actively considering a run for the seat in 2026, he said it was “too soon to say.”
A spokesperson for the Evans campaign told the Capital-Star on Friday that he “has every intention to run for re-election at this time” and “is working hard at fundraising and plans for a successful Q2.”
Evans, after a long tenure in the Pennsylvania General Assembly, defeated indicted incumbent Congressman Chaka Fattah in the Democratic Party primary in 2016 to win a seat in the U.S. House. He’s coasted to reelection since winning a seat in Congress and according to national ratings outlets, represents a safe Democratic district.
Yost said since it’s not a competitive district, “the impetus for him to raise money is not the same as it is for, say, Fitzpatrick or these other candidates that are in competitive districts.”
“That’s just the reality,” Yost said.
Fetterman posts lowest quarter since entering Senate
U.S. Sen. John Fetterman (D-Pa.), raised an impressive $73.9 million during his successful 2022 campaign over Republican Mehmet Oz.
Although he’s not up for reelection until 2028, his campaign raised the lowest amount in a full quarter since he declared for the seat in February 2021.
Fetterman’s campaign raised just over $395,000 from the beginning of January to the end of March and spent a little more than $415,000. 
In 2024, Fetterman raised $1 million in two-consecutive quarters to end the year. His lowest haul last year was $881,000 in the first three months of 2024.
Prior to this past quarter, Fetterman’s lowest total for a three-month stretch was $720,000 from the beginning of April to the end of June in 2023.

Over the past few months, Fetterman has faced pushback from Democrats and other progressives over a number of his statements, votes, and positions, including backing multiple cabinet selections in President Donald Trump’s administration. But, he holds a positive approval rating, according to data from early this year.
Yost said there’s no doubt that there are a number of Democrats who supported Fetterman in 2022 that have “soured” on him due, in part, to some of those recent votes.
Since Fetterman isn’t up for reelection until 2028, Yost believes “he’s got plenty of time to raise money, but you can’t ignore” the pushback he’s receiving from some in his own party.
“Maybe this is an early sign that he could have trouble raising money from traditional Democratic sources,” Yost said. “It’s worth following that to see if it’s just a blip, or if this is an early indicator that he may have trouble raising money like he did in 2022.”

(Photo courtesy Candice Kutrosky, NM Forestry Division)A wildfire in Valencia County destroyed three structures yesterday evening, according to a New Mexico state Forestry spokesperson. Efforts to contain the wildfire remain ongoing.
The Rio Grande Fire was detected around 4 p.m. on Thursday west of Bosque Farms. High winds and dry conditions pushed the fire east across the Rio Grande into the village Bosque Farms, state Forestry spokesperson George Ducker said. 
The fire, which started on Bureau of Indian Affairs jurisdiction is currently 10% contained, Ducker said. 
The fire spans roughly 60 acres, or less than a tenth of a square mile, and the structures burned may have been homes, Ducker said, , but a damage assessment is being conducted today. 
Fuels for the fire include grass, brush and other plants along the bosque. High winds and prolonged drought made fire risk high in the area and across the state Thursday. The fire also caused evacuations but those have since been lifted, Ducker said. 
The cause of the fire is still under investigation, Ducker said, though some online wildfire databases say it was “human caused.”
Crews worked through the night to contain the fire and have since established divisions on the north and south sides of it to try to contain it further. Crews will look to increase containment and extinguish hotspots within the bosque today, Ducker said. 
Winds in the area are expected to decrease, and scattered rain showers are expected tonight. Still, the eastern two-thirds of the state, including Bosque Farms, are under a Red Flag Warning, according to the National Weather Service.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Rio-Grande-Fire_Candice-Kutrosky-e1745000802891.jpg,,,2025-04-18 15:10:12.027806

(Photo credit: Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)Gov. Jeff Landry, a conservative Republican, drew praise from liberal Democrats after he railed against large corporations and called for stricter regulations on the insurance industry — an uncommon spectacle that suggested the governor is staking his political fate on lowering policy rates.
Testifying in a nearly two-hour exchange Wednesday with lawmakers on the House Insurance Committee, Landry urged his fellow Republicans to break from their traditional alignment with insurance companies and vote in favor of House Bill 576, a Democrat-backed proposal that’s part of an agenda Landry has described as a “balanced approach” to the decades-old rate debate between personal injury lawyers and the insurance companies they sue. 
Louisiana pollster John Couvillon said Landry can’t really afford not to take on the insurance issue because policy premiums are by far the most overwhelming concern of voters and likely outweighs any risk associated with bipartisanship.
“If he can bend the cost curve on insurance rates, that’s something he can take credit for,” Couvillon said. “Who he works with to do it is much more insider baseball. I don’t know if that kind of perception would matter with the average Louisiana voter who’s really more concerned with high insurance rates.”  
Landry has included multiple bills on his agenda that target both insurance companies and trial lawyers, but House Bill 576 could be part of a larger political calculation that affords him more opportunities for reward than risk. 
Cosponsored by moderate Democrats Robby Carter of Amite and Chad Brown of Plaquemine, the bill would give the state insurance commissioner the power to prohibit any insurance rates considered “excessive” during any market conditions. Currently, the commissioner can only exercise that power after holding a public hearing in which someone proves that the insurance market lacks competition. 
The bill applies to all lines of insurance, though Landry has focused his attention mostly on auto and property insurance rates. Spikes in homeowner premiums occurred after a series of destructive storms starting in 2020 and have been mostly limited to the coastal regions. Premiums for auto insurance have long been elevated across Louisiana, and lawmakers have struggled to identify a clear reason why, believing the problem is rooted in policy decisions. 
Landry and Brown sat shoulder-to-shoulder Wednesday as they presented the measure, which includes an amendment the governor said he wrote himself and modeled after a law in Mississippi. Louisiana’s neighbor has average auto insurance rates that are nearly half the amount of Louisiana’s, according to U.S. News & World Report.
Brown’s bill cleared the committee in a 13-4 vote but still has a ways to go before final passage, and Landry’s office would not say if the governor will continue to shepherd the bill over each subsequent hurdle.  
“It certainly helped that the governor was there to support it,” Brown said in an interview, adding that he hopes Landry will testify at subsequent hearings. He thinks the governor has sent a clear enough message to Republican lawmakers about what they need to vote for.
Landry paired his appearance with rhetoric that potentially puts him at odds with his own party, which has traditionally favored pro-capitalist narratives.
Louisiana lawmakers dissect personal injury laws as attorney-legislators protest

“We’re losing sight of something that’s been going on in this country for quite some time, and that is consolidation … That is exactly why we need this law,” Landry said, “because we have allowed corporations to control large market shares in violation of Sherman [Antitrust Act] again and again.”
Congress passed the Sherman Act in 1890 to establish rules for competitive trade and prevent unfair monopolies. 
Rep. Edmond Jordan of Baton Rouge and New Orleans Reps. Matt Willard and Mandie Landry, all Democrats, thanked the governor for putting effort into the issue and trying to hold insurance companies accountable. They joined Landry in arguing tort reform legislation, which is based on the idea that trial lawyers have an unfair advantage in court, has not worked.
One of the four Republicans who voted against the Brown bill, Rep. Jay Gallé of Mandeville, told his colleagues it would undermine “all free market principles” of supply and demand and ultimately discourage new insurance companies from coming to Louisiana. He argued it would give the insurance commissioner sole authority to arbitrarily decide rates. 
Brown clarified the commissioner would only be able to approve or reject rates, not set them. The governor argued Louisiana could never have a “free market” for insurance because the law requires drivers and homeowners to have coverage.  
“The free market rules do not apply when the consumer is mandated to buy something,” Gov. Landry said.
In a later interview, Gallé said he was in an uncomfortable situation having to choose between supporting his party leader versus following his conscience and beliefs. 
“When it is a quote-unquote ‘governor’s bill,’ the pressure is already on you, and when he takes the time to come and sit in the room that adds a little more pressure,” Gallé said. “I hated to go against the governor, but at the end of the day I had to go with what’s best for my district.”
Whether the Brown bill would even have an impact on insurance rates is questionable. Insurance Commissioner Tim Temple, who is opposed to it — and in a public feud with the governor — has said actuaries in his office have reviewed high policy rates in Louisiana and found them to be justified based on losses insurers have accrued in defending lawsuits. 
The governor’s bill would back the commissioner into a corner, forcing him to choose between rates based on market data or rates artificially suppressed for political reasons, Temple said. 
The governor has cast suspicion on Temple’s opposition to the bill, repeating an argument Rep. Mandie Landry made earlier in the hearing when she asked the governor if he ever knew of a politician who shied away from having greater control. 
“I’ve never seen a politician not want more power,” the governor said.
At the same time, some claim the governor is focused on Brown’s proposal because he hopes giving more power to Temple would allow him to blame the commissioner if rates fail to improve. Temple’s office pointed to Gov. Landry’s April 9 discussion with conservative radio host Moon Griffon in which the governor suggested as much.
“If we … implement that here, giving our insurance commissioner those tools, and if the rates don’t go down, it’s on him,” the governor told Griffon. 
But according to Couvillon, deflecting blame away from the governor would be a more difficult task than most people realize. Voters are much more familiar with the governor than the insurance commissioner, so it would take a very effective messaging strategy to deflect any blame. 
“Voters tend to hold the governor accountable for things like high insurance rates whether it is a deserved measurement or not,” Couvillon said.
If Gov. Landry’s agenda has little effect and coverage premiums remain about the same, there’s enough time to try to recast his political fate and convince voters to overlook it before his re-election bid in 2027. The greatest risk in the governor’s calculation lies in the possibility that insurance rates continue to increase, which would be a much bigger problem for Gov. Landry, Couvillon said.
On the other hand, the insurance commissioner has said repeatedly previous reforms have started having an impact on homeowner coverage lines. On Wednesday, Temple told the committee eight insurers have filed rate decreases for 2025. 
“It is working,” Temple said. “Rates are coming down.”
House Bill 576 will next move to the House floor for consideration.

SPRINGFIELD – The Illinois chapter of AARP played a role in the Trump administration reversing itself and allowing Social Security beneficiaries to have the option of filing for benefits over the phone.

The continuation of phone-based filing is an about-face of a plan set forth in mid-March by the Social Security Administration (SSA) to restrict telephone services for beneficiaries nationwide. Nearly 100,000 Illinoisans mobilized against the plan by writing to Congress during the month of March. Nationally, AARP members sent more than 2 million emails denouncing the proposed changes.

In response to the widespread pushback, the SSA issued a series of updates on X, formerly Twitter, withdrawing its previously announced plan and reinstating phone services for all claim types—including those applying for retirement, Social Security disability insurance (SSDI), Medicare and supplemental security income (SSI).

The new plan now requires in-person claims processing and identity proofing only for calls flagged as potentially fraudulent, according to a press release Monday from Illinois AARP. “This is great news for older Americans,” said Ryan Gruenenfelder, senior director of advocacy and outreach at AARP Illinois.

New rule caused web crashes, service disruptions

AARP Illinois and its members came to the Illinois state Capitol on April 10 to express their frustration with the recent federal actions and call on lawmakers to strengthen SSA customer service. Members have reported significant disruptions in service in recent months, including long wait times at SSA field offices, frequent website crashes and an increase in calls getting disconnected due to a lack of available representatives.

“As a retiree, I count on my Social Security benefits, and they actually provide more than half of my monthly income,” said Sandra McAvoy, an AARP member and volunteer with the Illinois state legislature. “That income has enabled me to live independently and very comfortably.”

In Illinois, about 2.3 million people receive some form of Social Security benefits. More than 40% of Illinois residents age 65 or older rely on Social Security for at least half of their income, while around 20% rely on it for at least 90% of their income, according to AARP.

The SSA was planning to end phone-based claims as an anti-fraud measure, saying the move would strengthen fraud prevention by forcing individuals to go online or visit local field offices to prove their identities and file for benefits.

AARP said this would have made it difficult for older adults, people with disabilities and those in rural areas to access their benefits.

“The proposed changes were unacceptable,” said Gruenenfelder.

About 140,000 people age 65 and older in Illinois live more than 45 miles roundtrip from the nearest Social Security office, according to an April 8 report by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Once there, individuals report having to wait for hours in long lines to see an available customer service agent.

The only alternative to in-person and phone services — the SSA’s online portal system — is not a reliable option for many beneficiaries. Roughly 28% of households in Illinois do not have subscriptions to high-speed internet, according to a 2024 report from the Benton Institute for Broadband and Society.

Some callers to SSA waited hours to get help

These challenges were in place long before the now-rescinded changes. But AARP said there has since been a recent “rapid deterioration” in customer service that has resulted in callers waiting hours at a time to get connected with an available representative.

According to SSA data, the agency had a busy rate of 0% in 2024, meaning no callers received a pre-recorded message when trying to reach a service agent over the phone. But in March, that number spiked to 28.4%, indicating nearly 1 in 3 callers received a message saying the office’s lines were too busy to take their call.

The sudden disruption to customer service came after the agency’s announcement in February of a 12% target reduction of the SSA workforce and permanent closure of six of 10 regional offices by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). These workforce reductions were announced despite promises by President Donald Trump not to cut or disrupt Social Security payments with his policies.

In his first speech since leaving the White House on Tuesday, April 15, former President Joe Biden spoke out against the Trump administration’s latest actions on Social Security, including sweeping workforce cuts, permanent closures of regional offices and the current customer service crisis.

“In fewer than 100 days, this new administration has done so much damage,” the former president said in Chicago, according to the AP. “They’ve taken a hatchet to the Social Security Administration.”

AARP celebrates the SSA’s decision to walk back its proposed changes to phone-based services, but Gruenenfelder said more oversight and resources are needed to improve the agency’s customer service moving forward.

“We’re urging Congress consistently, and the White House consistently, no matter who’s in the White House, to take actions to prioritize Social Security and protect it for the long term,” Gruenenfelder said.

Symptoms typically appear 7 to 14 days after exposure and can include a high fever, cough, runny nose, red and watery eyes, white spots inside the mouth, and a distinctive rash, writes guest columnist Noreen Womack. (Getty Images)Montana health officials have announced five confirmed cases of measles in Gallatin County.

The Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services along with the Gallatin City-County Health Department in Bozeman confirmed it’s the first instance of the highly infectious disease since 1990.
The individuals are children and adults who were exposed to measles while traveling outside of Montana. The cases reside in Gallatin County and are currently isolated at home. All five individuals are unvaccinated, or vaccine status is unknown.
The Gallatin City-County Health Department continues to assess any potential exposures while the individuals were contagious and are contacting the people who may have been exposed, commonly referred to as “contact tracing.” People potentially exposed are being provided with information about the exposure date and disease symptoms to watch out for.
The Gallatin health department has determined that there are points of exposure to the general public. Potential exposures to the public can be found on the GCCHD website and will be updated as needed or as more information becomes available. The spread of measles can occur before people know they have the disease, and before any rash appears. The times listed on the website include the period when the exposure occurred and two hours after.
 People without prior measles infection, vaccination have 90% likelihood of contracting disease if exposed

Individuals who are immune to measles through vaccination, laboratory evidence of immunity, laboratory confirmation of disease, or were born before 1957 are not considered at risk for infection. Individuals without prior measles infection or vaccination have a 90% likelihood of contracting the disease if exposed.
“While it is unfortunate to have cases of measles after 35 years of disease inactivity in Montana, we have been working diligently with our local partners to prepare,” said DPHHS Public Health Physician Dr. Maggie Cook-Shimanek. “We are confident that our public health and clinical partners will work together and address this situation as quickly as possible. It is important for everyone to know their vaccination status and to visit with their health department or health care provider if they are unsure.”

If you are unsure of your vaccination status, here are a few places you can review:

Call your old high school, college, or university and ask if they have vaccination records.
Contact your doctor’s office, urgent care, or pediatrician. Even if you have not been there in years, they may still have records.
Reach out to the health department where you grew up.
Check your home state immunization registries.

Measles is a highly infectious airborne disease that typically begins with a fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes, white spots in the mouth and a red rash that appears about 14 days after exposure. The rash usually starts on the face and spreads downward to the rest of the body. It is particularly dangerous for infants for whom vaccination is generally not recommended until 12 months of age. Maintaining a high level of vaccination in the community helps protect infants who are too young to be vaccinated, as well as individuals who cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons.
“Measles is highly contagious and highly preventable with vaccination, and ensuring people are immunized remains our best defense. If people are unable to find their vaccine records, there are no contraindications to receiving an additional dose,” said Dr. Peter Bulger, Gallatin City-County Health Department medical director.
Measles continues to be prevalent in many regions worldwide, resulting in an estimated 300 deaths every day. Cases in the U.S. are generally rare but have been increasing in recent years.
The best way to protect against measles is vaccination. No changes have been made to the existing measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine recommendations in the United States. Two doses of MMR, a measles-containing vaccine that protects against measles, mumps and rubella, are 97 to 99% effective in preventing measles. Measles vaccines have been available in the U.S. since 1963, and two doses have been recommended for children since 1989.
If you are in need of the MMR vaccine, call your primary care physician as soon as possible.
“We are actively working with individuals who are experiencing symptoms,” said Lori Christenson, Gallatin City-County Health Officer. “We greatly appreciate the cooperation of those involved in helping mitigate further exposures. We encourage anyone who is not vaccinated or unsure of their vaccination history to consider vaccination and to contact your health care provider or GCCHD. By getting vaccinated we protect ourselves and others around us from infection.”
There is no cure for measles once the outbreak has started. It’s a virus, and medical professionals treat the symptoms related to the infection.
For more information about measles and the measles vaccine, visit the state health department’s website. Additional information can also be found on the CDC’s website.

Last week, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer requested an emergency declaration from President Donald Trump for the state, 12 counties and the Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians following the historic ice storm that hit northern Michigan.
If granted, up to $5 million from the federal government would be made available to help northern Michigan clean up and recover.
Local, tribal and state entities and utilities have been responding to the storm for weeks, clearing roads, cleaning up debris and repairing power lines. Whitmer also called in the National Guard to help. The state estimates that costs for responding to the storm already exceed $7 million.
Officials have said federal assistance is central to recovery in the region. U.S. Rep. Jack Bergman, a Republican, and Sens. Gary Peters and Elissa Slotkin, both Democrats, supported that request.
In a news release from the governor’s office, Col. James F. Grady II, director of the Michigan State Police, said approval of the emergency request “would bring critical federal resources to support local response operations that are still ongoing. This is a necessary step while we work toward the broader disaster declaration that will bring additional relief.”
But how does the process actually work?
 Disaster relief starts locally

After a disaster hits, local, tribal and state governments will typically be the first to respond. If they don’t have enough resources to deal with the aftermath, governors and tribal governments can request assistance from the federal government, which the president has to sign off on.
Disaster declarations are structured through a law called the Stafford Act.
“There are incidents that obviously the state needs help dealing with, because no state or community can take care of it on their own, and that’s when federal aid is designed to kick in,” said Anna Weber, a senior policy analyst for climate adaptation at the environmental nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council.
Weber spent a decade working on federal contracts related to water infrastructure and environmental health.
There are two types of federal disaster declarations. One is an emergency declaration, which the president decides on and which doesn’t have to meet any threshold.
The other is a major disaster declaration, which often requires a damage assessment to determine if an area is eligible. (In situations where it’s clear that federal assistance will be required, officials don’t have to wait for a damage assessment to request federal assistance.)
The state of Michigan will work with the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, and the Small Business Administration to assess whether the region is eligible for that assistance.
 Whitmer requested emergency assistance from the president. What’s next?

It’s up to President Trump to decide whether or not to grant that relief, which usually goes to local entities to help with cleanup and recovery.
In an emailed statement to IPR, White House spokesman Kush Desai said, “The Trump administration is closely tracking the situation and is working with state and local officials to assess what next steps are needed.”
Emergency declarations are typically processed pretty quickly because they don’t need to meet any specific criteria. The goal is to get aid to the area quickly.
And that can also be a stopgap to give FEMA time to assess the damage to see if more assistance is needed.
If that is the case, the governor can request a major disaster declaration which would unlock additional federal dollars.
And unlike the initial emergency declaration, in a major disaster declaration FEMA considers a range of criteria, such as a state’s financial capacity and resources.
Those assessments begin next week.
“There’ll actually be people out there driving around to areas that they can reach, you know, going looking at things with clipboards, writing down the kinds of damages that we’ve seen in these areas, how much money it costs and how many additional resources the state might need in order to address it,” Weber said.
If the region is eligible for major disaster relief, other forms of aid can then come into play — such as cash payments to individuals and public assistance for more long term recovery like repairing infrastructure.
Rep. Bergman is urging counties to assist in those assessments.
“For us to have a chance at securing Individual Assistance and Public Assistance, we need to take an all-hands-on-deck approach,” he wrote in a newsletter from his office on Thursday. “I encourage our leaders in all 12 counties to support this effort as we work together to secure help for our communities.”
These relief efforts kick in after events like the ice storm, but federal hazard mitigation grants have also aimed to reduce the impact of future disasters.
 An uncertain future for FEMA

Uncertainty surrounds FEMA amid the Trump administration’s efforts to cut costs and reshape the federal government. Trump and those in his administration have said they want to drastically reduce – or even eliminate — the agency.
The situation has been constantly changing, but Weber said there have been concrete impacts: “What we have seen is that staff and programs at FEMA are being eliminated, and aid is being slower to arrive even if it’s already been approved.”
Those cuts have reached efforts to prepare for disasters as well. For example, Grist reported earlier this month that FEMA plans to dismantle a program, passed under the first Trump administration, to help communities prepare for disasters before they hit.

(Photo by Patrick Semansky-Pool/Getty Images)On April 18, 1775, Paul Revere famously rode through the streets of Massachusetts to warn residents about the approach of British troops, which culminated in the Battle of Lexington and Concord that kicked off America’s war for independence.
Now, 250 years later, U.S. Sen. Angus King is giving his own warning over what he sees as the imminent collapse of American democracy under President Donald Trump.
In an interview with writer, historian and Lincoln County resident Heather Cox Richardson, Maine’s independent senator discussed why this inflection point in American history is so resonant today.
“I believe we are in one of the most dangerous places our country has been in since the founding, because what is happening before our eyes is the collapse of the constitutional structure that the framers designed to protect us from the inevitable abuse that comes from the concentration of power,” King said, explaining that the U.S. Constitution purposefully divided power between the Legislature — or Congress — the President and the courts.
“But here’s what’s happening right now,” he said, “is that the executive branch is seizing more and more power.
“There are two levels of things going on here: one is bad and the other is dangerous,” he said. “There are bad things like what [the Department of Government Efficiency] is doing and messing around with Social Security and this sending people to El Salvador. That’s really bad, but what’s dangerous is the way it’s being done, by essentially violating the plain intent of the Constitution, by having the President be the legislator and the executive at the same time, that’s a recipe for the loss of our freedom.”
And for people who are “cheering on his agenda” and saying, “Well, we don’t care that he’s doing all this unconstitutional stuff,” King said, “They’re going to care because eventually the Eye of Sauron is going to turn on them,” referencing the evil, all-powerful symbol in J.R.R. Tolkien’s “Lord of the Rings.”
And while the courts are “doing pretty well so far” in pushing back, King repeatedly expressed alarm over what he sees as Congress’ abdication of its duty and the complicity of his Republican colleagues.
“What we have is a test between institutional loyalty, constitutional loyalty, and party loyalty. And so my Republican colleagues — who I’m doing everything I can to sort of peel off to say, ‘Enough is enough’ — so far, haven’t been willing to take that step,” he said. “They’re in control of the Senate, they’re in control of the House, and they’re looking at getting their tax bill through and getting their budget bill through, rather than what’s happening to the structure of our government in the process.”
He also said that he believes many Republicans are not speaking up because of Trump’s threat to challenge dissenters in upcoming elections by running primary opponents financed by billionaire advisor Elon Musk.
King also spoke about the frustration among voters, acknowledging the most frequent question he hears is, “I’m mad as hell. What can I do?’”
“They can get together, they can talk to each other, they can reach out to their neighbors,” King said. “They can participate in peaceful demonstrations that indicate to people like me that people want change, that they’re concerned…They also can communicate to our offices.”
He said American people actually have a lot of power and that members of Congress are influenced when they hear stories from constituents about how Trump’s actions are having a real negative impact on their lives — such as someone whose Social Security check didn’t come or a veteran unable to get a medical appointment.
“Believe it or not, anecdotes matter,” King said, “and so when people are in touch with us, if they are specific about what’s going on and what’s affecting them in their real life, that’s the kind of thing that breaks through with members of Congress — that their constituents are being hurt — and that’s one of the reasons I think we may see some progress on this over the next two or three weeks, because the damage that’s being done is just starting to manifest itself out in the communities.”
But King acknowledged he is “an optimist.”
As for Paul Revere, Maine is celebrating his midnight ride with a series of events that will feature the lighting of lanterns and lighthouses throughout the state. Organized by the Maine Semiquincentennial Commission, several of the ceremonies will include the reading of the famous 1861 poem by Portland native Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, “Paul Revere’s Ride,” which concludes:


So through the night rode Paul Revere;
And so through the night went his cry of alarm
To every Middlesex village and farm,—
A cry of defiance, and not of fear,
A voice in the darkness, a knock at the door,
And a word that shall echo forevermore!
For, borne on the night-wind of the Past,
Through all our history, to the last,
In the hour of darkness and peril and need,
The people will waken and listen to hear
The hurrying hoof-beats of that steed,
And the midnight message of Paul Revere.

States worry that an executive order and federal funding cuts could weaken their cybersecurity efforts (Joe Raedle/Getty Images).For the first half of his career in law enforcement, working as a police officer in South Florida, Chase Fopiano did not think cyberattacks on police agencies were a serious threat.
Many of his law enforcement colleagues were under the same impression — that since they were the most likely to investigate the attacks, there was no way cybercriminals would go after them.
By about 2015, as technology advanced and hackers became more creative, that changed, Fopiano said. Now, from the U.S. Secret Service to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, there are thousands of attempts to compromise networks or organizations every day, he said.
“A lot of those [attempts] are toward government or even police, especially because they know that we’re not as prepared as we should be,” said Fopiano, who now oversees cybersecurity as part of a regional task force.
Spanning health care facilities to court systems, states and local communities are facing a rise in cyberthreats. They include threats to critical infrastructure, increased activity from foreign actors, continued ransomware attacks and more, according to a recent report from the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center.
But President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order shifting some of the responsibility from the federal government to states and localities to improve their infrastructure to address risks, including cybercrimes. And federal cuts have reduced resources for state and local officials, including a cybersecurity grant program and a key cybersecurity agency.
States and localities are taking steps to address the problems, such as establishing new penalties for tampering with critical infrastructure, centralizing state IT personnel and setting standards in areas from elections to health care.
But the Trump order and federal funding cuts, a shortage of IT experts at the local level and an overall lack of preparedness could weaken their efforts.
In December, a major cyberattack forced Rhode Island to take down its online portal used by residents to obtain Medicaid benefits and SNAP, commonly known as food stamps. The personal data stolen from Rhode Island’s public benefits network — including Social Security numbers and banking information — was later found on the dark web.
In February, a “sophisticated cyberattack” hit the office of Virginia Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares, which led agency officials to shut down computer systems and resort to paper court filings.
Last week, hackers also breached the computer network of the Fall River School District in Massachusetts. The school district is working with third-party experts and law enforcement to determine if anyone’s personal information was targeted, according to MassLive.
In 2023, of the 48 states that participated in the Nationwide Cybersecurity Review, a voluntary self-assessment conducted by federal agencies that examines how well governments are prepared to respond to cyberattacks, only 22 states reached or surpassed the recommended levels of security in their systems.
Cybersecurity has become increasingly important over time because more government services and data are digitized, said Samir Jain, the vice president of policy at the Center for Democracy & Technology, a nonprofit that advocates for digital rights and freedom of expression.
But a national shortage of people with that expertise — especially at the local level — creates a challenge.
“The federal government has traditionally played at least some role in trying to fill some of those gaps,” Jain said. “And so the notion that the federal government could just withdraw and expect states and localities to step in is just not realistic.”
Local governments and law enforcement agencies also have other priorities, Fopiano said. The police need cars, guns, shields and other resources that generally take precedence over cybersecurity.
Today, Fopiano is the cybersecurity chair of the Southeast Regional Domestic Security Task Force in Florida, overseeing cyber activity from South Florida to the Florida Keys. The attacks continue to rise, he said.
“Terrorist groups are getting into cybercrime, cartels are getting into cybercrime, you have kids just learning about hacking and just fooling around,” he said. “The audience of who’s doing it has definitely expanded and led to that rise in overall cybercrime.”
 Cuts to federal resources

In 2022, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced a first-of-its-kind cybersecurity grant program, providing more than $1 billion in funding for states, localities, tribes and territories to address cybersecurity risks and threats.
The State and Local Cybersecurity Grant Program, created under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, awarded $279 million to states and localities in fiscal year 2024. The Tribal Cybersecurity Grant Program awarded another $18 million for tribes in its first year.
But the grant program is set to expire in September, with no current plans to renew it. At a hearing this month, several state and local officials urged Congress to reauthorize the program. But U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who refused the federal aid during her tenure as governor of South Dakota, questioned the program’s efficacy.
The Trump administration is also cutting as many as 1,300 employees from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, which administers the grants alongside the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
The program has allowed states to assess the security of their networks, develop cybersecurity training, implement multi-factor authentication features — which requires users to provide more than one form of verification to access a site or service — and much more, said Alex Whitaker, the director of government affairs at the National Association of State Chief Information Officers.
“This has been a really great program because we’re seeing a lot of great evidence for how states and their counterparts in local government are improving their cyber defenses,” Whitaker said.
Counties also rely on a number of federal resources to strengthen their defenses, including services provided by CISA, said Rita Reynolds, the chief information officer at the National Association of Counties and managing director for County Tech Xchange. NACo is an organization that represents county governments across the United States.
The Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center, for instance — a key collaboration between CISA and the Center for Internet Security to help state and local governments with cybersecurity operations — lost some of its federal funding for certain programs last month, Reynolds said.
In trying to keep up with emerging threats, counties are still trying to find resources to help them implement multi-factor authentication, convert government pages to “.gov” domains and other methods of protecting their infrastructure, she said.
“Are counties prepared?” Reynolds asked. “I would say they’re not as prepared as they’d like to be. And in some cases, they are looking at how to strategically approach this now that resources are disappearing.”
In a statement, CISA spokesperson Jared Auchey said Trump’s executive order empowers state and local governments “to make risk-informed decisions and investments to improve their preparedness.” The agency will work with state and local officials to ensure they have the information and support they need, Auchey added.
 Lawmakers step up

In 2024, 33 states adopted resolutions or enacted legislation regarding cybersecurity, according to a database from the National Conference of State Legislatures, a nonpartisan public officials’ association.
Many of those measures sought to protect states’ critical infrastructure, including water systems, government services, health care and more. Florida, Louisiana, West Virginia and other states created new criminal and civil penalties for people who attempt to tamper with critical infrastructure.
In Minnesota and Washington state, lawmakers passed measures allowing or requiring state and local governments to invest in cybersecurity protections related to election administration. Connecticut and Florida also passed legislation to secure health care facilities from cyberattacks by having hospitals create plans or by supporting investments in new technologies.
Other states are looking for solutions from outside vendors. South Dakota has set aside $7 million for a company to examine local governments for vulnerabilities to hackers.
With attacks occurring at every level of government, New Mexico Democratic state Sen. Michael Padilla, the Senate majority whip, sponsored legislation in 2023 to create the state’s office of cybersecurity. As chair of the Senate Science, Technology and Telecommunications Committee for 10 years, he plays a significant role in most of the state’s cybersecurity legislation.
Through the committee’s work, Padilla says New Mexico is in good shape to fend off cyberattacks — and the state’s cities and counties are joining in.
“I think New Mexico is in a very good position because what we decided to do by creating that office is to ensure that any transactions that occur with state government here [in New Mexico] have to meet a minimum set of security standards,” he said.
In Indiana, Republican state Sen. Liz Brown filed legislation that would encourage state agencies and groups to develop cybersecurity policies. The bill was approved by both chambers, with the Senate agreeing to changes sent from the House.
“You have to protect your infrastructure,” Brown said. “We don’t want utility systems to be shut down. We don’t want wastewater or freshwater treatment plants or even the water supply being contaminated or harmed in some way. Our systems all have backups, but even so, we know there are bad actors.”
Some states are also preparing to reshuffle their offices or create new ones to centralize their cybersecurity efforts. Arkansas, for example, enacted legislation this month to create a new state cybersecurity office, which will monitor the state’s computer networks and respond to cyberthreats.
In Alabama, rather than having information technology people scattered throughout the government, Republican state Rep. Mike Shaw wants cybersecurity personnel centrally managed.
Shaw’s legislation, which passed the House and is currently in the Senate, would give the Alabama Office of Information Technology central authority to maintain the needs of all of the state’s departments.
The centralization would make it easier to pursue cybersecurity initiatives in the future, Shaw said.
“The federal government is really big, and it’s really hard to come up with a one-size-fits-all solution for things like cybersecurity, data privacy and technology in general,” Shaw said. “So, in some sense, it’s good that the states are coming up with their own.”

(Matthew Perschall / Louisiana Illuminator)It had been many years since Phyllis Taylor, widow to the creator of the TOPS program, had sat behind the presentation desk of the Louisiana House Education Committee. 
Her late husband, Patrick F. Taylor, a wealthy oilman who had served for many years on the LSU Board of Supervisors, is perhaps best remembered for creating the program that’s now known as the Taylor Opportunity Program for Students. The program began with 183 students that Taylor personally paid tuition for. After this pilot’s success, Taylor convinced the legislature to begin a state-financed version, which inspired similar programs in numerous other states. 
Started in 1989, it pays a significant chunk of tuition costs for qualified Louisiana students who attend college at state colleges and universities. Hundreds of thousands of students have paid for college with TOPS, many who would have otherwise been unable to afford an education. 
Every year, lawmakers debate tweaks to TOPS, some minor, some major. But Phyllis Taylor, a soft-spoken octogenarian philanthropist and one of the richest people in Louisiana, has refrained from weighing in — until this week. 
What piqued Taylor’s interest was House Bill 77 by Rep. Chris Turner, R-Ruston. It would create a flat rate for each TOPS award amount, rather than having a unique allotment for each school. 
The new rate would mean students at LSU, LSU’s two medical schools and the University of New Orleans would be paying more out of pocket, while students at other Louisiana schools would pay less. 
The bill would also create a higher award amount for high-achieving students. 
In its original state, Turner’s bill – designed to keep high-performing students in Louisiana – would add around $50 million annually to the cost of the TOPS program. That’s not a small sum as the state tightens its belt amid difficult fiscal times. 
“I come to remind everyone that we want, by all means, to preserve TOPS, even if that means that some changes might have to be deferred for a later time, because I realized that the state of Louisiana is going to be under dire fiscal constraints,” Taylor said. 
“There is more need than there is money,” she added. 
Taylor made her position on Turner’s bill clear; she’s unhappy with the proposal that would hurt LSU students, who make up the majority of TOPS recipients in the state. She reminded the committee that while they may want to reward the best and brightest, TOPS was meant to provide an opportunity for all students – not just those with the best ACT scores. 
“Let’s not throw the baby out with the bath water and jeopardize a program as a whole in order to maybe provide for a few that might not be as contributing to our state as we need,” Taylor said. 
The committee unanimously advanced Turner’s legislation, though only after adding amendments that would partially close the gap for students at LSU’s main campus and undergraduate programs at its medical school in New Orleans. Members also lowered the new award amount for high-achieving students from $12,000 to $11,300. 
House Education Chairwoman Laurie Schlegel, R-Metairie, one of the co-authors on Turner’s bill, said she believed the amendments would lower the TOPS cost increase from around $50 million annually to $30 million to $35 million. 
Because it involves spending state money,  the bill must receive a second hearing in the House Appropriations Committee, which oversees the state’s budget. 
Though Appropriations Chairman Rep. Jack McFarland, R-Jonesboro, acknowledged the need to keep the best and brightest in Louisiana, he said it would be very challenging to find the money to fund Turner’s bill, especially as lawmakers are digging into couch cushions to find the change necessary to prevent a K-12 teacher pay cut. 
“Before we go and we commit ourselves to more, I think we need to address what we currently have in front of us,” McFarland said.

‘It wasn’t fair’ 
Turner said his bill is meant to address what he sees as inequities among Louisiana colleges in the amount of TOPS assistance available to their students.
“It wasn’t fair to give this university more and not the other one,” Turner said in an interview.  “All the institutions would be treated equally.” 
The bill is being sold as a market solution: the money follows the student, who can make a financial decision about how they would like to use it. But its critics say that choice could potentially disfavor the LSU flagship campus. 
Currently, LSU students who receive TOPS pay about $5,000 out of pocket annually, while students at Louisiana Tech University, in Turner’s district, pay $5,202. 
If Turner’s bill passes, the base-level amount, which approximately half of Louisiana TOPS students receive, would be $6,000 annually. 
TOPS Performance students, who must have at least a 3.25 GPA and a 23 ACT score, would receive $6,500. TOPS Honors students, with at least a 3.5 GPA and a 27 ACT score, would receive $9,000. The bill’s proposed TOPS Excellence award, the new highest amount, would be $11,300 per qualifying student, who must earn at least a 31 on the ACT and a 3.5 GPA. 
LSU and LSU Health New Orleans students would receive an additional $700 per year on top of whatever award level they earn. 
That would mean baseline TOPS students would pay out of pocket approximately $5,770 to attend LSU and $4,755 to attend Louisiana Tech. 

For some schools with lower tuition and fees, the new award amounts would provide some students with an excess. Under present law, that money has to be applied to students’ room and board expenses, which typically are paid out of pocket. But under a law the legislature approved last year, schools have complete autonomy to raise their fees, meaning they could increase the cost of attendance to meet the new award amount — and add to their revenues. 
Increasing the out-of-pocket costs for LSU students came as a bit of a surprise after the House Education Committee held a series of hearings over the past year in which they repeatedly questioned university administrators about why so many Louisiana students were leaving the state — and why LSU was admitting so many out-of-state students. 
Lawmakers have raised this concern so frequently over the past year that LSU launched new software, LSU Insight, designed to answer questions lawmakers frequently put to the university about where LSU students live and work. They unveiled the new program at a Senate budget hearing earlier this month and with an email to each lawmaker. 
Legislators frequently raised the issue that students in their community were being offered more money to attend Alabama or Ole Miss. They then asked why LSU couldn’t offer more to keep them home — and why LSU offered thousands of dollars in tuition assistance to out of state students at the same time. 
LSU President William Tate said the university profits only about $500 over four years from an in-state student. But even with a generous financial aid package, the margin for each out-of-state student is so high that it subsidizes the tuition assistants for two Louisiana enrollees. 
Increasing out-of-pocket costs for Louisianians at LSU could lead more students to accept generous financial aid packages at its competitors, or to go to schools like Louisiana Tech or the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. Any loss of in-state students would ultimately lead LSU to seek more out of state students, compounding the problem lawmakers have raised to them for months.

Feb. 25, 2025. Photo: Jim NeugerOngoing conflict over the state’s protections for transgender people is threatening to thwart the decades-long effort to pass an Equal Rights Amendment, which had been a major focus of late South Portland Rep. Lois Reckitt.
Though LD 260 passed the House with a majority of support, it will require two-thirds of lawmakers to back the measure for it to appear on the ballot.
And at long last, lawmakers came to a resolution as to whether the song “Welcome Home” would become the official state anthem (LD 373) after the House backed down from its support of the tune.
Other votes of note:
Following a positive vote in the Senate last week, members of the House voted 77-72 to pass LD 585, which will amend language in the Efficiency Maine Trust Act so that funds currently dedicated to subsidizing heat pumps could also be used for the state’s depleted electric vehicle incentive program.
Both chambers supported the committee recommendation against legislation that would modify the pending ban on products containing PFAS to exempt certain cookware, such as nonstick pans. During the Senate debate, Sen. Rick Bennett (R-Oxford), who opposed the bill, noted that initially the product ban, set to take effect January 2026, included all products with intentionally added PFAS but industry reps have repeatedly “sought to undo that good work.” LD 827 was rejected in the Senate 22-12 and the House 120-22.
Legislation (LD 1185) that raises the age for someone to be able to get married from 17 to 18 passed the House 93-52 and the Senate 23-11, but not without extensive debate in the House. Some critics of the measure pointed to the ability for young people to have abortions or access gender affirming care. However, Rep. Amy Kuhn (D-Falmouth) pointed out that Maine is the only New England state that hasn’t raised the age to 18 and referenced data from the Bureau of Vital Statistics which showed about half a dozen minors a year are married, almost entirely minor girls marrying older adults. That disparity raises concerns, Kuhn said, adding she wouldn’t want Maine to become an attractive place for people seeking to marry minors. 
Following the House vote last week, the Senate on Tuesday rejected a bill (19-15 vote against) that would have prohibited any state agency from providing informational or educational materials about the COVID-19 vaccine for children under 18. Health committee chair Sen. Henry Ingwersen (D-York) said while the intent of the bill may be to limit the influence of government in health decisions, he warned that if passed the impacts would be far reaching. Read more about the bill here. 
A resolve directing the Permanent Commission on the Status of Women to study the extent of workforce gender segregation in the state passed the House 82-63 and Senate 22-12. Labor committee co-chair Rep. Amy Roeder (D-Bangor), who supported the bill, said the legislation addresses the persistent issue of “occupational segregation,” which hampers true gender equity. However, critic Rep. Joseph Underwood (R-Presque Isle) said the bill represents the perfect definition of “identity politics.”

The House and Senate both voted to back the committee’s recommendation against a bill that would repeal a measure authorizing the Maine Department of Environmental Protection to potentially grant a permit for the development of an offshore wind port on Sears Island. The bill, LD 735, would also impose limits on who could propose similar legislation in the future. 
Both chambers also voted to accept the committee recommendation against LD 969, which would direct the Emergency Medical Services’ Board to adopt rules to allow municipalities to conduct or host emergency medical services licensing training. Bill sponsor Rep. Cheryl Golek (D-Harpswell) said that 15 of Maine’s counties are “ambulance deserts” and argued the bill would allow for much-needed training opportunities for volunteer medics but members of the committee said this bill is not the vehicle to solve that problem.
These bills also passed: LD 94, “An Act to Eliminate Miscarriage Reporting Requirements;” LD 415, “An Act to Support Hunger Prevention in Maine;” LD 815, “An Act to Provide Funding for Respite Care and Supplemental Services Provided by the Family Caregiver Support Program;” LD 905 “An Act to Clarify the Process to Transfer Funds Resulting from the Expiration of Unused Kilowatt-hour Credits to Be Used to Provide Assistance to Low-income Electricity Customers;” LD 1195, “An Act to Amend the Provisions of the Maine Workers’ Compensation Act of 1992 Governing Requirements for Self-insurers;” LD 678, “An Act to Provide for the 2025 and 2026 Allocations;” and LD 1240, “An Act to Align the Schedules for Climate Change Protection Plans and Grid-enhancing Technology Reviews with the Integrated Grid Planning Process,” among others.
Senate votes
Members of the Senate voted Tuesday to confirm Gigi Guyton Thompson of Peaks Island, Deborah Neuman of Hampden, and Daniel Piltch of Freeport to the Maine Retirement Savings Board.
The Senate on Thursday voted 21-13 to pass LD 143, which would provide an annual allocation of $6.18 million for family planning services, which include routine gynecological and well exams, testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections, birth control, cancer screenings, gender-affirming and behavioral health care, among others. Such funding is not used for abortions. 
Providers have said this funding is particularly crucial given years of stagnant state funding in addition to the Trump administration’s recent freeze on Title X, the country’s only federally funded program that supports family planning services. 
House votes
Members of the House on Thursday voted 74-69 in support of a proposed constitutional amendment to establish that all Maine residents have equal rights under the law. Legislators for decades have pressed for an Equal Rights Amendment to the state constitution but have so far fallen short. In order to be placed on the ballot for voters to decide on, LD 260 will ultimately need to secure two-thirds support of both chambers in reenactment votes. 
Sponsor Rep. Holly Sergent (D-York) said the U.S. Constitution “began with a narrow vision of to whom equal rights were given. But our national and state constitutions are living, evolving and expanding pronouncements of what Americans believe. Throughout our history, our constitutions have gradually redefined who is worthy of all of the rights to be bestowed and who can be excluded, who is viewed as less than human.” LD 260, she said, “sets Maine as a beacon that it proudly affirms the protections of the Maine Human Rights Act and embeds them in our constitution.”
But critics described the bill as a “wolf in sheep’s clothing” that would “hurt biological women” (Rep. Katrina Smith of Palmero and Rep. John Eder of Waterboro, respectively).
Legislators voted this week to pass LD 875, which provides $4 million dollars this year and next to fund essential services for victims of domestic violence. As an emergency measure, it needs to be enacted by two-thirds of lawmakers in order to be made available immediately. The House voted 140-0 and it now advances to the Senate.
Republican Alicia Collins of Sidney was the only representative to vote against LD 468, which would provide an additional $1.2 million per year to the Fund to Address Food Insecurity and Provide Nutritional Incentives, which supports programs that allow low-income Mainers to use their benefits to buy produce from farmers.

Thursday, DeSantis said that “this killer must and will be brought to justice to the fullest extent of the law,” calling it a “tragic attack.”
Authorities responded “almost immediately,” and “engaged, neutralized, and apprehended” the shooter, Tallahassee Police Department Chief Lawrence Revell said during a press conference Thursday afternoon, joined by officials from the FBI, FSU Police, Florida Department of Law Enforcement, and university administrators.
Tallahassee Memorial Healthcare said two patients from the shooting are expected to be discharged Friday, while three are in good condition and another remains in fair condition.

Alex Andrade, a Republican representing parts of Escambia and Santa Rosa counties, speaks to reporters on April 9, 2025. (Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)There have been additional resignations at the embattled Hope Florida Foundation, the nonprofit affiliated with Hope Florida, the initiative launched by First Lady Casey DeSantis.
Hope Florida Foundation President Joshua Hay announced Thursday that Tallahassee attorney Mohammad Jazil, who had been working with the foundation on completing its delinquent paperwork, had submitted his resignation.
“I know his name has come up regarding some things but, nonetheless, in my interactions, I’ve had pleasurable, nothing short of pleasurable experiences with him working on drafting the documents, getting actions cured, and also just trying to sort of brainstorm it on how we mitigate these instances of noncompliance going. So, thank you,” Hay said.
Hay was referencing comments made by House Health Care Budget Committee Chair Rep. Alex Andrade that he was “flabbergasted” to learn Jazil was working with the foundation to produce documents nonprofits are required to produce but that the board had not. The House has been probing the finances and other problems involving the foundation.
Jazil is a private attorney who frequently represents the administration of Gov. Ron DeSantis in litigation and also served as an attorney for the political committee Keep Florida Clean, which campaigned against last year’s pot-legalization proposed constitutional amendment. The committee was run by James Uthemeir, former chief of staff to Ron DeSantis. Uthemeir is now state attorney general.
The Hope Florida Foundation received a $10 million one-time “donation” from health care giant Centene, part of a $67 million settlement reached with the state for Medicaid overpayments. The foundation gave $5 million grants to Secure Florida’s Future, a nonprofit tied to the Florida Chamber of Commerce, and Save our Society another political committee. Within days, those groups made contributions to keep Florida Clean.
Hay announced Jazil’s resignation during the second part of a virtual Hope Florida Foundation board of directors meeting. He also announced the resignation of Jake Farmer from the board during the first part of the virtual meeting. Jazil and Farmer’s resignations followed news that Hope Florida director Erik Dellenback is stepping down in May.
The board’s virtual meeting was cut short  after members of the public participating posted images of Nazi symbols and pornography as well as racial slurs. Unable to control the flow of images and sounds being shared, the board recessed for several hours before reconvening.
Hay said during the second part of the meeting that he would discuss with the foundation’s accounting firm whether there was any “illicit use of funds” and, if so, look at a potential “clawback” of those funds. 
Before the forced meeting recess, Andrade told the board its nonprofit status was in jeopardy because 80% of all the funds the it had disbursed were for political purposes. “I believe that will jeopardize your 501(c)(3) status if you as the board do not take the proper steps to recoup those funds,” the Pensacola legislator told the group.

(Maskot/Getty Images)Headphones on and intently staring at his screen, Hayden sat at his table reading about ice cream. He was totally engrossed in the test’s content, his lips moving  silently with the narrator’s voice.
Some of my 5th graders  sat at single desks to better focus as they read, others wore unplugged headphones to block out noise, and still others like Hayden readied their text-to-speech (TTS) settings on their devices to begin their read-along sessions.
Each student had the tools and options they needed to be successful in this most important task: reading.
When I walked by to check on Hayden, he gave me a thumbs up as he began answering explicit and inferential questions, a tough skill for any 5th grader.
Students like Hayden with learning differences make up about 23% of all students in Arkansas. Once they’ve put in the work to learn how to use tools like TTS, the results are remarkable.
Texthelp tools like Read&Write and Equatio, which are  provided by the Arkansas Department of Education’s Division of Elementary and Secondary Education, help bridge the learning and literacy gaps for  students in grades 3-12.
Research shows that students with learning differences demonstrate increased comprehension scores when using text-to-speech technology on reading tests. This includes students with a range of learning differences, including dyslexia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism and vision impairment.
The Arkansas Teaching, Learning & Assessment System (ATLAS), which is administered each spring, was designed to assess students on state standards for math, science, reading, language, and writing.
Cohorts of teachers vetted the assessment prior to its adoption in the 2023-24 academic year to ensure its alignment with Arkansas standards and rigor in the question types. However, assistive technology that is part of daily instruction in a classroom like mine is not allowed on state testing for students on Individualized Education Plans (IEPs) like Hayden.
As of 2023, 30 states allow for text-to-speech access on state testing for students with documented disabilities who use such  resources in their daily learning. Arkansas should join these states so every student has the opportunity to consistently use the same assistive technology across their daily tasks and the state test that measures what they know and can do.
Providing this crucial learning tool to Arkansas students on the ATLAS test would boost their reading confidence and reduce stress associated with high-stakes testing. For example, one of my students uses speech-to-text to capture his ideas on longer writing assignments, thereby overcoming the negative impacts of dysgraphia, a neurological condition in which someone has difficulty turning their thoughts into written language. He is able to bridge this neurological barrier and successfully express himself.
Students like Hayden find success in my classroom by leveraging the tools and resources available to them, which rewards  their effort and fuels their desire to succeed. By removing the barrier for Hayden to decode words, I can evaluate what he comprehends in the writing he produces and adjust my instruction accordingly. I can also support Hayden  in improving his decoding skills through individualized reading interventions, so that he eventually won’t  need the text-to-speech tool.
Having consistency in students’ use of assistive technology also helps teachers like me, who rely on assessment data to adjust instruction and implement interventions and supports. I spend time using this data to understand the strengths and weaknesses of incoming students each fall.
If TTS is allowed on state testing, we can ensure our instructional shifts are effective and efficient from year to year.
With the support of TTS, Hayden is growing more and more confident and is able to answer complex questions at grade level. All students should have the opportunity to demonstrate their learning in a way that does not create feelings of inadequacy and failure.  Giving students access to  these tools on state tests would empower them and help them  reach their full potential.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Student-with-headphones-Getty-041825-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-04-18 14:10:27.278002

Avelo announced earlier this month the airline has signed a partnership for a long-term charter program with ICE.
The airline will open a base at Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport (AZA) in Arizona for the ICE operations beginning May 12, according to the airline. Flights will be both domestic and international to support the deportation efforts, which Avelo crews will carry out via three dedicated Boeing 737-800 aircrafts.
These charter flights will not include commercial passengers.
“We realize this is a sensitive and complicated topic,” Avelo Airlines Founder and CEO Andrew Levy said. “We also flew these charters under the Biden administration. Regardless of the administration or party affiliation, as a U.S. flag carrier when our country calls and requests assistance our practice is to say yes.”
It’s a move that’s lead to backlash and protests. More than 30,000 people have signed a petition started last week by the New Haven Immigrants Coalition in Connecticut. Tweed-New Haven Regional Airport (HVN) is the airline’s largest operating base.
In the aviation industry, a “base” is an airport at which an airline permanently houses aircraft and crew and operates routes. Low-cost carriers like Avelo tend to operate with a “point-to-point” network with bases, often at smaller airports to reduce costs.
A “hub” has more to do with an airline’s style of operations, as hub airports in the “hub-and-spoke” model are where airlines choose to connect passengers through — more common with full-service, legacy carriers and major airports.
Avelo’s three operating bases in North Carolina — located at Raleigh-Durham International Airport (RDU), Concord-Padgett Regional Airport (USA) near Charlotte, and Wilmington International Airport (ILM) — will continue to be used strictly for commercial travel, according to the airline. The agreement with ICE will not directly affect operations in North Carolina.
The airline, which had previous incarnations as charter carriers known as “Casino Express” and “Xtra Airways” was rechristened as Avelo in 2021.
Nikki Marín Baena, co-founder and co-director of the immigrant rights advocacy group Siembra NC, said the partnership could make immigrants question whether they’re safe in North Carolina.
“It just adds to that sense of stress and the sense of fear and not knowing you know what’s going to come tomorrow,” she said.
Spanish-language media outlets have covered the agreement, leading to more worries for Latino immigrants, according to Baena.
Between the three airports across the state, Avelo has plans to operate flights for more than two dozen routes from North Carolina. New additions would connect the airports with locations in Michigan, New York, and the Bahamas.
Media teams for the North Carolina airports redirected NC Newsline to Avelo.
“With this, Avelo will open a base at AZA with Avelo pilots, flight attendants and aircraft technicians, as well as appropriate local leaders. We expect to begin hiring locally for these positions immediately. Current Avelo Crewmembers (employees) will have the first option to transfer to our new AZA base,” a spokesperson for Avelo told NC Newsline in a statement.
The airline did not indicate whether any crew members from North Carolina would move to the Arizona base.
Avelo recently cancelled six flights out of Concord, WCNC reported on Friday, due to “poor performance and low bookings.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2152058571-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-18 13:13:12.617514

(Spencer Platt/Getty Images)TOPEKA — Investors watching the stock market jump up and down more times than a 6-month-old Lab puppy in recent weeks were able to take a breath as markets closed for Good Friday.
But one day off doesn’t make up for the stress and uncertainty and expectations of more market chaos next week. Investment experts from American Century Investments, which manages the Kansas 529 Plan, offer advice heard during past market downturns — diversify.
“The only or best defense in volatile economic and market environments like this is diversification,” said Rich Weiss, senior vice president and chief investment officer, multi-asset strategies, at American Century Investments. “You never know where the ball is going to land and which investments get favored or which suffer. You know, the markets hate uncertainty. It’s anathema to the market more than anything, and this is toxic uncertainty, which is a term I borrowed from Scott Galloway.”
Weiss, who brings a dry wit to talking about investment strategies and what’s happening in the volatile stock market, offered his assessment of what the country will see with the impacts of on-again, off-again tariffs.
“Externalities, or these shocks to the market, whether they’re acts of God or acts of man — COVID, earthquakes, wars etc. — these things happen on occasion,” he said. “They’re not forecastable, necessarily, although in this particular case a lot of the volatility could properly be ascribed to the new administration. The uncertainty, specifically in this case, is really on essentially the president himself and his close advisors. And it’s not necessarily the tariff program, but it’s the process by which they’re implementing it. I hesitate to call it trade policy, because that word ‘policy’ lends a degree of credibility or validity to it, which it doesn’t seem to have. It seems a little more capricious at times.”

Market expectations uncertain
Weiss said in his 40 years in the investment world, he’s never seen the Federal Reserve Board of Governors use the term “placeholder” in their minutes.
“The Fed Governors issue forecasts as part of their job for the economy, inflation, etc.,” Weiss said. “Several of the Fed governors used the word or term — we’re going to issue a ‘placeholder’ for GDP (Gross Domestic Product) growth — because even they have no idea which way this thing is going. So where do we land? We have an 85% probability right now of a slowdown or a recession. We’ve lumped them all together, so it’s not necessarily a recession but clearly an economic slowdown. I think you’re seeing that already in the numbers.”
It’s the uncertainty that makes it hard to forecast. Even United Airlines, Weiss said, came out and said it was issuing two forecasts, something rarely seen.
“Which is a place a lot of us are at because it’s so dependent on the magnitude and duration of the tariff program, and whether that indeed pushes us into a full-blown trade war with China or even some of our other allies,” he said.
Right now, many forecasters are predicting a recession, a prolonged economic decline.
 
  Evan Mayhew, vice president, national accounts, at American Century Investments, said 529 accounts offer flexibility to adapt for volatile markets. (Submitted)
529 plans offer flexibility
It’s difficult to give general advice in the current situation, but there are a couple of good rules to follow, said Weiss and Evan Mayhew, vice president, national accounts. Mayhew manages the Kansas 529 Plan.
Understanding your own tolerance for risk is important, and then diversification of stocks, bonds and other assets mean that if the market moves down in one of those areas, other investments can stabilize accounts, both said. Weiss said to consider geographical diversification, as some international markets are stronger than the U.S. market right now.
The Kansas 529 Plan, which is an investment tool to save for children’s college education, has become more flexible over the years, allowing investors to choose their level of risk, among other things, Mayhew said.
“Originally, they were set up just for college savings,” he said. “Now there’s the option for you to use it on K through 12, also for post secondary. There’s a new provision that went into effect last year that allows unused funds to be rolled into a Roth IRA. So really, it’s identifying what’s the objective of those goals and then investing appropriately.”
If 529 participants are looking at using funds to pay for kindergarten through 12th-grade educational costs, they would probably be more conservative, Mayhew said, because of a close timeframe.
“If you’ve got a longer runway, then look at something potentially more aggressive that you’re comfortable with,” he said. “We have multiple investment options.”
During economic downturns in the past, Mayhew said most clients continue their automatic payments to their 529 accounts. They typically see only a slight pull-back that corresponds to market volatility.
“We’re looking at reports on a weekly basis of investor behavior and actually over the last week, our purchases and new accounts are actually on par with last year,” he said.
Looking back at other economic downturns, such as in 2008, Mayhew said they tend to see more of a slowdown in lump-sum payments, rather than in automatic investments.
Weiss said there is a risk of “abandonment” of accounts when the economy is down, meaning customers take their money out. Sometimes they do it voluntarily, but sometimes job losses and other economic factors contribute to that decision.
 
Impossible to predict
Whether investing in a 529 Plan, mutual funds or other vehicles, the market right now is impossible to predict, Weiss said.
“It’s fraught with peril if you rush to sell or, on the other hand, buy on the dips because you could potentially catch a falling knife, as they say, by doing that,” he said. “Examine your overall asset allocation, making sure it’s still roughly in line with your specific long-term goals and objectives. These are the tried and true principles of investing. We’re not knee-jerk reacting to daily movements.”
Risk, Weiss said, is not something to consider after the markets are in a fall.
“Risk is not something you react to after the fact,” he said. “It’s something you should address up front before you ever make your first investment to make sure that you can, for example, tolerate a 20, 30, 40% loss in stocks in the short term.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/stockmarket-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-18 14:10:27.278002

As defined in the 2018 Farm Bill, the term “hemp” is a cannabis plant with a no more than 0.3% concentration of the chemical that results in a high, known as THC.
According to the report,  which was released on Thursday, South Dakota farmers planted 3,900 acres of hemp – a 22% increase from 2023. They harvested 3,700 acres, up 27.6%. Most of that growth came from hemp grown for fiber, a product for which South Dakota reigns as the nation’s top supplier.
Texas farmers planted 4,900 acres, a 1,860% increase from last year. Only 1,500 acres of that was harvested, though.
Former Democratic state lawmaker Oren Lesmeister, a rancher from Parade, championed the bills that created South Dakota’s hemp industry. He now serves on the South Dakota Industrial Hemp Association’s board of directors. He said Texas’ numbers mean little if farmers do not have a place to process their hemp. 
“We’re kicking a– and taking names when it comes to production and processing,” Lesmeister said. 
South Dakota leads the nation in hemp processing and the production of hemp fiber, according to the report.  
There were 13.6 million pounds of hemp harvested for fiber in South Dakota last year. That’s a 14% decrease, even as the number of acres harvested,  3,550, increased by 22%. Every harvested pound was processed, according to the report. About 23% of the 59 million pounds of hemp processed in the U.S. was processed in South Dakota
The mismatch between pounds harvested and acres planted is the result of lower per-acre yields for farmers. The average yield in the state dropped sharply by 30% in 2024, to 3,840 pounds per acre. Despite that, the value of South Dakota’s fiber hemp climbed to $3.54 million, a 50% year-over-year increase, buoyed by a 73% rise in price per pound.

(Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector) Gidley's bill that would require the Ten Commandments to be displayed in public K-12 schools passed the House on April 17, 2025.The Alabama House of Representatives Thursday passed a bill requiring public K-12 schools to display the Ten Commandments.
HB 178, sponsored by Rep. Mark Gidley, R-Hokes Bluff, passed the chamber 88-11. It requires schools to display the Ten Commandments in an entry way; a common area  an entry way or common areas like cafeterias, and in classrooms where the history of the United States is taught. The displays must be at least 11-by-14 inches in size and include text saying the commandments are “a key part of the Judeo-Christian religious and moral tradition that shaped Western Civilization and ultimately the founding of the United States,” as well as other arguments claiming they are foundational texts.

Displays would be made based on the availability of donations for them.

Gidley, a pastor, said in the House Thursday that  the country was founded on the principles of the Hebrew-derevied text, which makes it historical.
“This is about returning foundational principles to schools to be taught,” he said.
Alabama voters in 2018 approved a constitutional amendment allowing the Ten Commandments to be displayed on public property but not mandating such displays. Federal courts have allowed the displays of the Ten Commandments in historical contexts in schools but not as religious or moral displays. Local school boards do not have to use their state-allocated funds to purchase a poster to display, Gidley said. 
The legislation does not list any sanctions for schools that do not comply.
Louisiana passed similar legislation in 2024, but a federal district court ruled it unconstitutional in November, citing the separation of church and state. Louisiana’s law, unlike Gidley’s, required the Ten Commandments to be displayed in every classroom. 
Rep. Patrick Sellers, D-Pleasant Grove, was the only Democrat to support the legislation. Sellers, pastor of Mount Zion Missionary Baptist Church in Birmingham, said the values in the Ten Commandments should be in schools.
“These are principles that our children need, and even if it’s just looking at it on the wall to remind them of what they are and how they should live from day to day,” Sellers said. “That’s what’s missing in our schools. That’s what’s missing in our homes, that’s what’s missing in our families.”
Rep. Danny Garrett, R-Trussville, supported the legislation, but said putting the Ten Commandments in schools would not make more Christians. 
“As a Christian, we should be salt and light in the world. And I think that happens through relationships,” Garrett said. “But legislative mandates are not going to renew minds and change hearts.”
Rep. Marilyn Lands, D-Huntsville, said some of the commandments may not be age appropriate for young school children. 
“I think that the 10 commandments have their place, but I don’t know that we need to mandate that they be in our schools,” she said. “I think we teach our children well in our homes, and I think we have churches to teach them, but I’m not sure that they belong in our schools.”
Rep. Mary Moore, D-Birmingham, said putting the Christian text in schools would disrespect other religions. 
“All I am saying is there are other faiths, those people deserve to practice whatever faith you practice,” Moore said.
The bill moves to the Senate. Sen. Keith Kelley, R-Anniston, has a companion bill that was approved by the Senate Education Policy Committee last week.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-04-18 16:23:53+00:00,CT Mirror,"Trump is shifting cybersecurity to the states, but many aren’t prepared",Madyson Fitzgerald | Stateline,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/18/trump-cybersecurity-states/,CT passed a law to secure health care facilities from cyberattacks by having hospitals create plans or by supporting technology investment.,"For the first half of his career in law enforcement, working as a police officer in South Florida, Chase Fopiano did not think cyberattacks on police agencies were a serious threat.Many of his law enforcement colleagues were under the same impression — that since they were the most likely to investigate the attacks, there was no way cybercriminals would go after them.By about 2015, as technology advanced and hackers became more creative, that changed, Fopiano said. Now, from the U.S. Secret Service to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, there are thousands of attempts to compromise networks or organizations every day, he said.“A lot of those [attempts] are toward government or even police, especially because they know that we’re not as prepared as we should be,” said Fopiano, who now oversees cybersecurity as part of a regional task force.Spanning health care facilities to court systems, states and local communities are facing a rise in cyberthreats. They include threats to critical infrastructure, increased activity from foreign actors, continued ransomware attacks and more, according to a recent report from the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center.But President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order shifting some of the responsibility from the federal government to states and localities to improve their infrastructure to address risks, including cybercrimes. And federal cuts have reduced resources for state and local officials, including a cybersecurity grant program and a key cybersecurity agency.States and localities are taking steps to address the problems, such as establishing new penalties for tampering with critical infrastructure, centralizing state IT personnel and setting standards in areas from elections to health care.But the Trump order and federal funding cuts, a shortage of IT experts at the local level and an overall lack of preparedness could weaken their efforts.In December, a major cyberattack forced Rhode Island to take down its online portal used by residents to obtain Medicaid benefits and SNAP, commonly known as food stamps. The personal data stolen from Rhode Island’s public benefits network — including Social Security numbers and banking information — was later found on the dark web.In February, a “sophisticated cyberattack” hit the office of Virginia Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares, which led agency officials to shut down computer systems and resort to paper court filings.Last week, hackers also breached the computer network of the Fall River School District in Massachusetts. The school district is working with third-party experts and law enforcement to determine if anyone’s personal information was targeted, according to MassLive.In 2023, of the 48 states that participated in the Nationwide Cybersecurity Review, a voluntary self-assessment conducted by federal agencies that examines how well governments are prepared to respond to cyberattacks, only 22 states reached or surpassed the recommended levels of security in their systems.Cybersecurity has become increasingly important over time because more government services and data are digitized, said Samir Jain, the vice president of policy at the Center for Democracy & Technology, a nonprofit that advocates for digital rights and freedom of expression.But a national shortage of people with that expertise — especially at the local level — creates a challenge.“The federal government has traditionally played at least some role in trying to fill some of those gaps,” Jain said. “And so the notion that the federal government could just withdraw and expect states and localities to step in is just not realistic.”Local governments and law enforcement agencies also have other priorities, Fopiano said. The police need cars, guns, shields and other resources that generally take precedence over cybersecurity.Today, Fopiano is the cybersecurity chair of the Southeast Regional Domestic Security Task Force in Florida, overseeing cyber activity from South Florida to the Florida Keys. The attacks continue to rise, he said.“Terrorist groups are getting into cybercrime, cartels are getting into cybercrime, you have kids just learning about hacking and just fooling around,” he said. “The audience of who’s doing it has definitely expanded and led to that rise in overall cybercrime.” Cuts to federal resources In 2022, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced a first-of-its-kind cybersecurity grant program, providing more than $1 billion in funding for states, localities, tribes and territories to address cybersecurity risks and threats.The State and Local Cybersecurity Grant Program, created under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, awarded $279 million to states and localities in fiscal year 2024. The Tribal Cybersecurity Grant Program awarded another $18 million for tribes in its first year.But the grant program is set to expire in September, with no current plans to renew it. At a hearing this month, several state and local officials urged Congress to reauthorize the program. But U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who refused the federal aid during her tenure as governor of South Dakota, questioned the program’s efficacy.The Trump administration is also cutting as many as 1,300 employees from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, which administers the grants alongside the Federal Emergency Management Agency.The program has allowed states to assess the security of their networks, develop cybersecurity training, implement multi-factor authentication features — which requires users to provide more than one form of verification to access a site or service — and much more, said Alex Whitaker, the director of government affairs at the National Association of State Chief Information Officers.“This has been a really great program because we’re seeing a lot of great evidence for how states and their counterparts in local government are improving their cyber defenses,” Whitaker said.Counties also rely on a number of federal resources to strengthen their defenses, including services provided by CISA, said Rita Reynolds, the chief information officer at the National Association of Counties and managing director for County Tech Xchange. NACo is an organization that represents county governments across the United States.The Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center, for instance — a key collaboration between CISA and the Center for Internet Security to help state and local governments with cybersecurity operations — lost some of its federal funding for certain programs last month, Reynolds said.In trying to keep up with emerging threats, counties are still trying to find resources to help them implement multi-factor authentication, convert government pages to “.gov” domains and other methods of protecting their infrastructure, she said.“Are counties prepared?” Reynolds asked. “I would say they’re not as prepared as they’d like to be. And in some cases, they are looking at how to strategically approach this now that resources are disappearing.”In a statement, CISA spokesperson Jared Auchey said Trump’s executive order empowers state and local governments “to make risk-informed decisions and investments to improve their preparedness.” The agency will work with state and local officials to ensure they have the information and support they need, Auchey added. Lawmakers step up In 2024, 33 states adopted resolutions or enacted legislation regarding cybersecurity, according to a database from the National Conference of State Legislatures, a nonpartisan public officials’ association.Many of those measures sought to protect states’ critical infrastructure, including water systems, government services, health care and more. Florida, Louisiana, West Virginia and other states created new criminal and civil penalties for people who attempt to tamper with critical infrastructure.In Minnesota and Washington state, lawmakers passed measures allowing or requiring state and local governments to invest in cybersecurity protections related to election administration. Connecticut and Florida also passed legislation to secure health care facilities from cyberattacks by having hospitals create plans or by supporting investments in new technologies.Other states are looking for solutions from outside vendors. South Dakota has set aside $7 million for a company to examine local governments for vulnerabilities to hackers.With attacks occurring at every level of government, New Mexico Democratic state Sen. Michael Padilla, the Senate majority whip, sponsored legislation in 2023 to create the state’s office of cybersecurity. As chair of the Senate Science, Technology and Telecommunications Committee for 10 years, he plays a significant role in most of the state’s cybersecurity legislation.Through the committee’s work, Padilla says New Mexico is in good shape to fend off cyberattacks — and the state’s cities and counties are joining in.“I think New Mexico is in a very good position because what we decided to do by creating that office is to ensure that any transactions that occur with state government here [in New Mexico] have to meet a minimum set of security standards,” he said.In Indiana, Republican state Sen. Liz Brown filed legislation that would encourage state agencies and groups to develop cybersecurity policies. The bill was approved by both chambers, with the Senate agreeing to changes sent from the House.“You have to protect your infrastructure,” Brown said. “We don’t want utility systems to be shut down. We don’t want wastewater or freshwater treatment plants or even the water supply being contaminated or harmed in some way. Our systems all have backups, but even so, we know there are bad actors.”Some states are also preparing to reshuffle their offices or create new ones to centralize their cybersecurity efforts. Arkansas, for example, enacted legislation this month to create a new state cybersecurity office, which will monitor the state’s computer networks and respond to cyberthreats.In Alabama, rather than having information technology people scattered throughout the government, Republican state Rep. Mike Shaw wants cybersecurity personnel centrally managed.Shaw’s legislation, which passed the House and is currently in the Senate, would give the Alabama Office of Information Technology central authority to maintain the needs of all of the state’s departments.The centralization would make it easier to pursue cybersecurity initiatives in the future, Shaw said.“The federal government is really big, and it’s really hard to come up with a one-size-fits-all solution for things like cybersecurity, data privacy and technology in general,” Shaw said. “So, in some sense, it’s good that the states are coming up with their own.”Stateline reporter Madyson Fitzgerald can be reached at mfitzgerald@stateline.org.

CHICAGO — Federal agents asked state Sen. Emil Jones III to wear a wire against a politically connected hospital CEO and his fellow lawmakers in Springfield, the senator testified Thursday in his own defense at his federal corruption trial.

Jones, D-Chicago, said he was prepared to cooperate with the FBI in a widespread investigation into public corruption in Illinois and attended a handful of meetings with agents and prosecutors with the intent to do so before he ultimately was charged in September 2022.

But the agents, Jones said, asked him “to do things that I was not willing to do” — including wearing a wire. The senator struggled to articulate the other requests the agents made, even after U.S. District Judge Andrea Wood stepped in to restate his attorney’s question.

“Wearing a wire and — I don’t know how to describe it, judge,” Jones said.

The senator took the witness stand for a third day Thursday in his trial over alleged bribes he agreed to take from a red-light camera entrepreneur-turned-FBI witness in exchange for limiting legislation he had proposed that worried the red-light camera industry — and lying to agents about it.

Not too long into questioning from his own attorney, Jones’ testimony was halted for more than an hour after he named Tim Egan, the CEO of Chicago’s Roseland Hospital in Jones’ South Side District, as someone the feds wanted him to help investigate.

""Agent (Timothy) O’Brien basically instructed me that he wanted me to wear a wire on Tim Egan and he wanted me to come up with a scenario to entrap Tim Egan,” Jones said.

Prosecutors immediately objected, which was followed by a lengthy sidebar discussion between Wood and attorneys on both sides. The arguments were intentionally masked by loud white noise in the courtroom, but Wood ultimately told jurors to disregard Jones’ answer and the senator’s lawyer, Vic Henderson, told his client to refrain from “naming names.”

Egan, who’s spent nearly a decade as a Cook County Democratic Party committeeman, has not been charged with any crimes. But Roseland Hospital has been mentioned several times throughout the trial.

Jones apparently made unsuccessful efforts to get his former intern hired there in the summer of 2019, though the senator instead connected him with Omar Maani, a co-founder of Chicago-based red-light camera company SafeSpeed. Maani, who was cooperating with the government, hired the former intern, Christopher Katz, which the feds say constituted part of a bribe.

Roseland Hospital also threw Jones an annual campaign fundraiser, which in 2019 was scheduled for August at a White Sox game. With his FBI-provided recording devices rolling during a dinner the month before, Maani offered Jones a contribution for the event. Eventually, the senator named a number — “five grand” — which became the other purported bribe Jones allegedly agreed to.

Prosecutors say it doesn’t matter that Maani never gave Jones any money or that Jones never amended his legislation in the way Maani wanted him to, the agreement is what counts.

But Jones said that while he was suspicious of Maani and his “used-car salesman” vibe, he fully believed that he and Maani never made an agreement. He said the same to FBI agents when they knocked on his door the morning of Sept. 24, 2019, who told him they were investigating his colleague, then-state Sen. Martin Sandoval, D-Chicago, who’d connected him to Maani earlier that summer.

Five months later, however, Jones’ attorney received a letter from the U.S. Attorney’s office informing him that charges were imminent. In February 2019, Jones sat down with the feds twice within the span of a week. That’s when he was asked to wear a wire on Egan after identifying different people in photos and initialing them.

They also showed Jones “snippets” of Maani’s secretly recorded videos, he said.

But then the COVID-19 pandemic threw a wrench into Jones’s plans for cooperating with the government. On Thursday, the senator noted he wasn’t “able to go to restaurants and eat dinner with folks,” which limited opportunities for covert FBI operations.

The next time Jones met with FBI agents was in September 2021, when he and his then-lawyer were allowed to listen to all of the recordings Maani had made in addition to tape of the FBI agents’ interview with Jones on which the feds allege the senator lied.

Jones on Thursday said he left that meeting knowing “I was gonna fight these charges,” which were still a year away from being filed. The senator said that after spending eight or so hours listening to the tapes, he “felt the government was misleading me” in the February 2020 meeting when they played selected portions of the recordings.

""You hear Omar basically trying to set me up,” Jones said of Maani. “And you hear me pushing back on him, trying to change the subject, all that.”

Over the next 12 months, Jones met with the feds three more times. The senator testified that the FBI was still hoping he’d agree to wear a wire during both a February 2022 Zoom videoconference and a downtown Chicago meeting in June of that year.

Asked Thursday why he kept attending the meetings even though he’d already decided to fight the charges, Jones said he did so at the direction of his lawyer — and because he was worried the feds would charge him before the November 2022 election, though he ran unopposed.

“Did you expect to hear anything different?” his lawyer Henderson asked.

""Only thing I did hear were things that I was not willing to do,” Jones said. “Wear wires on my colleagues.”

“And why were you not willing to wear a wire?” Henderson asked.

Jones exhaled deeply before answering.

“Because — if,” he said before sighing again. “I don’t know how to answer that question.”

Feds persist in their pursuit of Jones

The senator met with the feds one final time in August 2022 in a brief meeting in which he was informed the government was moving forward with plans to charge him.

Jones was charged on three counts the following month, but in November of that year, he was reelected to a four-year term in the General Assembly.

The senator was stripped of his committee chairmanship and leadership roles in the Senate but has refused to step down in the last 2 ½ years. The last sitting lawmaker who took his federal corruption case to trial was then-state Rep. Derrick Smith, D-Chicago, in 2014. And the last state official to take the witness stand at their own trial was then-state Rep. Patricia Bailey, D-Chicago, in 2005. Both were convicted.

Deciding to testify in his own defense was a risky move, as it opened Jones up to grueling cross-examination from prosecutors. Assistant U.S. Attorney Tiffany Ardam on Thursday attempted over and over to impeach the senator’s prior testimony, pointing out inconsistencies between the previously played secret recordings and what Jones told the jury.

Ardam questioned why Jones would portray what the government showed to him at one of the February 2020 meetings as “information shared with you” and act as if the “snippets” the agents showed were a surprise.

“The truth is you were at all of these meetings,” Ardam said.

“Yes,” Jones said.

“So you know everything that was said,” Ardam said.

“I can’t remember everything that was said,” Jones replied.

At one of those February 2020 meetings, prosecutors and one of the case agents have already told the jury that Jones acknowledged making an agreement with Maani, contrary to what he told the FBI in September 2019.

The senator earlier Thursday told his own attorney a few different times that he never signed or initialed a document indicating that he was recanting his previous statements.

But Ardam waded into that territory herself.

“And you acknowledged you made a deal with Omar Maani,” she said.

“No. I. Did. Not,” Jones answered.

Ardam cast doubt on Jones’ earlier explanation on the witness stand that even though Maani made him “uncomfortable,” he still met with him because he was following a directive from Sandoval. As chair of the Senate Transportation committee, Sandoval had blocked Jones’ bill that called for a study of red-light camera systems across the state.

Jones had called Sandoval “intimidating” and “a bully” — but Ardam pointed out that in the recording of the dinner where between him, Sandoval and Maani at a suburban steakhouse in June 2025, they were cracking jokes and seemed relaxed.

""You were only intimidated by him at times?” Ardam asked.

""Yes,” Jones answered.

Later, Ardam asked whether Jones had trepidation about dealing with Sandoval in other ways.

“I never said I was scared of Senator Sandoval,” Jones said. “I said he could be a bully at times and he could be intimidating. I was never scared of him.”

Ardam also pointed out that Jones’ contention earlier in his testimony that Sandoval was arrested on Sept. 24, 2019, wasn’t true; in fact, federal agents had executed search warrants on his home and offices. He began cooperating and later pleaded guilty to bribery and tax fraud charges.

Jones held to his repeated claim, seemingly confused by her questions.

“And you know he’s no longer with us, he’s deceased,” Ardam said. “So you know that he can’t dispute anything you're saying today?”

“Yes,” Jones replied.

But Ardam had some mixups of her own. To catch Jones in a lie over his claim Wednesday that he’d never had one of his bills die on the Senate floor, the prosecutor pointed out that in 2019, roughly 30 bills that Jones had introduced died at the end of session. As Jones attempted to tell her, that’s different than the rare and fairly embarrassing scenario in which a senator allows for a bill to be called for a vote only to see it fail to garner the minimum number of votes for passage.

Ardam also spent time suggesting that Jones benefitted from nepotism as his father, Emil Jones Jr., had been a longtime legislator and served as president of the Illinois Senate from 2003 until 2009.

“You were elected in 2008?” Ardam asked, after reminding the jury of Jones’ testimony that “ever since I was a child,” he’d wanted to be a state senator like his father.

“Yes,” Jones said.

“You didn’t tell the jury how that happened, did you?” Ardam said, before falsely asserting that Jones was appointed to his father’s seat when the elder Jones announced his retirement in August 2008.

“Well I replaced him on the ballot,” the senator explained.

“So somebody had to replace him in the Senate,” Ardam said. “Were you appointed to fill your father’s seat from August 2008 to November 2008?”

“No,” Jones said.

“You were not?” Ardam asked skeptically.

Jones and his father caught heat when the Senate president withdrew from the ballot after he’d won his 2008 primary election and later withdrew from the ballot and advocated for his son to replace him. But Jones III wasn’t sworn in to the Senate until January 2009 after his father’s term officially ended.

After acknowledging to jurors that trial has stretched longer than originally planned, Judge Wood canceled trial on Good Friday while the attorneys work through final jury instructions. Closing arguments are scheduled for Monday.

Juan Carlos Lopez-Gomez held his mother in a tight embrace and wept following his release from the Leon County Jail Thursday evening, where the U.S. citizen was held after his arrest for illegally entering Florida as an “unauthorized alien.”
An official with Homeland Security Investigations in Tallahassee took Lopez-Gomez, a 20-year-old born in Georgia, to a Wendy’s near the jail, where he reunited with his mother after spending more than 24 hours under arrest following a traffic stop in which he was a passenger.
Lopez-Gomez appeared shellshocked and spoke quietly as he discussed what happened when a Florida Highway Patrol trooper pulled over the car he was in on his way to work from Cairo, Georgia, to Tallahassee. The trooper made the traffic stop because the driver was going 78 mph in a 65 mph zone, according to the arrest report.
“I feel fine leaving that place, I felt bad in there. They didn’t give us anything to eat all day yesterday,” he told the Florida Phoenix in Spanish. He added that he had asked the trooper who made the arrest why he was being taken into custody, because he was a U.S. citizen.
His mother, also in Spanish, said the days ahead will be tough for the family and worries that Lopez-Gomez and his sisters will live in fear of deportation despite having been born in the country. She told the Phoenix she planned to sue over her son’s arrest.
“I don’t have a way to pay all the people who are helping us. People from other states have called us, and we don’t have a way to pay them; we can only thank them,” Gomez-Perez said.
The pair didn’t reunite until the evening, after Lopez-Gomez’s first court appearance earlier in the day. Leon County Judge LaShawn Riggans ruled Thursday morning that she lacked jurisdiction to release him because U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement had formally asked the jail to hold him for 48 hours.
After Riggans’ inspection of his Social Security card and birth certificate, which an advocate waved in the courtroom, the judge said she found no probable cause for the charge.
“In looking at it, and feeling it, and holding it up to the light, the court can clearly see the watermark to show that this is indeed an authentic document,” Riggans said.
The arrest record the trooper filed states that Lopez-Gomez had said he was in the country illegally but that he had handed over his ID. There was no mention of the Social Security card on the arrest report. However, Lopez-Gomez told the Phoenix he had shown the trooper a copy of his Social Security card and Georgia state ID.
The HSI agent who took Lopez-Gomez to Wendy’s directed questions to a spokesperson, who didn’t respond to the Phoenix’s request for comment or questions as of this publication.

After the reunion with his mom, Lopez-Gomez returned to the parking lot of the jail, where 30 protesters had been demanding his release. They met him with cheers and hugs.
Lopez-Gomez will have to return to the Leon County Courthouse on May 6. He was charged under a recently passed law that a federal judge has temporarily barred the state from enforcing, further calling into question the validity of his arrest, the charge, and detention.
Gov. Ron DeSantis signed SB 4-C into law on Feb. 14, and U.S. District Court Judge Kathleen Williams blocked its enforcement on April 4.
The law makes it a misdemeanor for undocumented immigrants over age 18 to “knowingly” enter Florida “after entering the United States by eluding or avoiding examination or inspection by immigration officers.”
Two other men who were in the car with Lopez-Gomez, the driver and another passenger, also made their first appearances on the same charge on Thursday. The driver was also charged with driving without a license.

(Photo by Nancy Lavin/Rhode Island Current)A national real estate company will have to pay back nearly $100,000 in fees charged to local residents who applied to live at any of its Rhode Island housing properties under a settlement announced Thursday by the Rhode Island Office of the Attorney General.
The agreement comes four months after the AG’s office sued A.R. Building Co. in state Superior Court, alleging the Philadelphia company violated consumer protection laws by forcing prospective tenants to pay “excessive” application and screening fees. 
The state’s December lawsuit alleged the company violated Rhode Island’s Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices Act and a new state law which took effect on Jan. 1 that limits fees landlords can charge to prospective tenants. The 19-page complaint lists three anonymous consumers — identified as A, B, and C — as examples, but the AG’s office estimates nearly 400 applicants paid fees during the 13-month timeframe of the complaint, said Tim Rondeau, a spokesperson for the AG.
The state also claimed in its complaint that the company violated state and federal fair housing protections by requiring a more difficult application process for applicants with disabilities.
As part of the settlement, which resolves all components of the complaint, A.R. Building will also pay $114,750 to the state for a total monetary compensation of $213,000. And, it has agreed to stop charging application fees to residents looking to live in any of its five local housing complexes, while allowing prospective tenants to avoid screening fees by submitting their own documents as part of the application.
“We will hold accountable any entity that attempts to take advantage of consumers by implementing illegal barriers to finding a home, a practice made all the more egregious by the fact that we are in the midst of a severe housing crisis,” Attorney General Peter Neronha said in a statement. “With this settlement, not only are we returning nearly $100,000 to Rhode Island consumers, we are barring this company from further engaging in behaviors that we allege are illegal and discriminatory. We must make it easier, not harder, for people to obtain safe, affordable housing, and that’s why my Office will continue to hold accountable bad actors who place profits over people. Let this settlement serve as a warning to those who may still be engaging in illegal housing practices; we won’t stand for it, and we won’t hesitate to take further action.”
Michael Gamboli, a partner at Partridge Snow & Hahn LLP in Providence representing A.R. Building Co., did not immediately return inquiries for comment Friday.
The company owns more than 800 apartments, condominiums and townhouses across five complexes in Rhode Island: East Providence’s Kettle Point and Newport Avenue Apartments, Dowling Village in Smithfield, Highland Hills in Cumberland and Reynolds Farm in North Kingstown.
State residents who paid application or administrative fees as part of an application to any of the local properties from Jan. 1 2024 to Jan. 30, 2025, should contact the property manager where they applied to receive a refund. Applicants have until July 1 to claim their refunds; unclaimed money will be donated to the Special Olympics of Rhode Island.

States worry that an executive order and federal funding cuts could weaken their cybersecurity efforts. (Getty Images)For the first half of his career in law enforcement, working as a police officer in South Florida, Chase Fopiano did not think cyberattacks on police agencies were a serious threat.
Many of his law enforcement colleagues were under the same impression — that since they were the most likely to investigate the attacks, there was no way cybercriminals would go after them.
By about 2015, as technology advanced and hackers became more creative, that changed, Fopiano said. Now, from the U.S. Secret Service to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, there are thousands of attempts to compromise networks or organizations every day, he said.
“A lot of those [attempts] are toward government or even police, especially because they know that we’re not as prepared as we should be,” said Fopiano, who now oversees cybersecurity as part of a regional task force.
Spanning health care facilities to court systems, states and local communities are facing a rise in cyberthreats. They include threats to critical infrastructure, increased activity from foreign actors, continued ransomware attacks and more, according to a recent report from the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center.
Budget restrictions, staff issues and AI are threats to states’ cybersecurity

But President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order shifting some of the responsibility from the federal government to states and localities to improve their infrastructure to address risks, including cybercrimes. And federal cuts have reduced resources for state and local officials, including a cybersecurity grant program and a key cybersecurity agency.
States and localities are taking steps to address the problems, such as establishing new penalties for tampering with critical infrastructure, centralizing state IT personnel and setting standards in areas from elections to health care.
But the Trump order and federal funding cuts, a shortage of IT experts at the local level and an overall lack of preparedness could weaken their efforts.
In December, a major cyberattack forced Rhode Island to take down its online portal used by residents to obtain Medicaid benefits and SNAP, commonly known as food stamps. The personal data stolen from Rhode Island’s public benefits network — including Social Security numbers and banking information — was later found on the dark web.
In February, a “sophisticated cyberattack” hit the office of Virginia Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares, which led agency officials to shut down computer systems and resort to paper court filings.
Last week, hackers also breached the computer network of the Fall River School District in Massachusetts. The school district is working with third-party experts and law enforcement to determine if anyone’s personal information was targeted, according to MassLive.
In 2023, of the 48 states that participated in the Nationwide Cybersecurity Review, a voluntary self-assessment conducted by federal agencies that examines how well governments are prepared to respond to cyberattacks, only 22 states reached or surpassed the recommended levels of security in their systems.



The notion that the federal government could just withdraw and expect states and localities to step in is just not realistic.


– Samir Jain, Vice President of Policy at the Center for Democracy & Technology


Cybersecurity has become increasingly important over time because more government services and data are digitized, said Samir Jain, the vice president of policy at the Center for Democracy & Technology, a nonprofit that advocates for digital rights and freedom of expression.
But a national shortage of people with that expertise — especially at the local level — creates a challenge.
“The federal government has traditionally played at least some role in trying to fill some of those gaps,” Jain said. “And so the notion that the federal government could just withdraw and expect states and localities to step in is just not realistic.”
Local governments and law enforcement agencies also have other priorities, Fopiano said. The police need cars, guns, shields and other resources that generally take precedence over cybersecurity.
Today, Fopiano is the cybersecurity chair of the Southeast Regional Domestic Security Task Force in Florida, overseeing cyber activity from South Florida to the Florida Keys. The attacks continue to rise, he said.
“Terrorist groups are getting into cybercrime, cartels are getting into cybercrime, you have kids just learning about hacking and just fooling around,” he said. “The audience of who’s doing it has definitely expanded and led to that rise in overall cybercrime.”
Cuts to federal resources
In 2022, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced a first-of-its-kind cybersecurity grant program, providing more than $1 billion in funding for states, localities, tribes and territories to address cybersecurity risks and threats.
The State and Local Cybersecurity Grant Program, created under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, awarded $279 million to states and localities in fiscal year 2024. The Tribal Cybersecurity Grant Program awarded another $18 million for tribes in its first year.
But the grant program is set to expire in September, with no current plans to renew it. At a hearing this month, several state and local officials urged Congress to reauthorize the program. But U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who refused the federal aid during her tenure as governor of South Dakota, questioned the program’s efficacy.
The Trump administration is also cutting as many as 1,300 employees from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, which administers the grants alongside the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
Governments often struggle with massive new IT projects

The program has allowed states to assess the security of their networks, develop cybersecurity training, implement multi-factor authentication features — which requires users to provide more than one form of verification to access a site or service — and much more, said Alex Whitaker, the director of government affairs at the National Association of State Chief Information Officers.
“This has been a really great program because we’re seeing a lot of great evidence for how states and their counterparts in local government are improving their cyber defenses,” Whitaker said.
Counties also rely on a number of federal resources to strengthen their defenses, including services provided by CISA, said Rita Reynolds, the chief information officer at the National Association of Counties and managing director for County Tech Xchange. NACo is an organization that represents county governments across the United States.
The Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center, for instance — a key collaboration between CISA and the Center for Internet Security to help state and local governments with cybersecurity operations — lost some of its federal funding for certain programs last month, Reynolds said.
In trying to keep up with emerging threats, counties are still trying to find resources to help them implement multi-factor authentication, convert government pages to “.gov” domains and other methods of protecting their infrastructure, she said.
“Are counties prepared?” Reynolds asked. “I would say they’re not as prepared as they’d like to be. And in some cases, they are looking at how to strategically approach this now that resources are disappearing.”
In a statement, CISA spokesperson Jared Auchey said Trump’s executive order empowers state and local governments “to make risk-informed decisions and investments to improve their preparedness.” The agency will work with state and local officials to ensure they have the information and support they need, Auchey added.
Lawmakers step up
In 2024, 33 states adopted resolutions or enacted legislation regarding cybersecurity, according to a database from the National Conference of State Legislatures, a nonpartisan public officials’ association.
Many of those measures sought to protect states’ critical infrastructure, including water systems, government services, health care and more. Florida, Louisiana, West Virginia and other states created new criminal and civil penalties for people who attempt to tamper with critical infrastructure.
In Minnesota and Washington state, lawmakers passed measures allowing or requiring state and local governments to invest in cybersecurity protections related to election administration. Connecticut and Florida also passed legislation to secure health care facilities from cyberattacks by having hospitals create plans or by supporting investments in new technologies.
Other states are looking for solutions from outside vendors. South Dakota has set aside $7 million for a company to examine local governments for vulnerabilities to hackers.
Rhode Island state government hit by major cyberattack

With attacks occurring at every level of government, New Mexico Democratic state Sen. Michael Padilla, the Senate majority whip, sponsored legislation in 2023 to create the state’s office of cybersecurity. As chair of the Senate Science, Technology and Telecommunications Committee for 10 years, he plays a significant role in most of the state’s cybersecurity legislation.
Through the committee’s work, Padilla says New Mexico is in good shape to fend off cyberattacks — and the state’s cities and counties are joining in.
“I think New Mexico is in a very good position because what we decided to do by creating that office is to ensure that any transactions that occur with state government here [in New Mexico] have to meet a minimum set of security standards,” he said.


New Mexico developed a three-year cybersecurity plan, which it published in 2023. The plan includes four long-term goals:
• to manage and monitor information systems, data and networks
• to enhance cybersecurity resilience
• to develop statewide cybersecurity and risk management strategies
• to train and develop the cybersecurity workforce
 


In Indiana, Republican state Sen. Liz Brown filed legislation that would encourage state agencies and groups to develop cybersecurity policies. The bill was approved by both chambers, with the Senate agreeing to changes sent from the House.
“You have to protect your infrastructure,” Brown said. “We don’t want utility systems to be shut down. We don’t want wastewater or freshwater treatment plants or even the water supply being contaminated or harmed in some way. Our systems all have backups, but even so, we know there are bad actors.”
Some states are also preparing to reshuffle their offices or create new ones to centralize their cybersecurity efforts. Arkansas, for example, enacted legislation this month to create a new state cybersecurity office, which will monitor the state’s computer networks and respond to cyberthreats.
In Alabama, rather than having information technology people scattered throughout the government, Republican state Rep. Mike Shaw wants cybersecurity personnel centrally managed.
Shaw’s legislation, which passed the House and is currently in the Senate, would give the Alabama Office of Information Technology central authority to maintain the needs of all of the state’s departments.
The centralization would make it easier to pursue cybersecurity initiatives in the future, Shaw said.
“The federal government is really big, and it’s really hard to come up with a one-size-fits-all solution for things like cybersecurity, data privacy and technology in general,” Shaw said. “So, in some sense, it’s good that the states are coming up with their own.”

The Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC) is calling on nature lovers to help protect some of the state’s most vulnerable shorebirds, including the federally threatened piping plover and the state-endangered American oystercatcher.
DNREC’s Division of Fish and Wildlife will host a training session for prospective volunteers from 10 a.m. to noon on Saturday, May 3, at the Officers Club Mess Hall in Cape Henlopen State Park.
The training is part of the agency’s annual effort to monitor and safeguard beach-nesting birds during the busy summer season.
Volunteers play a key role in DNREC’s conservation strategy, acting as on-the-ground monitors at designated nesting areas along Delaware’s beaches.
Their primary task is to educate the public about temporary beach closures and the importance of minimizing human disturbances that can threaten the nesting success of shorebirds.
The training will kick off with refreshments and a slideshow presentation, followed by a discussion about the monitoring program and volunteer responsibilities.
If weather allows, participants will also have the chance to head out to the Point at Cape Henlopen to spot shorebirds in their natural habitat. Binoculars will be provided, though attendees are encouraged to bring their own.
Submitting an interest form ahead of time is encouraged, but walk-ins are welcome. Park entrance fees will be waived for all training participants.

(Photo illustration from Getty Images)All that glitters is not gold.
Republican leaders are proposing three separate bills to give gambling a stronghold in South Carolina — one to legalize casinos and two to legalize online sports betting. A House Ways and Means subcommittee will consider two of them Tuesday.
The casino bill, H. 4176, is authored by Rep. Gary Brewer and co-sponsored by House Judiciary Committee Chairman Weston Newton and House Labor, Commerce, and Industry Chairman Bill Herbkersman, among others.
The online sports betting bills, S. 444 and H. 3625, are authored by Republicans.
Low-income individuals always get the brunt end of gambling because their financial stress makes them more prone to the risk of repeated gambling that leads to addiction.
In that sense, jobs are created by plundering the most vulnerable of our neighbors.
When video poker proliferated in South Carolina in the 1990s, we learned all too painfully about the increase in bankruptcy, domestic violence, divorce, mental health issues, and even suicide.
In turn, taxpayers bear the burden of those costs as the state must intervene with welfare, health care, criminal justice and the like, while the gambling profiteers dance their way to the bank.
Do we really want towns like Biloxi, Mississippi, in South Carolina, that are havens for crime and corruption?
I hope we learned our lesson with video poker.
The opening paragraph of the casino bill says, “The General Assembly finds that casino gaming is not consistent with nor compatible with the economic, labor, or tourism industry profile for most communities in South Carolina.”
I couldn’t agree more — but would say that principle applies to the entire state.
Casinos are predatory and placing one in Santee or along the economically depressed Interstate 95 corridor blatantly disregards the social disparities faced by our neighbors in that part of the state.
Consider a 2012 report in The Washington Post, citing a study’s findings that while casinos created jobs, they also “lead to a plethora of social ills, including increased substance abuse, mental illness and suicide, violent crime, auto theft and larceny, and bankruptcy. The latter three all increased by 10% in communities that allowed gambling.”
In addition to the social costs, casinos provide cover to sex traffickers as “casino crowds and co-located lodging facilities — coupled with the transient nature of sex trafficking — provide convenience and cover for sex traffickers,” wrote Dave Vialpando, a veteran law enforcement officer.
I-95 has long been cited as the main north-south route for smuggling drugs and human trafficking. A casino along this corridor would only exacerbate these problems.
While some may regard casinos as the dark underbelly of Big Gambling, its close cousin — online sports betting — seeks to cast itself as the more cultured, sophisticated form of gambling.
While online sports betting is illegal in South Carolina, none of us are naïve enough to believe that people in the Palmetto State aren’t doing it.
There are certainly ways to get around state law, but that — in and of itself — should not be a reason for us to dive headlong into an arena that has high costs.
Gambling in the privacy of your home on your iPhone or laptop is easy. Combine the convenience and accessibility of online gambling with sports and you have a potent combination.
Robert Strezo with The Center for Public Justice states, “Sports betting is having an enormous impact on society, and it is disproportionately impacting the lives of young men who are less risk-averse and interested in sports. Nearly 60 percent of 18 to 22-year-olds have bet on sports and 20-year-old males represent about 40% of the calls to hotlines for gambling addiction. The targeting of college youth, who often have access to financial aid — which can be redirected to fund their addiction — has compounded the burden of college debt with gambling debts and the costs of addiction therapy.”
Because of its very nature, it disproportionately affects young men.
According to a January 2024 study, 72% of sports bettors are young men.
Ultimately, there is neither a strong social nor fiscal argument for South Carolina to pursue casinos or online sports betting.
In addition to these and other concerns, Palmetto Family is committed to a biblical worldview that calls us to pursue human flourishing.
South Carolina is at a crossroads: We can either choose to pursue the “glitter” of gambling or embrace the core Judeo-Christian values of hard work, productivity, and using the fruits of God’s provision to meet our needs, the needs of other South Carolinians and expanding and invest to continue to make South Carolina a great place to live, work and raise a family.

(Video capture courtesy of the Iowa Supreme Court)  The Iowa Supreme Court has removed from the bench a magistrate who questioned the veracity of an alleged sexual assault victim because he was a teenage male and asked whether a defendant in a separate case was a “wetback.”
Magistrate David J. Hanson, who is based in Fayette County and has practiced law for more than 36 years, is “simply and unalterably unsuited to be a judge,” and is “unable to preside over any proceeding involving a sexual assault,” the court ruled on Friday.
Its decision to remove Hanson from the bench takes effect in 10 days, assuming Hanson has not resigned before then.
In March, the justices heard oral arguments in the disciplinary proceedings against Hanson. The Iowa Judicial Qualifications Commission, which hears complaints about judges’ conduct, had recommended that the justices suspend Hanson for 90 days due to his conduct in two separate criminal matters.
On Aug. 5, 2022, he refused to sign an arrest warrant for a 17-year-old girl in a sexual abuse case in which the alleged victim was a 15-year-old male. According to court records, Hanson reviewed the matter and denied the warrant, writing that “any self-respecting young male” would have simply removed himself from any sexual touching that was truly unwelcome and he described his own response as a teenager to “unwelcome” sexual advances.
Hanson went on to write that as a teenage boy, the alleged victim’s actions were “contrary to nature” because the “normal, hormone-ridden teenage boy’s reaction to being undressed by a teenage girl” is, “Alright! I’m gonna GET some!” His written decision then went into graphic detail about the physiology of the male sex organ.
In July 2023, Hanson was presiding over a case in which an individual was charged with driving without a license or insurance. A law-student intern who was prosecuting the case later complained that during the proceedings Hanson asked, “Is this guy a wetback? An illegal?”
According to the commission, Hanson also asked whether the prosecutor was sure the defendant, who wasn’t present at the time, hadn’t stolen someone’s identification.
Hanson says use of slur was once ‘common’
At last month’s hearing before the Iowa Supreme Court, Hanson told the justices that with regard to the allegations made by the victim in the sexual abuse case, “I honestly thought, ‘This is a lie. It reads like bad pornography.’ I hate pornography. Pornography is lies … I still, to this day, am convinced that the arrest warrant request, the complaint, was resting on lies.”
At the time, Chief Justice Susan Christensen appeared to bristle at Hanson’s comment and questioned his equation of pornography with lies.

“Sir, are you aware that things that happen to people are pornographic in nature? And sometimes, in order for there to be an arrest warrant, someone might have to give details that are really ugly to give (and) heartbreaking to hear? Just because you’re giving the adjective ‘porn’ — what if those things actually happened to that person? Because it qualifies as porn in your mind and you hate porn, you think it’s a lie?”
“I seriously questioned it,” Hanson replied. “The other problem I had was the utter lack of interest, as far as I could tell, in the policeman attempting to corroborate what the young man said.”
Hanson then likened the decision he faced in that case with what he called the “travesty” of the testimony that was given during the U.S. Supreme Court nomination hearings for conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh in 2018, and for Justice Clarence Thomas in 1991.
“Those were lies,” Hanson said, pounding the podium as he addressed the Iowa justices. “Televised lies! And I was appalled by that, and I thought, ‘I will not be an instrument of anyone seeking to destroy someone without any backing up of what (the alleged victim) said here.’”
As to the second matter involving the case in which Hanson used the term “wetback,” Christensen asked Hanson, “Do you think the term ‘wetback’ is offensive?”
“I’ve learned since using it that it is,” Hanson said. “I grew up in west side, working class Waterloo, and it was fairly common.”
Christensen cut Hanson off, shaking her head and telling him, “You definitely, that one, I am gonna call ‘foul’ on that, that you didn’t know it was offensive.” Hanson told the justices he was agreeable to taking whatever educational courses the court might prescribe for him but asked that he not be removed from the bench due to the heavy caseloads in Fayette County.
Justices remove Hanson from the bench 
In the decision Friday to remove Hanson from the bench, Justice Dana Oxley, writing for the full court, stated that “it should go without saying that the term ‘w——‘ is a racially derogatory, highly offensive slur that does not belong in a courtroom — and especially not from the mouth of a judge … We cannot overemphasize how inappropriate it was for Magistrate Hanson to use the slur … Rather than recognize the term as the racial epithet that it is, he labels it as ‘someone’s taboo’ that he ‘apparently’ transgressed.”
In deciding that Hanson’s conduct warranted not just a suspension but his removal from the bench, the court stated that if Hanson “cannot recognize bias or prejudice in his own conduct, we cannot trust him to recognize it in those he is tasked with policing,” referring to attorneys and other officers of the court.
Hanson, the court added, “has not shown regret for his choice of words. He has not shown genuine remorse for the effect his statements likely had on the litigants. He has shown no aptitude for self-improvement. Indeed, he suggested in his brief that the commission simply provide him with a list of ‘bad words’ so that he can avoid them in conversation.”
With regard to the sexual assault case, the court found that Hanson is “unable to preside over any proceeding involving a sexual assault,” and noted that in a written brief, Hanson had explained his view of sexual assault allegations by writing, “All judges should know, and fear, false accusations of sexual crimes alleged long after the supposed events. I witnessed the televised atrocities visited upon U.S. Supreme Court Justice nominees … by women whom effective cross examinations showed to be telling falsehoods. I will never abet such ‘high-tech lynchings.’ ”
The justices stated Hanson’s remarks were “not those of an independent, impartial arbiter carefully considering whether the allegations provided in the affidavit before him supplied probable cause to support an arrest warrant. Instead, they reflect the biases of someone with preconceived and inflexible notions about alleged sexual assault victims.”",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Hanson.jpg,,,2025-04-18 12:24:51.264178

ST. MARY PARISH —  Amid the rapid erosion of Louisiana’s coast, something hopeful is happening where the Atchafalaya River meets the Gulf. A flow of sediment from a decades-old river diversion has accidentally given birth to new wetlands.
While that small delta is dwarfed by what’s washing away all around it, researchers have gained knowledge from Wax Lake Delta that could help save the rest of Louisiana’s coast and contribute to a better understanding of wetland science across the globe. 
“We have sea level rise, we have storms, but yet … the Wax Lake Delta remains and continues to grow and reach out into the Atchafalaya Basin,” said Alisha Renfro, a coastal scientist with the National Wildlife Federation.
Researchers at Louisiana State University’s Coastal Systems Ecology Lab, led by wetland scientist and professor Robert Twilley, take regular trips to Wax Lake to study what makes a healthy wetland. They monitor soil chemistry and study the way water moves throughout the delta, depositing sediment and building land as it flows. 
 This story is part of the series “Down the Drain” from the Mississippi River Basin Ag & Water Desk, an independent reporting collaborative based at the University of Missouri in partnership with Report for America, with major funding from the Walton Family Foundation.
“Wax Lake has this beautiful, long history of researchers that literally wrote the textbook on what is a delta based on that region,” Twilley said. 

Rather than having to rely on computer modeling for their research, Wax Lake is known as a “living laboratory,” said Renfro, describing it as the perfect place to study what makes a healthy wetland. 
A happy accident
During a research trip on a bright February morning, alligators meandered through the marshy channels of the Wax Lake Delta, part of the Atchafalaya Wildlife Management Area. The scientists were happy to see them. The presence of so many apex predators in the muddy water is a testament to the health of the ecosystem, said Jessica Richardson, a data manager working with Twilley at LSU in the Coastal Sciences department.
White ibises gathered together on the land, and schools of silvery fish darted through the dark water.
“You’ve got different wildlife nesting, laying eggs, such as alligators … and birds that fly, that come in during different seasons and nest,” Twilley said.

Deltas are formed from sediment that collects at the end of a river, like the Mississippi or Atchafalaya. Over time, this sediment builds, creating new land and using nutrients carried by the river to grow vegetation, the roots of which stabilize the new soil and keep it from eroding. 
Deltaic wetlands are uniquely diverse and ecologically valuable. When a river flows into the delta, “it’s not just water,” said Ivan Vargas-Lopez, a wetland scientist and researcher with the Coastal Systems Ecology Lab. 
“It’s bringing a lot of nutrients, a lot of sediment, a lot of particles, a lot of material …” Vargas-Lopez said. “When the water recedes, a lot of that material stays.” 
This process can happen naturally over thousands of years, but the new land built from Wax Lake happened by mistake. 
“[Wax Lake] teaches us about the balance, that if you supply the right amount of 
sediment into an environment, that you outweigh the influence of subsidence and sea level. You will be able to establish and maintain a healthy ecosystem,” said Ehab Meselhe, a river and coastal scientist at Tulane University. 
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers dug a channel in 1941 to try to reduce flooding in nearby Morgan City, redirecting the flow of water from the Atchafalaya. This started the process of sediment buildup, noticed only after a massive flood in 1973 flushed a torrent of dirt down the river. 
For Wax Lake, land is built through flooding. Floods bring in great heaps of sediment, spreading it out across the floodplain in a lobelike shape at the end of the river. 
“Under that water, you’re building a delta, and all of a sudden it sort of … pops up,” Twilley said.  
Over time, the process forms the wetlands so important to the integrity of Louisiana’s coast.

Reversing wetland loss
Subsidence, or the slow sinking of land, paired with ongoing oil and gas development and sea level rise caused by climate change is erasing Louisiana’s coastal wetlands — and fast. These wetlands are some of the most vulnerable in the world, with much of the coast washing away at a rate of about a football field every 100 minutes, endangering cities, towns and livelihoods all along the coast. 
Wax Lake Delta bucks this trend, with one estimate from LSU researchers suggesting land grows by about half a square mile a year. Louisiana officials and researchers are scrambling to respond to the wetland crisis and using Wax Lake’s land-building success to inform other coastal restoration efforts, such as marsh creation, manmade oyster reefs and rebuilding barrier islands. 
Meselhe used data from Wax Lake Delta in his work on the Mid-Barataria sediment diversion project, which would redirect the Mississippi River into the Barataria Basin to reverse land loss in coastal parishes. The diversion has been highly controversial due to its impact on fisheries, and it’s facing delays and legal challenges. 
The Wax Lake Delta data helped him to understand how the interaction between water flow, sediment buildup and plant growth worked to build land. He also looked at how land is being built by another diversion called West Bay and at the Bonnet Carré spillway to see how the diversion would impact the river itself. Then he used that information to calibrate models to help explain how Mid-Barataria would work. 
 “Wax Lake, West Bay and Bonnet Carré served as examples because they had data and measurements and maps over a number of years that helped us to have confidence and trust in the models we ended up using for the Mid-Barataria area,” he said.  
The LSU Center for River Studies houses a massive model of the Mississippi River in its Baton Rouge facility, built using data including water velocity and sediment concentrations observed at Wax Lake and other Louisiana deltas. Researchers and students use it to test how sediment moves with the Mississippi River and where it’s deposited.  
Physical models are useful and necessary; the Army Corps has used them since the early 20th century. But Twilley said field observations like those done at Wax Lake are crucial. 
“Models are not to do your thinking. Models are to help you think,” he said. “Once we build these models of the way we think these systems work and the way they operate, you know, it’s great to go visit somewhere else and see if your hypothesis stands or not.”
Added benefits of a healthy wetland
As scientists study how Wax Lake builds land, they can also better understand the added benefits of healthy wetlands, such as natural carbon storage and nutrient reduction.
Because Wax Lake has been building wetlands for decades, Twilley’s lab can compare older and newer areas of marsh. 
“The older delta does a much better job at holding the soil and serving as a hurricane protection system than the younger,” he said. 
Mature wetlands also store massive amounts of carbon in organic matter, found in dead plants. Buried in the marsh, they keep microorganisms from eating the carbon and releasing it as planet-warming CO2. Wetlands also filter excess nitrogen out of the water, sequestering it before it reaches the Gulf and contributes to harmful algal blooms and the “dead zone.”
That’s one of the reasons it’s important to protect existing wetlands, Twilley said. Their systems are already established and don’t have to play catch up. 
“You gotta let these deltas age before they really reach their full capacity,” he said. “You will get a jump start by already having some wetlands out there.”

An uncertain future
While the science is clear – wetlands have lots of benefits and we know how to build more of them – the future is not. America’s wetlands are under increased threat. After hundreds of years of draining them for agriculture and housing—and historic efforts to protect them—regulations are now being rolled back.  
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service estimated that wetlands covered about 6% of the lower 48 states as of 2019 – about half the amount of wetlands that existed around 1780.
The report also found that the rate of wetland loss increased 50% during the latest study period. Wetlands are now being lost faster than ever, from a combination of drainage for agriculture, development and the effects of climate change. 
Louisiana’s coastal wetlands make up about 40% of all coastal marshes in the United States, according to a series of reports from the U.S. Geological Survey conducted throughout the 1980s and finished in 1996, which found that “wetlands once covered more than one-half of the area that is now Louisiana, but wetland acreage has declined to less than one-third of the state’s land surface over the last 200 years.”
Changes at the federal level could also increase risk of continued wetland loss. 
Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin announced plans to redefine what are designated in federal law as Waters of the United States, sometimes called WOTUS. The changes affect what qualifies as a federally protected body of water under the Clean Water Act. 
The fate of the Mississippi River’s precious wetlands hangs in the balance. 
Research on Wax Lake Delta illustrates that wetlands are more important than ever. Renfro said that’s why it’s critical to take these lessons and use them to build more wetlands. 
“At the end of the day, reconnecting the river with those wetlands it once built is kind of the consistent way to build robust, healthy coastal ecosystems that continue to grow.”

Jose Maria Gonzales Linares, a Pine Ridge Middle School student, died in the crash, Chester County Coroner Terry Tinker said Friday.
Three buses from the middle school were returning to the Lexington County school after a field trip near Charlotte, according to a Lexington School District Two news release.
A tire blew on the bus, which was carrying about 35 students and three adults, causing it to swerve, hit a guard rail and flip, according to the state Highway Patrol, which is investigating the crash.
The two buses that were following the bus that flipped “maneuvered to avoid the accident,” injuring several people on those buses, the district said in a news release.
Emergency services took 38 people to local hospitals, said Ed Darby, director of Chester County Emergency Management. That included three people airlifted to hospitals in helicopters, he said.
Darby did not have information on how many had been released as of Friday morning, or how many people were considered in critical condition, he said.
Highway Patrol and Lexington School District Two also had no new information to release Friday morning, spokespeople said.
Pine Ridge Middle School listed an eighth grade field trip on its online calendar Thursday, but the district has not said where the field trip was.
“Our hearts are broken by the tragic bus accident in Chester County this afternoon,” state Superintendent Ellen Weaver said in a statement. “Our entire state is mourning alongside the Pine Ridge Middle School families, friends, classmates, and educators. Please join me in praying for the Lexington Two community.”
Gov. Henry McMaster said in a statement on X, formerly Twitter, that he and his wife, Peggy McMaster, were both praying for the students injured in the bus crash.
“Today’s school bus accident in Chester County is a tragedy no family should ever have to endure,” McMaster wrote.
Fatal school bus crashes are relatively rare in South Carolina. In 2022, the most recent data available, four people died in collisions involving school buses, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SC42-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-18 12:24:51.264178

(Photo: Richard Bednarski/Nevada Current)“If I had my way, I’d take the tax out,” Republican Assemblymember P.K. O’Neill said last month about the state commerce tax paid by Nevada businesses.
It’s not a bad idea.
The commerce tax was crafted by quasi-governmental fixture, consultant to the publicly subsidized stars, and lobbyist in denial Jeremy Aguero at the request of then-Republican Gov. Brian Sandoval for the 2015 Nevada legislative session. 
The measure, which was enacted with bipartisan support, applies small levies well south of 1% (between 0.051% and 0.331%, depending on the industry) on the gross receipts of businesses that collect an annual revenue of more than $4 million.
O’Neill and Republican Assemblymember Jill Dickman are sponsoring a bill to have the $4 million exemption grow with inflation, effectively expanding the exemption a little more each year, and capturing a few less businesses in the process. It would have a negligible impact on state revenues and Nevada businesses alike in the short term, though the impact on state revenue would compound over time. 
Only seven states levy a tax on gross revenue. States name them differently — “corporate activity tax” (Oregon), “franchise tax” (Texas), “commerce tax” (Nevada), etc. — but tax policy think tanks such as the Tax Foundation and the Tax Policy Center categorize them collectively as a “gross receipts” tax.
And the center-right Tax Foundation, in particular, is not fond of gross receipts taxes at all.
Among the many faults the group finds in “this harmful tax,” perhaps the most pernicious is “tax pyramiding” — a good or service gets taxed again and again by every business at every step in the market process.
That “continual forward shifting of the tax burden” ultimately results in consumers paying higher prices.
Nevada consumers already pay higher sales tax rates than people in most of the rest of the country, which makes inflation hit households in Nevada harder than in other states (and is yet another reason Nevadans will also be hit harder by Trump’s tariffs than people in most other states). Nevada’s commerce tax exacerbates the problem.
  Nevada’s commerce tax on business is a wee slice. Nevada’s sales tax on working households is like a big honking third of the whole stinking pie. (Pie: Nevada Economic Forum)
Price increases driven by commerce tax pyramiding also make the tax regressive — the lower a household’s income, the higher the percentage of that income is paid as a tax. That’s in keeping with Nevada’s upside down tax structure in general, which is notorious for being one of the nation’s most regressive.
“Nevada’s Commerce Tax is a prime example of a state with a poorly structured and legally tenuous gross receipts tax,” the Tax Foundation wrote in a 2024 overview of taxes on gross receipts in the U.S. The group singled out the aforementioned $4 million exemption for “eliminating many small and medium-sized businesses in Nevada from the Commerce Tax altogether.” 
(The “legally tenuous” bit refers to an “in-state payroll” quirk in the tax that could make it ripe for challenge under the U.S. Constitution clause granting Congress the authority to regulate commerce between the states. But since Republicans who control Congress have relinquished power over everything and anything in deference to Trump’s authority, that potential constitutional transgression is unlikely to be anyone’s concern anytime soon.)
“Gross receipt taxes” such as Nevada’s commerce tax “can and should be left in the dustbin of history,” the Tax Foundation asserts.
“If states intend to levy a broad-based business tax,” the group’s overview concludes, “a properly corporate income tax that allows businesses to deduct the cost of goods sold, as well as qualifying business investments and inputs,” which would curb tax pyramiding, you see, “is — while far from an ideal tax — demonstrably better than a tax on gross receipts.”
Yeah well we won’t be doing that
When O’Neill, who previously has struggled to grasp the meaning of regressive taxation, says he’d like to “take the tax out,” he assuredly doesn’t mean he would like to replace it with a corporate income tax.
But ridding the state of its commerce tax without replacing it with something smarter would leave a projected $760 million hole in state revenue over the next two years.
The damage that Trump and Elon Musk have recklessly inflicted on federal programs and services is as yet still incalculable, and the prospect of repairing what they have broken is still unknown. 
What is known, however, is that states that stand the best chance of maintaining a semblance of vital public services will be those states with a history of at least trying to adequately fund and staff state and local government. 
Nevada isn’t one of them.
And barring a currently unthinkable outbreak of sense and sensibility among Trump and his congressional Republicans, Nevada will likely be facing intense budget challenges over the next two years, especially with diminished Medicaid funding, yet another thing that is projected to hit Nevada harder than most states. 
Nevada can’t “take the tax out.” 
And it can’t replace it with a corporate income tax, for the same reason Sandoval and Aguero came up with gross receipts tax ten years ago. Sure, it was convoluted, unfamiliar, and wracked with bizarre industrial tax rate variations that were inexplicable from a policy standpoint but grossly obvious from a political one (oh hi mining). And, if memory serves, opponents at the time warned of the tax pyramiding problem.
But the big attraction about the commerce tax is that as blunt and flawed and silly as it so obviously was/is, it wasn’t that one tax that Nevada politicians of both parties are horrified to entertain, let alone make an argument or — perish the thought — vote for: It wasn’t an income tax.
Technically, it is true that Nevada can replace its gross receipts tax with a corporate income tax that would treat businesses and working households more fairly. While the state constitution prohibits establishment of a personal income tax, it also explicitly allows a business and/or corporate income tax.
But replacing the commerce tax with a business income tax would require at least a few Republicans to vote for it, because of the  state’s daftly undemocratic requirement that any new or increased taxes must be approved by two-thirds of both houses of the Legislature.
And approving a business income tax — or any new or increased tax for that matter — would require Democrats to not only vote for it, but to make a public case for it.
That’s just not going to happen at any time in the foreseeable future, if ever.
Instead, O’Neill’s bill to make the commerce tax slightly more complicated and slightly less useful was passed out of a committee controlled by Democrats, and seems exactly the sort of thing that perhaps not most but enough legislative Democrats would vote to send to the desk of a Republican governor who would no doubt be delighted to sign it, Nevada legislative Democrats arguably being among the most business-compliant legislative Democrats in the nation.
If that’s what happens, a little bit more of the state’s tax burden will be lifted from business, a  little bit more of it will fall on the shoulders of working households, and Nevada’s tax structure will be a little bit more upside down, fairness wise. In other words, yet again, the Nevada way will win the day.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/20250115_StateofState_Current-1418-2-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-04-18 12:24:51.264178

(Courtesy of the Nebraska Supreme Court)LINCOLN — The Nebraska Supreme Court sided with the Legislature on Friday, upholding its constitutional authority to pass new parole eligibility standards as part of a major criminal justice reform law in 2023 meant to help address prison crowding.
In an unsigned 37-page ruling, the high court unanimously overturned a Lancaster County District Court ruling that parts of Legislative Bill 50 from 2023 were unconstitutional. The sections deal with parole eligibility and legislative intent that the expanded provisions apply to all committed offenders. 
Those laws took effect Sept. 2, 2023, but on the advice of Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers, the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services refused to implement the parole provisions. The lower court sided with Hilgers in March 2024, leading to the appeal.
“Whether applied prospectively or retroactively, LB 50’s new parole eligibility provisions do not result in substituting a milder punishment for the sentence originally imposed,” the Supreme Court wrote.

The justices reasoned that parole is not the same as commutation, or imposing a “milder” sentence, which is a power reserved exclusively to the Nebraska Board of Pardons and the executive branch.
The court said parole “merely changes the circumstances under which the sentence is being served.”
While some offenders might get earlier parole, the justices said, it can’t be assumed that everyone who will become eligible will then be granted parole sooner than they would have if not for LB 50’s passage. It passed the Legislature in a 34-15 vote in June 2023.
“Because leaving an erroneous declaration of unconstitutionality uncorrected would result in damage to the integrity, reputation or fairness of the judicial process, we must reverse the judgment for plain error,” the justices said.
Justice Jason Bergevin had not yet joined the Supreme Court when oral arguments came up in January, so Chief Judge Francie Riedmann of the Nebraska Court of Appeals filled in.
Expanded parole eligibility
Hilgers and his office specifically targeted Sections 47 and 48 of LB 50, which the Legislature in Section 57 explicitly said it intended to apply retroactively.
The new law extended parole eligibility in the following ways:

For someone serving a maximum term of 20 years or less, two years prior to a person’s mandatory discharge date.


For someone serving a maximum term of more than 20 years, when the person has served 80% of the time until the sentence’s mandatory discharge date.

LB 50 also created the possibility of “geriatric parole” for someone who is at least 75 years old and who has served at least 15 years of the sentence. Persons serving a Class I, IA or IB felony or for a sex-related offense are ineligible, as are those serving life imprisonment.
As a condition of geriatric parole, the person would need to wear an electronic monitoring device for at least 17 months.
In late 2023 court filings, the Corrections Department said the “retroactive effect” of LB 50 would impact 1,794 current offenders:

529 committed offenders who were already parole eligible would have had a new, earlier parole eligibility date.


345 committed offenders who were not yet parole eligible under the previous law would now be parole eligible.


920 committed offenders who had not yet reached parole eligibility would have a new, earlier parole eligibility date.

‘Holding out hope’
At least five serving on the Supreme Court would have needed to agree to declare part or all of LB 50 unconstitutional. Statutes are presumed to be constitutional and “all reasonable doubts are resolved in favor of its constitutionality.”
“The burden of establishing the unconstitutionality of a statute is on the one attacking its validity,” the court wrote. “It is not the province of a court to annul a legislative act unless it clearly contravenes the constitution and no other resort remains.”
State Sen. Terrell McKinney of North Omaha, a longtime member of the Legislature’s Judiciary Committee, joined former State Sen. Justin Wayne of Omaha, the then-committee chair, to get LB 50 over the finish line. 
McKinney said he was a little surprised by Friday’s decision but felt good. He said he had received numerous calls and questions from individuals and families who will be impacted by LB 50.
“I feel happy, but I feel relief for those individuals who were holding out hope that the court would uphold what we passed,” McKinney told the Nebraska Examiner.

The Judiciary Committee in 2023 was split 4-4 between Republicans and Democrats, and LB 50 advanced 4-2 after a temporary vacancy caused by the resignation of former State Sen. Suzanne Geist of Lincoln, a Republican, making four members a majority. Geist is now chief of staff and chief policy adviser to Hilgers. Geist’s legislative successor, State Sen. Carolyn Bosn of Lincoln, now chairs the Judiciary Committee. Bosn was unavailable for comment Friday.
AG’s opinions are not law
When Hilgers’ office filed the case in late 2023, he did so under a previous law since repealed by the Legislature. It required his office to challenge the constitutionality of a law if, on the AG’s written advice, an agency refused to implement a state law. However, justices during January arguments said this was the first time the lawsuit had followed “informal” advice rather than an archived AG’s opinion.
Secretary of State Bob Evnen defended the law against the attorney general, as was his duty under the previous law. Spokespersons for Evnen and Hilgers did not immediately respond to Friday requests for comment, nor did the Corrections Department.
Friday’s ruling almost did not happen on technical grounds after the attorney for Evnen contained no “assignment of error section” in a brief to the high court, only headings alluding to alleged errors, the opinion states. However, the case was allowed to move forward to determine whether there was a “plain error” in the lower court ruling, leading to Friday’s ruling.

This isn’t the first time Hilgers has questioned the constitutionality of state laws at the request of state agency heads, He did so notably in August 2023 after the Corrections Department and the Department of Health and Human Services questioned legislative oversight of child welfare and corrections and in July 2024, when Evnen questioned restoring voting rights to formerly convicted felons after the completion of their sentences, rather than a two-year waiting period that Evnen also questioned.
Wayne, with McKinney’s support, led the voting rights law. The Supreme Court ruled against Hilgers in October. No lawsuit was ever launched in the oversight case. Legislation is pending to get around a legal fight.
McKinney said he and others often have to remind colleagues that AG’s opinions lack the force of law and that Friday’s decision upheld that state lawmakers were “working to do the right thing” and “crossing our t’s and dotting our i’s.”
“Just because another agency or individual wants to try to say, ‘No, y’all can’t do that,’ I think it shows that there’s power in the Legislature to do good things,” McKinney said. “When you do good things for the right reasons, things will be upheld.”
This is a developing story.

In April of 2018, the complaint says, an MGM customer wrote in an email to a corporate host that his casino hosts may be sharing information about him with Bowyer, including an allegation that “Mr. Bowyer is attempting to steal clients from the MGM, hence he is in the illegal bookmaking business and [casino host] is funneling MGM sportsbook clients to Mr. Bowyer.” The email was forwarded to two casino marketing managers, the GCB complaint states, however it was not reported to MGM Compliance executives. 
The revelation comes a year and a half after federal authorities from California agreed to allow MGM to pay a $7.45 million fine in lieu of prosecution for allowing another illegal bookmaker, Wayne Nix, to gamble and launder cash at MGM Grand and the Cosmopolitan, which the company now owns. 
Then-MGM Grand president Scott Sibella “approved complimentary rooms, food service, and event tickets for Mr. Nix, and invited Mr. Nix on marketing trips to encourage him to gamble at the MGM Grand,” the complaint says. 
The Nevada Gaming Commission will be asked next week to sign off on a stipulated agreement calling for MGM Resorts International to pay an $8.5 million fine for allowing illegal bookmakers to gamble and failing to adhere to anti-money laundering laws. 
The Current was first to report in 2023 that the Criminal Division of the Internal Revenue Service was investigating MGM and Resorts World. The Nevada Gaming Commission last month approved a stipulated agreement in which Resorts World agreed to pay a $10.5 million fine. Federal authorities have yet to take any action against Resorts World.  
Former MGM Resorts Chairman and CEO Jim Murren, who led the company during the time the alleged violations occurred, declined to comment. Earlier this year, Resorts World named Murren to head up its Board of Directors. 
The Current reported last year that Murren, the company’s general counsel John McManus, and the GCB were notified in 2019 that executives, including Sibella, were catering to gamblers with questionable bankrolls.
GCB officials have declined to say what, if any, action they took at the time. Las Vegas Raiders president Sandra Douglass Morgan, who served as chairperson of the GCB at the time, also did not respond. 
Nix gambled at MGM properties on 400 separate days, the GCB complaint asserts. Each day constitutes a separate violation. 
A Cosmopolitan host “went to dinner with Mr. Nix, invited Mr. Nix to casino-sponsored events, and encouraged Mr. Nix to travel and stay at the Cosmopolitan to use the illegal proceeds,” and referred at least one casino customer to place illegal sports bets with Nix.
The GCB’s “months long investigation” revealed MGM executives had “suspicions” from March 2015 until September 2018 about Bowyer’s source of funds, but did nothing to stop him from gambling on 300 separate days at MGM properties.  
MGM knew, or should have known, since April 2018 that Bowyer was involved in illegal bookmaking, the complaint alleges. 
The Current was first to report in November 2023 that federal authorities raided Bowyer’s California home a month earlier and seized his phone. He has since pleaded guilty to money laundering and illegal bookmaking.

(Photo: Jackie Llanos/Florida Phoenix)Juan Carlos Lopez-Gomez held his mother in a tight embrace and wept following his release from the Leon County Jail Thursday evening, where the U.S. citizen was held after his arrest for illegally entering Florida as an “unauthorized alien.”
An official with Homeland Security Investigations in Tallahassee took Lopez-Gomez, a 20-year-old born in Georgia, to a Wendy’s near the jail, where he reunited with his mother after spending more than 24 hours under arrest following a traffic stop in which he was a passenger.
Lopez-Gomez appeared shellshocked and spoke quietly as he discussed what happened when a Florida Highway Patrol trooper pulled over the car he was in on his way to work from Cairo, Georgia, to Tallahassee. The trooper made the traffic stop because the driver was going 78 mph in a 65 mph zone, according to the arrest report.
“I feel fine leaving that place, I felt bad in there. They didn’t give us anything to eat all day yesterday,” he told the Florida Phoenix in Spanish. He added that he had asked the trooper who made the arrest why he was being taken into custody, because he was a U.S. citizen.
His mother, also in Spanish, said the days ahead will be tough for the family and worries that Lopez-Gomez and his sisters will live in fear of deportation despite having been born in the country. She told the Phoenix she planned to sue over her son’s arrest.
“I don’t have a way to pay all the people who are helping us. People from other states have called us, and we don’t have a way to pay them; we can only thank them,” Gomez-Perez said.

The pair didn’t reunite until the evening, after Lopez-Gomez’s first court appearance earlier in the day. Leon County Judge LaShawn Riggans ruled Thursday morning that she lacked jurisdiction to release him because U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement had formally asked the jail to hold him for 48 hours.
After Riggans’ inspection of his Social Security card and birth certificate, which an advocate waved in the courtroom, the judge said she found no probable cause for the charge.
“In looking at it, and feeling it, and holding it up to the light, the court can clearly see the watermark to show that this is indeed an authentic document,” Riggans said.
The arrest record the trooper filed states that Lopez-Gomez had said he was in the country illegally but that he had handed over his ID. There was no mention of the Social Security card on the arrest report. However, Lopez-Gomez told the Phoenix he had shown the trooper a copy of his Social Security card and Georgia state ID.
The HSI agent who took Lopez-Gomez to Wendy’s directed questions to a spokesperson, who didn’t respond to the Phoenix’s request for comment or questions as of this publication.
After the reunion with his mom, Lopez-Gomez returned to the parking lot of the jail, where 30 protesters had been demanding his release. They met him with cheers and hugs.
Lopez-Gomez will have to return to the Leon County Courthouse on May 6. He was charged under a recently passed law that a federal judge has temporarily barred the state from enforcing, further calling into question the validity of his arrest, the charge, and detention.
Gov. Ron DeSantis signed SB 4-C into law on Feb. 14, and U.S. District Court Judge Kathleen Williams blocked its enforcement on April 4.
The law makes it a misdemeanor for undocumented immigrants over age 18 to “knowingly” enter Florida “after entering the United States by eluding or avoiding examination or inspection by immigration officers.”
Two other men who were in the car with Lopez-Gomez, the driver and another passenger, also made their first appearances on the same charge on Thursday. The driver was also charged with driving without a license.

(Photo courtesy of the Oregon Department of Transportation/Flickr)Fred Cuozzo barely made it out of the South Obenchain Fire that burned through his home, barn, pumphouse and garage in Eagle Point, north of Medford, on Sept. 8, 2020.
Three years later, PacifiCorp — owner of Oregon private utility Pacific Power — was found by a jury to have been reckless and negligent in causing that fire and three others. In January 2024, a jury ordered the utility company to pay millions in damages to Cuozzo and nine other survivors, among the first group in an ongoing class action lawsuit.
Cuozzo still has not seen that settlement money because PacifiCorp is appealing the jury’s verdict. In three months, Cuozzo turns 80. He fears he might not in his lifetime see that money — money he needs to rebuild.
“I’ve been waiting almost five years since my home, contents and four other structures burned up,” he said. “I think they’re just waiting, trying to wait people out, and they can get tired of waiting or die, right?”
The Oregon Legislature is considering a bill that would do something about that, and it’s moving through the session with bipartisan support and little fanfare.
Senate Bill 926, sponsored by state Sen. David Brock Smith, R-Port Orford, and co-sponsored by Democratic state Sens. Jeff Golden of Ashland and James Manning of Eugene, would impose some consequences on PacifiCorp, and the state’s two other investor-owned utilities, for delaying settlements and prolonging litigation if they are found to have recklessly or negligently caused a wildfire.
On April 8, the Senate Judiciary Committee’s four Democrats voted to pass it out of the committee and onto the Senate floor, recommending they also vote yes. The committee’s two Republicans opposed the bill. The larger Senate vote has not yet been scheduled.
Golden said he only recently learned about the bill and signed on as a sponsor.
“I am interested in faster settlements. I’m not interested in rate increases or favorable treatment (for utilities) until people who have been waiting for a remedy get it,” he said.
Unlike other bills this session related to private utilities and wildfire risk that have been more controversial — including bills to shield utilities from some financial liabilities, and one bill that would have prohibited utilities from raising rates if they had ongoing wildfire suits — Senate Bill 926 appears to be meeting little friction. Only one person spoke at its first public hearing in March: a father of three in Albany who supports the bill and expressed frustration over his rising electricity costs. Brock Smith, the bill’s chief sponsor, did not give testimony during the bill’s first hearing or in the run-up to the judiciary committee’s vote. He also didn’t respond to calls, emails or texts about the bill.
Utility companies oppose the bill. Portland General Electric lobbyist Greg Alderson called it “problematically broad” in a letter submitted to the committee two days after the hearing.
PacifiCorp spokesman Simon Gutierrez, said in an email to the Capital Chronicle on Tuesday that the company strongly opposes the bill, though it has not yet submitted any formal testimony against it.
The bill was amended after public comment closed, unfairly and fundamentally altering the original bill without the opportunity to weigh in on the changes, both utilities contend.
 Imposing consequences

Senate Bill 926 would prohibit Oregon’s private investor-owned utilities from recovering wildfire lawsuit costs from ratepayers — including fines, fees and settlements — if the company was found by a court or jury to have acted recklessly or negligently in causing the fire. It would also prohibit companies from raising rates to pay for repairing or replacing wildfire-damaged infrastructure if the company is found by court or jury to have been at fault for the fire.
Electric utilities indebted by a wildfire judgment would not be allowed to send dividends, income, interest or profits to corporate owners and shareholders and would pay 9% interest on any damages awarded to wildfire victims starting from the date of the fire, rather than the date the damages are awarded.
The bill would apply retroactively to all powerline-ignited wildfires since Jan. 1, 2020. For a company like PacifiCorp, that could mean millions in interest on cases that have been awaiting trial for years, and limits to the utilities’ now annual requests to raise rates.
“It is astounding that Senate leadership in the Oregon legislature is seeking to insert themselves into ongoing litigation involving PacifiCorp by retroactively imposing costs in the millions under a scheme that would apply to no other business in the state,” Gutierrez said.
He added that in light of a recent report from the Oregon Department of Forestry that concluded PacifiCorp did not start fires it was previously found to have started in the Santiam Canyon, the bill should be reconsidered.
That state report refutes statements from first responders from the U.S. Forest Service and months of trial testimony about the origins of the fires, and is unlikely to be admissible in PacifiCorp’s appeal because the company in 2023 moved to exclude all government reports at trial.

(Screenshots via YouTube)Social media posts have been falsely claiming that a man with connections to Arizona and far-right militias was the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent who smashed a car’s window with an axe to apprehend a Guatemalan immigrant. But that man has not been hired by ICE and is currently in Oklahoma spreading conspiracy theories there.
Michael “Lewis Arthur” Meyer is the founder of a group known as Veterans on Patrol which has been involved with a number of militia activities along the southern border often with a QAnon theme.
Users on BlueSky and X, formerly Twitter, have been claiming that Meyer is an ICE agent who was seen breaking the window of a vehicle to arrest a Guatemalan immigrant woman as she was waiting for her attorney.
The Arizona Mirror found that Meyer was posting videos of himself in Oklahoma at the time of the incident in Massachusetts. Meyer has been making videos of himself at the Oklahoma state Capitol telling staff of lawmakers that he intends to “destroy” what he claims is “military weather manipulation” technology.
In an email to the Mirror, Meyer confirmed that he has been living in Oklahoma and said he does not work for ICE.
And ICE “vehemently” denied the claims that Meyer works for the agency in any capacity.
“The officer recorded making an arrest in New Bedford, Mass. is not militia leader Lewis Arthur,” an ICE spokesman said in an emailed statement to the Mirror. “The rumors circulating on social media that ICE Boston employed a militia leader from Arizona to make arrests in New England are not only false, but they are also inflammatory and place the safety of federal officers in jeopardy.”
ICE would not release the name of the officer seen in the video, and would only confirm that “he is a federal law enforcement officer who has worked with ICE to help keep New England communities safe for years.”
Meyer believes in the debunked chemtrail conspiracy theory that has been overtaking many state legislatures. His Telegram, a social media channel favored by the far-right for allowing hate speech and graphic content, if full of conspiratorial creeds and allusions to violence towards the alleged weather manipulation technology in Oklahoma.
Meyer’s group has long engaged in these sorts of antics and “operations.”
In 2018, his group found a homeless encampment and began spreading unfounded claims of sex trafficking and last year claimed that Hurricane Helene was created by the United States military.
Meyer also has a criminal record which includes damaging and stealing water meant for migrants along the border left by humanitarian groups in Arizona, disorderly conduct and trespassing at a cement factory he believed was part of a QAnon-style conspiracy.
Journalist Jessica Pishko also confirmed on X that she had recently seen Meyer in Oklahoma.

Gruters has been a candidate for CFO since last June – months after Trump publicly urged him to run for the seat, saying on his Truth Social page, “Joe was on the ‘Trump Train’ before it even left the station and, if he decides to run, he will have my Complete and Total Endorsement.”
The Florida Chief Financial Officer seat remains vacant, weeks after Jimmy Patronis resigned before his election to Congress on April 1. Although Gov. Ron DeSantis has said he would select an interim CFO before choosing a successor to fill out the remaining year-and-half term, he has yet to do so.
Gruters will most likely not be that pick. He and DeSantis have never been close, and they clashed a year ago regarding Amendment 3, the proposed constitutional amendment that would have legalized recreational cannabis in Florida.

This week: State employees begin union contract negotiations; Minnesota posts strong job numbers despite economic uncertainty; union carpenters protest subcontractor Absolute Drywall; and whistleblower alleges serious data breach at National Labor Relations Board. 
State employees begin union contract negotiations
Negotiations kicked off this week between the state of Minnesota and tens of thousands of its unionized workers in what may shape up to be the most contentious round of contract talks in recent memory.
Members of the Minnesota Association of Professional Employees, which represents about 18,000 workers, continue to hold protests against Gov. Tim Walz’s order for most workers to return to the office 50% of the time beginning on June 1. The union has called for a full repeal of the rule and raised the prospect of a strike, though the soonest one could happen wouldn’t be until late in the summer.
The union says the flexibility and autonomy that comes with remote work has been a boon for recruitment and retention, while forcing workers back into the office will increase their costs and steal time away from their families.
In their opening offer, MAPE leaders proposed that their members have the right to work remotely unless the state can “clearly and convincingly demonstrate that essential job functions of the position cannot be completed when telecommuting.” The proposal would also have the state reimburse workers for parking expenses if they are mandated to be onsite on an incidental basis.
Walz said this week he has no plans to rescind or delay the return-to-office order, and brushed aside concerns that there wouldn’t be enough office space to accommodate workers after agencies began downsizing during the pandemic.
“I understand that there are disruptions for folks. But the ability to come back to work, work in there together 50% of the time is right in line with the majority, the vast majority of every other state government and most of our private employers,” Walz said at a news conference highlighting potential federal cuts to Medicaid.
Rules on layoffs will also be a key sticking point for the two sides, as the state stares down the likelihood of large federal funding cuts on top of a gloomy budget forecast for the near future. Minnesota Management and Budget, which is negotiating with the union, proposed creating “emergency layoffs” to be used in the event of “fiscal exigencies,” as well as epidemics, natural disasters and national security emergencies.
The new kind of layoff would allow the state to idle workers without having to follow the usual contractual procedures governing layoffs, like placing laid off workers in vacant positions at the same seniority level.
“We are deeply concerned about this proposal, especially given the timing. Workers are already being laid off across multiple agencies. Removing their only remaining protections in a moment of instability is unnecessary and harmful,” MAPE President Megan Dayton told the Reformer.
On Monday, the Minnesota Department of Health announced it was delaying layoffs for approximately 170 employees because a federal judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration from freezing $11 billion in federal health grants, including about $220 million for Minnesota.
In an internal memo obtained by the Star Tribune, assistant Commissioner Mel Gresczyk also acknowledged the agency made errors in determining layoffs, discovering some employees who received notices were funded by other grants and revenue sources. The Department of Health plans to issue new layoff notices, which will take effect May 14.
In its opening bid, the union also proposed tying cost-of-living raises to inflation and adding protections from job losses from artificial intelligence.
Job growth remains strong in Minnesota
Minnesota added 10,700 jobs in March, the biggest monthly gain in a year, despite massive upheavals in the global economy driven by the Trump administration’s trade war.
“The recent on again, off again round of tariffs continues to cause significant uncertainty among Minnesota companies … but even so, I have to say Minnesota’s job market has so far shown impressive resilience,” said Matt Varilek, commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development, at a news briefing on Thursday.
Minnesota gained 37,581 jobs over the year, faster than the national rate of growth. Unemployment ticked up slightly, but it was driven by more people entering the workforce, with the labor force participation rate increasing to 68.2%, among the tops in the nation.
Trouble may be on the horizon, however, as businesses that rely on products from other countries stare down steep tariffs and a souring consumer sentiment that’s likely to lead to a pullback in spending and layoffs. Tourist-dependent industries may also take a hit this season as international workers and customers stay away, either in protest of the Trump administration or fear of being caught up in immigration enforcement.
Trump’s efforts to slash the size of the federal workforce through layoffs and buyouts have also not yet appeared in the jobs data, since the mass firings of probationary workers has been tied up in court and those who accepted voluntary buyouts may remain on the government’s payroll through September. More layoffs are planned, affecting Minnesota’s roughly 18,000 federal workers, with agency heads required to submit plans for massive staffing reductions by Monday.
Jobs in state and local government, meanwhile, saw strong growth and added 1,500 jobs over the month in March.
Carpenters union protests Absolute Drywall

Members of the North Central States Regional Council of Carpenters picketed outside an affordable housing development in Burnsville on Wednesday to protest Absolute Drywall, a subcontractor on the site with a long history of labor violations.
The demonstration was part of coordinated protests across the country by the carpenters union called Tax Fraud Days of Action aimed at shaming contractors the union says drive down industry wages by skirting labor laws.
Absolute Drywall has been cited repeatedly for various labor law violations, including illegally employing minors and misclassifying workers as independent contractors to avoid paying overtime, health insurance and payroll taxes. Minnesota loses upwards of $136 million a year in tax revenue because of payroll tax fraud, according to an estimate by the Midwest Economic Policy Institute.
The company is currently being sued by the state Department of Human Rights for sex discrimination for firing a female worker who was raped by a co-worker on a job site. The company is also being investigated by state labor regulators for alleged wage theft on an apartment complex built by the owners of the Minnesota Vikings.
The carpenters union also criticized MWF Properties — the developer of the Pillsbury Ridge development they picketed — and its general contractor, Eagle Building Company, for continuing to hire Absolute Drywall even after its checkered past has become public.
Eagle Building Company told the Reformer the company does not condone the behavior laid out in the allegations against Absolute Drywall and would reevaluate its business relationship with the subcontractor after the legal process played out.
“We have a rigorous program in place to identify and prevent worker abuses on our job sites,” Nick Williams, vice president at Eagle, wrote in an email.
MWF Properties did not respond to a request for comment.
Whistleblower warns of DOGE intrusion into private NLRB data
Members of Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency initiative appear to have taken reams of sensitive data from the National Labor Relations Board, according to a whistleblower’s account detailed by NPR.
The intrusion into the agency, which investigates and adjudicates unfair labor practices, has alarmed labor experts, who say it could expose personal information about union members, proprietary corporate data and witness testimony — data protected by the Privacy Act and other federal laws.
“It could result in damage to individual workers, to union-organizing campaigns and to unions themselves,” Harley Shaiken, a professor emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley, told NPR.
DOGE’s effective leader, world’s richest man Elon Musk, owns companies with a number of cases before the NLRB, including alleged illegal firings of SpaceX employees. Lawyers for SpaceX have argued the NLRB’s structure is unconstitutional in that case.
In a report sent to Congress, NLRB information technology employee Daniel Berulis detailed how DOGE engineers were granted virtually unrestricted access to the agency’s computer system. Then they took steps to conceal their digital footprints across the system and appear to have exported gigabytes of data.
Berulis also noticed attempted logins from an IP address in Russia after DOGE accessed the system.
“If he didn’t know the backstory, any [chief information security officer] worth his salt would look at network activity like this and assume it’s a nation-state attack from China or Russia,” said Jake Braun, a former White House cyber official.
After Berulis raised concerns about the data intrusion, he found a printed letter taped to his door which included threatening language and a picture of him walking his dog.
The NLRB’s acting press secretary denies that DOGE was granted access to its systems. NPR reports that a day after its investigation was published, DOGE assigned two of its people to work part-time, remotely at the agency.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/487509966_1072026698298301_3793242531339463052_n-1024x709.jpg,,,2025-04-18 11:03:16.031178

Chris Van Hollen told reporters Friday.Van Hollen, a Maryland Democrat, met Thursday with Abrego Garcia and briefed reporters on the visit after landing Friday afternoon at Dulles International Airport outside Washington, D.C.The meeting with Van Hollen was Abrego Garcia’s first contact outside of the U.S. and El Salvador immigration and legal systems since he was deported in March, the senator said.“His conversation with me was the first communication he’d had with anybody outside a prison since he was abducted,” Van Hollen said Friday.

Accompanied by Abrego Garcia’s wife, mother and brother at Dulles, Van Hollen said he’d been preparing to catch his plane out of El Salvador Thursday evening when he got word from the U.S. embassy that he would be able to meet with Abrego Garcia.The meeting came at the end of Van Hollen’s second day in the country, where he faced difficulties securing an in-person meeting or phone call with the Salvadoran citizen. The second-term senator traveled to the Central American country this week to urge the Salvadoran government to release Abrego Garcia and to meet with him.Abrego Garcia told Van Hollen he’d been taken to a detention center in Baltimore, Van Hollen said Friday. From there, he was transported to Texas and then flown to El Salvador, where he was detained at the notorious mega-prison Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo, or CECOT.Abrego Garcia was moved on April 9 from CECOT to another El Salvador detention center, Van Hollen reported. The conditions at the new prison were better, but Abrego Garcia was still denied access to the outside world, including communication with his family or lawyers, which is a violation of international law, Van Hollen said.The meeting occurred under close supervision from Salvadoran officials, Van Hollen said, but Abrego Garcia appeared in adequate health.“On a very cursory examination, he appeared OK,” Van Hollen said.Van Hollen on Thursday shared a picture on social media of his meeting with Abrego Garcia, who appeared in civilian clothes.Constitutional conflictWhile he said Abrego Garcia’s individual case was tragic, Van Hollen said it had even larger implications for the strength of constitutional rights to due process.“This should not be an issue for Republicans or Democrats,” he said. “This is an issue for every American who cares about our Constitution, who cares about personal liberty, who cares about due process and who cares about what makes America so different, which is adherence to all of those things. This is an American issue.”Noting that the administration has ignored federal courts at every level — including a U.S. Supreme Court ruling last week that President Donald Trump’s administration must “facilitate” Abrego Garcia’s return to the United States — Van Hollen said officials at the U.S. embassy in El Salvador told him they had not received any instruction from the administration to seek his release.“It’s very clear that the president, the Trump administration, are blatantly, flagrantly disagreeing with, defying, the order from the Supreme Court,” he said.White House says ‘he’s NOT coming back’The Trump administration, which has admitted in court that Abrego Garcia’s deportation stemmed from an “administrative error,” continued Friday to be steadfast in refusing to return him.The Trump administration has criticized Van Hollen’s advocacy for Abrego Garcia, and the White House targeted the senator on social media Friday.“Oh, and by the way, @ChrisVanHollen — he’s NOT coming back,” a post on X from the official White House account read. The post included an illustration of a New York Times headline on the meeting, with two sections crossed out and replaced with administration claims about Abrego Garcia. The administration has claimed there are logistical reasons it cannot repatriate Abrego Garcia, but some — including a Reagan-appointed federal appeals court judge on Thursday — have said the executive branch is defying the Supreme Court order.Payments to El SalvadorVan Hollen said the Trump administration has promised to pay El Salvador up to $15 million to detain the prisoners, but noted that Democrats in the U.S. Senate are not “totally powerless” to stop those payments.“Appropriations need to go through the Congress, and that $15 million, you can be sure we’re going to be looking for where it is because that wasn’t authorized in previous appropriations,” he said.He said that while Democrats are in the minority in both houses of Congress, they could block any Senate funding bill that included payments for detention in El Salvador.“You can be sure that I won’t support the use of one penny of taxpayer dollars to keep Abrego Garcia illegally detained in El Salvador,” he said.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/themes/custom/sn/images/icons/No_image.svg,,,2025-04-18 18:07:53.748274

Angus King (I-ME) speaks during a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on the conclusion of military operations in Afghanistan and plans for future counterterrorism operations on Capitol Hill on September 28, 2021 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Patrick Semansky-Pool/Getty Images)On April 18, 1775, Paul Revere famously rode through the streets of Massachusetts to warn residents about the approach of British troops, which culminated in the Battle of Lexington and Concord that kicked off America’s war for independence. 
Now, 250 years later, Sen. Angus King is giving his own warning over what he sees as the imminent collapse of American democracy under President Donald Trump. 
In an interview with writer, historian and Lincoln County resident Heather Cox Richardson, Maine’s independent senator discussed why this inflection point in American history is so resonant today.
“I believe we are in one of the most dangerous places our country has been in since the founding, because what is happening before our eyes is the collapse of the constitutional structure that the framers designed to protect us from the inevitable abuse that comes from the concentration of power,” King said, explaining that the U.S. Constitution purposefully divided power up between the Legislature — or Congress — the President and the courts. 
“But here’s what’s happening right now,” he said, “is that the executive branch is seizing more and more power.” 
He said “there are two levels of things going on here: one is bad and the other is dangerous. There are bad things like what [the Department of Government Efficiency] is doing and messing around with Social Security and this sending people to El Salvador. That’s really bad, but what’s dangerous is the way it’s being done, by essentially violating the plain intent of the Constitution, by having the President be the legislator and the executive at the same time, that’s a recipe for the loss of our freedom.”
And for people who are “cheering on his agenda” and saying, “Well, we don’t care that he’s doing all this unconstitutional stuff,” King said, “They’re going to care because eventually the Eye of Sauron is going to turn on them,” referencing the evil, all-powerful symbol in J.R.R. Tolkien’s “Lord of the Rings.”
And while the courts are “doing pretty well so far” in pushing back, King repeatedly expressed alarm over what he sees as Congress’ abdication of its duty and the complicity of his Republican colleagues.
“What we have is a test between institutional loyalty, constitutional loyalty, and party loyalty. And so my Republican colleagues — who I’m doing everything I can to sort of peel off to say, ‘Enough is enough’ — so far, haven’t been willing to take that step,” he said. “They’re in control of the Senate, they’re in control of the House, and they’re looking at getting their tax bill through and getting their budget bill through, rather than what’s happening to the structure of our government in the process.”
He also said that he believes many Republicans are not speaking up because of Trump’s threat to challenge dissenters in upcoming elections by running primary opponents financed by billionaire advisor Elon Musk.
King also spoke about the frustration among voters, acknowledging the most frequent question he hears is, “I’m mad as hell. What can I do?’”
“They can get together, they can talk to each other, they can reach out to their neighbors,” King said. “They can participate in peaceful demonstrations that indicate to people like me that people want change, that they’re concerned…They also can communicate to our offices.”
He said American people actually have a lot of power and that members of Congress are influenced when they hear stories from constituents about how Trump’s actions are having a real negative impact on their lives — such as someone whose Social Security check didn’t come or a veteran unable to get a medical appointment.
“Believe it or not, anecdotes matter,” King said, “and so when people are in touch with us, if they are specific about what’s going on and what’s affecting them in their real life, that’s the kind of thing that breaks through with members of Congress — that their constituents are being hurt — and that’s one of the reasons I think we may see some progress on this over the next two or three weeks, because the damage that’s being done is just starting to manifest itself out in the communities.”
But, King acknowledged, he is “an optimist.”
As for Paul Revere, Maine is celebrating his midnight ride with a series of events that will feature the lighting of lanterns and lighthouses throughout the state. Organized by the Maine Semiquincentennial Commission, several of the ceremonies will include the reading of the famous 1861 poem by Portland native Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, “Paul Revere’s Ride,” which concludes:

So through the night rode Paul Revere;
And so through the night went his cry of alarm
To every Middlesex village and farm,—
A cry of defiance, and not of fear,
A voice in the darkness, a knock at the door,
And a word that shall echo forevermore!
For, borne on the night-wind of the Past,
Through all our history, to the last,
In the hour of darkness and peril and need,
The people will waken and listen to hear
The hurrying hoof-beats of that steed,
And the midnight message of Paul Revere.

They warned of budget problems if the Legislature continued to expend more money than collected in revenue. (Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — A bullish revenue picture for state government in Kansas through the current and next fiscal years couldn’t sugarcoat projections the state budget could end up with a $730 million deficit by 2029 if lawmakers continued spending more than what was collected in revenue.
The new forecast released Thursday by the Consensus Revenue Group, which is responsible for updating financial reports twice each year, indicated the treasury could expect to collect $157 million more in the current fiscal year than projected in November. In addition, the state could receive $219 million more in the 2026 fiscal year than predicted six months ago. The state general fund takes in about $10 billion annually.
The estimating group said the state’s budget ending balance could sit at $2.29 billion at close of the current fiscal year in June, but fall to $1.73 billion in 2026, $903 million in 2027 and $63 million in 2028 before going under water by $730 million in 2029.
Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly said the latest revenue estimates from university economists and state financial experts could be viewed as positive news.
“In reality, they underscore the seriousness of the financial predicament ahead,” Kelly said. “The bizarre and irresponsible budget gimmicks used by the Republican-led Legislature spend more than the state takes in by nearly $800 million per year. Ultimately, this will lead to a historically large budget deficit.”
She said the revenue update came one week after GOP House and Senate leaders adjourned the annual legislative session. Traditionally, the Legislature remained in session until the revenue forecast was updated so spending and tax policy could be refined.
“Kansans need to demand their legislators restore fiscal sanity and fairness when they return in January,” Kelly said.
House Speaker Dan Hawkins, a Republican from Wichita, said the Legislature successfully assumed a more direct approach to developing the new state budget and produced a plan that spent less than recommended by the governor.
He said the Legislature was confident in the wisdom of the three-year, $1.2 billion income tax cut adopted in the 2024 special session and the additional tax relief approved in the 2025 regular session.
“Be wary of those who want to make political hay by invoking the budget boogeyman and screaming that the sky is falling,” Hawkins said. “These positive consensus revenue estimates reaffirm we’re headed down a smart and sustainable path as we continue to monitor all fiscal data as it’s available.”
 
A structural imbalance
Adam Proffitt, secretary of the Kansas Department of administration and budget director for the governor, state tax reductions and elevated spending were significant drivers of the state’s financial prospectus.
He said the extended assessment was that state revenue could remain below expenditures during the next four years unless a different approach was taken by state lawmakers.
“We need to get more structurally balanced,” Proffitt said. “This is something we’ve been watching for a couple years. I think the governor’s been pretty consistent in her message that we need to be showing fiscal restraint and making sure we have a good handle on expenditures and don’t grow them unnecessarily.”
Proffitt said the projected $800 million decline in state budget ending balances in fiscal years 2027, 2028 and 2029 would leave the state in dire financial condition. An unknown for forecasters, for a couple more months after close of tax season, was the influence of retroactive income tax cuts approved by the state lawmakers in 2024, he said. In addition, he said, the forecast changes didn’t take into account the influence of tax bills on Kelly’s desk nor possible federal policy shifts.
Shirley Morrow, director of the nonpartisan Kansas Legislative Research Department, said during a news conference at the Capitol the solution to the state’s future budget predicament was obvious.
“To me,” she said, “the simple answer — and this is going to be too simple — is increase revenue and decrease expenditures.”
Morrow said forces that could influence the state’s bottom line were tied to volatility in the U.S. economy. Factors capable of altering the fiscal assessment included persistently elevated inflation, trade policy changes relevant to agriculture exports and aviation manufacturing, shifting unemployment rates, sustained high interest rates, cuts in federal funding to states, monetary policy and geopolitical dynamics, she said.
“The reoccurring theme throughout the forecast cycle is an increased volatility in the state’s economy,” Morrow said.
She said the Kansas inflation rate in 2025 was raised from 2.3% to 2.9% while the estimate for inflation in 2026 was raised from 2.2% to 2.5%. Kansas has added 3,300 jobs over the year, she said.
In terms of agriculture, she said, crop producers continued to struggle with low commodity prices and high input costs. Livestock producers were looking to expand beef herds based on continued escalation in market prices, she said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Proffitt-and-Morrow-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-18 11:03:16.031178

(Photo by New Jersey Monitor)A coalition of businesses and the state’s biggest police union are sparring over a New Jersey law meant to protect prosecutors, judges, and cops by shielding their home addresses and phone numbers from disclosure.
Businesses that use data for things like real estate, lending, fraud detection, background checks, and credit reporting say changes legislators made in 2023 to strengthen the law instead allowed data privacy companies to profit by suing and seeking damages from companies that don’t remove personal information from the internet. The businesses recently formed the Public Safety Information Protection Coalition to fight the state statute, known as Daniel’s Law.
The businesses asked a federal judge last June to declare Daniel’s Law an unconstitutional, impermissibly broad violation of the First Amendment. The judge rejected that challenge, and last month the U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals agreed to review the judge’s ruling.
John Molinelli, a former Bergen County prosecutor, is the coalition’s spokesman.
“Daniel’s Law serves a noble purpose, but the law is broken,” Molinelli said in a statement last week.
The New Jersey State Policemen’s Benevolent Association wrote an open letter Wednesday to Molinelli, accusing him of falling prey to “the data industry’s latest ploy to avoid accountability for putting public servants in harm’s way.” The letter, signed by state PBA President Peter Andreyev and 43 leaders of other PBA chapters statewide, said members of the data business coalition “pretend to be advocates for Daniel’s Law while secretly seeking to undermine and weaken it.”
“They would rather spend millions of dollars spreading misinformation and lies than simply comply with a law meant to keep us and our families safe,” the letter says.
New Jersey enacted Daniel’s Law in 2020. It’s named after federal Judge Esther Salas’ son, Daniel Anderl, who was slain at the judge’s home that year by a gunman who wanted to harm Salas. Since state legislators passed the law soon after Anderl’s death, they have expanded it several times to protect additional public workers, including child welfare investigators.
Lawmakers amended it in 2023 to establish mandatory monetary damages for violations, among other things. The following year, Atlas Data Privacy Corp. filed 118 class-action lawsuits on behalf of law enforcement officers against data brokers accused of ignoring requests to remove the officers’ data from various websites.
Molinelli had called such lawsuits predatory, accusing Atlas of “engineering” the 2023 legislative amendments so that it could sue violators and reap the profits.
The PBA officials defended the lawsuits, saying the data brokers and businesses Molinelli represents continue to violate Daniel’s Law by selling law enforcement officers’ private information despite the ongoing litigation and officers’ pleas to them to stop.
“What you call ‘predatory lawsuits’ we call a fight to protect ourselves and our families from predators who seek to cause us harm,” the PBA officials wrote.
PBA officials have cited a leaked conference call, first reported by Politico earlier this month, during which data brokers and industry groups plotted how to weaken the law.
Molinelli, in a statement from a spokesman, said the PBA’s letter fails to address how best to protect public officials who do not want their personal information published.
“Many of those who signed this letter are friends of mine and I respect them greatly for what they do. Their misplaced efforts to attack me for wanting Daniel’s Law to work as intended are regrettably shrouded by the financial plans of Atlas Data Privacy Corporation,” he said.
Daniel’s Law has inspired similar legislation in other states, even though it has prompted several legal challenges here.
Still, legislators aim to expand it further.
One bill now in the Statehouse pipeline would extend privacy protections under Daniel’s Law to court administrators and deputy court administrators, while another would allow people protected under the law to use a post office box or address other than their home address on their driver’s license or other official identification cards.
Salas has recently said judges and their families have received unsolicited pizza deliveries from unknown persons — a signal, she says, that the people know where the judges live — and some of them are sent using her late son’s name.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)South Minneapolis along East Lake Street is a thriving immigrant neighborhood with block after block of family-run restaurants, churches and more businesses than you can shake a stick at, ordinarily serving a bustling foot traffic.  
As Sahan Journal reported not long after inauguration day, employees there are now scared to come to work. Customers are afraid to walk in the door. ICE raids and the threat of them frighten an entire populace witless, wreaking economic havoc.  
Undocumented immigrants already had to worry about being exploited by unscrupulous employers. 
In President Trump’s America, those who need protection are instead being targeted; the outrageous, mistaken deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador is just one example we know about. 
The U.S. Department of Justice, which not long ago prided itself on its independence, has now become a key lever in Trump’s effort to reverse the gains of the Civil Rights Movement. The first step was freezing the work of the Civil Rights Division, as the Washington Post first reported, “halting much of its investigative activity dating from the Biden administration and not pursuing new indictments, cases or settlements, according to a memo sent to the temporary head of the division.” 
That means stopping cases enforcing important civil rights statutes, like the 1964 Civil Rights Act, the Fair Housing Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act. 
Here in Minnesota the changes are affecting federal oversight of the Minneapolis Police Department and its long history of unconstitutional policing, including off-the-charts levels of racial profiling as revealed in the 2023 DOJ report. 
What was catalogued in that report, former U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland said, “made what happened to George Floyd possible.” After Floyd’s murder and days of ensuing carnage, it took nearly five years to put the federal police reform agreement in place. 
But Trump’s DOJ seems uncommitted to getting final approval. DOJ attorneys recently won a second 30-day stay on the pending consent decree case between Minneapolis and the federal government.
Trump’s right-wing pals are even pressuring him to pardon Derek Chauvin for his federal crimes. Thankfully, Trump can’t pardon the state murder charge. But still, expect all hell to break loose on Minneapolis streets should he issue the pardon for the federal civil rights charge.
Even if Trump holds off on the pardon, the prospects of a federal consent decree to oversee MPD aren’t great. The head of the once-proud DOJ Civil Rights Division is Harmeet Dhillon. As NBC News reported, Dhillon has “alleged fraud in the 2020 election, accused Google of discriminating against white men and spoken out against state laws to protect doctors who perform gender-affirming surgery for transgender minors.”
Luckily, the Minnesota Department of Human Rights already put its own agreement with the city of Minneapolis in place, but federal oversight would be good belt-and-suspenders insurance. 
Trump, who was once accused by the federal government of refusing to rent to Black tenants, issued an executive order “ending illegal discrimination and restoring merit-based opportunity,” which is double-talk, the effect of which is de facto legalized discrimination. 
“Federal civil-rights laws protect individual Americans from discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, [protections supporting] equality of opportunity for all Americans. As President, I have a solemn duty to ensure that these laws are enforced for the benefit of all Americans,” he wrote.  
He is, to be crass about it, taking a leak on our heads and calling it rain.
This gravely impacts women, racial and ethnic and religious minorities, lesbians and gays, not to mention the now frequently targeted transgender community. Everyone who isn’t a white heterosexual male and counts on established civil rights legislation is straight out of luck. The DOJ’s Civil Rights Division was created to protect citizens from the actions of bigots after the Civil War, enforcing the 13th, 14th and 15th Amendments to the Constitution. They expanded that brief to protect other vulnerable folks. Now, contrary to Trump-speak, the DOJ is about the business of doing exactly the opposite.
A key area is the workplace, where women, Black and immigrant workers have made strides thanks to enforcement of anti-discrimination laws and, yes, diversity efforts by both the federal government and corporations. With Trump turning the clock back, Meta, Ford, McDonald’s, Walmart and Target all got in line. 
It took public outrage to restore recognition of the likes of the late Colin Powell, Jackie Robinson and other prominent Black veterans after Trump’s order to scrub government websites of “DEI,” i.e., Black achievement. 
Sadly, a prevailing reality is that some people of color like Justice Clarence Thomas — a disgrace to Thurgood Marshall’s legacy — will pull the ladder up after them. Where the clarion call once was “We shall overcome,” their credo is “I have overcome.” 
Erec Smith of the Koch-funded Cato Institute endorsed Trump’s sweeping edict, saying “the Trump administration isn’t getting rid of the concepts of diversity, equity and inclusion as they are typically understood. He’s getting rid of the critical social justice version, which is inherently divisive.”

(Corrie Boudreaux for Source NM)The Bible says pain and agony engulfed Jesus Christ in the final hours before his death, while fear of the future gripped his followers. 
Fear once again is prevalent in churches as Christians gather for Easter. This time it is because “roughly one in 12 Christians in the United States are vulnerable to deportation or live with a family member who could be deported.” 
That’s according to a new report, “One Part of the Body: The Potential Impact of Deportations on American Christian Families,” published by a coalition of Christian organizations.
“Many American Christians, we suspect, have not realized that among immigrants at risk of deportation, the vast majority — four out of five — are fellow Christians,” the report’s introductory letter said. 
Noem cheers court order requiring immigrants without legal status to register and carry documents

The report’s purpose “is to invite American Christians — within our congregations and within the halls of governmental power — to recognize that, if even a fraction of those vulnerable to deportation are actually deported, the ramifications are profound — for those individuals, of course, but also for their U.S.-citizen family members and, because when one part of the body suffers, every part suffers with it, for all Christians.”
Four South Dakotans with government power who could make a difference are U.S. Senators John Thune and Mike Rounds, U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson and U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.
Government action, or inaction as the case may be, is the source of great distress in churches today. 
“There is just a strong emphasis on fear,” among parishioners, said The Very Rev. Kristopher Cowles, vicar for Hispanic ministry in the Catholic Diocese of Sioux Falls. He also serves Our Lady of Guadalupe church in Sioux Falls. 
“They don’t know from day to day what is going to happen.”
Cowles is featured prominently in the report, which said that “80 percent of all of those at risk of deportation are Christians. Sixty-one percent of those at risk of deportation are Catholic, 13 percent are evangelical and 7 percent are adherents to other Christian traditions.”
The report notes that President Donald Trump said during his campaign there were as many as 20 million deportable immigrants present in the U.S. How many will be targeted for deportation is unknown. 
Noem, who said in a 2021 Newsmax interview that “our faith is everything — we love the Lord,” has been the tip of the spear in deporting immigrants.
The report quoted Cowles saying government policies often cause the problem. “So many of our laws make it nearly impossible to have a course forward even if they want to do so legally,” he said of immigrants. 
He wished there was more empathy among elected leaders. 
“I wish lawmakers would understand the sacrifices that so many people have gone through, and what so many of them are running from,” he said in the report. “Some are just looking for a better life and some are looking to just survive.”
Most people, the report said, want violent criminals and those with final orders of deportation to be the priority for immigration enforcement. But they don’t want blanket deportation. 
Reforming the immigration system must be a priority. Congress, which largely created this humanitarian problem, has the power to solve it.

Thune, Rounds and Johnson all say religion is central to their lives. 
Thune has said his faith in Christ is “the foundation for pretty much everything I do.” 
Rounds, in an interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network, reflected on faith and his job. “I think part of it goes back to asking for wisdom and asking for the ability and the help to do what’s right, to make the right decisions. A lot of decisions are not black and white. It’s a matter of making the right decision long term. That saves lives. I think that’s something that all of us as Christians should be doing.”
Johnson has said “faith, family and freedom are pillars of our nation.”
Given their faith, and their powerful political positions and ability to influence this issue, they should not sit on the sidelines. It shouldn’t be that hard to sway Congress when 87% of voting members say they are Christians. 
Cowles reminded everyone that Jesus was an immigrant. “He made his way from Galilee and Judea into Egypt to flee the persecution of Herod.”
He pointed to the Catholic Church’s position on immigration. It says people have a right to migrate to sustain their lives and the lives of their families. It acknowledges that a country has a right to regulate its borders but that it should regulate them with “justice and mercy.”
“That is the issue we are running into right now,” he said.
Cowles added that Jesus “would stand with the immigrants because he understands the persecution of people.”
As Christians gather in churches this week and gaze at the image of Christ nailed to the cross, the authors of the “One Part of the Body” report have one wish.
“We hope that you will prayerfully ask the Lord what part you should play at a time when so many of your brothers and sisters are fearful of the impacts of deportation.”

(Photo by Jackie Llanos/Florida Phoenix)Juan Carlos Lopez-Gomez held his mother in a tight embrace and wept following his release from the Leon County Jail Thursday evening, where the U.S. citizen was held after his arrest for illegally entering Florida as an “unauthorized alien.”
An official with Homeland Security Investigations in Tallahassee took Lopez-Gomez, a 20-year-old born in Georgia, to a Wendy’s near the jail, where he reunited with his mother after spending more than 24 hours under arrest following a traffic stop in which he was a passenger.
Lopez-Gomez appeared shellshocked and spoke quietly as he discussed what happened when a Florida Highway Patrol trooper pulled over the car he was in on his way to work from Cairo, Georgia, to Tallahassee. The trooper made the traffic stop because the driver was going 78 mph in a 65 mph zone, according to the arrest report.
“I feel fine leaving that place, I felt bad in there. They didn’t give us anything to eat all day yesterday,” he told the Florida Phoenix in Spanish. He added that he had asked the trooper who made the arrest why he was being taken into custody, because he was a U.S. citizen.
His mother, also in Spanish, said the days ahead will be tough for the family and worries that Lopez-Gomez and his sisters will live in fear of deportation despite having been born in the country. She told the Phoenix she planned to sue over her son’s arrest.
“I don’t have a way to pay all the people who are helping us. People from other states have called us, and we don’t have a way to pay them; we can only thank them,” Gomez-Perez said.

The pair didn’t reunite until the evening, after Lopez-Gomez’s first court appearance earlier in the day. Leon County Judge LaShawn Riggans ruled Thursday morning that she lacked jurisdiction to release him because U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement had formally asked the jail to hold him for 48 hours.
After Riggans’ inspection of his Social Security card and birth certificate, which an advocate waved in the courtroom, the judge said she found no probable cause for the charge.
“In looking at it, and feeling it, and holding it up to the light, the court can clearly see the watermark to show that this is indeed an authentic document,” Riggans said.
The arrest record the trooper filed states that Lopez-Gomez had said he was in the country illegally but that he had handed over his ID. There was no mention of the Social Security card on the arrest report. However, Lopez-Gomez told the Phoenix he had shown the trooper a copy of his Social Security card and Georgia state ID.
The HSI agent who took Lopez-Gomez to Wendy’s directed questions to a spokesperson, who didn’t respond to the Phoenix’s request for comment or questions as of this publication.
After the reunion with his mom, Lopez-Gomez returned to the parking lot of the jail, where 30 protesters had been demanding his release. They met him with cheers and hugs.
Lopez-Gomez will have to return to the Leon County Courthouse on May 6. He was charged under a recently passed law that a federal judge has temporarily barred the state from enforcing, further calling into question the validity of his arrest, the charge, and detention.
Gov. Ron DeSantis signed SB 4-C into law on Feb. 14, and U.S. District Court Judge Kathleen Williams blocked its enforcement on April 4.
The law makes it a misdemeanor for undocumented immigrants over age 18 to “knowingly” enter Florida “after entering the United States by eluding or avoiding examination or inspection by immigration officers.”
Two other men who were in the car with Lopez-Gomez, the driver and another passenger, also made their first appearances on the same charge on Thursday. The driver was also charged with driving without a license.

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)Alaska’s voter-approved mandate for paid sick leave has not yet gone into effect, but some lawmakers are already trying to reduce the number of workers who would benefit from it.
A bill pending in the Alaska Legislature, House Bill 161, would exempt businesses with fewer than 50 employees, a change from the 15-employee threshold in the labor-rights initiative that voters approved in November. The bill would also drop seasonal workers from the mandate for accrued paid sick leave.The bill was introduced on March 28 by Rep. Justin Ruffridge, R-Soldotna, with Rep. Julie Coulombe, R-Anchorage, as a co-sponsor. Both are members of the House minority. It has the support of a key majority member; House Majority Leader Chuck Kopp, R-Anchorage, signed on as a co-sponsor on April 14.
It addresses Ballot Measure 1, a three-part citizen initiative that will raise Alaska’s minimum wage and protect workers against any employer-imposed political or religious meetings, as well as mandate paid sick leave, based on time accrued over work periods. Voters approved Ballot Measure 1 by a 58-42 percent margin. The new law is set to go into effect on July 1.
Ruffridge and Coulombe, during the bill’s first hearing on Wednesday, described the proposed changes as modifications that fit within the state constitution’s limits. While the constitution forbids sweeping changes within two years to any voter-passed initiatives, the bill “in no way seeks to repeal or change some of the key provisions of Ballot Measure 1,” chiefly the minimum-wage hike that was probably the most popular element, Ruffridge told the House Labor and Commerce Committee.
Coulombe said the changes amounted to a “few tweaks” that are necessary to help small businesses.
“What will happen if we don’t try to amend this a little bit, make the language a little cleaner and make it more adaptable to small businesses, we have small businesses that might actually just go out of business,” she told the committee.
The bill has the enthusiastic backing of the Alaska Chamber, a business group that campaigned against the ballot measure.
In testimony at Wednesday’s hearing of the House Labor and Commerce Committee, Kati Capozzi, the chamber’s president, called it a “vital correction” to a pending mandate that burdens small businesses, especially in the tourism and hospitality sectors.
“Maybe well-intentioned or maybe not, Ballot Measure 1 introduced a one-size-fits-all mandate that failed to account for Alaska’s unique economic landscape,” she said.
Echoing earlier comments by Ruffridge and Coulombe, Capozzi said voters were less aware of Ballot Measure 1’s sick-leave provisions than they were of the wage hike. “It’s become clear that many voters did not understand the true and full implications of the ballot measure,” she said.
One of the leaders of the Ballot Measure 1 campaign vowed to work against House Bill 161.
“For me, it’s really important that the voters will be respected here,” Joelle Hall, president of the Alaska AFL-CIO, said Thursday. “The voters have made this choice. The voters have said, ‘We would like this to happen.’ And whether or not the business groups can use a smaller group of people, the Alaska Legislature, to try to undo their will — that is something we will fight.”
Hall disputed the bill sponsors’ characterization of the changes as minor.
“This, in my mind, is a substantial change. It is repealing the benefit that the voters voted for,” she said.
She also disputed the contention that voters had not paid attention to the sick-leave provisions in the initiative.
“That is just silliness, because we were very clear that it was earned sick leave,” she said. “Almost all of our advertising was about that, so almost every single ad we put out was about somebody’s earned sick-leave benefit.”
She said she was expecting some pushback on the bill’s provisions, but not this soon.
“It’s a little bit shocking to me that it’s such an aggressive overreach of what the voters passed,” she said. “I’m not surprised that they’re going to fight us on this tooth and nail every single session, to try to claw it back. I’m a little surprised they’re starting before it’s even a law.”
Alaska was not the only state where voters in November approved a mandate for paid sick leave. Similar initiatives passed in Missouri and Nebraska.
Several other states already required paid sick leave prior to last year’s election.

It was supposed to be a trial that would be closely watched by California homelessness advocates, public defenders and legal experts. But instead, the case was thrown out by the judge — leaving some stakeholders wondering whether it makes sense to arrest homeless people at all.
As CalMatters’ Marisa Kendall explains, following a U.S. Supreme Court ruling last year granting local governments more authority to clear homeless encampments, cities across California have enacted more punitive policies banning public camping — including citing and arresting unhoused residents. 
But some attorneys and the unhoused residents they represent are eager to bring their cases before juries in order to demonstrate the shortcomings of enforcing camping bans and clear their names. That includes Wickey Two Hands, a 77-year-old homeless man who was poised to be the first person tried in court under Fresno’s anti-camping ban after police arrested him last year.
On April 10, however, a judge ended up dismissing all charges because the city waited too long to prosecute. 
The case’s conclusion underscores the considerable amount of time, labor and resources used — not only from the city and county, but also Two Hands’ lawyer, activists and local journalists — to enforce a policy that seeks to penalize public camping.

Ron Hochbaum, a law professor at the University of the Pacific: “When you think about all the people who were involved, from police to the city attorney’s office to judges and court clerks and so on. That’s probably hundreds of hours of work and thousands of dollars wasted. And that money would be better spent by simply offering Mr. Two Hands housing without arresting him.”

What will happen with new crop of CA crime bills?

In the aftermath of voters passing Proposition 36 in November to increase penalties for theft and other crimes, some Republican legislators have found their tough-on-crime bills are advancing further than before in a Legislature dominated by Democrats, reports CalMatters’ Jeanne Kuang.
Senate GOP Leader Brian Jones of San Diego, for example, authored a bill that would add regulatory guardrails before the Department of State Hospitals releases sexually violent predators. In his fourth attempt to push the proposal, the Senate Public Safety Committee unanimously approved the bill earlier this month. Last year the proposal died in the Assembly after advancing through the Senate, and in previous years the bill never passed through committee. 
Jones says that after Prop. 36, he noticed a shift among Democrats and their attitudes toward stricter incarceration measures.

Jones: “The smart Democrats are getting it. The voters spoke overwhelmingly.”

But some criminal justice advocates don’t see it that way. Tinisch Hollins, the executive director of Californians for Safety and Justice, pointed out that the Legislature is also advancing bills the organization is sponsoring, including ones that would expand the state’s efforts to clear criminal records and require the California Department of Corrections to apply more good behavior credits to reduce prisoners’ time served.

Hollins: “Even Prop. 36 wasn’t a referendum on reform. There’s still plenty of support for different approaches to public safety that really address the root cause and prevent crime from happening in the first place.”

More federal attacks on CA college students

As part of President Donald Trump’s push to cut assistance to undocumented immigrants, his administration is revoking one vital policy that allows California to help students who don’t have legal status, writes CalMatters’ Adam Echelman.
In 2022 the federal TRIO programs — which provides financial assistance and counseling to low-income and first-generation college students — granted California special permission to also serve students who don’t have legal status. But in March, the U.S. Department of Education said it was revoking waivers to California colleges and universities that use federal funds to “provide services to illegal aliens.”
It’s difficult to track how many California college students lack legal status, but some data suggests that it could number in the thousands — most of whom attend community colleges. More than 100,000 California students are reportedly enrolled in TRIO programs.

Often, not much",Marisa Kendall,,,,,https://calmatters.org/housing/homelessness/2025/04/homeless-camping-california-trial/,"Wickey Two Hands was supposed to be the first person tried for camping in Fresno. Instead, after the city and county poured resources into his case, it was dismissed at the last minute.","In summary
Wickey Two Hands was supposed to be the first person tried for camping in Fresno. Instead, after the city and county poured resources into his case, it was dismissed at the last minute.


Wickey Two Hands sat at the defense table on a recent Thursday morning, holding in his lap the red baseball cap he’d doffed out of respect for the judge. 
The 77-year-old homeless man was supposed to be the first person tried in court under an ordinance Fresno passed last year making it a crime to camp in all public places. Over the past six months, he’d spent hours in a courtroom, arriving early for each hearing. He’d packed up and moved his campsite multiple times, trying to find out-of-the-way spots where he could avoid getting arrested again. 
But instead of sending Two Hands’ case before a jury, the judge — on the day trial was supposed to begin — dismissed all charges. The reason? The city waited too long to prosecute. 
Two Hands’ case shines a spotlight on a contradiction seen around the state in recent months. California cities are passing ordinances left and right that allow police to arrest or cite unhoused people for camping on their streets and sidewalks, or in their parks. Police are making arrests. But when it comes to prosecuting, trying or sentencing people for violating these ordinances, some cities haven’t been able to follow through. In many cases, prosecutors aren’t filing charges. If people are charged, their cases often are dismissed quickly. Two Hands’ case was a rarity for how close it came to trial. But in the end, it too was thrown out.
That has some wondering: what’s the point of arresting people at all?
Two Hands’ case was set to be a bellwether to see if Fresno’s camping ban — under which police have made several hundred arrests already — would hold up before a jury. The city and county — as well as Two Hands’ lawyer, activists and even local journalists — invested a considerable amount of resources in the case before it was ultimately dismissed last week without a trial or any public hearings on its merits.
“They wasted a lot of time and money pursuing this case,” said Ron Hochbaum, a law professor at the University of the Pacific who specializes in homelessness and poverty law. “When you think about all the people who were involved, from police to the city attorney’s office to judges and court clerks and so on. That’s probably hundreds of hours of work and thousands of dollars wasted. And that money would be better spent by simply offering Mr. Two Hands housing without arresting him.”

CalMatters analyzed the resources that went into prosecuting Two Hands’ case: 
At 8:40 a.m. on Oct. 14, 2024, two Fresno police officers came across Two Hands and his belongings on the side of the road and arrested him for camping in a public place and illegally possessing a shopping cart. 
Over the next six months, Two Hands attended four hearings in three different courtrooms. Before each hearing, he dropped off his belongings at a friend’s house and then caught the bus to the downtown Fresno courthouse, sometimes arriving as much as an hour early so he didn’t miss anything. After court, an advocate sometimes drove him back to his campsite. On April 10, the day his trial was supposed to begin, he missed work to attend court, skipping his scheduled shift at a wrecking yard and with it, his chance to earn money for food and other necessities for the day. 
City and county resources also went into each hearing. Public funds paid for the presence of a judge, a bailiff and staff from the city attorney’s office. The city brought on outside law firm Manning Kass to help prosecute the case. 
Kevin Little, a private attorney who specializes in civil rights litigation, signed on to defend Two Hands pro bono. Little estimates he spent between 100 and 150 hours on Two Hands’ case. He had two additional staff members helping him, and they put in another 50 to 100 hours. The week the case was supposed to go to trial, Little said he spent a couple nights working in his office until 3 a.m.

Another attorney, Patience Milrod, was also in court on April 10. She was there to represent Pablo Orihuela, a Fresnoland journalist who had been covering Two Hands’ case and received a subpoena to testify on behalf of the prosecution. Attorney Karl Olson was standing by to contest a subpoena issued to Fresno Bee reporter Thaddeus Miller, according to the Bee.
In addition to Orihuela and Miller, journalists from CalMatters and ABC30 were there to cover the trial.
About two-dozen activists and local community members also showed up at the courthouse — some arriving as early as 7 a.m. despite work and childcare obligations — to support Two Hands on the day his trial was set to start. Activist Wes White drove two-and-a-half hours from Salinas to be there. 
After all that, Judge Brian Alvarez dismissed the case. He found that the trial should have started by March 6, and going past that date would violate Two Hands’ right to a speedy trial. Two Hands’ supporters filed out of the courtroom and filled the hallway, cheering, until a bailiff asked them to keep it down.

“I’m really shocked by how much money and resources they put into this,” said advocate Dez Martinez, who recently helped Two Hands get into a shelter. “There was so much money used in this so they can make a point because they don’t want to lose a case. It just bothers me that they used that (many resources) and finances into punishing Wickey instead of doing what I did: sit down and talk to him, figure out why does he not want to go inside.”
The trial originally was set to start Feb. 20, but the city asked for a delay, which was granted by Judge Carlos Cabrera. Judge Alvarez appeared to disagree with that ruling. 
The city blamed Two Hands’ team for the case getting thrown out. The defense’s subpoena request forced the city to review an extensive amount of documents, which took extra time, Deputy City Attorney Daniel Cisneros told the court. The city also had tried to prevent the case from going to trial by offering Two Hands a plea deal, which it said would come with a shelter bed. Two Hands declined, instead opting to try to clear his name through a trial. 
“The City’s position is to continue to offer plea deals to defendants who accept housing and services offered by the City,” the city attorney’s office said in an emailed statement from Noemi Schwartz. “It is unfortunate that this defendant declined the services and housing offered by City at a congregate shelter at Travel Inn and will likely end up back on the streets without shelter and assistance.”
Fresno’s new camping ordinance went into effect in September, making it a misdemeanor to sit, lie, sleep or camp in a public place. But most people arrested aren’t prosecuted, and even fewer come close to a trial. Fresno police made 322 arrests under that ordinance from October 2024 through January 2025. During that time, the city attorney’s office filed charges in just 132 camping cases. The defendant failed to show up in court in more than half of the cases in which charges were filed. Only one other case, in addition to Two Hands’, was listed as headed toward trial. 
It’s a similar situation in other cities, from the Bay Area to Southern California. Police in Los Angeles made 238 camping arrests last year, and the city attorney’s office declined to file charges in two-thirds of those cases. In San Francisco, nearly four in five illegal lodging arrests made since August 2024 have not resulted in charges, according to the San Francisco Chronicle.
“Cities and district attorneys aren’t interested in prosecuting the cases because they know they don’t have enough room in jail and prisons to incarcerate everyone who is experiencing homelessness,” Hochbaum said. And they know slapping someone with a fine won’t stop them from sleeping outside, he said.
Instead, he said, many cities are using the threat of arrest to force unhoused people to move when they want to clear an encampment. 
For the time being, Two Hands is sleeping inside after five years on the street. Martinez said she got him a 90-day stay at a city-run shelter — with no help from the city attorney’s office. 
“(It’s) a pretty good day in my life,” Two Hands said outside the courthouse, after his case was dismissed. “77 seasons I’ve been here, you know, I think I deserve it.”
While Two Hands was hesitant to accept a shelter bed at first, Martinez said after spending months talking to him, getting to know him and showing up at his side to his court dates, she won his trust. She promised to keep fighting to get Two Hands into permanent housing, sign him up for Social Security, help him access health care, and get him whatever else he needs. 
“It’s not that he wants to stay outside,” Martinez said. “He’s tired. He doesn’t want to die on the sidewalk. He didn’t want to be given something and have it be taken away.”
Fresno still has yet to try anyone for sleeping outside, but that could change. Little is representing another unhoused man who was arrested for camping — and plans on bringing that case to trial. 
“I hope the message the city gets,” Little said, “is leave the unhoused alone. Help them and don’t prosecute them. But if you are going to choose unfortunately to prosecute these cases, then you better come ready, because we’re not backing down.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/041025_Homeless-Case_AP_CM_35.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-18 09:04:08.818398

Chuck Bonham
Charlton H. Bonham is the director of the California Department of Fish and Wildlife.


This week, a public federal process determined there will be no commercial salmon fishing off California’s coast for the third year in a row. It’s a grim milestone for our state. 
While we will see some recreational ocean fishing, we’re at the low-water mark. With so few fish available, we know this won’t be enough to meet the demand of our state. That’s hard news in hard times.
Thirty years ago, the idea we would be implementing — yet alone discussing — these restrictions would have been unthinkable. Back then, millions of salmon swam through the rivers of California every year. It was a bountiful, thriving species.
But last year, the number of adult salmon in the Sacramento Index, a critical measure of the Sacramento River salmon population and an indicator of the overall health of California’s salmon, shrunk to roughly 100,000 fish. It’s a tiny fraction of salmon’s former might.
The reasons for the decline are numerous and complicated. Decades of severe drought, climate disruption, water management challenges and habitat loss threaten the future of salmon in California. The loss of salmon would wound California deeply.
Salmon are the basis of a multibillion-dollar fishing economy that creates jobs across the state. They support thriving forests, rivers and floodplains, and serve as one of the most popular seafood choices across the country. Salmon provide vital subsistence to numerous California Tribes. Recreational salmon fishing trips form the basis of family legend and lore.
For the salmon lovers among us, these are dark times. But I see glimmers of hope.
Two weeks ago, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife revealed the progress on California’s “Salmon Strategy for a Hotter, Drier Future.” It was an update on the strategy Gov. Gavin Newsom released last year, which outlined dozens of key action items the state must take to better support healthy salmon populations.
In the last year alone, state fish and wildlife and its partner agencies have made critical headway on nearly 70% of the action items set by Gov. Newsom. Another 26% are already done.
California finished removing the outdated and obsolete Klamath River dams, allowing for a free-flowing river and access to cold-water habitats blocked for more than a century.
California’s initiative to fast-track approvals for salmon restoration projects led to the streamlining of more than 60 important projects to support salmon populations over the past year.
Fish and wildlife has also worked with the State Water Resources Control Board to develop flow recommendations in drought-prone watersheds like the Scott and Shasta rivers and Mill and Deer creeks, ensuring salmon populations have enough cold water to survive during dry periods.
Investments to expand and modernize the state’s fish hatcheries, ensuring California is supporting the production of a resilient salmon population, have increased fall run production from state-operated hatcheries in the Central Valley by over 9.7 million fish.
The state’s salmon strategy was designed for long-term salmon support. But we’re already seeing early benefits, some that even surprised fish and wildlife officials. Ten days after the final Klamath dam came down, state scientists spotted salmon swimming north of the dam sites into Oregon. 
Experts originally estimated that would take 10 years.
Data shows that, while salmon numbers from 2024 are down, California saw the highest number of jacks (2-year-old fish) returning to the Central Valley since 2019. Jacks are an important predictor of the number of adult salmon that will return to spawn the following year.
In Lagunitas Creek, there’s been a 60% increase in spawning of endangered Coho salmon. In Mendocino County, adult coho returns have almost quadrupled their 15-year average.
To be clear, these wins are just the beginning. The road to reviving California salmon will be long. But these successes give me hope and the drive to keep fighting for salmon.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/110723-Yreka-And-Klamath-Falls-LV_CM_13.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-18 09:04:08.818398

Are Democrats shifting their way?,Jeanne Kuang,,,,,https://calmatters.org/politics/2025/04/california-democrats-crime/,A California Republican state senator finds his crime bills getting a warmer welcome this year. Democrats say they’re just responding to their voters.,"In summary
A California Republican state senator finds his crime bills getting a warmer welcome this year. Democrats say they’re just responding to their voters.


Republican state Sen. Brian Jones has been trying to block sex offenders from being released from prison through California’s elderly parole program for several years. Last week, for the first time, his bill to do so made it out of its first committee. 
It was just one of many votes Senate Bill 286 will have to survive in a long road ahead in the Capitol, but it caught Jones’ attention. In a Legislature dominated by Democrats who often shelve Republican tough-on-crime proposals, the approval from the Senate Public Safety Committee was unanimous.
“I don’t think it would have passed a committee last year,” said Jones, the Senate minority leader.
California’s Democratic legislators — who for years have been passing progressive measures designed to reduce sentences and lessen mass incarceration by emphasizing more rehabilitative solutions to crime — were dealt a blow last fall when an overwhelming majority of voters approved Proposition 36. 
The measure backed by business owners, police and Republicans, increased sentences for some drug and theft crimes, partially undoing more lenient measures that voters approved just 10 years ago. Though many Democrats opposed the measure, they’re now tasked with providing funding to carry it out.
Jones, of San Diego, said he’s seeing Democrats inching toward stricter incarceration measures as a result. He said he saw a window to bring back the legislation this year.
“The smart Democrats are getting it,” he said. “The voters spoke overwhelmingly.”
The Public Safety Committee also gave unanimous approval this month for another bill Jones authored, SB 379, that would add regulatory guardrails before the Department of State Hospitals releases sexually violent predators. It’s his fourth year in a row pushing that measure; the proposal passed the Senate and died in the Assembly last year, after failing to clear a single committee both years before that. SB 432, authored by a different Republican senator to increase penalties for selling or giving fentanyl to minors, also got unanimous approval in the committee this month. 
Freshman Sen. Jesse Arreguín, an Oakland Democrat who chairs the committee, said his fellow Democrats don’t intend to return to an era of overcrowded prisons or harsh penalties for lower-level crimes. But he acknowledged they’re also shifting their thinking in response to their voters, and called that approach “pragmatic.”
“That was the direction I was given as chair of the Public Safety Committee, was that we need to provide more balance in terms of how we look at criminal justice policy,” he said, referring to the Democratic caucus. “Just focusing specifically on restorative justice and prevention, and not focusing on accountability (for offenders), that’s not where the voters are now.”
Criminal justice reforms still advancing
So far, the shift hasn’t been enough to worry Tinisch Hollins, executive director of Californians for Safety and Justice, a group that advocates for reduced imprisonment and pushed for the 2014 sentencing changes that voters approved.
She pointed to bills her organization has sponsored that are also advancing through the Legislature, including legislation to expand the state’s efforts to clear criminal records to give past offenders second chances, and to require that the California Department of Corrections apply more good behavior credits to reduce prisoners’ time served. With the state tight on cash, she said she doesn’t believe lawmakers will be eager to significantly increase imprisonment and sees a “consensus that we shouldn’t go back that way.”
“Even Prop. 36 wasn’t a referendum on reform,” Hollins said. “There’s still plenty of support for different approaches to public safety that really address the root cause and prevent crime from happening in the first place.”
Any stricter measures the Legislature approves this year will ultimately be narrow, with Republicans pointing to extreme examples to push their case.

Jones’ elderly parole bill targets a program the Corrections Department first created in 2014, in response to a court order to reduce prison crowding, that allows prisoners who are older than 60 and have served at least 25 years of their sentences to petition for release. 
He tried in 2019 to restrict those convicted of sex offenses from being eligible; the bill never got a hearing. In 2020, lawmakers quietly lowered the eligibility for some prisoners to age 50, if they’ve served at least 20 years, though many have not been approved for release. The following year, Jones proposed a bill undoing that change for sex offenders, which went nowhere.
Between January 2021 and June 2024, the Board of Parole Hearings released 1,762 people through the elderly parole program, corrections spokesperson Emily Humpal wrote in an email. Department data analyzed by CalMatters show that while more people have been released under the elder program since 2021, the rates at which the board grants parole fluctuate between 14% and 20% each year, hovering just above the board’s overall parole-granting rate. The department would not immediately provide a breakdown of their convictions, nor of how many of those released were between the ages of 50 and 60.
Now, 12,303 people currently imprisoned – nearly 14% of the prison population – are eligible for either form of elderly parole, Humpal said.
Jones’ bill would bar those convicted of sexual felonies such as rape and child sexual abuse from parole eligibility at age 50. It would not affect their eligibility upon turning 60, or the parole eligibility date in their original sentences. 
He also proposed blocking the earlier eligibility from people convicted of murder, but Arreguín’s committee removed that provision with Jones’ agreement before voting to advance the bill. 
Proponents of the measure, including San Diego County District Attorney Summer Stephan, say victims shouldn’t be forced to relive the trauma of parole hearings and the prospect of their abusers’ release before the end of their original sentences. 
They point to Mary Johnson, who identified herself as the childhood victim of rape and sexual abuse by her uncle. The abuser, Cody Klemp, was originally sentenced in the 1990s to 170 years. In 2023, under the elderly parole program, the Board of Parole Hearings recommended his release — then rescinded the decision last year. His next hearing is scheduled for 2029.
“Suddenly, I was no longer a 49-year-old woman, but I was a 13-year-old trapped and powerless and fighting again,” Johnson said in a press conference. “No victim’s family should have to fight over and over again to ensure that a dangerous predator serves the sentence that they were given.”
Closing the doors on the rehabilitated?
A group of criminal justice reform and civil rights advocates including the American Civil Liberties Union opposes the legislation, arguing it would close the door on those who have been rehabilitated in prison and pose less of a public safety risk. Studies have found the chances of re-offense decrease as a defendant ages. 
Gary Harrell, who was given a life sentence for his participation in a murder, testified that despite becoming eligible for parole in 1984, he wasn’t released until about 40 years later, after he had gone before the parole board about 20 times. He said in the last two decades of his incarceration, he turned his life around, and now works a day job while in his spare time giving homeless Sacramento residents food and hygiene products. 
“I have taken so much from others and now it’s time to give back and do my part to make the world a better place,” he said. “I hope you can see that the people who will be impacted by this bill are people like me who have changed and want to give back.”
Arreguín said he proposed removing Jones’ exclusion of people convicted of murder to focus the bill on sex offenses. 
That tactic has yielded bipartisan backing in the last legislative session.
In 2023, Republican Sen. Shannon Grove of Bakersfield pushed a bill to increase penalties for child sex trafficking. Democrats in the Assembly Public Safety Committee resisted but, after a public outcry, Gov. Gavin Newsom stepped in with rare public comments in support of the legislation, which ultimately won more Democratic support and his signature.
Last year Grove’s bill to increase penalties for soliciting a minor for prostitution — targeting the buyers of sex — also prevailed. Senate Democrats carved out exclusions for 16- and 17-year-olds who are allegedly solicited, out of concern it would inadvertently rope in older teenagers who aren’t actually involved in or victims of trafficking. (The legal age of consent is 18.) This year, Grove is turning heads with a bill, Assembly Bill 379, co-authored with an Assembly Democrat, to undo those exclusions and apply the changes to all minors. 
Jones acknowledged the tactic of focusing on sexual offenses is an incremental step toward tightening criminal sentences overall. 
“We’re smart enough to know how far we can go,” he said.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/031723-SAN-QUENTIN-REHABILITATION-CENTER-MHN-08-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-18 09:04:08.818398

(Photo: Alejanda Rubio/Nevada Current)President Donald Trump’s efforts to carry out mass deportations and detain legal permanent residents and green card recipients has created increased “fear and uncertainty” throughout the state, immigrant groups have told Nevada lawmakers. 
Two bills proposed this session, which recently passed out of committee, seek to provide a measure of reassurance to anxious families. One would protect students from being taken from school by immigration officials. Another would establish a procedure for families to select potential temporary guardians if parents are deported. 
“While we may not have control over the events that are unfolding on a national scale, we do have the power to make a meaningful impact within our own communities,” Noé Orosco, the Government Affairs Manager with Make the Road Nevada, told lawmakers in March. 
The Trump administration has defied court orders seeking to restrict aggressive federal immigration tactics, and rescinded long-standing policies that prohibit immigration enforcement in “sensitive” places such as schools, churches, and hospitals.
‘Afraid to attend school’
Assembly Bill 217 would prohibit school employees from granting permission to immigration officers to enter a school, or provide student records, including information on a student’s family, without a warrant.
“Across the nation, we have seen instances where officers have gone to schools and have intimidated teachers, staff and students,” said Democratic Assemblymember Cecelia González, who sponsored the bill. “This is really a response to the fears of our students, staff and families and mixed-status families.”
González, who presented the bill to the Assembly Education Committee in March, said Clark and Washoe county school districts already have existing policies to prevent employees from granting permission to immigration enforcement officials seeking to enter a school.
The bill would simply codify that policy and ensure other districts throughout the state follow suit. 
González sought to make a violation of the law a misdemeanor, which received pushback from Nevada Association of School Boards.
The bill was amended so the first violation “will be disciplined under the discretion of each school district.” School employees could face a misdemeanor charge for any subsequent violation. 
The original version of the bill also prevented school police from using tasers and “chemical agents” such as pepper spray on students but was edited out of the legislation to focus on immigration enforcement. 
Orosco, who presented the bill alongside González, said the legislation was needed to address “an overwhelming sense of fear and uncertainty, particularly those who come from mixed-status families.”
The anxiety students feel about losing a parent to deportation, or being taken as well, “follows them into the classroom where it severely impacts their ability to concentrate and engage in learning,” he said.
“Many students are afraid to attend school because they worry about their family safety,” he said. “The thought of immigration enforcement officers potentially being present on campuses creates an environment of distress.” 
AB 217 passed out of committee in late March with only Republican Assemblymember Richard Delong opposed.
“My concern with the bill, and I will be a no on this, is because there’s a chance that federal law could change in the future and thus we set up a situation where no matter what a school official does, they’re going to be in violation of one law or another,” he said. “I don’t want to put anyone in that position”
Democratic Assemblymember Selena Torres-Fossett, the committee chair, pointed out that “federal law can change at any point, and our state laws could be a violation of federal law at any point.”
‘Solutions that prioritize family unity’
González, along with Democratic state Sen. Fabian Doñate, are also sponsoring Assembly Bill 460 that seeks a streamlined process for selecting a temporary guardian for minors prior to any immigration action.
“I think there’s some value in the fact that individuals were coming to us with this solution, and so that’s why we’re putting that bill forward,” Doñate said during the March bill hearing.
Nevada is home to one of the largest populations of mixed-status families in the country, González said at the hearing.
A 2020 report published by the American Immigration Council estimated that “about one in seven children in the state was a U.S. citizen living with at least one undocumented family member.” Some estimates put that number in Nevada at one in 10 households 
Both figures make it likely that throughout the state “that in every single one of our districts there are hard working families that pay taxes and contribute to our community, yet live with the daily fear of separation,” González said. 
The legislation, which passed unanimously out of committee last week, would establish a form for parents or guardians to nominate a temporary guardian for a minor. 
The form would need to be signed by the parent or guardian, two “impartial adult witnesses” and notarized before being placed in the Nevada Lockbox, an electronic registry maintained by the Nevada Secretary of State.
The legislation would require “a court to consider the form requesting to nominate a guardian of a minor in determining which person is most suitable to be the guardian for the minor,” González said. 
“Regardless of where we stand on immigration policy, we can all agree that children should not bear the brunt of these challenges,” González said. “As policymakers, we have a responsibility to provide solutions that prioritize family unity, stability and the well being of our most vulnerable children.”
The original version of the bill also sought to expand eligibility for welfare support assistance for children living with guardians if an immigration order led to their separation. It also allocated $2 million to the Nevada’s Department of Education for the Trauma Recovery Grant Project, which provides funding for trauma support for children.  
Both were removed from the bill. 
“It’s not lost on me the conversations that we’ve been having about our state’s budget and what that is going to look like this session and beyond,” she said. “If we have the opportunity to include (the funding), we would love to.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/CeciliaGonzalez-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-18 09:04:08.818398

Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) was finally able to meet Thursday night with Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, the Beltsville resident who was erroneously deported last month to his native El Salvador, where he has been held incommunicado in that country’s megaprison for terrorists.
The meeting followed two days of attempts by Van Hollen to see Abrego Garcia, including an attempt earlier Thursday when soldiers turned away him and Chris Newman — the lawyer for Abrego Garcia’s wife and his mother — at a checkpoint about 3 kilometers away from the Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo, or CECOT, where Abrego Garcia is being held.
Van Hollen said that while the soldiers allowed other cars to pass, they said they had “been ordered not to allow us to proceed any further than that point.”
It is unclear what led to the the change in policy, but Van Hollen posted a photo on social media after 9 p.m. Thursday of him talking with Abrego Garcia.
“I said my main goal of this trip was to meet with Kilmar. Tonight I had that chance,” Van Hollen said in his post. “I have called his wife, Jennifer, to pass along his message of love. I look forward to providing a full update upon my return.”
Abrego Garcia, seen in the photos in jeans, a checkered shirt and a Kansas City Chiefs ballcap, appears healthy. It was a different look than the shaved heads, baggy white shorts and T-shirts and Crocs or sandals that CECOT inmates are wearing in most photos of the facility.

Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele, who insisted during a White House meeting Monday with President Donald Trump that his country had no intention of releasing Abrego Garcia, trolled Van Hollen with his own social media posts of the meeting shortly before the senator’s Thursday. Bukele mockingly referred to Abrego Garcia “miraculously risen from the ‘death camps’ & ‘torture,’ now sipping margaritas with Sen. Van Hollen in the tropical paradise of El Salvador.”
“Now that he’s been confirmed healthy, he gets the honor of staying in El Salvador’s custody,” Bukele posted.
Van Hollen unsuccessfully sought a meeting when Bukele was in Washington, and again when he traveled to El Salvador Wednesday. He was able to meet instead with Salvadoran Vice President Félix Ulloa, who denied his requests Wednesday to either visit or speak on the phone with Abrego Garcia.
The Maryland Democrat arrived in the Central American country Wednesday in an effort to help bring Abrego Garcia, whom the Justice Department admitted in court was deported in error, back to the United States, or at least check on his wellness.
A U.S. immigration judge issued a protective order in 2019 allowing Abrego Garcia, an undocumented immigrant in the U,S., to daus here because sending him back to his home country would put him in grave danger from gangs there that he said caused him to flee in the first place.
Van Hollen said that since Abrego Garcia was sent to CECOT, he had not spoken with anyone outside of the prison walls until their meeting Thursday. “This inability to communicate with his lawyers is a violation of international law,” Van Hollen had said earlier Thursday.
The senator pointed out that El Salvador is a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
“That covenant says, and I quote, ‘A detained or imprisoned person shall be entitled to communicate and consult with his legal counsel,’” he said.
Van Hollen also said he met with the U.S. Embassy in El Salvador and they discussed “the full range of important bilateral relations between the United States and El Salvador.”
White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt and other Republicans have criticized Van Hollen for making the trip, repeating the accusation that Abrego Garcia is a gang member.
Representatives for the White House and DHS did not respond to messages seeking comment Thursday.
Appeals court slams administration’s inaction
Meanwhile, Abrego Garcia’s case continues to work its way through U.S. courts as a flashpoint conflict between two branches of government that has led to the precipice of a constitutional crisis.
On Thursday, a federal appeals court panel dismantled the administration’s latest appeal, saying the government had done “essentially nothing” to attempt to return Abrego Garcia in compliance with last week’s Supreme Court order.
A three-judge panel for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit said the executive branch was due deference in conducting foreign policy, but that the administration’s inaction in seeking Abrego Garcia’s return amounted to defiance of a judicial order.
The unanimous ruling was written by 4th Circuit Chief Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III, who was nominated by Republican President Ronald Reagan. The other two judges, Robert Bruce King and Stephanie Thacker, were nominated by Democratic presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama.
“The government is asserting a right to stash away residents of this country in foreign prisons without the semblance of due process that is the foundation of our constitutional order. Further, it claims in essence that because it has rid itself of custody that there is nothing that can be done,” the panel wrote. “This should be shocking not only to judges, but to the intuitive sense of liberty that Americans far removed from courthouses still hold dear.”
The appeals ruling responded to the government’s appeal of U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis’ order this week for the Trump administration to offer evidence on how it has sought to help with Abrego Garcia’s release from CECOT.
The U.S. Supreme Court ruled last week that the Trump administration must “facilitate” — but stopped short of requiring — his return to the United States.
In unusually frank language, the 4th Circuit panel warned Thursday the conflict between the executive and judicial branches threatened the foundation of U.S. government.
“If today the Executive claims the right to deport without due process and in disregard of court orders, what assurance will there be tomorrow that it will not deport American citizens and then disclaim responsibility to bring them home?” the court asked. “And what assurance shall there be that the Executive will not train its broad discretionary powers upon its political enemies? The threat, even if not the actuality, would always be present.”
Near the end of the order, the panel urged the administration to obey the judicial branch.
“We yet cling to the hope that it is not naïve to believe our good brethren in the Executive Branch perceive the rule of law as vital to the American ethos,” the judges wrote. “This case presents their unique chance to vindicate that value and to summon the best that is within us while there is still time.”
Neither country taking action
The 4th Circuit panel pointed out that the leaders of both the United States and El Salvador claimed they had no power to return Abrego Garcia.
“We are told that neither government has the power to act,” they wrote. “The result will be to leave matters generally and Abrego Garcia specifically in an interminable limbo without recourse to law of any sort.”
During a White House visit this week, El Salvador President Nayib Bukele said he would not bring Abrego Garcia back to the United States.
The Trump administration has admitted in court that Abrego Garcia’s deportation stemmed from an “administrative error.” The administration continues to accuse him of being part of the gang MS-13, despite no charges or convictions of any criminal offenses against him, including gang-related crimes.

(Kyle Dunphey/Utah News Dispatch) Utah has rates of sexual violence that often trump the national average — according to the Salt Lake County District Attorney’s Office, 1 in 3 Utah women will experience sexual violence, compared to 1 in 5 women nationally.  
Yet this year, the state’s service providers are forced to fundraise and solicit federal money, which is increasingly short supply, after lawmakers snubbed the Utah Coalition Against Sexual Assault’s request for funding that would have gone to the state’s rape crisis programs. According to the request, the money was intended to provide “meaningful sexual prevention work,” like education and training. 
“Prevention education works. It can change the way individuals think. It can change the way communities interact. It changes relationships. It is the least funded source of service for victims in the state of Utah,” said Gary Scheller, associate director of the Rape Recovery Center.
The coalition asked lawmakers for almost $3.3 million — the Legislature’s Social Services Appropriations Committee recommended just over $1.6 million. But ultimately, funding for the coalition was not included in the final budget.

Now, with April being Sexual Assault Awareness Month, Scheller’s nonprofit, which provides advocacy for victims, clinical therapy, education and training, will be forced to fundraise and look to the federal government to fill the void.  
Lawmakers said it was a tight budget year, and a number of programs never received funding. Still, some of the programs funded by the state’s nearly $30 billion budget include $40 million in annual funds for the Utah Fits All Scholarship voucher program, $20 million in one-time funding for the state’s first-time home buyer program, and dozens of other programs and allocations that cost far more than what the Coalition Against Sexual Assault was asking for. 
“What I would like to say really loudly to our state Legislature is, what you fund reflects your priorities,” Scheller said on Thursday during an event at the Salt Lake County District Attorney’s Office marking Sexual Assault Awareness Month. “So when we see millions going here and millions going there and this being cut and that being cut, that is equivalent to the state Legislature saying, these are our priorities, these not so much.”
The Utah Domestic Violence Coalition is in a similar boat, after their request for $200,000 in annual funds was also left out of the state’s budget. The money would have allowed police departments around the state to continue to administer a critical health care service for victims of domestic violence while bolstering investigations.
Legislature snubs funding for domestic violence health care service, forcing nonprofit to fundraise

Scheller said the lack of state funds will have a “significant” impact to the Rape Recovery Center.  
The center, and other sexual assault support programs, have been sharing a $600,000 allocation from the state spread out over three years — for the Rape Recovery Center, that’s about $15,000 to $20,000 each year, according to Scheller. 
Now that the Legislature snubbed their request this year, Scheller said education and prevention programs, which are already underfunded, will continue to be spread thin. 
“These prevention and education programs, with state school board approved curriculum, where we can get into schools and talk to students about consent and healthy relationships — those will be greatly minimized. So now we’re going to go looking for other ways to continue to do that,” Scheller said. 
Sex crimes continue to be an issue in Utah. According to Salt Lake County District Attorney Sim Gill, 88 out of 100 women who are sexually assaulted in Utah will choose not to come forward. Of the 12 that do report the crime, six will likely be re-victimized “though the way that we respond to them,” Gill said. “Because we’re not trauma informed, because we’re not victim centered.” 
Data from Gill’s office shows the extent of sexual violence in the county, which fluctuates year to year. 
The office filed 81 rape charges in 2023, compared to 89 in 2024; 51 object rape charges in 2023, compared to 54 in 2024; 22 rape of a child charges in 2023, compared to 10 in 2024; 104 sex battery charges in 2024, compared to 72 in 2024; 100 lewdness charges in 2023, compared to 90 in 2024; 35 sodomy of a child charges in 2023, compared to 26 in 2024; and 20 aggravated sexual assault charges in 2023, compared to 15 in 2024. 
“I hope this encourages our policymakers to know that they need to fully fund our institutional partners and our community partners,” Gill said.

(Anna Barrett/Alabama Reflector)Tensions mounted in the Alabama Legislature Thursday as Republicans pushed through several bills dealing with religion and targeting LGBTQ+ Alabamians and immigrants. 
The legislation passed despite attempts from minority Democrats in both chambers to counter passage of the legislation. In the Senate, the majority GOP used cloture petitions and procedural moves to effectively prevent Democrats from debating the measures.  
Speaking after the House adjourned Thursday, Rep. Barbara Drummond, D-Mobile, said HB 437, sponsored by Rep. David Faulkner, R-Mountain Brook, establishing a shark alert system and the first bill on the agenda, was the exception to a day where time “was spent on things that will not move Alabama forward.” 
Other than that, the agenda consisted of an expansion of the state’s “Don’t Say Gay” law; a ban on drag performances; a mandate for displaying the Ten Commandments in public schools; a bill allowing local law enforcement to enforce federal immigration laws and a bill renaming the Gulf of Mexico the “Gulf of America.”
Drummond said the Legislature should be preparing for cuts to federal spending proposed by the Trump administration and the Republican-controlled Congress. The possible reduction include more than $800 million to Alabama Medicaid, a cornerstone of health care in the state. 
“We’ve got about, what about less than 10 days left in this session. And when we leave and those cuts happen, our children, as well as the citizens of Alabama, are going to be left with no recourse,” Drummond said. “What will they do? How will we fill these holes?”
High tension in the Senate
The atmosphere in the Senate became tense as majority Republicans clotured debate six times and kept Democratic senators from speaking on bills. Republican senators spoke at length on each of their own bills and asked for their bills to be read at length after calling for cloture, effectively excluding Democrats from debate for most of the Thursday session.
That led to a brief, heated exchange between Senate Minority Leader Bobby Singleton, D-Greensboro, and Lt. Gov. Will Ainsworth. Singleton, who tried to get Ainsworth’s attention several times, asked what he needed to do to be recognized.
“Do we have to shout?” Singleton asked.
Ainsworth maintained Singleton was out of order and he would be recognized when appropriate.
“Here’s the deal – It’s my decision who to recognize. For seven years, right now seven years, since I’ve been in here, always to the sponsor and I always go back to the sponsor and I’m going to continue doing that,” Ainsworth said to Singleton.
Senate Pro Tempore Garlan Gudger, R-Cullman, said in a statement sent during the session that “Senate Republicans are serious about promoting conservative policies.”
“Senate Republicans are holding the line. We’re standing up for Alabama families and fighting for the values that make this state such a special place to live, work, worship, and raise children,” Gudger said in the statement.

‘Fundamentally unconstitutional’

Democrats in the House got more opportunities to speak, though Republicans clotured debate on the “Gulf of America” bill.
Thursday was the 23rd day of the 2025 legislative session. The Legislature can meet for up to 30 days in a 105-day calendar period. The last day the Legislature can meet is May 20. 
“The Legislature is not taking any action. The leadership of the state has not taken any action to put forth information so we can be working on a plan to help the people in our town, our state, absorb some of these cuts, or we rearrange some of the things we are doing to make up for some of the things that’s going to be lost,” Rep. Sam Jones, D-Mobile, said.
Rep. Ontario Tillman, D-Bessemer, criticized the agenda, saying most of the bills would end up in court and cost Alabama over $500,000, like previously challenged laws. 
“The number one thing that we did today was taxpayers money by passing out of this house bills that are fundamentally unconstitutional on its face,” Tillman said. “There will be a ton of challenges to these bills if they become law.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_9167-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-04-18 09:04:08.818398

“This bill will expand the existing prohibitions that are currently in K-5 schools on the classroom discussions of gender identity or sexual orientation,” he said.

The chamber adopted a committee substitute 76-8 that removed a portion of the bill that would prohibit educators from referring to students by their preferred gender if it conflicts with their assigned sex at birth.
Rep. Phillip Ensler, D-Montgomery, objected to the measure, saying kids would be less receptive to learning if they did not feel welcome in a classroom. 
“If they don’t trust a teacher, if they think a teacher doesn’t like them or use them differently or views them as unequal, they’re not going to be as open to learning,” he said.
Gidley rebutted, saying students could still confide in a teacher, but the teacher has to stick to the curriculum during instructional time. He said he has received complaints from a student that said their teacher could not teach without mentioning “all things gay and transgender.” He did not say, and has previously declined to say, which school this happened in.
“That is not part of the curriculum, or what the parents signed up for, and not what the parents are paying for,” he said.
Rep. Neil Rafferty, D-Birmingham, the only openly gay member of the House, used his debate time to address LGBTQ+ Alabamians.
“I want you to know you are not the problem. You are not broken, and you’re absolutely not alone,” Rafferty said. “They’re not theories. They’re not talking points, not threats to be neutralized. They’re people. They’re Alabamian, and they deserve better than what we are offering them right now.”
The bill now moves to the Senate.
The House also passed a bill that prohibits public schools and libraries from hosting drag performances in the presence of children without parental consent.
HB 67, sponsored by Rep. Scott Stadthagen, R-Hartselle, passed 76-9 with no discussion. The legislation defines drag performances as “a performance in which a performer exhibits a sex identity that is different from the sex assigned to the performer at birth using clothing, makeup, or other physical markers.”
The bill now moves to the Senate.

Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), right, meets with Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Maryland resident who was erroneously deported to El Salvador by ICE agents last month. (Photo courtesy Sen. Van Hollen)Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) was finally able to meet Thursday night with Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, the Maryland resident who was erroneously deported last month to his native El Salvador, where he has been held incommunicado in that country’s megaprison for terrorists.
The meeting followed two days of attempts by Van Hollen to see Abrego Garcia, including an attempt earlier Thursday when soldiers turned away him and Chris Newman — the lawyer for Abrego Garcia’s wife and his mother — at a checkpoint about 3 kilometers away from the Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo, or CECOT, where Abrego Garcia is being held.
Van Hollen said that while the soldiers allowed other cars to pass, they said they had “been ordered not to allow us to proceed any further than that point.”
It is unclear what led to the the change in policy, but Van Hollen posted a photo on social media after 9 p.m. Thursday of him talking with Abrego Garcia.
“I said my main goal of this trip was to meet with Kilmar. Tonight I had that chance,” Van Hollen said in his post. “I have called his wife, Jennifer, to pass along his message of love. I look forward to providing a full update upon my return.”
Abrego Garcia, seen in the photos in jeans, a checkered shirt and a Kansas City Chiefs ballcap, appears healthy. It was a different look than the shaved heads, baggy white shorts and T-shirts and Crocs or sandals that CECOT inmates are wearing in most photos of the facility.
Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele, who insisted during a White House meeting Monday with President Donald Trump that his country had no intention of releasing Abrego Garcia, trolled Van Hollen with his own social media posts of the meeting shortly before the senator’s Thursday. Bukele mockingly referred to Abrego Garcia “miraculously risen from the ‘death camps’ & ‘torture,’ now sipping margaritas with Sen. Van Hollen in the tropical paradise of El Salvador.”
“Now that he’s been confirmed healthy, he gets the honor of staying in El Salvador’s custody,” Bukele posted.
Van Hollen unsuccessfully sought a meeting when Bukele was in Washington, and again when he traveled to El Salvador Wednesday. He was able to meet instead with Salvadoran Vice President Félix Ulloa, who denied his requests Wednesday to either visit or speak on the phone with Abrego Garcia.
The Maryland Democrat arrived in the Central American country Wednesday in an effort to help bring Abrego Garcia, whom the Justice Department admitted in court was deported in error, back to the United States, or at least check on his wellness.
A U.S. immigration judge issued a protective order in 2019 allowing Abrego Garcia, an undocumented immigrant, to stay in the U.S. because sending him back to his home country would put him in grave danger from gangs there that he said caused him to flee in the first place.
Van Hollen said that since Abrego Garcia was sent to CECOT, he had not spoken with anyone outside of the prison walls until their meeting Thursday. “This inability to communicate with his lawyers is a violation of international law,” Van Hollen had said earlier Thursday.
The senator pointed out that El Salvador is a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
“That covenant says, and I quote, ‘A detained or imprisoned person shall be entitled to communicate and consult with his legal counsel,’” he said.
Van Hollen also said he met with the U.S. Embassy in El Salvador and they discussed “the full range of important bilateral relations between the United States and El Salvador.”
White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt and other Republicans have criticized Van Hollen for making the trip, repeating the accusation that Abrego Garcia is a gang member.
Representatives for the White House and DHS did not respond to messages seeking comment Thursday.
 Appeals court slams administration’s inaction

Meanwhile, Abrego Garcia’s case continues to work its way through U.S. courts as a flashpoint conflict between two branches of government that has led to the precipice of a constitutional crisis.
On Thursday, a federal appeals court panel dismantled the administration’s latest appeal, saying the government had done “essentially nothing” to attempt to return Abrego Garcia in compliance with last week’s Supreme Court order.










“This should be shocking not only to judges, but to the intuitive sense of liberty that Americans far removed from courthouses still hold dear.”

SB 5, sponsored by Sen. Chris Elliot, R-Josephine, would remove the board’s appointing authority and increase its membership by one, from 16 to 17 members. The governor would be the appointing authority for most seats, including members from each congressional district, with eight at-large appointments coming from the speaker, president pro tempore, and the minority leaders of the House and Senate.
“What this bill does is make those appointments not self-appointments, where they may continue to appoint themselves or their friends, but rather appointments from other elected officials that are accountable to the people of the state of Alabama,” Elliot said on the floor.

The Department of Archives & History did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Currently, the Alabama Department of Archives and History has two trustees from each congressional district and two additional at-large members, plus the governor or their designees. The Senate must approve each appointment, which Elliot kept in the proposed bill.
Elliot said when introducing the bill that while the governor gets a majority of appointments, he tried to ensure geographical diversity and kept “standard diversity language … to assure that the membership of the board is inclusive and reflects the racial, gender, geographic, urban and rural and economic diversity of the state.”
Senate Republicans killed debate on every bill Thursday, and Democrats did not have a chance to speak on the board legislation. After the Senate adjourned, Sen. Bobby Singleton, D-Greensboro, said that “this is all about DEI” and that the board has not done anything wrong to warrant the restructuring.
“This is a board that allowed someone, a third party, to come in to be able to utilize their facilities to be able to do history about gay and lesbians in this state. That’s what this is all about,” Singleton said.
Elliot was one of several Republicans who attacked the Archives Department for hosting a presentation on LGBTQ+ history in Alabama in June 2023, claiming the board is not accountable to elected officials, calling it a “unicorn.”
Elliott then introduced a bill in the redistricting special session in mid-2023 to strip Archives of $5 million, which did not pass.
He also introduced a similar bill for the 2024 legislative session that would have given state officials and legislative leaders the power to appoint board members, while keeping the board size the same. The bill passed the Senate and a House committee but did not reach the House floor.

In response to economic uncertainty, the University of Missouri System is imposing immediate hiring restrictions, purchasing controls and slowing spending.
The cost-saving measures, which aim for a minimum $16 million in savings for fiscal year 2025, were presented Thursday at the Board of Curators meeting in Rolla.
While the system “remains well positioned with a strong balance sheet,” broader pressures on the higher education sector are spurring such cuts, said Ryan Rapp, UM System executive vice president for Finance and Operations.
One of the key concerns is potential cuts to federal research funding, such as those from the National Institutes of Health.
“NIH is the largest funder of university research throughout the United States. And so to replace the level of funding that potentially can be at risk is very significant,” UM System President Mun Choi said. “We will continue to make the case to NIH and other agencies and educate them on the value of our research so that the funds will continue to flow to the University of Missouri.”
Part of the system’s financial strategy, Rapp said, is keeping administrative spending low and maintaining current academic spending.
The system spends just over a quarter of its labor budget on administration, Rapp said, compared to a 38.5% benchmark average. Additionally, 56.8% of its labor budget is allotted to academics, exceeding the 52.5% average at peer institutions.
The University of Missouri has also cut educational expenses per degree awarded by 20% since 2017, according to Rapp’s report. More “moderate” tuition increases are expected, with state appropriations projected to rise by 1.5%. The curators increased tuition by 5% for all undergraduates in May 2024, and will vote on tuition and fee rates for fiscal year 2026 at its May meeting.
Even amid the UM system’s economic stress, Choi boasted increased application rates for fall 2025 at all four universities. First-time college applications showed double-digit increases with MU at 12%, the University of Missouri-Kansas City at 15%, Missouri University of Science and Technology at 15% and the University of Missouri-St. Louis at 5%.
“We are very proud of the work that our faculty, staff and administrators have done to share the message that we provide a very high-quality, affordable education at our universities,” Choi said.
The curators also approved two new degree programs at the meeting: a doctoral program in human development and family science at MU and a masters in geospatial engineering at Missouri S&T.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-04-18 11:15:00+00:00,CT Mirror,CT could withhold driver’s licenses from tax delinquents,Keith M. Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/18/ct-tax-delinquents-drivers-licenses/,The measure is sparking pushback from some who say it unfairly targets the poor while CT treats wealthy delinquent taxpayers with kid gloves.,"Faced with a slumping economy and likely big cuts in federal aid, state legislators are once again weighing whether to turn delinquent taxpayers over to collection agencies — and block renewal of their driver’s licenses or vehicle registrations.
But the measure also is sparking pushback from groups that say it unfairly targets the poor even as Connecticut treats wealthy delinquent taxpayers with kid gloves.
“If we want people to work and pay off tax debt, we can’t take their driver’s license in the meantime,” said Jeff Gentes, a lawyer with the Connecticut Fair Housing Center specializing in fair lending and foreclosure issues. “It’s an abuse of government power.”
Violette Haldane, executive director of Advocacy to Legacy, a Hartford nonprofit that teaches youth leadership and civic engagement, said the bill pending before the Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee is “very punitive.
“And to take away someone’s driver’s license [when] that has nothing to do with driving, nothing to do with safety, just seems so wrong.”
The bill raised by the committee is designed to whittle down state government’s estimated $3 billion tax gap — the margin between what it’s owed and what it currently collects.
Gov. Ned Lamont’s administration reported the 2022 tax gap in January as directed by the legislature. It also notified legislators that the Department of Revenue Services is facing a real challenge in resources.
DRS Commissioner Mark Boughton said the department is seeking authorization to hire attorneys to help with collections from delinquent taxpayers who have left Connecticut. Boughton said the state faces “thousands of thousands” of cases like this, with an aggregate outstanding debt of about $258 million.
But critics note the committee’s bill is much broader in scope than the tax department’s current request.
First, it authorizes DRS to contract with collection agencies as well as with lawyers. Second, they can use these to pursue delinquents residing both in and out of Connecticut.
Legislators balked three years ago when the Lamont administration sought permission to sell delinquent tax debt to private collection agencies.
The Internal Revenue Service’s Taxpayer Advocate Service, an independent office within the IRS, classified privatized collections as one of the IRS’ “most serious problems” in its 2017 report to Congress.
About 44% of all taxpayers targeted by private collection agencies on behalf of the IRS “are at risk of economic hardship,” according to the report. And the median income of households targeted by collection agencies that later entered into installment agreements to repay their debt was $38,021 per year.
“With unacceptable frequency,” the Taxpayer Advocate Service added, “taxpayers whose debts are assigned to PCAs [private collection agencies] are placed in installment agreements they cannot afford.”
Critics also noted that while Connecticut continues to explore using collection agencies that target poor households, its history with wealthy tax delinquents is marked by extreme patience.
The state offered seven tax amnesty programs — a benefit typically used by households and businesses that can afford specialized legal counsel or accounting services — between 1990 and 2021. That means once every 4.6 years, on average, the state waives certain penalties on overdue filers to enhance revenue collections.
Besides raising the issue of collection agencies, the new legislation also stipulates that once a filer’s tax payment is overdue for 30 days, the state would notify that person that in another 60 days, the delinquent status would be reported to the Department of Motor Vehicles.
The license wouldn’t be suspended. But unless the taxpayer successfully appeals the matter, the DMV “shall not issue or renew” that person’s license or vehicle registration until delinquent taxes, including interest and other penalties, have been paid.
Gentes, who also supervises a clinic at Yale Law School, said that provision — like the option to employ collection agencies — is designed chiefly to intimidate low-income residents who lack the resources to overcome a temporary loss of transportation.
“We should not be using government to punish poor people,” he added.
The committee drafted the measure largely in response to the administration’s tax gap report. But, according to that report, most of Connecticut’s tax gap isn’t tied to the low-income households that, critics say, the bill would target the most.
According to that analysis, nearly 80% of Connecticut’s uncollected taxes involve under-reporting of income, a problem typically connected with businesses and households that can afford tax attorneys and accountants. 
Another 14% involves filers who don’t pay the full amount they claim to owe, and 6% involves those who don’t file altogether.
Complicating matters, the department’s contingent of auditors, who are essential to targeting underreporting, has been shrinking for more than a decade, according to the tax gap report.
DRS had 228 auditor positions this fiscal year, down 20% since 2012 and 11% since Lamont became governor six years ago.
Boughton said most states audit 3% of tax returns each year. Connecticut audits less than 1%.
Rep. Maria Horn, D-Salisbury, co-chairwoman of the Democratic-controlled committee, said the measure remains a work in progress, adding that she and others on the panel have several concerns. The finance committee must complete action on all bills it had raised by Thursday.
Horn said while Connecticut should seek ways to recoup delinquent tax dollars, particularly from taxpayers who leave the state, it cannot craft a system that targets one income group. She added that the need for more auditors to tackle the largest portion of the tax gap also must be addressed.
“I do believe DRS is understaffed,” she said.
Rep. Joe Polletta of Watertown, ranking House Republican on the finance panel, said he also wants lawmakers to make a serious effort to reduce tax delinquency — but in a fair manner across all income groups.
“If you owe a single dollar to the state of Connecticut, you should pay in a timely manner,” he said. “No one should get preferential treatment.”
But Polletta said he thinks withholding driver’s licenses for tax reasons only will make it harder for many households to pay what they owe. And he noted DMV Commissioner Antonio Guerrera testified before the committee that administering the withholding of driver’s licenses and vehicle registrations would be a burden on the agency and should be stripped from the bill.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025_0107_SR_CapitolMugs_071-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-18 08:01:30.211429

(Getty Images)There are some big opinions on the overall impact of the property tax bill that lawmakers passed and Gov. Mike Braun celebrated. I don’t think it’s either as good or as bad as some believe — but today, I want to focus on some smaller provisions that deserve notice.
They aren’t sexy, like a $300 homeowner credit or a business personal property tax cut. But they do make a difference.
The first is a bond debt cooling-off period.
Under current law, when a local unit of government is planning to bond for a new project, it’ll often do it when another bond is set to expire. That means local officials can tell taxpayers they won’t see an increase in their tax bill. That is technically true, but they also won’t see a decrease.
Senate Enrolled Act 1 requires a one-year freeze after a bond expires so that taxpayers see the reduction.
Indiana Senate sends finalized local property, income tax plan to governor

Another change is moving all referenda votes to the general election. Schools use referenda largely for construction projects but can also hold them for school security and operational needs if they feel the state hasn’t provided what they need.
Of course, they still have to convince taxpayers to fund those needs.
For years, these votes were allowed in primary elections, when fewer Hoosiers go to the polls. Lawmakers believe moving them to general elections gives more transparency to the costs that lie above the percent caps for bills.
According to data collected by the Indiana School Boards Association, the school referendum pass rate in Indiana is 16 percentage points higher at the primary election than at the general election. The organization believes this is because primary voters are better informed and highly motivated to vote for or against the referendum. But voters in the general election are often surprised by the referendum and reflexively vote no.
Several provisions in the new law require affirmative voting on taxes, which can only be a good thing.
One section says if a unit’s assessed value remains the same, its levy cannot exceed the year before unless its fiscal body votes to do so by ordinance following a separate public hearing. Also, if assessed value does grow, it requires a decrease in the tax rate to bring in the same amount of money unless it’s affirmatively raised.
This language is meant to draw attention to the automatic nature of property taxes, which are essentially a calculation involving tax rate and assessed value.
Similarly, local income taxes — which got a lot of attention in discussion over the property tax package — will revert to zero each year. This forces an annual vote by fiscal leaders of local government to continue collecting that money.
I’m not actually sure this is necessary, and I can’t imagine state lawmakers would want to vote on the state income or sales tax every single year. But it is consistent with other moves to make the overall taxation system more open and understandable.
In the weeds
The last bits of language I want to highlight are deep in the weeds of property taxes.
The maximum levy growth quotient currently limits how much local property tax levies can rise in a year based on a six-year rolling average of non-farm personal income growth. Because of inflation, it rose to 5% in 2023 compared to 3.4% in 2019. Lawmakers last year put in an artificial cap of 4% and Senate Enrolled Act 1 extends that another year.
The bill also limits excess levy appeals by units. In that past, cities, counties and other units were allowed to ask for more revenue based on certain circumstances, such as assessed value growth and school transportation costs. Those won’t be allowed any longer, though an appeal would still be an option in case of natural disaster or other emergency.
None of these items individually — or even collectively — will likely drop your tax obligation in any massive way. But they do create a more responsive and open system so that Hoosiers can more easily understand the decisions that are being made. It also puts local officials on the hot seat instead of state lawmakers.
“They’re waving a flag, saying we’re the ones cutting your taxes … when what they’re doing is shifting everything on to the local government and saying, ‘You be the bad guys,’” Sen. Ron Alting told Based in Lafayette.
He was one of 12 Republicans to vote against the bill. Some believe it didn’t go far enough to cut property taxes.
In the end, those who simply disagree with the mechanism of property taxes will never be pleased with what occurred. But from a pragmatic standpoint, this package was more than I thought Gov. Mike Braun could get.

(Photo by Veronica Gabriela Cardenas, Pool/Getty Images)The Trump administration is moving quickly to dramatically expand the nation’s capacity for detaining immigrants who do not have legal authorization to be in the United States.
The administration has largely turned to the for-profit, private prison industry to reopen or repurpose shuttered and aging facilities — many of which have been previously criticized for poor conditions and inadequate care.
In February, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement announced it will reopen Delaney Hall in Newark, New Jersey. The detention facility, owned by private prison company GEO Group, has the capacity to hold about 1,000 people. It will become the largest ICE processing and detention center on the East Coast. The 15-year contract is valued at $1 billion.
Private prison operator CoreCivic also announced it will reopen the South Texas Family Residential Center in Dilley, Texas. The family detention site can house up to 2,400 ICE detainees, including children. The new contract will run through at least March 2030.
Private immigration detention is growing fast — again. The Trump administration is rapidly expanding immigration detention through billion-dollar contracts with private prison companies, including GEO Group and CoreCivic. Dozens of facilities may reopen across at least eight states, including places with long histories of abuse. But while some communities and states are concerned about oversight and are pushing back, others see economic opportunity.
President Donald Trump isn’t the first president to rely on private contractors to detain immigrants. Tens of thousands were held in private facilities under both the Obama and Biden administrations.
But the new contracts mark the start of a planned expansion led by Trump’s border adviser, Tom Homan, who has called for boosting ICE’s detention capacity to at least 100,000 people.
Trump has repeatedly touted his goal of staging the “largest deportation operation in American history,” vowing to deport millions of people. There are an estimated 11 million immigrants who are not legally authorized to live in the United States, according to the Migration Policy Institute, an independent, nonpartisan think tank.
Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons told attendees of the 2025 Border Security Expo in Arizona this week that he wants the agency to become as efficient at deporting immigrants as e-commerce giant Amazon is at delivering packages.
“We need to get better at treating this like a business,” Lyons said, describing his ideal deportation process as “like [Amazon] Prime, but with human beings.”
On top of expanding contracts with private operators, the Trump administration also has sent immigrants to detention facilities abroad, including Guantánamo Bay in Cuba and Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo, or CECOT, in El Salvador.
As of March 23, ICE had 47,892 people in custody, according to the government’s latest detention statistics. Yet the agency requested funding for just 34,000 beds in fiscal year 2025, according to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s budget documents. ICE, in February, released at least 160 detainees after its network of at least 107 facilities reached 109% capacity, according to internal government statistics obtained by CBS News.






During earnings calls earlier this year with stockholders, both GEO Group and CoreCivic officials described the landscape as one of unprecedented growth and opportunity. Alongside detention expansion, executives said, they expect increased demand for transportation and electronic monitoring services.
Neither company granted Stateline an interview. In an emailed statement, GEO’s corporate relations director, Christopher Ferreira, wrote: “We are proud of our record of working closely with federal, state, and local government agencies to ensure that all persons entrusted to our care are treated in a safe, secure and humane manner.”
In that same statement, Ferreira confirmed GEO is investing $70 million to expand housing, transportation, and monitoring services to meet the federal government’s immigration enforcement goals.
CoreCivic’s senior director for public affairs, Ryan Gustin, wrote in an email that “the fact is the services we provide help the government solve problems in ways it could not do alone — to help create safer communities by assisting with the current immigration challenges, dramatically improve the standard of care for vulnerable people, and meet other critical needs efficiently and innovatively. These are problems the American public has made clear they want fixed.”
Both companies are now moving quickly to reopen idle facilities, which could happen in just a few months.
 ‘Emblematic of the immigration detention system’

Private immigration detention dates to the 1980s, when companies such as CoreCivic — then called Corrections Corp. of America — began operating detention facilities. In 1984, the company converted a Houston motel into a makeshift detention center. Since then, the federal government’s use of private contractors has dramatically increased.
Today, nearly 90% of immigrants in ICE custody are held in privately operated facilities, according to the latest analysis by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a data gathering and research group.


Some immigration advocates say this growth is largely driven by profit.
“The conditions at the privately run facilities are awful, but they’re really emblematic of the immigration detention system as a whole,” Setareh Ghandehari, advocacy director at the immigration rights group Detention Watch Network, told Stateline. “They’re incentivized to cut corners.”
Just last week, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security posted a request inviting contractors to submit bids for new detention facilities, transportation, security personnel, medical services and administrative support. The contracts could total up to $45 billion over the next two years.
Over the next several months, dozens of privately operated ICE detention facilities may open in at least eight states, including California, Kansas, Michigan, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Texas, and Washington.
Several states have tried to rein in private detention within their jurisdictions, with varying levels of success.
At least four states — Illinois, Iowa, Nevada, and New York — have passed laws banning private prisons, although those measures do not apply to federal immigration detention facilities.
Illinois, which outlawed for-profit prisons in the 1990s, passed a law in 2019 that prohibits state, county, and local governments from entering into contracts with private companies to run immigration detention centers.
New Mexico legislators earlier this year considered a similar bill that would have prohibited state agencies and local governments from entering into any agreements used to detain immigrants. The bill would have required that any existing agreements end as soon as possible. The bill passed out of the House but did not get through the Senate before the session ended.
California and New Jersey enacted laws to ban private detention — in 2019 and 2021, respectively. But both laws have been ruled partially unconstitutional, allowing private companies to continue operating.
The judges determined that while the states can bar public agencies or departments from contracting with ICE or private companies, they cannot prevent private companies from entering into contracts and operating facilities within state borders.
The New Jersey attorney general’s office is seeking a federal appeals court hearing to challenge the ruling.
 Private detention oversight

Legislators in Washington state are considering a bill that would introduce state-level oversight of privately operated immigration detention facilities.

The bill would grant the state Department of Health the authority to inspect privately run detention facilities in Washington. Under the proposal, the department would be able to establish rules regarding access to phones, medical services, running water, lighting, and food safety.
State inspectors would have the authority to enter facilities at any time and impose fines of up to $10,000 per violation. The bill passed out of the House and is now under review in the Senate.
Some of the facilities slated to reopen in the coming months, including in Kansas and New Jersey, are already facing challenges related to permits and oversight.










They're incentivized to cut corners.


– Setareh Ghandehari, Detention Watch Network’s advocacy director


CoreCivic filed paperwork earlier this year to reopen its shuttered Leavenworth Detention Center in Kansas as an immigration facility. The jail, which closed in 2021, has a documented history of violence and abuse when it was previously run by CoreCivic as a pretrial lockup.
The new proposal has sparked strong public opposition.
CoreCivic initially applied for a special use permit with the city but later withdrew, avoiding the required public hearings. In turn, the Leavenworth City Commission unanimously passed a resolution requiring the company to complete the full permit process and has since filed a federal lawsuit.
In Newark, New Jersey, tensions have escalated between city officials and GEO Group over the company’s efforts to open the 1,000-bed Delaney Hall. The Newark mayor’s administration filed a legal complaint last week, accusing the company of violating local codes in a rush to complete the project.
The filing came just one day after Newark’s engineering department issued a stop-work order, halting all ongoing construction at the site. GEO plans to open the facility by this summer.

In late February, CoreCivic also announced that it has expanded its contracts with ICE to accommodate up to 784 detainees collectively at CoreCivic-owned facilities in Mississippi, Nevada, Ohio, and Oklahoma.
While some communities have pushed back against reopening detention centers over concerns about abuse and lack of oversight, others view the facilities as economic lifelines and say they offer a safer alternative than releasing detainees while their case is resolved.
Kansas state Rep. Pat Proctor, a Republican who represents the Leavenworth area, told local TV station KCTV that he was initially against the Leavenworth Detention Center becoming an ICE detention facility, but later changed his mind.
“I was very concerned they may be released,” Proctor said. “They are ICE detainees that are being held until they can be put on a bus to be put on a plane to go back to their country of origin. … I think it’s much safer for the community.”
But some academic research has found that the economic benefits of private prisons are often overstated. In many private detention facilities, basic operations such as food service and janitorial work are carried out by detained immigrants, who are paid as little as $1 a day.
 Troubling conditions

Unlike state-run prisons or local jails in states with oversight bodies, privately operated ICE detention centers are not subject to state inspections or regulations. States or local governments may have limited discretion to inspect or regulate when detainees are held in state-owned or local facilities, experts say, but even then, the extent of that oversight varies widely.
As a practical matter, experts say, there is little to no state or local oversight of federal immigration detention operations.

State legislators should focus on gathering as much information as possible about past private contracts, including how facilities operated and the challenges they faced, said Ben Eikey, manager of state training and development at the Levin Center for Oversight and Democracy, a nonpartisan organization that promotes government transparency.
Doing so, he argued, would help lawmakers make more informed decisions about how private detention centers and private prisons might affect their communities.
Internal audits and independent investigations have repeatedly flagged lapses in oversight at immigration detention centers, including those privately operated, across the country.
Although unannounced inspections by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Office of Inspector General found that ICE “generally complied” with detention standards, inspectors still uncovered troubling conditions and questionable practices at several facilities, according to a report released in September.
The report warned that these gaps undermine ICE’s “ability to maintain a safe and secure environment for staff and detainees.”
The report also highlighted concerns over “guaranteed minimums” built into some ICE contracts with private operators and state or local governments, which require the government to pay for a set number of beds regardless of whether they are filled.
Between 2020 and 2023, eight of the 17 inspected facilities cost the federal government roughly $160 million in payments for unused space, according to the report.
“Although ICE must acquire and maintain enough bed space to satisfy demand for population surges and must adjust for health and safety requirements,” Joseph Cuffari, the inspector general of the Department of Homeland Security, wrote in the report, “it must also strive for balance to avoid wasting funds on empty beds.”

A Minnesota Reformer analysis of ICE contracts also found that a gun range jointly owned by the cities of Cottage Grove and Woodbury holds one of the largest contracts for gun range leasing to ICE in the country, while a manufacturer in Anoka, Minn. provides more ammunition to the agency than any other contractor. 
Overall, contractors in Minnesota receive less in ICE contracts than those in states like Virginia and Texas, which each have had over $400 million in contracts since Jan. 2024, compared to Minnesota’s $7 million. Still, the data shows the two ways that Minnesota stands out: in producing ammunition and leasing gun range facilities to the agency. 
The findings come at a time when the Trump administration has been actively ramping up its immigration enforcement tactics, which have included a flurry of executive actions and what legal experts deem a legally questionable expansion of ICE’s reach. Immigration enforcement is becoming notably more aggressive in higher education, with hundreds of foreign students, including five from Minnesota State-Mankato, getting their visas revoked in recent days. Students and faculty nationwide have responded with protests against ICE, including at the University of Minnesota, where the existence of the gun range contract seems largely unknown. 
University of Minnesota leases gun range, making it ICE’s only existing contract with a university
The University of Minnesota has received $17,395 since 2022 to lease its Rosemount gun range to federal immigration enforcement for training, according to the spending data. The currently active contract, which ends in May, amounts to $18,867 to be paid over twelve months. 
Apprehension around immigration enforcement is high at the university, where Turkish graduate student Doğukan Günaydin was arrested and stripped of his student visa on March 27 for a 2023 drunken driving conviction, the New York Times reported. University president Rebecca Cunningham called the arrest, whose reasons were initially unknown, “deeply concerning” in a statement the day after. Elected officials quickly responded on social media, and activists organized a protest in downtown Minneapolis. 
In an email, university spokesperson Jake Ricker confirmed that the campus police department manages a firearm range on university property, which ICE, along with other law enforcement agencies, has reserved and used “for several years.” 
“As a public university, decisions about reviewing space requests” are required to be made “in a viewpoint neutral manner,” Ricker added. 
The last time another educational institution received contracts from ICE was when the Vermont State Colleges provided leadership training to the agency in 2023, according to the spending data. Johns Hopkins previously received over $1 million in ICE contracts, which, after a year of campus protests, were ended in September 2019 — though the school has since signed contracts with Customs and Border Protection, according to a Mother Jones report. 
The larger University of Minnesota community seems unaware of the agreement. Luisa Gaona, president of the university’s chapter of Mujeres Activas en Letras y Cambio Social, an organization that helped circulate a petition to support immigrants and non-citizens on campus, said she was surprised to hear about the contract. 
“I just don’t know why the university is collaborating,” Gaona said. “I don’t see the point there.” 
Gaona said that the contract will likely diminish trust in campus police among already-wary students. 
In her statement, university president Cunningham noted that campus departments “do not enforce federal immigration laws, and our officers do not inquire about an individual’s immigration status.” 
“Their focus remains on public safety, fostering trust and maintaining strong relationships across the University community,” Cunningham wrote. 
Still, Ricker previously told the campus newspaper that the university “cannot ignore federal court orders or subpoenas.” 
The Trump administration has rescinded prior protections from immigration enforcement in schools and is detaining international students with no charges. ICE had largely been targeting students who have expressed criticism of U.S. support of Israel in the Israel-Gaza war. The decision to arrest and jail Günaydin for an old DWI signals a worrying expansion of ICE’s authority, according to immigration lawyers. 


Twenty miles away from the university gun range is HERO Center and Shooting Range, a gun range jointly owned by Cottage Grove and Woodbury, Minn., that has received over $290k in contract payments from ICE since 2020, according to Cottage Grove spokesperson Phil Jents. 
That’s the second highest of active agreements ICE has with gun ranges, according to the spending database. In February alone, ICE spent $5,292 using the facility, Jents said. 
In other cities, contracts with ICE to use local training facilities have been controversial. In September 2019, Portland, Ore., police terminated a two-year contract to lease its training facility to immigration enforcement following criticism. 
Minnesota leads in ammunition manufacturing for ICE
Minnesota is also the top producer of rifle ammunition for immigration enforcement, with over $28 million in contracts since 2020. That number is driven largely by the Kinetic Group, formerly Vista Outdoors, a Czech-owned ammunition manufacturer based in Anoka, Minn. with over $6 million in active contracts with ICE. 

A 2023 press release confirms that one of the company’s brands received a contract from the Department of Homeland Security for ammunition “made exclusively for law enforcement and at our Anoka, MN headquarters,” though the press release did not give a dollar amount.

It’s just one of the 273 notifications the average teen receives daily, according to Common Sense Media.
Her focus fades and learning stalls. A United Nations study found that it can take up to 20 minutes to regain concentration after such an interruption—making the cost of distraction cumulative, not momentary.
Students spend an average of 43 minutes on their phones each school day—nearly a full class period. Over the course of a school year, that equals roughly 130 hours of missed instruction. Missouri students cannot afford these losses, especially when more than a third of the state’s fourth- and eighth-graders score below basic proficiency in reading, with similar concerns in math, as reported by the National Assessment of Educational Progress.
Research from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development shows that even the mere presence of a phone—or being seated near one—can negatively impact academic performance, particularly in math. A recent survey found that 53% of school leaders believe phones harm academic progress, while 73% report they diminish students’ attention spans. This distraction doesn’t just affect individual students; it erodes focus throughout the entire classroom.
Several St. Louis-area districts have adopted stricter cellphone bans after previous attempts failed to curb phone use in class. These early successes offer a practical roadmap for schools statewide, proving that focused classroom environments are possible with clear phone policies.
If we are serious about raising achievement and closing learning gaps, we must prioritize focus—beginning with limiting phone use during class.
The February 2025 SLU/YouGov Poll found that 70% of likely Missouri voters support banning phones during class across all K-12 schools. Nationally, 53% of adults favor similar restrictions for middle and high schoolers, and 83% of National Education Association members back a full school-day phone ban. Teachers, parents, researchers, and voters are all aligned in this rare moment of consensus on the need for change.
School safety bill advances in Missouri House with restrictions on cell phone use

Banning phones promotes equity by addressing the digital divide. Not every student has access to the latest devices, and phone use in class can exacerbate inequalities. Students with ADHD, learning differences, or trauma histories are especially vulnerable to digital distraction. Well-defined policies level the playing field, fostering more focused, inclusive classrooms.
Some families raise safety concerns, particularly in light of school shootings. However, experts recommend structured communication systems—not student cell phones. In a crisis, phones can spread misinformation, jam emergency lines, and prevent students from hearing or following safety instructions.
The Missouri House recently advanced a school safety bill that includes provisions for limiting cellphone use, reflecting ongoing discussions on how to address distractions in schools. This bill is one approach among many that seek to balance safety and learning environments, and it has garnered significant attention for its potential to create clear, student-centered policies.
While some schools have implemented phone restrictions, the lack of a statewide policy creates inequities for students, families, and teachers. A consistent framework at the state level would ensure that all schools, regardless of where they live, can create environments that support learning.
Schools don’t need to start from scratch. Many districts already use effective tools like wall-mounted phone caddies, magnetically sealed pouches, or classroom tech agreements. The goal is to create classroom norms that promote learning. With clear guidance and local flexibility, districts can implement practical, age-appropriate policies supported by staff and families.
Missouri wouldn’t be going it alone. Currently, at least 19 states have laws or policies banning or restricting cellphone use in schools or recommending local districts adopt similar measures, according to an Education Week analysis. Additionally, another 16 states have introduced similar legislation this year.
The issue of cellphone use in classrooms is complex. Finding the right balance between reducing distractions and supporting students’ needs will require thoughtful, evidence-based decisions. The stakes are high for student engagement and success, and thoughtful, evidence-based decisions will be key to shaping effective policies moving forward.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/teacher-in-a-classroom-1536x864-1-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-04-18 08:01:30.211429

Facing the continued collapse of Chinook salmon, officials this week shut down California’s commercial salmon fishing season for an unprecedented third year in a row.
Under the decision by an interstate fisheries agency, recreational salmon fishing will be allowed in California for only brief windows of time this spring. This will be the first year that any sportfishing of Chinook has been allowed since 2022.
The decision by the Pacific Fishery Management Council means that no salmon caught off California can be sold to retail consumers and restaurants for at least another year. In Oregon and Washington, commercial salmon fishing will remain open, although limited.
“From a salmon standpoint, it’s an environmental disaster. For the fishing industry, it’s a human tragedy, and it’s also an economic disaster,” said Scott Artis, executive director of the Golden State Salmon Association, an industry organization that has lobbied for river restoration and improved hatchery programs.
The decline of California’s salmon follows decades of deteriorating conditions in the waterways where the fish spawn each year, including the Sacramento and Klamath rivers.
California’s salmon are an ecological icon and a valued source of food for Native American tribes. The shutdown also has an economic toll: It has already put hundreds of commercial fishers and sportfishing boat operators out of work and affected thousands of people in communities and industries reliant on processing, selling and serving locally caught salmon.
California’s commercial fishery has never been closed for three years in a row before.
Some experts fear the conditions in California have been so poor for so long that Chinook may never rebound to fishable levels. Others remain hopeful for major recovery if the amounts of water diverted to farms and cities are reduced and wetlands kept dry by flood-control levees are restored.

 
This year’s recreational season includes several brief windows for fishing, including a weekend in June and another in July, or a quota of 7,000 fish.
Jared Davis, owner and operator of the Salty Lady in Sausalito, one of dozens of party boats that take paying customers fishing, thinks it’s likely that this quota will be met on the first open weekend for recreational fishing, scheduled for June 7-8.
“Obviously, the pressure is going to be intense, so everybody and their mother is going to be out on the water on those days,” he said. “When they hit that quota, it’s done.”
One member of the fishery council, Corey Ridings, voted against the proposed regulations after saying she was concerned that the first weekend would overshoot the 7,000-fish quota.
Davis said such a miniscule recreational season won’t help boat owners like him recover from past closures, though it will carry symbolic meaning.
“It might give California anglers a glimmer of hope and keep them from selling all their rods and buying golf clubs,” he said.
Sarah Bates, a commercial fisher based at San Francisco’s Fisherman’s Wharf, said the ongoing closure has stripped many boat owners of most of their income.
“It continues to be devastating,” she said. “Salmon has been the cornerstone of many of our ports for a long time.”
She said the shutdown also has trickle-down effects on a range of businesses that support the salmon fishery, such as fuel services, grocery stores and dockside ice machines.
“We’re also seeing a sort of a third wave … the general seafood market for local products has tanked,” such as rockfish and halibut. She said that many buyers are turning to farmed and wild salmon delivered from other regions instead.
Davis noted that federal emergency relief funds promised for the 2023 closure still have not arrived. “Nobody has seen a dime,” he said.
 Fewer returning salmon

Before the Gold Rush, several million Chinook spawned annually in the river systems of the Central Valley and the state’s northern coast. Through much of the 20th century, California’s salmon fishery formed the economic backbone of coastal fishing ports, with fishers using hook and line pulling in millions of pounds in good years.
But in 2024, just 99,274 fall-run Chinook — the most commercially viable of the Central Valley’s four subpopulations — returned to the Sacramento River and its tributaries, substantially lower than the numbers in 2023. In 2022, fewer than 70,000 returned, one of the lowest estimates ever.

 
About 40,000 returned to the San Joaquin River. Fewer than 30,000 Chinook reached their spawning grounds in the Klamath River system, where the Hoopa, Yurok and Karuk tribes rely on the fish in years of abundance.
The decline of California’s salmon stems from nearly two centuries of damage inflicted on the rivers where salmon spend the first and final stages of their lives. Gold mining, logging and dam construction devastated watersheds. Levees constrained rivers, turning them into relatively sterile channels of fast-moving water while converting floodplains and wetlands into irrigated farmland.
Today, many of these impacts persist, along with water diversions, reduced flows and elevated river temperatures that frequently spell death for fertilized eggs and juvenile fish.
 The future of California salmon is murky

Peter Moyle, a UC Davis fish biologist and professor emeritus, said recovery of self-sustaining populations may be possible in some tributaries of the Sacramento River.
“There are some opportunities for at least keeping runs going in parts of the Central Valley, but getting naturally spawning fish back in large numbers, I just can’t see it happening,” he said.
Jacob Katz, a biologist with the group California Trout, holds out hope for a future of flourishing Sacramento River Chinook. “We could have vibrant fall-run populations in a decade,” he said.
That will require major habitat restoration involving dam removals, reconstruction of levee systems to revive wetlands and floodplains, and reduced water diversions for agriculture — all measures fraught with cost, regulatory constraints, and controversy.
State officials, recognizing the risk of extinction, have promoted salmon recovery as a policy goal for years. In early 2024, the Newsom administration released its California Salmon Strategy for a Hotter, Drier Future, a 37-page catalogue of proposed actions to mitigate environmental impacts and restore flows and habitat, all in the face of climate change.
California Department of Fish and Wildlife Director Charlton H. Bonham said the decision to allow limited recreational fishing “brings hope. We know, however, that this news brings little relief” to the industry.
He said salmon “are still recovering from severe drought and other climate challenges and have not yet benefitted from our consecutive years of wet winters and other actions taken to boost populations.”
However, Artis of Golden State Salmon Association said while the state’s salmon strategy includes some important items, it leaves out equally critical steps, such as protecting minimum flows for fish. He said salmon are threatened by proposed water projects endorsed by the Newsom administration.
“It fails to include some of the upcoming salmon-killing projects that the governor is pushing like Sites Reservoir and the Delta tunnel, and it ignores the fact that the Voluntary Agreements are designed to allow massive diversions of water,” he said.
Experts agree that an important key to rebuilding salmon runs is increasing the frequency and duration of shallow flooding in riverside riparian areas, or even fallow rice paddies — a program Katz has helped develop through his career.
On such seasonal floodplains, a shallow layer of water can help trigger an explosion of photosynthesis and food production, ultimately providing nutrition for juvenile salmon as they migrate out of the river system each spring.
Through meetings with farmers, urban water agencies and government officials, Rene Henery, California science director with Trout Unlimited, has helped draft an ambitious salmon recovery plan dubbed “Reorienting to Recovery.” Featuring habitat restoration, carefully managed harvests and generously enhanced river flows — especially in dry years — this framework, Henery said, could rebuild diminished Central Valley Chinook runs to more than 1.6 million adult fish per year over a 20-year period.
He said adversaries — often farmers and environmentalists — must shift from traditional feuds over water to more collaborative programs of restoring productive watersheds while maintaining productive agriculture.
As the recovery needle for Chinook moves in the wrong direction, Katz said deliberate action is urgent.
“We’re balanced on the edge of losing these populations,” he said. “We have to go big now. We have no other option.”

Mike Bohacek, R-Michiana Shores, speaks on a bill to establish Medicaid work requirements on April 17, 2025. (Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)A signature from Gov. Mike Braun is all that remains for a Medicaid work requirements bill to become law, though such a move would require federal approval before it could go into effect.
Under Senate Bill 2, Hoosiers getting their health insurance under the Healthy Indiana Plan would need to log at least 20 work or volunteer hours a week with the overseeing state agency, a move that supporters hope will curb the program’s enrollment numbers. 
“I’d like to remind everybody who Medicaid is for: it is for our poor and our disabled. So every dollar … that is being redirected to somebody who should not be eligible, is taking a dollar away from somebody — some Hoosier — who is poor and or disabled,” said Sen. Chris Garten, R-Charlestown. 
  Sen. Shelli Yoder, D-Bloomington, pushes back against Senate Bill 2 on April 17, 2025. (Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
Every other member of the voting Republican caucus agreed: moving the bill forward on a 37-10 vote.
The program, otherwise known as HIP, covers working-age Hoosiers with low-to-moderate incomes and has been in place — in some form or another — since former Gov. Mitch Daniels’ administration. 
But Democrats decried the move, countering the belief that it would decrease costs. Senate Minority Leader Shelli Yoder, D-Bloomington, pointed to a provision that quadruples eligibility checks from an annual process to a quarterly effort.
“My concern is Senate Bill 2 will eventually continue to drive up the costs of administering Indiana’s Medicaid program. So while we’re trying to save money, the way the language sits now … will drive up costs, administrative costs, bureaucracy,” said Yoder. “… Making Indiana’s Medicaid program more complicated will only increase the likelihood of eligible Medicaid members losing their coverage.” 
She also worried that the proposal would have a ripple effect on greater health care access across the state, such as the closure of clinics and longer emergency department waits.
Breaking down budgets: Why Medicaid expenses are growing

Sen. Mike Bohacek, R-Michiana Shores, said his daughter accessed disability services under a Medicaid waiver. 
“You’ll find that those of us that rely on Medicaid are also the most defensive of Medicaid and making sure that those folks that are on the program are eligible … and are being served appropriately,” said Bohacek. “… the path that we’re going on now, it will make the entire program untenable. And this program is way too important for those that quality.”
The Urban Institute and Robert Wood Johnson Foundation estimate that imposing Medicaid work requirements could cull between 102,000-116,000 Hoosiers from the expansion population rolls, far short of the more than 250,000 who would have to be cut in order to meet the 500,000 cap suggested in an earlier version of the bill. 
Though the bill no longer includes an explicit numerical cap, the language allows the Family and Social Services Administration to limit enrollment based on funding, which Sen. Fady Qaddoura called an “appropriation cap.”
“I see this as a policy goal of capping Medicaid enrollment based on appropriations,” said the Indianapolis Democrat. “… there are other solutions. The solution is not to reduce eligibility. The solution is not to reduce appropriations.”
 Details

Republicans point to the bill as a way to save much-needed money going into the next two-year budget cycle — though the Healthy Indiana Plan isn’t funded by state dollars. Instead, the federal government pays for 90% of the insurance program while provider and cigarette taxes cover the remainder. 
Several patient and anti-poverty advocates rallied earlier this month to oppose the restrictions proposed under Senate Bill 2, including the Indiana chapter of the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network. 
Lucy Dagneau, a senior director overseeing the organization’s national Medicaid campaigns, told the Indiana Capital Chronicle that work requirements, specifically, can have a detrimental impact on those with cancer. Such constraints can “impose additional barriers to care and paperwork between cancer patients and their doctors,” Dagneau said.
“I think in a state like Indiana, it seems so unfortunate that the state would take steps backward when the Healthy Indiana Plan has been so successful and such a lifeline for people with cancer and a support in the lives of people who could be diagnosed with cancer,” said Dagneau.

According to ACS CAN, Medicaid covers the care of an estimated one in ten adults with a history of cancer and one in three children diagnosed with cancer.
“ACS has done a number of studies that show that Medicaid expansion specifically improves cancer survival rates. It reduces cancer mortality (and) it increases the likelihood that cancer patients receive timely treatment and an earlier stage diagnosis,” Dagneau said. “Pretty much across the cancer care continuum, Medicaid expansion makes dealing with cancer, preventing cancer and treating cancer better.”
Though listed exemptions to the bill’s work requirements would likely include someone diagnosed with cancer, “qualifying for and maintaining an exemption can be confusing and onerous,” according to ACS CAN. 
The biggest driver of Medicaid costs is Indiana’s aging population, many of whom rely on it to pay for nursing homes, assisted living facilities, home health aides and other long-term care costs. 
Senate Bill 2 also includes language that would assess the so-called “lookback period,” where regulators assess an individual’s financial assets before determining their Medicaid eligibility. 
“That’s actually how wealthy people get on Medicaid … you can sign all your assets over to a family member and then you have to wait five years and then you go on Medicaid,” said Sen. Ryan Mishler, R-Mishawaka. “We’re just not sure that they’re really waiting five years and we just wanted to … report on what they’re doing to claw back from those violators.”
However, like with the Medicaid work requirements and increased administrative workload, such a provision would need federal approval.

The hope is that creating an alliance between the 14 universities in the Big Ten Conference to defend “academic freedom, institutional integrity, and the research enterprise,” as the resolution reads, will make schools stronger together.
Just this week, the faculty senate at fellow Big Ten school Michigan State University adopted such a resolution, as have Indiana University and the University of Nebraska at Lincoln.

Schools are already seeing the negative impacts of President Donald Trump’s divisive rhetoric and threatening executive orders, Sandra Levitsky, a professor of sociology and law at the University of Michigan said Thursday during the faculty senate meeting. The university’s administration quickly folded to Trump’s demands to shut down diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, policies, shuttering the doors of the school’s DEI office, Levitsky said.
“The University of Michigan abandoned DEI in-part to avoid the wrath of Trump and most schools, not just ours, have been cowed into this kind of preemptive capitulation. Most schools, not just ours, have gone silent, just when we need them to speak up,” Levisky said. “Hoping that our university is going to step out of this defensive crouch is not going to be enough, because the reality is, this is an existential moment for higher education and most schools, not just ours, are genuinely terrified about what might happen next.”
U-M-Motion-to-establish-alliance
 
The United States is on the cusp of an authoritarian administration, Associate Professor of History and Gender Studies Yi-Li Wu said during the faculty senate meeting, and everyone must look themselves in the mirror and determine what they will do as democratic institutions like higher education are attacked.
And silence or eager compliance are not survival strategies, Wu said, noting that Columbia University, which has had hundreds of millions of dollars of federal funding pulled and several Pro-Palestinian students arrested, is a prime example of the reality that compromising on core values will not save schools from Trump’s wrath.
In reflecting on U of M’s smothering of the DEI office, Wu said it would appear the administration is trying to play a quiet game to stay out of the spotlight, but it won’t work.
“They apparently think that the best course is to work behind the scenes with lobbyists and to avoid making any public noise that might draw attention to us. They apparently think that ‘do it to the other guy, not us’, is a viable strategy for survival,” Wu said. “But we have seen that complying and silence do not work.”
The university’s faculty senate will have until Sunday to vote on whether to adopt the resolution.
The resolution is a “mutual suicide pact”, physics professor Keith Riles said, urging his colleagues to vote against the the Mutual Defense Compact Thursday.
It’s important to choose battles and allies wisely, Riles said, and after years of the university disregarding anti-discrimination laws, faculty members have “provoked the understandable anger of voters for whom Donald Trump is a vehicle for retribution.”
“Many of you have deluded yourselves into thinking that discrimination against whites and Asian Americans, especially males, is somehow magically permissible,” Riles said. “The Trump administration is, yes, it’s attacking this university, I understand that, but the university has much to answer for…You brought this on all of us.”
Though the Thursday meeting of the faculty senate was in large part called in response to the university’s recent decisions on DEI policies, Fred Terry, a professor of electrical engineering and computer science, said the stakes are much higher and broader.
What the Trump administration has set into motion is a regime where any research area, public discourse or curriculum that the president disagrees with will be gutted, with universities risking severe consequences if they don’t give in to Trump’s wishes, Terry said. This defies academic freedom and defiles the university’s mission to serve the state and the world through research and cultivating citizens for the betterment of the future.
But that doesn’t mean that banding together will protect schools, Terry said, but the cost of not trying presents a greater danger.
“I do have to observe that with a unified effort, we may not win, particularly in the near term. This is not a low stakes game. There may be real suffering by many in our community. We cannot engage in this fight lightly, but we cannot give up without giving up our intellectual integrity. Measures like motion one are clearly our best hope,” Terry said.
Following the faculty senate meeting, Democratic elected officials gathered at the Diag on the Ann Arbor campus to rail against the Trump administration cancelling student visas in recent weeks at schools across the country, including U of M and MSU.
It’s two weeks until graduation at plenty of Michigan schools, U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Ann Arbor) told a small crowd at the Diag Thursday, and Democrats in Congress are demanding answers about why this crackdown on visas is happening just before students are about to have their hard work rewarded on the graduation stage.

“I’m here to make this promise to all of you. We are demanding answers. No one will silence my voice. Do not let them silence yours,” Dingell told students on campus, affirming the crowd that diverse students and diverse perspectives are what makes campuses and the dialogues that can happen richer.
After announcing his campaign Thursday morning for the 2026 race for the open U.S. Senate seat to represent Michigan, Democrat Abdul El-Sayed joined the rally on campus to encourage students to “fight back” against Trump’s fear tactics.
Trump’s policies prey on people’s pain, El-Sayed said. By coercing his followers into cynicism about the economy and creating divisions between people groups, El-Sayed said Trump has won back the White House where he is implementing policies that will help his billionaire friends like Elon Musk, while leaving the middle class worse off than before.
“If we’re not willing to protect our democracy, if we’re not willing to go back to back working with one another to protect what it means to be an American, the question we have to ask ourselves is, ‘who will’,” El-Sayed said.

While Trump has used his power to pardon January 6 protestors who vandalized the U.S. Capitol and assaulted law enforcement in support of him in 2021, he’s calling for the arrest and deportation of students who speak out against his policies, U of M Junior and member of the College Democrats group Amber Henson said.
The First Amendment rights of students are on the line, and as college campuses have long been the stage of social movements throughout American history, threats to these rights must be answered, Henson said.
Leading up to Thursday, as the U of M College Democrats were organizing the rally, Henson said there was one student in the group who was concerned that their visa status would be revoked if they attended. As the daughter of Polish immigrants and as an International Studies student, the pull to protect international students and speak against federal acts to attack them is strong.
Young people have a lot to lose right now for speaking out, Henson said, but they also have a lot to gain as they face what decades of ramifications of this current administration could mean for their lives.

Phil Murphy says ""market manipulation"" is behind rising energy costs. Critics say Murphy's focus on offshore wind is to blame. (Amalie Hindash for New Jersey Monitor)The fight between New Jersey Democrats and the state’s electric grid operator escalated this week, with Murphy asking federal officials to investigate whether the company is responsible for the “exorbitant” rate increases set to take effect in less than two months. 
In a Wednesday letter to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Murphy asked officials to probe whether grid operator PJM Interconnection’s most recent electricity auction may have been “subject to market manipulation” that will result in ratepayers’ bills increasing by hundreds of dollars a year beginning June 1. 
“I believe that billions of dollars in excessive costs for consumers are the direct result of fundamental flaws in PJM’s capacity market and were foreseeable and preventable,” Murphy wrote. 
PJM operates the grid for New Jersey and 12 other states. The company held a rate-setting capacity auction last July — in New Jersey, utilities annually buy electricity supply through auctions — and the state Board of Public Utilities has blamed the auction as the “main driver of these increases.” The board announced in February it approved the new rates, resulting in increases of about 17% to 20%, depending on the service territory. 
Democrats are anxious over the skyrocketing costs, which will kick in days before voters cast their ballots in the June 10 primary, when all 80 Assembly seats and the governor’s race will be on the ballot. Lawmakers have introduced a seven-bill package they say is intended to lower costs for consumers, including bills that would set new processes to determine a utility company’s profit margins and end a surcharge tacked onto monthly bills. 
In a statement, PJM officials blamed the price hikes on “insufficient generation in-state” and denied any market manipulation in the auction. PJM echoed complaints of New Jersey Republicans who say Murphy’s focus on offshore wind projects has resulted in energy supply issues.
“Consumers are now paying the price for this failure,” said Jeff Shields, PJM spokesman. 
During a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission meeting Thursday, commission chairman Mark Christie praised PJM and said politicians have been too critical of PJM. The company is “actually deserving of praise,” Christie said.
“I think is in many ways misplaced and lot of it is because of state policies that have sort of come to a head just recently. So I just want to say that with regard to defending PJM and defending their staff who work very hard, and work in good faith, by the way,” Christie said. “I never doubted PJM’s good faith.”
Another commissioner, Willie Phillips, said that those comments were “spot on and very well said.”
Christie said during a press conference that while he hadn’t seen Murphy’s recent letter, he’s seen his complaints, adding “a lot of these problems are some 20 years in the making, and I think a lot of it is just the very construct of a mandatory capacity market.” 
State Sen. Tony Bucco (R-Morris) has argued that the state’s energy policies under Murphy have led to supply-demand imbalances, and this, rather than market manipulation or anything PJM did, caused electricity prices to soar.
“You can’t increase demand to the point where the state can’t meet it, and they don’t have the supply to meet it. When you do that, it’s purely economics,” Bucco told the New Jersey Monitor. “Prices go up, and now our residents are going to be faced with that.",https://newjerseymonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/IMG_1729_1-1024x705.jpg,,,2025-04-18 07:00:17.247106

Amid a bipartisan push to improve school safety and students’ mental health, Republican lawmakers have put forward a package of bills that aims to create a comprehensive “school-community mental health system” and put additional crisis teams in schools.
The bill package cleared a legislative hurdle on Wednesday when the House Education and Workforce Committee voted to move it forward.
Last year, the legislature passed several bipartisan school safety bills that were introduced after a student shot and killed four students at Oxford High School in 2021. Those measures took lawmakers more than three years to approve, in part, because Democrats wanted to include gun reforms in proposed measures, and Republicans wanted to leave those measures out. A bipartisan House of Representatives school safety task force also researched the issues and interviewed school and public safety officials, community members, and survivors of school shootings, including Oxford, and their families.
Democrats eventually altered their proposals to gain support from Republicans.
Some of the newly introduced Republican bills touch on areas the original school safety task force agreed would be priorities: physical security, mental health, data processes, staff, and education. The bills do not address firearms and criminal justice, which were also among the original goals of the task force.
Rep. Kelly Breen, a Democrat from Novi, said in a March 26 hearing for the bills she was “alarmed” that the legwork the taskforce did and the input from school and public safety officials was not reflected in the new Republican bills. For example, Breen said the bills require hiring of hundreds of new mental health staff while schools already struggle to fill open positions.
One of the bills that moved forward this week would require every intermediate school district — or regional agencies that work with the Michigan Department of Education and local school districts to develop programs and meet goals — in Michigan to hire a mental health coordinator to develop and implement the comprehensive system. It would integrate community or faith-based mental health services in public and private schools. Few details about how this would play out in schools were available.
With state funds, the coordinator would also facilitate and deploy a behavioral health care technology platform for schools, as well as oversee and monitor Medicaid billing and the Caring 4 Students program, which partially reimburses school districts for mental health services for students who are eligible for Medicaid.
The bill would also require each ISD to have at least one emergency and safety manager to serve as a liaison between state and local school and law enforcement entities. The manager would perform risk assessments, facilitate response training with schools, and implement prevention programs.
It could cost an estimated $16.8 million in state funding for every ISD in the state to add the staff, according to a fiscal analysis of the bill. Schools would not have to meet the requirements if the state does not allocate the money to fund the positions, according to the bill.
The House Education and Workforce Committee voted to move the bill forward during a meeting Wednesday.
Republican state Reps. Nancy DeBoer, Rylee Linting, Joseph Fox, Tom Kunse, Joseph Pavlov, and Alicia St. Germain voted in favor of moving the bill to a vote in the full House. Democratic state Reps. Matt Koleszar and Regina Weiss voted against it.
Democratic state Reps. Jimmie Wilson Jr. and Erin Byrnes abstained, as did Republican state Rep. Brad Paquette.
 Here’s what the other new Republican proposals would do


Require every public school to establish its own crisis team by July 1, 2026. The team would be responsible for initiating lockdowns, helping evacuate students and staff, as well as reuniting families after a safety crisis. The teams would include the school’s principal, vice principal, a school resource officer, and other school personnel. Private schools would have to establish an emergency operations plan.
Change the requirement for public schools to review their emergency preparedness plans with local law enforcement from every two years to every three years. Private schools, which currently are not required to share their plans, would also have to adhere to the requirement.
Local schools that don’t currently have temporary locking systems – or systems that immediately lock doors as a barrier in active shooter situations – would have to install them.
Increase the number of lockdown drills schools must complete each school year from three to four. At least one of the drills would have to take place during lunch, recess, or another time when students are gathered outside of classrooms. At least one would have to take place between class periods.
Require public and private school identification cards to include contact information for the OK2SAY program, which facilitates anonymous tips on potential threats to school and student safety. An existing provision that schools are not legally liable when suicide prevention numbers are not included on student IDs would be extended to situations in which schools don’t include OK2SAY information.
Require the Michigan Department of Heath and Human Services to make materials related to suicide, depression, and anxiety available to private schools that request it. Public schools can already receive such materials.
Require the Michigan State Police’s Office of School Safety to compile quarterly reports on the OK2SAY tips it receives for the School Safety and Mental Health Commission.

The bills will go forward for a full vote in the Republican-controlled House. In order to become law, they would also need to pass votes in the Democratically controlled Senate, and be signed by Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.
Earlier this year, Whitmer signed several other school safety bills into law. Among the measures, public schools now must have behavior threat assessment and management teams.

(Photo by Althea Dotzour / UW–Madison)Federal funding cuts and national culture war politics cast a long shadow over a state legislative committee hearing Thursday as Wisconsin’s higher education leaders asked lawmakers for additional investments in the next state budget — warning that disinvestment by the state could damage  public universities’, private nonprofit schools’ and technical colleges’ ability to serve students and the state. 
Lawmakers working on the 2025-27 state budget are gathering feedback from agency heads and members of the public just as higher education institutions across the country are facing an onslaught of threats from the Trump administration. 
As Republican lawmakers on the Assembly Colleges and Universities Committee grilled Universities of Wisconsin President Jay Rothman and other higher education leaders on their budget goals, they appeared skeptical about providing additional funding. They pointed to current levels of spending and diversity, equity and inclusion programs, which state Republicans have demanded be cut from the UW. Democratic lawmakers, meanwhile, expressed concerns about federal cuts to research and recent targeting of international students whose visas have been revoked. 
Rothman defends $855 million budget request
Rothman asked lawmakers whether the state is going to let its public universities “atrophy.” If not, he said,  new investments need to be made. The UW system has requested an additional $855 million, with the support of  Gov. Tony Evers, in the upcoming budget. 
The money  would be used to keep college affordable and accessible for Wisconsinites,  invest in retaining talented staff and support innovation, Rothman said. He told lawmakers the money would help UW maintain its two-year campuses and avoid raising tuition.
“We are at a state that without additional support from the state, student successes that we are seeing across our universities are at risk,” Rothman said. He noted that the state’s investment in the system has not kept up with inflation, and the money would put Wisconsin at the median nationwide. This would be up from Wisconsin’s current position of 43rd out of 50 when it comes to state investment in public universities.
This is not the first time Rothman has testified to lawmakers about the system’s request, having addressed lawmakers on the Joint Finance Committee, which is in charge of writing the budget on April 1.
Committee Chair Rep. Dave Murphy (R-Greenville) asked Rothman where he thought the money would come from.
“That is a challenge for the Legislature… This is an investment in the future of the state. We are returning $23 for every dollar that is invested in the Universities of Wisconsin,” Rothman said, citing a number that comes from a 2018 study.
Murphy told Rothman that he was “leery” of that number.
“If we’re increasing the money to the university by $855 million, are you telling me that I can expect $20 billion?” Murphy asked.
Rothman pointed out that lawmakers and their constituents have benefited from the existence of UW schools.
“At this table, you represent districts that have 9,000 students currently in school at the Universities of Wisconsin… More than half of you have attended one of our universities and hopefully you have benefitted from that,” Rothman said.
Murphy attended UW-Fox Valley from 1972 to 1974, according to his legislative biography. The school was merged with UW-Fond du Lac and UW-Oshkosh in 2018, and is now known as UW Oshkosh-Fox Cities. That campus is set to close in June.
Trump administration threats hanging over college campuses across the nation were central to the discussion over whether lawmakers should provide universities additional state funding.
Rep. Amanda Nedweski (R-Pleasant Prairie) brought up diversity, equity and inclusion efforts at UW institutions. An audit released last week found campuses haven’t been tracking their spending on these efforts. The audit was part of Republican lawmakers’ ongoing targeting of DEI, and comes as the Trump administration has also ramped up efforts to try to eliminate diversity programs in education. 
Republican lawmakers used staff pay and capital projects funding during the last legislative cycle as a negotiating tool with the UW system to get concessions on DEI efforts, including a reduction in positions focused on DEI. 
“We’re trying to see more of an effort to see in money savings, and I know there’s been reductions in positions, but there’s also been requests to add more,” Nedweski said. “We had a deal on DEI. Would you say that the UW system kept up their end of the deal?”
“Yes,” Rothman said.
“I wouldn’t say that’s what the audit says,” Nedweski said. 
Rothman responded that the UW has gone above and beyond the terms of  the deal, having reduced staffing by 43 positions even though the agreed upon deadline won’t arrive until December 2026. 
“We were on our way when the [Legislative Audit Bureau] did its field work in May of 2024,” Rothman said. “Since that time, we have made significant progress, and we are in compliance with the agreement as it relates to the positions. We’ve exceeded what we said we were going to do.” 
Nedweski said she was concerned about being able to measure the outcomes of the investments in DEI programs. 
“We now have a pattern within the UW system and our other state agencies where taxpayers are making investments in things like employees teleworking without knowing if there’s productivity. We’ve heard repeatedly from the UW system that we don’t really know their actual impact,” Nedweski said. 
Rothman noted that nearly 36,000 students graduate with degrees from Universities of Wisconsin schools each year. 
“I think that is an extraordinary [return-on-investment] for our state,” Rothman said. 
Murphy asked Rothman about a letter from the Trump administration sent to over 60 schools, including UW-Madison, warning that they could face consequences if they don’t address “antisemitism” on campus. UW-Madison is one of many schools where students joined encampment protests against the war in Gaza last spring. The Trump administration has said the university didn’t properly protect Jewish students.
“How do we control this antisemitism problem on our campuses?” Murphy asked. 
Before Rothman answered the question, Rep. Jodi Emerson (D-Eau Claire) interjected, asking what the topic had to do with the budget. 
Murphy shot back that, as chair of the committee, he could ask what he wanted. 
“If you think this isn’t a budgetary issue, I think you should talk to Columbia University and see what they would say about that,” Murphy said. Columbia became a target of the Trump administration after large student protests there and has had over $400 million in federal funding, mostly for medical and other scientific research, terminated, despite agreeing to police student protesters and place the department of Middle East, South Asian and African Studies under scrutiny.
Rothman said the UW system is navigating First Amendment issues and being inclusive, but that the UW has done a lot of work to ensure that all students, including Jewish students, those with conservative beliefs, veterans, those who are disabled, “feel they are part of the campus community.”
Democrats on the committee expressed concerns about federal cuts to research funding, potential threats to Pell Grants and student loans and the targeting of international students. 
Emerson asked about the impact of federal cuts to research. The Trump administration has been targeting funding for higher education institutions across the country, including cutting over $12 million in research funding to UW-Madison. The flagship campus has laid off six employees so far.
Rothman said he is deeply concerned about the federal cuts. UW-Madison and UW-Milwaukee are both tier one research institutions and the federal government invests about $1 billion annually in UW schools for research, Rothman said. 
“It’s not like we can start five years from now, six years from now… These research engines were built over generations,” Rothman said. “If they are not maintained, that’s gone.” 
Rothman said the impact would be felt in sectors across the state including as research would be lost and researchers even in the private sector could be affected as many are educated at public universities. 
Rothman said that philanthropic support would be incapable of filling the gap that would be left from federal funding cuts.
Nedweski said she thought there is skepticism among taxpayers about the federal funding of research. She asked whether the UW system is expecting Wisconsin taxpayers to pick up the cost. 
“I don’t think that the state could afford to pick up what could be lost,” Rothman said. “I think what’s going to happen if that occurs is that research capacity is going to decline, research infrastructure is going to decline and that will be our new reality going forward.” 
Emerson also asked Rothman whether the Trump administration’s move to cancel foreign students’ visas is having a “chilling effect” on prospective international students. Dozens of UW students and alumni, including 26 at UW-Madison, have had their visas cancelled by the Trump administration in recent weeks as a part of an unprecedented nationwide move by the federal government targeting international students. 
“Do we have fewer applications from international students for next school year?… Are there international students who are thinking of finishing their bachelor’s or higher education back home?” Emerson asked.
Rothman said that it was too early to know as most applications have already been submitted. He said that about 10,000 international students attend UW schools.
“We may have a number of international students who might be accepted into our universities that will not come because of this. We know there is anxiety among our international students just generally, for reasons that are understandable,” Rothman said, adding that the university is seeking to support students, but is  not providing legal representation to them.
Private, nonprofit schools and tech colleges on budget requests
Wisconsin Association of Independent Colleges and Universities President Eric Fulcomer told lawmakers the top priority for private nonprofit colleges and universities is doubling the funding for the Wisconsin Grant (WG-PNP) Program, which provides assistance to undergraduate, Wisconsin residents enrolled in a degree or certificate program at non-profit, independent colleges or universities based in Wisconsin, from $57 million to $114 million.
Fulcomer’s organization represents 22 private nonprofit colleges and universities in Wisconsin, including Marquette University, the Medical College of Wisconsin, Beloit College and St. Norbert College. It also includes Northland College, which was founded in 1892, but announced in February the school will be closing after this year’s graduation due to financial hardships.
There has been no additional investment in the grant program in the last two state budgets. Private, nonprofit schools don’t receive state funding to sustain their operations, but many students rely on the funding to be able to attend the schools. 
Among its neighboring states, Wisconsin ranks last when it comes to the amount of need-based grants awarded to students attending private nonprofit schools. The investment would not bring Wisconsin to the top, but would bring it to the middle among states in the Midwest. Currently, Wisconsin can give a maximum amount of $4,400.
The schools’ request is more than the governor’s budget request; Evers  proposed a 20% increase.
“I would prefer a larger increase,” Fulcomer said. “20% would be welcomed but it’s not enough to move the needle.”
If there is no increase in the budget, Fulcomer said the award will need to be reduced to $3,850, bringing Wisconsin even further below its peers.
Nedweski asked if he had suggestions for where the money for the budget request could come from. The state has a $4 billion budget surplus, which Evers wants to pull from to fund many priorities in his budget.
Fulcomer noted that about a quarter of all bachelor’s degrees and a third of all master’s degrees come from Wisconsin’s private, nonprofit schools and that students are providing millions in revenue to the state via taxes. 
“It’s a good investment, but I’m not in a position to tell you where you might find those dollars,” Fulcomer said.
“We are not operating with a lot of extra money in the next biennium. If you get more, it has to come out of somebody else’s bucket,” Nedweski said.
Rep. Rob Kreibich (R-New Richmond) commented that he thinks lawmakers “should reward success” and he admires the retention and placement rates for the private schools. 
Emerson asked about what would happen if the Pell Grants were reduced or eliminated — a question that comes as the federal grants face a shortfall and as there is also uncertainty surrounding the future of student loans. 
“Potentially we’d be looking at a 27% cut to enrollment,” Fulcomer said. “Cutting the Pell Grant or eliminating the Pell Grant would be devastating for our sector.”
Wisconsin Technical College System President Layla Merrifield asked for  about $60 million from the state, including $45 million that would go toward general aid for its 16 colleges. The technical college system’s budget for 2024-25 totaled about $1.3 billion with $592.9 million coming from state aid. 
“There’s almost no better investment that you could make in Wisconsin’s economy, in its workforce and its people than the technical college system,” Merrifield said. “Our outcomes are well documented. We are transparent with our data, both our failings and our successes.”
Murphy thanked Merrifield for her approach to the budget. 
It is “a little bit what we were looking for from the UW today…,” Murphy said. “They want $855 million, but it’s taken nine months, and we still don’t have very much detail around what they expect to do with that money.”

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Wisconsin has issued a letter asking elected leaders in Milwaukee to temper the acquisition and use of surveillance technologies by the Milwaukee Police Department (MPD). On Thursday evening, the police department went before the Fire and Police Commission (FPC) to push for the use of facial recognition technology. This, along with the common council’s recent approval of drone usage by the MPD, has spurred the ACLU to call for a two-year pause on the adoption of new surveillance technologies, and craft frameworks to regulate the technology MPD already has “with meaningful opportunities for community input.” 
Although it acknowledges that many on the council and within MPD “care deeply about the safety and well-being of our city,” the ACLU’s letter also warns that “history has shown time and again, authoritarianism does not always arrive with flashing lights and villainous speeches — it often comes wrapped in routine procedure, paperwork, and people ‘just doing their jobs.’” 
“We are already seeing how surveillance technology is being weaponized in real time,” the ACLU continued, citing data-gathering, automatic license plate readers, artificial intelligence (AI), and other tools that are used to “target and detain individuals.” 
  The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
The MPD has long denied that it uses facial recognition technology. As part of an investigation into surveillance technologies which the department obtained ahead of the 2020 Democratic National Convention (DNC), Wisconsin Examiner reviewed “investment justification” records from the state’s Homeland Security Council which suggested that the Southeastern Threat Analysis Center — a homeland security-focused aspect of the MPD’s intel-gathering Fusion Center — utilized Clear facial recognition technology. It was described as a “mobile device” that would allow police to “conduct timely identification of individuals in the field to prevent terrorist attack.” 
By contrast, MPD PowerPoint presentations prepared for the April 17 FPC meeting openly advertise the use of facial recognition. The PowerPoint details two examples of arrests made using facial recognition software. One “case study” from March 2024 involved a fatal gun violence incident where the suspects fled. The PowerPoint said that they were later seen at a gas station, and that facial recognition software provided leads to both suspects. Noting that “facial recognition results are advisory in nature and are to be treated as investigative leads only,” the PowerPoint states that a Department of Corrections agent confirmed the software’s results, leading to arrests the next morning. 
One of the PowerPoint slides shows in-custody photographs of the arrested men above pictures of them masked in a gas station. The slides showed that the facial recognition software had a “similarity” rating of 99.7% for one man, and 98.1% for another. Both men are waiting for a trial. The other case study focused on a sexual assault incident involving a gun. Like the other example, surveillance footage of the suspect from a gas station helped lead to the arrest. MPD sent out a facial recognition request to local agencies. It was answered by the Wauwatosa Police Department, which returned two pictures of the same individual. The pictures had similarity ratings of 99.1% and 98.9% respectively. The arrested man was sentenced to 20 years in prison. 
The PowerPoint presentation lists 14 cases from the North and South Sides of Milwaukee. It states that MPD “would be diligent in balancing the need for effective, accurate investigations and the need to respect the privacy of others,” and that facial recognition does not establish probable cause to arrest someone or obtain a warrant. “It may generate investigative leads through a combination of automated biometric comparisons and human analysis,” the PowerPoint states. “Corroborating information must be developed through additional investigation.” 
 
PUBLIC Facial Rec for FPC
A PowerPoint presentation detailing the Milwaukee PD’s plans for facial recognition software. 
 
MPD has reviewed procedures for the technology’s use nationwide, and stated that “oversight of the system will consist of an audit report showing information requested, accessed, searched, or disseminated.” All requests for facial recognition must be approved by a supervisor, and the department will keep a log of each search and the type of crime involved. Biometrica is the chosen facial recognition vendor. The PowerPoint states that the company has worked with the NAACP and the ACLU to provide anti-bias training for users of the software. 
The reassurances, however, do little to quell the concerns of privacy advocates. In their letter to the MPD and common council, the ACLU of Wisconsin highlighted ongoing immigrant roundups by  the Trump administration, and the deportation of Milwaukee residents to a notorious maximum security terrorism prison in El Salvador. “It is being used to monitor and prosecute political protesters, people seeking reproductive health care, LGBTQ+ individuals, and doctors trying to provide care,” the letter states. “These are not projections — these are present-day realities carried out by bad actors within the federal government and local jurisdictions.” 
The ACLU letter warns, “while we trust that our local leaders and police officers have good intentions, history reminds us how quickly larger systems can override those intentions.” 
In recent years MPD has expanded its network of surveillance cameras and other activities such as its phone surveillance operations remain shrouded in secrecy. MPD has also built up its social media surveillance footprint using AI-powered software, after downplaying the very existence of those activities in years past. 
“Data collected in Milwaukee does not stay in Milwaukee,” the ACLU states. “Once it enters a federal pipeline, it can be accessed, shared, and used in ways we cannot predict — or stop. That’s why now, more than ever, we must choose restraint. The rule of law at the federal level is unraveling before our eyes.”

The same set of concerns came up during a March 20 FPC meeting, where commissioners discussed the MPD’s use of drones and facial recognition technology. Police officials claimed that complaints about law enforcement using drones lagged behind the rate of agencies acquiring the technology, suggesting that the public approves. Police officials said that MPD’s “Airborne Assessment Team,” which is attached to the department’s Specialized Patrol Division, would help increase situational awareness, de-escalate dangerous situations, aid search-and-rescue, help manage major events and offer unique opportunities to “positively engage” with the community. In protest situations, drones would allow MPD to monitor an area while not physically placing officers nearby, whose presence could trigger an escalation among the protest crowd. 
MPD said that its drones do not have facial recognition capabilities. Still, the growth of MPD’s surveillance powers have worried some community members. Commissioner Bri Spencer said during the meeting that it would be nice for a community-based tech advisory board to be established to help review MPD’s surveillance requests. Spencer said that nationwide and historically, it’s not unheard-of for law enforcement surveillance programs to get out of hand. 
“I get it for water rescue, I’m very worried about things like protests,” said Spencer. “I think for very good reason. Our federal government is doing some very funky things right now with protesters. So I get what you’re saying, and I see in the SOP that you’re like, ‘We’re not going to do that.’ I don’t know if that’s sufficient in terms of a protection, particularly for people who are skeptical about the use of these technologies.” 
Police officials said that drones are a crowd management tool, and that during the Republican National Convention (RNC) they helped monitor protest movements to ensure opposing groups didn’t come into contact with one another. Spencer reiterated, “I think I just worry about the cost to individual civil rights and, like, how that’s going to just keep growing in our society…I wish the public had more input into whether or not the use of this type of technology is happening here. Talking to the community is not the same as letting them have a decision about whether or not they want drones in their city being run by police.” 
MPD spokespeople said the department based its drone usage procedures on best practice guidance from the ACLU, and that the department is “very late” to the drone game. The Milwaukee County Sheriff’s Office, for example, officially announced its drone program in 2021.

Ahead of the DNC nearly five years ago, the MPD acquired large white vans called “critical response vehicles”, which are also attached to the Specialized Patrol Division and came equipped with their own tethered aerial drones. Wisconsin Examiner found that the sheriff’s drones were used to monitor police accountability protests, with the number of flights dropping significantly once the protests subsided. 
In its letter Thursday, the ACLU stressed that police abuse of surveillance “is not ancient history” but rather “it’s living memory for many in our city.” Some may remember the reign of police chief Harold Breier, who surveilled civil rights activists, LGBTQ+ communities, and Black Milwaukeeans. “And those who carried out that surveillance often believed they were ‘just doing their jobs.’” The ACLU’s letter questions what a personality like Chief Breier would do with today’s surveillance powers. 
“We’re not calling for a ban,” the letter states. Instead, the ACLU calls for a  two-year pause on acquiring new surveillance technologies, especially facial recognition technology, “while we assess the potential risks.” In the meantime, the letter urges city leaders to “pass a framework for regulating existing surveillance technology, such as adopting a Community Control Over Police Surveillance (CCOPS) Ordinance to bring accountability to these decisions before it’s too late.”",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screenshot_2021-03-15-Wisconsin-Examiner.png,,,2025-04-18 07:00:17.247106

(Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Dozens of bills are headed to the governor’s desk for final sign-off, but even more have stalled — or appear to be dead altogether.
Despite earlier momentum, legislation dealing with rape kit backlogs, immigration enforcement, social media restrictions for minors, and more ultimately missed key deadlines and failed to advance in the final weeks of the session.
Those issues won’t be officially settled, however, until lawmakers close out the session for good. Bill language could still reappear elsewhere — via closed-door conference committees — during the coming days.
Republican leadership said they plan to finish this year’s business by Thursday, April 24, but the session isn’t legally required to end until end-of-day on the following Tuesday, April 29.
‘Dead for good’
Although a bill prohibiting some Hoosier minors from using social media without their parents’ permission got bipartisan support in the Senate, the House took no action.

Senate Bill 11 would have required anyone under the age of 16 to secure permission from their guardians before accessing apps like Facebook, Instagram or TikTok. Another provision allowed Indiana’s attorney general to issue a civil investigative demand to determine if a social media site violated the law, with civil penalties up to $250,000. 
Following a 42-7 vote in the Senate in January, the bill was assigned to the House Judiciary Committee. Rep. Chris Jeter, R-Fishers, never gave the proposal a hearing.
The bill’s author, Sen. Ryan Bohacek, R-Michiana Shores, attempted to amend the language into a foreign trade bill during the second half of the session, but he told the Indiana Capital Chronicle it was deemed non-germane, so he never called it for a vote.
“It’s dead for good,” Bohacek said, but he’s open to bringing the bill back in 2026.
One of several controversial anti-immigration bills this session also died in the second-half of session despite passing the full House in February.
House Bill 1531 would have mandated local compliance with federal immigration detainer requests and leveraged local government funding to ensure cooperation with federal authorities like U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).
It also would have targeted employers who hire a person who is not legally allowed in the U.S.
The bill died after the Senate Judiciary Committee, helmed by Fort Wayne Republican Sen. Liz Brown, declined to hold a hearing.
“I’ve had a lot of conversation with Sen. Brown in the second half of the session … she’s not comfortable moving it this year due to a few different things in the bill,” said bill author Rep. J.D. Prescott, R-Union City, who could file a similar bill in a future session. “I’m still looking at other options, but more than likely, it’s not moving this year.”
Still, a separate immigration-focused proposal, House Bill 1393, is headed to Gov. Mike Braun’s desk.

The bill requires jails and detention facilities to tell county sheriffs when they have probable cause to believe that someone they’re booking on unrelated misdemeanor or felony charges isn’t legally in the country. Sheriffs would have to report that information to ICE.
Senators additionally killed a contested elections bill that aimed to put school referendums and public questions only on general election ballots. 
Rep. Tim Wesco, R-Osceola, who authored House Bill 1681, previously emphasized that more voters participate in general elections than primaries. Democrats opposed, arguing that the change would strip local control and put more financial stress on schools.
Ultimately, though, the referenda language was signed into law in Senate Enrolled Act 1.
Also dead is House Bill 1413, which sought to eliminate the state’s backlog of rape kits and help counties with legal costs. Rep. Becky Cash, who authored the proposal, pointed to the current six- to eight-month wait for rape kit processing in Indiana, which crime technicians and law enforcement have attributed to a lack of equipment and staff.
The bill earned unanimous support from the House, and the chamber’s budget-drafting committee created a $2.5 million line item for the proposed Rape Kit Backlog Fund. Momentum continued in the Senate corrections committee, but the multi-million dollar appropriation is likely in jeopardy following this week’s grim revenue forecast. State budget writers said cuts are on the way.
Left out of the budget, too, was a $500 tax credit per newborn child for eligible taxpayers — or $250 for a married person filing a separate return.
Originally offered in Senate Bill 497, the credit would have been available for families earning up to 720% of the federal poverty level. The proposal passed 47-0 from the Senate but never made it into the state’s spending plan.
Other bills on the chopping block
Hundreds of other bills additionally failed to cross the finish line. Among those are:
House Bill 1174, pay day loans: The House narrowly advanced Rep. Jake Teshka’s bill to create new, longer-term loans of up to $5,000 — with steep monthly service fees stacked atop interest and other charges. The measure would have also allowed lenders overseeing larger borrowing, like car loans, to charge interest rates as high as 36%, up from the current cap of 25%. The Senate’s insurance committee left the bill untouched.

House Bill 1285, special education classroom cameras: A repeat attempt by Rep. Beck Cash, R-Zionsville, to mandate round-the-clock electronic recording equipment in special education classrooms, sensory rooms, seclusion spaces and time-out areas was stripped from the underlying bill by the House Education Committee. What’s left in the measure — which has since advanced from the Senate and is awaiting final House approval — are provisions to allow parents an opportunity to collect their student’s property if the child no longer attends the school, and another to permit parents to record meetings concerning their child’s individualized education program. The bill also requires schools to always have present in each building at least one employee who has obtained nonviolent crisis intervention training.
Senate Bill 126, annexation: An attempt to bridge the differences between House and Senate lawmakers in an annexation compromise met its demise last month after the author criticized the process and rebuked committee members. Sen. Jim Buck, R-Kokomo, has repeatedly authored legislation to rein in what he describes as an “abusive” form of annexation that’s “tilted in favor of the municipalities.” But he rejected an attempt to meld two bills into an annexation compromise, seemingly killing the effort altogether.
House Bill 1432, iGaming: A push to legalize online lottery and casino games passed easily out of the House Public Policy Committee earlier this year but didn’t get a hearing in the Ways and Means Committee, which would’ve taken a closer look at the financial aspects of the proposal. Rep. Ethan Manning, R-Logansport, authored the bill and estimated that the digital lottery and casino games, coupled with sports wagering tax hikes, could bring the state of Indiana more than $300 million annually in new revenue. But some were concerned that online options would cannibalize in-person gaming or lottery sales.
House Bills 1618 and 1237, new state emblems: A lively committee presentation by Jasper Elementary School fourth-graders was not enough to convince lawmakers to name the persimmon as Indiana’s state fruit. That bill died in committee without a vote, as did another proposal to make Myotis sodalis, also known as the Indiana bat, the official mammal of the Hoosier State.
Opposition brings likely end to Indiana utility siting bill, but the issue isn’t going away

House Bill 1628, utility siting: Overwhelming opposition from county officials killed the Republican proposal to shift authority over large-scale utility infrastructure projects from local governments to the state. The bill received multiple hours of discussion in the House utilities committee, but it was never put to a vote and failed to advance to the full chamber. Bill author Rep. Ed Soliday, R-Valparaiso, called it a response to ongoing resistance of local governments to greenlight solar, wind and other renewables projects that are increasingly necessary to support the state’s growing energy demands. Locals said decision-making control over the zoning and approval processes for those proposals was theirs, not the state’s.
Senate Bill 171, abortion pills: A move to ban pill-based abortions, and to require women to file an affidavit of rape to meet one of the state’s few exceptions, got no traction. Filed by Sen. Mike Young, R-Indianapolis, the bill would have outlawed the use of abortion pills even in abortions that meet the state’s narrow exemptions. And it would have required a woman who seeks an abortion under the state’s rape or incest exceptions to provide the doctor with an affidavit under penalties of perjury attesting to the rape or incest. The same requirement was defeated in 2022 during an amendment fight.
Senate Bills 201 and 284, closed primaries and early voting: Legislation slashing early in-person voting days and closing primary elections to unaffiliated voters garnered mixed committee testimony in early February before quietly dying in the Senate. Sen. Gary Byrne’s bill would’ve cut Indiana’s early voting timeline from 28 days down to two weeks. Another measure offered by Sen. Mike Gaskill, R-Pendleton, would have added text to voter registration forms asking Hoosiers to choose their political parties and warning that affiliation is required to vote in a primary election. It also would’ve required county election officials to affiliate registered voters with either the Democratic or Republican Party based on their last primary election votes, and would’ve created a way for voters to change their affiliations.

(Photo by Quentin Young/Colorado Newsline)Mental illness doesn’t check voter registration. Suicide doesn’t screen for partisanship. These crises are indiscriminate and omnipresent, cutting across class, race and creed. 
Yet Oklahoma’s failure to fully fund its 988 mental health crisis hotline reveals something chilling: for many state leaders, saving lives is negotiable — so long as it’s politically inconvenient.
In 2024, more than 39,000 Oklahomans called 988 in moments of acute distress. The hotline has become a vital alternative to 911 for those experiencing suicidal ideation, substance abuse crises, or psychosis — circumstances in which police presence is often inappropriate, and occasionally lethal. 
This is not a theoretical benefit. It is a demonstrable public health tool. And yet, lawmakers continue to defer, delay, and dilute every serious effort to secure its future.
The preferred mechanism to sustain 988 — a modest monthly telecom fee — has failed in the Oklahoma Legislature. Despite being modeled after the fee that funds 911, lawmakers balk at this proposal, wary of the optics. Some cite inflation. Others gesture vaguely toward “tax fatigue.” But all of them are missing the point.
This is not a fiscal debate. It is a referendum on priorities.
When the state wants to fund something, it does — and Oklahoma is proving that. Even as the legality is still being debated by the U.S. Supreme Court, Oklahoma has been fighting to direct public dollars toward a religious charter school. Meanwhile, State Superintendent Ryan Walters has proposed spending $3 million to put Bibles in classrooms.
As of mid-2024, the Office of Management and Enterprise Services reported $8.5 billion in state collections — 2.1% above the year’s projected estimate. 
There is no budgetary emergency. There is, however, a chronic unwillingness to spend political capital on the unglamorous work of mental health care.
But the clock is ticking. Federal funding might carry Oklahoma through fiscal year 2026, but how much longer can we keep kicking the can down the road? Hard decisions can only be postponed for so long. Without a sustainable revenue stream, Oklahoma risks gutting a system that has already proven its value.
And people will die. Not metaphorically. Not someday. Actually. Soon.
When the state abdicates responsibility, the burden does not vanish — it shifts. It falls to emergency rooms, already overwhelmed. It falls to police, untrained and ill-equipped. It falls to families, who are left to navigate overdose, psychosis, and suicidal crisis without trained professionals. 
And when the system fails, it is not the politicians who pay the price. It is the parent identifying a child in the morgue. It is the patient handcuffed during a panic attack. It is the person who dies on hold.
Let’s be clear: this is not about the money. It’s about optics. About cowardice. About lawmakers who want credit for caring, but not the consequences of doing.
To call 988 “life-saving” in a press release and then vote against funding it is not just hypocrisy — it’s complicity. 
The same legislators who boast of their mental health platforms during campaign season are the ones now waffling over 60 cents a year. That’s the cost of the proposed surcharge. Less than a drive-thru meal. Less than a single Starbucks run. And yet, for some, even that is too much.
Nationally, the need is unmistakable. Suicide remains the 11th leading cause of death in the United States, and Oklahoma’s suicide rate has risen by nearly 49% over the last two decades. Oklahoma ranks among the worst in the nation for health and well-being, and 1 in 5 adults report a diagnosable mental illness. In rural counties, access is often nonexistent.
The 988 line isn’t a silver bullet. But it is a start — a bridge between crisis and care. The hotline connects callers to trained behavioral health responders, often dispatching mobile crisis teams instead of law enforcement. It prevents unnecessary ER visits. It de-escalates violent episodes. It saves lives. All for less than a dollar per person per month.
This is policy at its most basic: spend a little to save a lot. But too many lawmakers are focused on ideological optics over empirical outcomes. They fear being labeled as tax-and-spend liberals. They fear their own base. And so they equivocate, allowing a proven, necessary, life-saving system to twist in the political wind.
There is no bipartisan spin that can reconcile this contradiction. You cannot champion mental health while defunding its infrastructure. You cannot claim to care about life and then balk at funding the system that protects it. And you cannot, in good conscience, govern a state where the price of survival is deemed too high at 60 cents.

(Drew Angerer/Getty Images)Attorneys in a lawsuit against Idaho pathologist Dr. Ryan Cole for his alleged false cancer diagnosis that led a woman to undergo major surgery reached an agreement to dismiss the case.
But almost no information about the agreement is public.
Idaho 4th District Judge James Cawthon on April 10 agreed to dismiss the medical malpractice lawsuit, following a stipulation between attorneys on both sides. That came months after Cole and the patient’s attorneys began mediation, which is a legal process to work toward agreement. 
Filed in April 2023, the lawsuit was scheduled for a jury trial in April. Granting a request from both sides’ attorneys, the judge dismissed the case with prejudice. Each party will pay their own costs and attorneys’ fees. 
In November, patient J.B.’s attorneys submitted a ream of additional evidence in court. Those included statements from six doctors — who either worked with the patient, or were independent from her medical care — that disagreed with Cole’s diagnosis of a rare and aggressive form of endometrial cancer. The Idaho Capital Sun is identifying the patient only by her initials to protect her medical privacy.
In legal declarations, two independent pathologist doctors called Cole “reckless” in rendering the patient’s cancer diagnosis.

Cole, an Idaho pathologist, gained fame for false and misleading statements he made about COVID-19. He serves as an appointed Idaho health official.
Early last year, Washington state regulators restricted Cole’s medical license in the state after they found he spread COVID disinformation and broke medical practice by virtually prescribing ivermectin to COVID patients. The drug — long used as an anti-parsitic in humans but which lacks evidence to treat COVID — can now be sold over the counter in Idaho, after the Legislature widely approved the deregulation this year.
Cole and his attorney, Nancy Garrett, could not be immediately reached for comment. Mallam Prior, an attorney for the patient, declined to comment to the Idaho Capital Sun, saying the lawsuit’s outcome was confidential.
 Two pathologist doctors call Cole’s misdiagnosis ‘reckless’ in legal declarations

In 2021, Cole ran a laboratory being used by women’s health practices in the Boise area. J.B.’s nurse practitioner sent Cole’s lab a biopsy from her body that summer. 
She had invasive surgery after Idaho Dr. Ryan Cole misdiagnosed her. Now she’s suing.

After she underwent surgery to remove her female reproductive system, J.B. learned she didn’t have cancer, the Sun previously reported.
Part of Cole’s stance against COVID vaccines included false claims that they cause cancer.
There is no evidence that COVID vaccines can raise, or lower, a person’s risk of cancer. There is evidence that they lower a person’s risk of severe illness, death and chronic health issues after a COVID infection.
“I have seen a 10- to 20-fold increase of uterine cancer in the last six months in my laboratory,” Cole said at a meeting of America’s Frontline Doctors in San Antonio, Texas, about two weeks after he misdiagnosed J.B. with cancer of the uterine lining. “In the last six months. When did we start shots? January? How much solid-tumor cancer increase are we going to see over the next several years? Probably a lot.”
In November, as part of the plaintiff’s additional evidence submission, J.B’s attorneys wrote that Cole “claims to have retracted his comment that he was seeing a 20-fold increase of endometrial cancer in 2021 when there is nothing he can point to in order to demonstrate he has actually done so.”
Actually, Cole’s cancer diagnosis records — which the plaintiffs’ attorneys obtained as part of the lawsuit’s evidence discovery process — show “less than a 1% increase,” the legal filing alleged. 
That was part of the patient’s attorneys’ request for a jury to require Cole to pay punitive damages in the lawsuit.
  Dr. Ryan Cole speaks at a “Defeat the Mandates” rally in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 23, 2022. “Let doctors be doctors, and let us treat patients and save their lives. Don’t shackle our hands. We will not comply with your silliness,” he said. (Screenshot from livestream video)
Six other doctors — including five pathologists — evaluated the patient’s tissue samples and disagreed with Cole’s diagnosis, the filing alleged.
Dr. Matt Tannenbaum, an Idaho Falls pathologist who disagreed with Cole’s diagnosis of the patient, wrote “it is my opinion to a reasonable degree of medical probability and far more likely than not that Dr. Cole was negligent and reckless when misdiagnosing (the patient) with serous carcinoma.”

Dr. Paul Cohen, who serves as chair of pathology at Yale University’s hospital in Connecticut, wrote that “Dr. Cole’s level of incompetence in this case rises to the level of being reckless.”
“He either knew or should have known that there were problems with the diagnosis of serous carcinoma, that it was an incorrect diagnosis, and that by rendering such diagnosis it was creating an unreasonable risk of harm to (the patient) and a high probability that such harm would actually result,” Cohen wrote. 
Cole maintained his cancer diagnosis for J.B. was correct, despite the lawsuit and another review of the slides since his initial diagnosis, the filing alleged. 
 Cole is still licensed as doctor in Idaho, and serves on Central District Health board

The medical malpractice suit J.B. filed in Ada County accused Cole of negligence and other harms. The lawsuit also was against his business Cole Diagnostics, based in Garden City. 
Washington regulators restrict medical license of Idaho doctor who spread COVID-19 disinformation

The company is still registered as an Idaho business and lists Cole as president, business filings from the Idaho Secretary of State’s Office showed Thursday night.
Cole is still licensed to practice medicine in Idaho, the Idaho Board of Medicine’s licensing records website shows.
In 2024, his Idaho license temporarily lapsed, prompting questions about his status on the Central District Health board, the Sun previously reported. In September, Cole renewed his Idaho medical license.
Central District Health is a regional Idaho government public health agency that serves Idaho’s two most populated counties in and around Boise — Ada and Canyon — and two rural counties: Elmore and Valley. 
Cole remains on the Central District Health board.
In the state of Washington, Cole’s medical license is active with restrictions, the Washington State Department of Health’s website shows.

Bernie Sanders of Vermont said his message of money out of politics resonates across the political spectrum. (Keila Szpaller/The Daily Montanan)How strange that due to the disastrous policies of “their president,” Montana’s all-Republican Congressional delegation and governor are now too scared to even face Montanans in town halls.  And yet Bernie Sanders flies into Missoula on his national “Fighting Oligarchy” tour and draws “thunderous applause and standing ovations” from an over-capacity crowd of 9,000 Montanans on an afternoon in the middle of the week.  
Why?  Because people know Bernie is telling the truth about what’s going on in this nation, not fabricating excuses and downplaying the very real damages taking place while they hide under their MAGA hats.  
He’s also correctly calling out the fact that both Republicans and Democrats are responsible for the on-going tragedy that sees American democracy, once the envy of the world, turning into an oligarchy of billionaires whose greed knows no bounds or even a scintilla of concern for “the little people.”
Nor was Bernie speaking from a bullet-proof cage surrounded by nasty looking thugs with sunglasses and earbuds to ensure no one gets close to him.  Quite the opposite — top Republicans nowadays don’t dare do what Bernie did — walk out into the overflow crowd of thousands to shake hands and talk directly to the people who couldn’t get in.  
The few Republican politicians who dare venture into the realm of “we the people” are being met by angry crowds whose interests and hope for a better future they have so grievously betrayed.  Just ask 91-year old GOP Senator Chuck Grassley, who was bluntly told “his” people in supposedly “red state” Iowa are now really “pissed” because he won’t stand up to “dictator” Trump.   
In an astounding contrast, there’s no denying that Bernie’s huge crowds are showering this 83-year old dynamo with love and hope, many with tears in their eyes because his words go straight to the challenges they are experiencing and they want to believe that somehow we can overcome the insulated and isolated billionaires and return our government to the people, not the 1 percenters who want ever more, no matter the cost to the rest of us.
That’s part of the reason Bernie Sanders is the most popular Senator in the nation. In his own words from his Missoula speech: “We can either have extreme wealth inequality, with the toxic division and corruption that it requires to survive, or we can have a fair economy for working people along with the democracy and freedoms that uphold it. But we cannot have both.” 
Speaking truth to power, Bernie laid it out: ““We don’t accept this blue state–red state nonsense. We are the United States of America, not red states, not blue states.  I believe honestly that I speak for conservatives, moderates and progressives, for the overwhelming majority of the American people, who understand that there is something fundamentally wrong in our campaign finance system where billionaires can buy elections.”
Apparently that rankled Montana’s millionaire governor, Greg Gianforte, who posted: “Bernie Sanders and AOC are in Montana pushing their far–left agenda — but Montanans rejected them and their puppet Joe Biden after four years of failed policies. The people have spoken. They aren’t feeling the Bern.”
I got news for the gov — who has never drawn anything close to Bernie’s crowds or approval ratings. Bernie won the Montana Democratic primary election in 2016 because he, not Hillary Clinton, spoke to Montanans’ concerns. They “felt the Bern” then and obviously are “feeling the Bern” again.  Why?  Because they’re feeling burned — by Gianforte, our do-nothing congressional delegation, and by the eternally lying fool in the Oval Office.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Bernie-3-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-18 07:00:17.247106

(Photo by Shauneen Miranda/States Newsroom)Idaho Medicaid allows people with disabilities to live their most independent lives, makes preventive care accessible, helps ensure safe deliveries of healthy babies, assists seniors when they are most vulnerable, and saves families with medical emergencies from financial ruin. 
That’s why it’s alarming that Congress is considering $880 billion in Medicaid cuts. This staggering figure puts health care at risk for more than 340,000 Idahoans — half of whom are children. By cutting $364 million from Idaho’s health care system, it would force Idaho into an impossible bind: slash critical health services or raise taxes. 
Republicans in Congress are eyeing cuts to Medicaid. But what does Medicaid actually do?

U.S. Sen. Mike Crapo’s recent statements opposing health care cuts are heartening. It’s imperative that our entire congressional delegation take a thoughtful, bipartisan approach to keep Medicaid whole. 
Proponents justify these cuts with claims about reducing “fraud, waste, and abuse.” But let’s be clear:

Fraud is rare and usually involves deliberate billing schemes by corporations, not patients gaming the system.
Waste often means system inefficiencies, such as avoidable emergency room visits or lack of care coordination, that are best solved through smarter care models, not blanket cuts.
Abuse can refer to overbilling, administrative errors, and regulatory gray areas — which call for oversight, not slashed funding.

These terms are often used to create political cover for cuts that hurt people. In truth, 95% of Medicaid dollars go directly to pay for health care rather than administration. This is a much higher rate than any private insurance company can claim. With as lean and efficient as Medicaid is, there is not $880 billion worth of fraud to eliminate — only critical services that keep our health system functioning. 
Rural Idaho would be disproportionately impacted. One in five rural residents depends on Medicaid. When funding drops, clinics close, providers leave, and health care access disappears. This makes our existing health workforce shortage, already severe in 43 of 44 counties, much worse.
Proposed nationwide “work requirements” are also harmful. Most working-age Medicaid enrollees already work, or can’t due to illness or caregiving responsibilities. 
Previous experiments with work requirements led to thousands of people losing coverage, not because they were ineligible, but because of bureaucratic red tape. These policies are costly to administer and serve only to push people off care, doing nothing to assist with employment.
Furthermore, cuts to Medicaid don’t save money; they just shift costs in harmful, expensive ways. When people lose coverage, they are forced to roll the dice: sometimes delaying care until it’s less effective, costlier or too late. They may end up with emergency room bills they can’t afford. 
When hospitals absorb the costs of uncompensated care, everyone pays higher insurance premiums and health care costs, while health outcomes worsen.
Instead of rushing to slash the backbone of our health care safety net, let’s press pause and assess the consequences for Idaho. Congress should focus on smart, targeted reforms: Strengthen fraud prevention by investigating the companies that are bad actors. Lower prescription drug prices. Expand provider access in rural areas. These real solutions don’t jeopardize people’s lives or Idaho’s economy.
We must stop the gutting of health care benefits for our neighbors, veterans, cancer survivors, seniors in nursing homes, and people living with disabilities. Congress is on recess and back in Idaho this week and next. We hope Sen. Crapo, Sen. Jim Risch, Rep. Mike Simpson, and Rep. Russ Fulcher will hear from Idahoans on how important it is to protect Medicaid for future generations.

But what many still don’t know is that every one of them was certified by a single, government-run lab in Bruceton, Allegheny County in Pennsylvania. It’s called the National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory. The name N95 actually comes from their certification standards.
The lab, near Pittsburgh, is operated by the National Institute of Occupational Health and Safety (NIOSH) and is the only facility in the country that is capable of offering the agency’s stamp of approval. The same lab certifies a host of other protective masks and respirators used by firefighters, doctors, painters, factory workers, coal miners, pharmaceutical manufacturers, welders, chemical plant employees, construction crews and others. Many American employers are statutorily required to provide them to workers.
An estimated 5 million Americans workers are required to use respirators at their place of employment.
But according to a dozen current and former NIOSH employees and union representatives who have worked at or with their personal protective equipment division, that lab has halted almost all of its regular work and is preparing to shut down in June.
That’s because of the most recent announcement of layoffs at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The agency, run by Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has announced plans to lay off 10,000 employees across its various divisions. Hundreds of those cuts are in NIOSH, the division that studies and recommends ways to prevent workplace health and safety hazards.
“It’s kind of the sabotage of guide rails that have been set up for industry to help keep workers safe,” said Jonathan Szalajda, a lab employee and former deputy director of the National Personal Protective Technology Lab. “It’s a situation where we’re leaving workers defenseless, and I think it’s certainly a step back from what we’ve done to protect workers over the last half century.”

Since the beginning of mass layoffs at federal agencies overseen by the Trump administration and Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), virtually every employee at the National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory has taken a buyout or early retirement offer, been put on administrative leave, or received a notice that their job is subject to what’s called a “reduction in force” and that their last day will come in June.
It’s not clear if the impending layoffs will hit every remaining employee because, according to workers and union officials, leaders at the Department of Health and Human Services and the Centers for Disease Control have not been answering questions. Moreover, almost all of the lab’s supervisors have been placed on administrative leave, along with their HR contact.
The reduction in force notices are confusing as well. Some sent out to individual employees note that layoffs will happen in their division, and they may or may not be subject to them. But another sent to the union that oversees the bargaining unit employees at the National Personal Protective Technology Lab said all of their jobs would be eliminated. Virtually every lab employee that isn’t part of that union has already been placed on leave or told their position will be terminated in June.
Given the lack of communication, and the sweeping layoffs that have hit other parts of the federal government, including NIOSH itself, employees at the personal protective equipment division are expecting the worst.
Already, the lab’s workforce has shrunk from 120 to 70 this year, and the remaining employees are facing layoffs that the Department of Health and Human Services says will come in June.
A spokesperson for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention referred questions to the Department of Health and Human Services, which did not respond to multiple inquiries from the Capital-Star. NIOSH is a research agency within the CDC, which is a part of the Department of Health and Human Services.
“We have no idea what we’re supposed to do,” said one remaining lab employee who spoke under condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation. “We have no idea what to tell the manufacturers. This is so important, we just feel there’s no way this can be real.”
Szalajda said the lab has stopped accepting requests from manufacturers to certify new respirators. The remaining lab employees who weren’t laid off have shifted their focus to preparing for the lab to be shut down.
New research has also stopped because of time constraints and a freeze on federal employee credit cards that has made it impossible to buy necessary materials.
Instead, workers are finalizing research projects that are near completion, and preparing them for publication.
‘Someone will have to own the travesty’
Szalajda and others have said they expect the lab’s closure to result in the market being flooded with substandard masks.
Along with certifying new products, lab employees regularly inspect respirator manufacturing plants and test masks that have already been approved to ensure they’re still being manufactured to NIOSH standards. That work, however, has stopped, largely because of a freeze on approval of employee travel reimbursement. According to Szalajda, the lab has also stopped sending out contractors because they’re not certain they’ll ever be paid given the rapid changes.
Szalajda worries about “a Wild West scenario” where respirator manufacturers are free to cut corners in production, and no one will be there to catch them.
“The American public, if you’re buying a respirator or a mask to do home improvements or hobbies or anything, you’re going to be at the mercy of those companies to not become lax,” said Linda Chasko, a NIOSH employee who was speaking in her capacity as vice president of the federal employees union that includes the Allegheny County NIOSH campus employees.
The potential closure has also alarmed industry members, who have spent significant time and money ensuring their respirators meet NIOSH standards, and rely on the certification for new products.
The closure of the lab could also cede the respirator market to foreign companies whose products are tested according to their own government’s standards. NIOSH certification, however, had often been referred to as a “gold standard,” Szalajda said.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, for example, KN95 masks were often billed as an alternative to N95s, which were at times difficult to find. The primary difference is that KN95s were certified in China. However, issues were found with a number of certified KN95s, which led to numerous recalls.
There is also a fear that counterfeit masks will spread. Part of the Personal Protective Technology Lab’s mission was to find and study respirators with fake NIOSH-approval stamps, and work with distributors to stop their spread.
One of the last research projects that lab employees are working to finalize is a comprehensive study on the efficacy of counterfeit masks. They found that virtually all of them failed to consistently meet NIOSH standards for filtering air particulates. Between an HHS communications freeze and uncertainty that the report can be finalized before the lab closes, it’s unclear if the report will ever be released to the public.
“We’re expecting there could potentially be an influx of counterfeit equipment,” said Chasko. “What’s at stake is the respiratory health and overall health of all the workers in industries that use equipment reliant on NIOSH standards.”
The lab’s closure could also cause problems for certain industries, like coal, where companies are statutorily required to provide NIOSH-certified respirators for miners. It’s unclear what will happen if NIOSH is no longer able to provide that certification.

For example, every underground coal mine is required by law to provide specialized respirators called closed-circuit escape respirators. They’re for the worst case scenario: escaping a deadly and low-oxygen environment where something has likely gone very wrong.
Those respirators are not just approved by NIOSH, but regularly audited by the lab to ensure they still work after being stored in harsh underground conditions with heavy dust exposure. The same masks are also required in certain Navy ships.
“We have found failures,” one employee said about their regular audits.
Personal protective equipment researchers in Morgantown, West Virginia, the other NIOSH office where research on respirators and protective gear is done, were also hit with layoffs.
One Morgantown NIOSH employee who worked with the personal protective equipment team on firefighter safety recommendations was notified on April 1 that they would immediately be placed on administrative leave. That will end with their termination on June 1.
Still, they’re hoping the decision will be reversed, and requested anonymity for fear of being targeted in the event that some employees are brought back.
“We were told it was just going to be a consolidation … that the scientists would not be let go,” the employee said about the layoffs, which have affected almost everyone at the Morgantown NIOSH campus. “But the scientists went in the first round.”
Cathy Tinney-Zara, president of the federal employee union that represents the Morgantown NIOSH employees, said almost all work at the division has stopped, with almost everyone put on administrative leave ahead of terminations in June.
“You wouldn’t believe how confusing it’s been,” Tinney-Zara said. She said leaders at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services have not been communicating with union officials. She can’t even provide an exact number of workers who have been told they’re being laid off.
Mostly, she gets updates through the news like everyone else. Most recently, U.S. Rep. Riley Moore, a West Virginia Republican, said some of the layoffs at the Morgantown facility, which does extensive work on coal miner safety, were made in error. But Tinney-Zara hasn’t been able to confirm that or find out where he got that information.
“It’s a real tragedy,” Szalajda said about the lab’s closure and cuts at NIOSH. “For people who work in this business, it’s not just the paycheck. It’s a lifestyle. People who have been involved within our division, they work there because of a mission, the attractiveness of doing something that makes a difference in people’s lives.”
But Szalajda is hopeful that HHS may still reverse course. He and other employees are waging something of a pressure campaign by reaching out to lawmakers, industry partners and media.
Moreover, he believes that even if the lab, or most of NIOSH, is shut down now, one day it will be replaced. But it may be a hard learning curve for whoever’s brought in to get it running. He expects many of the most experienced people on staff now, would not return.
“It’s just kind of a recipe for disaster,” Szalajda said. “It may not be something that happens right away, but there will be some sort of incident that will show the void of what’s been left from stepping away, and someone will have to own the travesty that comes after that.”

The Japanese automotive maker is being impacted by President Trump’s new 25 percent imported automobile tariffs. (Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)I’m old enough to remember when hundreds of thousands of Buicks, Mercurys, Oldsmobiles, Plymouths and Pontiacs rolled off the assembly lines every year in Flint, Dearborn, Lansing, Detroit and Pontiac, the respective hometowns of these storied brands.
The problem is that too many other people, including influential policymakers, also wistfully recall those days and somehow believe they can be resurrected.
Mercury, Oldsmobile, Plymouth and Pontiac ignobly landed in the junkyard of automotive history decades ago.
There hasn’t been a Buick built in Flint, the brand’s former hometown and birthplace of General Motors, since 1999. Buick still exists but sells only a small fraction of the approximate 800,000 U.S.-produced vehicles it shipped to dealers annually in the late 1970s and early 1980s.
President Donald Trump says he’s determined to restore U.S. auto manufacturing through stiff tariffs that will force domestic and foreign automakers to build all the cars and trucks they sell to American consumers here.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
While he has repeatedly flip-flopped on tariffs for other goods, such as smart phones, Trump is holding steady (at least as I’m writing this sentence) on 25% tariffs for foreign-built autos and parts. Those include many vehicles built outside the U.S. by Detroit automakers.
(Whoops. The president said he’s considering pausing tariffs to give the industry more time to build plants in the U.S.)
“Foreign automobile industries, bolstered by unfair subsidies and aggressive industrial policies, have expanded, while U.S. production has stagnated,” Trump said on March 26 in announcing his own aggressive industrial policy.
Trump sees a hermetically sealed U.S. auto industry as the centerpiece of his plan to create a “golden age of America.” And his hyper-loyal lieutenants charged with implementing the tariffs couldn’t be more delusional in their support.
“(W)e want the tires made in Akron. We want the transmissions made in Indianapolis. We want the engines made in Flint and Saginaw. And we want the cars manufactured here,” said Trump trade advisor Peter Navarro.
Trump puts the blame on the decline of the U.S. auto industry squarely on free trade. Trade deficits with other countries have led to “the hollowing out of our manufacturing base,” distorted supply chains and threatened national security, he said.
His common refrain is countries that run a trade surplus with the U.S. are “ripping us off.”
(Side note: popular Chinese-built Buicks saved the brand from extinction, although Buick and other non-Chinese automakers are struggling there as of late.)
Some economists agree that globalism has destroyed millions of blue-collar factory jobs in the U.S.
Prominent among them is Susan Houseman, director of research at the Upjohn Institute for Employment Research in Kalamazoo. Houseman has been widely noted for her eye-opening  finding that liberalized trade with China in 2001 was the root cause of the staggering loss of U.S. manufacturing jobs.
Other economists insist the decline in manufacturing employment has been a result of increased productivity made possible by the proliferation of factory robots.
“What you see is that the real story in the auto sector is automation,” Jason Miller, a Michigan State University business professor, told CNN Business.
Surprisingly, there are more automotive assembly jobs in the U.S. then there were in 1994, the year the much-maligned North American Free Trade Act took effect, according to Labor Department data cited by CNN. (There are about 183,000 fewer auto parts jobs than at the start of NAFTA.)
It’s a different story in Michigan because of something we don’t like to talk much about—the precipitous competitiveness decline of the Detroit Three automakers.
Except for monster pickup trucks and gargantuan SUVs, American consumers generally prefer Asian and European brands not built in Michigan. That’s tough to say for someone like me, who grew up in a mostly GM family.
Ford, GM and Stellantis (formerly Chrysler) sold just 5.4 million cars and light trucks in the U.S. last year, down nearly 60% from the more than 12 million cars they sold in 1999, according to a University of Michigan economic forecast.
Overall, 15.8 million cars and trucks were sold last year in the U.S., dominated by foreign brands.
Forecasting sales this year is a nightmare because of Trump’s 25%, confusing tariffs on foreign-built cars and parts. But higher prices resulting from the tariffs could cuts sales by 700,000 vehicles this year, according to auto analytics firm Cox Automotive.
In February, before the auto tariffs were enacted, U-M economists predicted the Detroit Three’s U.S. market share would fall to a record-low 32.7% by 2026 following decades of declining sales.
Less market share means less need for assembly plants, parts and workers. It shouldn’t be surprising then that auto manufacturing employment in Michigan has plunged from its most recent high of 91,000 in 2000 to about 49,000 in February.
They key to reversing that trend is for the Detroit Three to build more vehicles that appeal to American buyers lost to Honda, Hyundai and Toyota. Tariffs won’t save them.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2208357928-1024x704.jpg,,,2025-04-18 06:05:42.546358

Janne Myrdal, R-Edinburg, speaks during a floor session in the Senate on April 17, 2025. (Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)A North Dakota legislative committee this week recommended adding $1 million in the budget bill for the Office of Management and Budget for a “life education committee” to teach people about abortion alternatives.
The amendment was brought by Sen. Janne Myrdal, R-Edinburg.
Myrdal said the program would help inform pregnant women considering abortion of other options.
“What we’ve found in the state is that they don’t have information about what those are: pro-life centers, adoption services for women and families in crisis pregnancy,” Myrdal said. 
North Dakota Supreme Court hears arguments over abortion ban

The state’s Abortion Control Act already requires health care professionals to make pregnant women aware of alternatives before they can obtain abortions.
The committee established by the amendment would oversee a campaign to teach the public about state abortion laws, laws and policies “supporting life and family values,” as well as resources available for pregnant mothers, families and children, it states.
While the campaign would be supervised by the committee, it would be carried out by a third party contractor, according to the amendment.
The contractor would be hired through the Office of Management and Budget in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General.
The committee would include three people appointed by Gov. Kelly Armstrong, two people chosen by the House majority leader and two people chosen by the Senate majority leader.
The life education committee would also be tasked with overseeing a video the state must produce to educate abortion providers about state abortion laws, the amendment states.
Lawmakers set aside $50,000 for the video under House Bill 1511, which Armstrong signed into law on Wednesday.
Bridget Turbide, executive director of North Dakota Right to Life, spoke before the Government Operations Division of the Senate Appropriations Committee in favor of the amendment on Wednesday. The amendment originally recommended $1.5 million, which Turbide said is needed to educate the public properly. Lawmakers cut this down to $1 million.
Some committee members asked why Turbide wanted the state to conduct the program as opposed to a private organization.
She said that the messaging would be more effective coming from the state.
“The public are going to agree with the state education over the private a lot of the time,” she said.
North Dakota judge vacates state abortion ban, ruling it unconstitutional

Sen. Terry Wanzek, the committee’s chair, asked Turbide to prepare more specific details on how third-party contractors would use the money to share with lawmakers.
The amendment was made after the budget bill had its public hearings in the House and Senate.
Christina Sambor, an attorney and lobbyist for the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, questioned why the amendment was rolled into the Office of Management and Budget bill so late in the legislative session.
“Why wasn’t this a separate piece of legislation that requires a public hearing like everything else?” she asked.
Sambor also noted that the North Dakota Supreme Court sent a strong message against lumping policy issues to budget bills when it ruled in 2023 that the state’s previous OMB budget violated the state constitution’s single-subject rule.
Myrdal said the amendment aligns with existing laws that signal the state’s preference for birth over abortion.
“This is just going forward as a state and doing what we can to inform people of the services. It’s not really controversial,” Myrdal said.
When asked if the amendment constituted a policy change during the appropriations process, Myrdal said no. 
“Appropriations should not write policy and there are times they go, ‘Shoot, we forgot that little thing,’” she said.
Katie Christensen, state director of external affairs for Planned Parenthood North Dakota Action Fund, said the campaign and proposed committee would be a “disastrous use” of public money.
“North Dakotans are facing real struggles accessing sexual and reproductive health care, and yet politicians obsessed with banning abortion care about one thing: pouring money into their misguided priorities,” she said in a statement to the North Dakota Monitor.
The committee gave the bill a do-pass recommendation. It is headed to the full Senate Appropriations Committee next. 
Lawmakers passed a law in 2023 that banned all abortions, except in cases of rape or incest in the first six weeks of pregnancy or when the pregnancy poses a serious health risk to the mother. That law was struck down by a district court judge last fall, who found that women have a right to seek abortions for any reason up to the point of fetal viability.
The state appealed the lower court’s decision to the North Dakota Supreme Court, which has yet to rule on the case.

Bryan King, R-Green Forest, speaks against Senate Bill 354, the $750 million Franklin County prison appropriation, on the Senate floor on Monday, April 7, 2025. (Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)With one major exception, Arkansas lawmakers gave Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders almost everything she asked for in the 95th General Assembly, and even then it wasn’t a total loss.
The Legislature’s Republican supermajority passed bills addressing Sanders’ priorities: maternal health, a higher-education overhaul, concerns about the effects of social media platforms on children and restrictions on the influence of China in Arkansas.
The big exception: funding for a planned 3,000-bed prison in rural Franklin County on the western side of the state. 
Senate Minority Leader Greg Leding, D-Fayetteville, told the Advocate Wednesday that he’s experienced longer and more challenging sessions since being elected to the state Legislature in 2010, but the 2025 session saw “quite a lot of conflict.”
Much of the controversy arose over efforts by one legislator to dissolve the State Library and its board and another lawmaker’s efforts to police the use of public restrooms. Then there was a conflict about funding a new state prison.

“The biggest story is probably the defeat of the appropriation for the prison in Franklin County, especially considering that was one of the governor’s top priorities,” Leding said. 
A $750 million appropriation bill to support the prison’s construction died after five failed votes in the Senate this month. Sanders has pushed for the new penitentiary to alleviate overcrowding in county jails. State officials and residents have fought against the project, citing concerns about transparency, infrastructure and staffing. 
State lawmakers this week also challenged a separate bill that would have added $250 million to a correctional facilities set-aside fund into which the Legislature placed $330 million during the 2023 legislative session. 
An additional $75 million appropriated in 2022 for prison expansion has already been allocated to the Arkansas Department of Corrections, which can use the funding to move the project forward. 
Senate President Pro Tempore Bart Hester, R-Cave Springs, said Wednesday that money will support the hiring of architects and engineers who can help officials get a better understanding of the project’s overall cost. Initial estimates set the prison’s price tag at $825 million.  The state Board of Corrections has already sought proposals from architects and general contractors.

“I would have liked to have funded the entire prison, but the members saw fit to just fund a portion of it, and that’s great,” Hester said. “We’re moving in the direction we want to go, just not as fast as we wanted to go.”
Putting a more positive spin on the rejection of the $750 million appropriation bill, its primary sponsor, Searcy Republican Sen. Jonathan Dismang, told the Joint Budget Committee Monday that the corrections department isn’t likely to use all $75 million allocated to the agency before next year’s fiscal session — when lawmakers can again explore options for funding prison expansion in April. If officials need more money before then, they can request lawmakers’ approval for a temporary appropriation increase, he said.

Sanders’ effort to address the state’s poor maternal health outcomes found bipartisan support this session and culminated with her signing Act 124 into law just two weeks after announcing the policy.
The Healthy Moms, Healthy Babies Act changes the state’s Medicaid program by establishing presumptive Medicaid eligibility for pregnant Arkansans, offering reimbursements for doulas and community health workers and establishing pregnancy-related Medicaid coverage for specific treatments.

Aaron Pilkington of Knoxville, are at right during a press conference at the state Capitol on Feb. 6, 2025. (Mary Hennigan/Arkansas Advocate)
Arkansas has one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the nation, and the third-highest infant mortality rate, according to the Arkansas Center for Health Improvement. 
Sanders last year convened a Strategic Committee for Maternal Health to develop recommendations for addressing the state’s maternal health crisis. Sanders’ efforts have not included support for expanding Medicaid coverage for postpartum mothers from 60 days to 12 months after birth because she said it would be “duplicative.” Arkansas is the only state that has not taken advantage of this federal option.
Rep. Aaron Pilkington, R-Knoxville, and Sen. Breanne Davis, R-Russellville, presented legislation this session that would have provided the extended coverage to qualifying pregnant Arkansans. House Bill 1004 advanced through the House before failing in a Senate committee earlier this month. 
Arkansas’ Medicaid expansion program, called ARHOME, covers people up to 138% of the federal poverty level. ARHOME covered 237,327 Arkansans as of the end of February, the latest figures available from the Department of Human Services. Regular Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program covered another 230,058 adults and 421,192 children, for a total 888,577 Medicaid beneficiaries.
Since Jan. 1, 2023, Medicaid covers pregnant Arkansans with incomes of up to 214% of the federal poverty level, or about $45,200 for a family of two or $68,700 for a family of four. 
This coverage expires two months after birth, leaving many postpartum Arkansans to “fall through the cracks,” Davis told the Senate Public Health, Welfare and Labor Committee on April 9. 
“We have got to address this holistically, and I think there’s been a lot of really good work done, but it has not included this group of women,” who do not qualify for Medicaid expansion, she said.

The proposal to expand coverage had supporters from both political parties. House Minority Leader Rep. Andrew Collins, D-Little Rock, proposed a similar bill that was never heard in committee. 
Social media
Sanders signed two bills Wednesday that she said in January’s State of the State address she hoped would reach her desk during the session.
The two bills cleared the Legislature on the last two days of business. One new law allows parents to file civil lawsuits against social media platforms if content on those platforms harms their children, and the other amends the state’s blocked social media age verification law.
The Social Media Safety Act of 2023 was the first of its kind in the nation and required social media platforms to verify the age of new account holders in Arkansas. Those under 18 could only access sites with parental permission. A federal judge temporarily blocked the law before it went into effect and permanently blocked it in March.
The amendments to the Social Media Safety Act will go into effect in August. They more clearly define social media and apply the definition to more platforms, lower the age of minor users from under 18 to under 16 years old, prohibit social media algorithms from targeting minors, and add a penalty for noncompliance.

The other bill Sanders signed would hold social media companies accountable for showing and promoting content to a child without that child’s consent if viewing the content leads to “significant bodily or cognitive harm.”
Sanders has yet to take action on a third social media regulation bill on her desk, the Children and Teens’ Online Privacy Protection Act. That bill would ban technology companies from collecting data from Arkansas minors except under specific circumstances, such as for financial transactions.
Companies would also be barred from retaining that data and disclosing it to third parties that use the information in advertising targeted to children, and they would be required to provide notice and obtain consent if they are collecting data under permissible circumstances.
Ballot measures
Sanders signed a slew of bills that place new restrictions on direct democracy, the process by which Arkansans can propose new laws or constitutional amendments and put them to a statewide vote. Many were sponsored by Sen. Kim Hammer, R-Benton, who in 2026 will run for Secretary of State, the office that oversees elections.
Hammer and other Republican lawmakers said adding regulations to the process of soliciting and gathering signatures on petitions will protect the integrity of direct democracy and discourage fraudulent behavior.
New requirements include but are not limited to:

Signature gatherers, known as canvassers, must inform potential signers that petition fraud is a criminal offense
Canvassers must request a photo ID from potential signers
Potential signers must read a petition’s ballot title or have it read to them
Ballot titles must be at an eighth-grade reading level or lower
Petition sponsors cannot submit more than one conflicting petition at the same time

Democratic lawmakers and members of the public said the restrictions will have a chilling effect on the people’s right to initiate new laws and constitutional amendments.
In February, a committee rejected a proposed enforcement agency within the Secretary of State’s office to investigate the validity of submitted ballot initiative documents.
On Wednesday, the final day of the session, the House voted down a bill that would have given the Legislature the authority to overturn voter-approved constitutional amendments.
The Red Menace
The Legislature also took up multiple “foreign adversary” bills. While the bills technically targeted several nations — such as Iran, Russia and North Korea — China has been repeatedly mentioned by lawmakers intent on rooting out the Communist country’s perceived influence within Arkansas.
Sanders promoted the legislation, saying in press conferences and on social media that Arkansas is the first state to “kick China off of our farmland and out of our state.”

The session’s efforts built off of legislation passed in 2023 and 2024 that limited Chinese businesses from owning land in Arkansas and prohibited them from operating cryptocurrency mining facilities.
Many of the bills passed in the last days of the session, such as House Bill 1680, which built on Act 636 of 2023’s prohibition against land ownership by foreign adversary-controlled businesses. HB1680 added more prohibitions on such businesses, banning them from holding leases on land or having an interest in agricultural land within 10 miles of “critical infrastructure” such as dams or power generation facilities.
Other foreign adversary bills targeted higher education. Act 473 of 2025 requires extensive screening of individuals being considered for employment by a university or college if the person is from a covered foreign adversary such as China, depending on the role they are being considered for. It also creates a high bar for higher education institutions to enter into research agreements or cultural exchanges with groups from foreign adversary nations, requiring they be rejected unless a strong state interest is identified.
Another bill, House Bill 1352, prohibits funding for institutions of higher education that have a Chinese cultural center or a Confucius Institute. A federal government report in October 2023 noted there are fewer than five Confucius Institutes left in the U.S. since Congress restricted federal funding to schools with institutes. 
Under House Bill 1604, government agencies would be prohibited from buying promotional items such as stickers and mugs from Chinese businesses, while House Bill 1683 would bar government agencies from buying electric vehicles or their components if the vendor could not certify that it was not made using forced labor. 
HB1683 took particular aim at alleged forced-labor practices in China — specifically mentioning alleged human rights abuses committed against the Uyghur people — although the importation of goods made with forced labor has been illegal in the U.S. since 1930 with the passage of the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act. 
The Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act of 2021 established that there is a presumption that all goods imported from China’s Xinjiang region, where allegations of forced labor are concentrated, are produced using forced labor.

Photograph by John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout ©2025Tennessee’s bill restricting education for undocumented immigrant students could be dead for the year.
The Lookout is hearing from key lawmakers that the measure won’t make it to the House floor for a vote this session.
Because of the potential for a major financial impact, lawmakers put the measure sponsored by House Majority Leader William Lamberth “behind the budget,” meaning it couldn’t be taken up until lawmakers approve the spending plan for fiscal 2026. They did so Wednesday, but the legislation that would allow school districts to check the immigration status of students continues to flounder in the House where rank-and-file members don’t want to be put in the position of voting on it.
A major drawback is that the bill contains no provision for the state attorney general to defend school districts if they check students’ status, thus forcing them to spend their own money to go to court to ward off a legal challenge.
Sponsors have been bucking all year for litigation that would send the question to the U.S. Supreme Court, in hopes of undoing Plyler v. Doe, the 1982 case that requires all students, including immigrants, to be educated.
The Senate version of the bill, which passed on a 19-13 vote last week, differs in that it would require school districts to determine whether students have permanent legal status in the country. The House bill makes it optional.
Both measures would allow school districts to charge tuition to students without legal status.
Without changes the bills were likely to wind up in a conference committee of House and Senate members where differences would be worked out, raising questions about whether the bill would come out unscathed.
Hundreds of people have rallied against the bill throughout the legislative session. And Sen. Bo Watson, sponsor of the Senate bill, has drawn heat from Hamilton County principals, the Tennessee Small Business Alliance and other opposition groups. 
The financial impact estimate for the bill points out Tennessee is required to follow federal Title VI laws prohibiting discrimination against students. Violations could put $1.1 billion in federal funding at risk, even though the U.S. Department of Education might be eliminated under President Donald Trump’s administration.
Lamberth told reporters Thursday he’s trying to find out if the federal funds would be endangered but said the bill could be taken up at any time.
At the very least, though, the bill is in flux. Whether it flies could be determined by whether backers want a blood bath on the House floor.
Humble to challenge Johnson
A bipartisan eruption over millions of dollars slipped into the state budget to pay for primary elections appears, in part, to be spurring competition for Williamson County’s state Senate seat.
Republican candidate Gary Humble, founder of the ultra-conservative Tennessee Stands political group, told the Tennessee Lookout this week he will run for election to the 27th District seat held by Senate Majority Leader Jack Johnson of Franklin. Johnson narrowly defeated Humble in the last battle.

Humble confirmed his candidacy while criticizing a move to add $8 million to the state budget to reimburse county election commissions for holding primary elections. The Senate placed the money in the budget Tuesday during a finance committee meeting, and the House made the move Wednesday on the chamber floor.
Democrats and several Republicans who favor closing primaries and allowing caucuses blasted the move, saying they were deceived in committees when they asked whether the primary bill came with a cost.
Humble told the Lookout he considers the funding move a “slap in the face” of taxpayers. It clashes with proposals by Elevate 2025, a group that Humble supports, to hold a Williamson County Republican caucus.
Humble told the Lookout the primary bill wouldn’t have passed if it had $8 million attached, and he accused lawmakers of lying to the opponents and the public while forcing the legislature to vote on an amended budget.
Without the money, county governments would have been forced to make up the cost to hold primaries.
“Jack Johnson is leading a campaign of fraud and corruption against the people of Williamson County and the entire state for his own desire for political retribution,” Humble said in a statement to the Lookout.
Johnson, who has shied away from commenting about Humble, said the primary bill he sponsored in the Senate isn’t an effort to go after the competing political group. Johnson backed the Williamson County Conservatives group, which opposed Elevate 2025, in recent county party elections.
Nevertheless, he said the opposing group has discussed using a caucus, which he contends would be “an absolute disaster.”
“It would disenfranchise tens of thousands of Republicans that want to vote, or Democrats if they have a Democratic primary,” Johnson told the Lookout. 
Johnson pointed out state law requires primaries for general assembly and federal offices, but not for county offices and said he’s glad the legislature is “finally addressing that inconsistency.”

Caucuses, which enable party members to select party nominees instead of voters electing them at the polls, are the great political endeavors that led to the election of Andy Ogles, Tennessee’s most creative resume embellisher, as Maury County mayor. That helped buoy his career and eventual election as U.S. congressman after the legislature gerrymandered the 5th Congressional District to rid themselves of Democrats and liberal Republicans.
Similarly, Rutherford County held a caucus roughly 15 years ago that led to the election of a county sheriff who wound up serving federal prison time for fraud. He allowed his chief administrative deputy to start a company called JailCigs that sold e-cigarettes to jail inmates.
It just goes to show that bypassing voters is good, until it’s not.
Getting Nico-ed
Republican Sen. Page Walley warned colleagues Thursday that the legislature could be “Nico-ing our citizens” by passing stricter rules on the hemp industry after farmers and businesses invested in the product based on laws passed just a few years ago.
The Hardin County Republican was referring to the former Tennessee Vols quarterback Nico Iamaleava who left the team, or was dismissed, after trying to negotiate a raise in his NIL deal to $4 million from $2.1 million.
“We don’t need to Nico our law-abiding citizens who trusted us,” Walley said, as he opposed the bill.
Despite the quippy approach, senators voted 23-9 to set up a new regulatory approach to the hemp industry, putting the Alcoholic Beverage Commission in charge of policing products, and severely restricting the hemp derivative THCA – also referred to as the flower.

Although state law allows nothing above .3% THC (the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana) in items such as gummies or hemp cigarettes, once the stuff is decarboxylated, the level gets higher.
The bill’s sponsor, Republican Sen. Richard Briggs of Knoxville, told senators Thursday they were really voting on whether to legalize recreational marijuana in Tennessee and said the state has “totally unregulated” pot under the current setup.
He harkened back to Woodstock, love, peace and rock ‘n’ roll but said the weed people were smoking back then had less than 3% THC. 
“That’s your grandfather’s marijuana,” Briggs said.
Enough senators bought his argument that they turned back the clock on hemp and put the industry in turmoil. 
Something tells me, though, that folks will find a way to get their weed, one way or another.
Whose school system
The bill allowing state leaders to appoint a board to oversee Memphis Shelby County Schools passed the Senate finance committee and House finance subcommittee this week.
Tennessee lawmakers file Memphis Shelby Schools “hostile takeover” at last minute

The sponsors, Republican Sen. Brent Taylor of Shelby County and Republican Rep. Mark White of East Memphis, said it’s not a “takeover,” even though opponents are calling it a “hostile takeover.”
In a sizable government expansion, both bills would give a state-appointed board authority over school district budgets, contracts exceeding $50,000 and under-used or vacant properties. The Senate bill also would allow the state commissioner of education to remove the district director and school board members. 
The rationale is that the elected board and director aren’t getting the job done. Maybe they aren’t. Then again, a lot of people would say the Tennessee legislature is doing a crappy job, too, so they’re even.
This isn’t exactly a recent phenomenon. But the pending solution begs the question: Who takes over the takeover board when there’s nothing left to take?

(Photo: John Partipilo)The Tennessee General Assembly’s 2026 budget trimmed $35 million from a funding bucket intended to support ongoing efforts to preserve North America’s most ecologically diverse freshwater river while serving the growing Middle Tennessee population’s water needs.
The Duck River, a “scenic treasure” according to Gov. Bill Lee, provides water to an estimated 250,000 Middle Tennessee residents. Its water levels reached concerning lows in 2025, and an increase in dead mussels signaled the river’s health is in peril, scientists say.
Lee’s budget proposal originally earmarked $100 million “to create a regional water supply strategy that will solve this problem once and for all,” he said in his 2025 State of the State Address.
The $59.8 billion budget approved by the Tennessee General Assembly on Wednesday allocated $65 million to projects involving the river. House Majority Leader William Lamberth, a Sumner County Republican, said in a Thursday news conference that when viewed “as a whole, 98% plus of the budget was almost exactly what the governor proposed.”
TDEC: $100M Duck River budget ask could be used toward regional Tennessee River pipeline

Rep. Jody Barrett, a Dickson Republican, represents Hickman County, which is bisected by the Duck River. While his constituents’ concerns about the river are mostly environmental for now, residents of neighboring Maury County are looking toward the Duck as a “saving grace” for water shortages, he said.
“Certainly $35 million is going to have some practical impact. As far as how that money was going to be used, I’m not exactly sure, so I don’t know that it will be a considerable immediate impact,” Barrett said. “But obviously it’s an emergency situation, depending upon where you are along the river.”
Barrett said he understands part of the reasoning behind the funding redirect was a lack of specificity on how the funding will be used.
Lee’s November executive order to conserve the Duck River tasks the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation (TDEC) to “evaluate large-scale engineering projects” for cost and feasibility.
TDEC Commissioner David Salyers in March referred to the proposed $100 million as “incentive money” to encourage partnerships among regional utilities. 
Salyers chairs the 19-member advisory group created by Lee to make recommendations to the governor and state lawmakers. He told lawmakers last month that the funding could be put toward a potential pipeline from the Cumberland or Tennessee rivers to “really solve the problem” of drinking water access. 
But Salyers also acknowledged that a full solution will likely require hundreds of millions of dollars over the course of several years.
“While we are disappointed by the reduction in funding by $35 million for the Duck River projects, we recognize that conservation requires sustained commitment over time, not just in moments of opportunity,” Harpeth Conservancy CEO Grace Stranch, also a member of the governor’s advisory group, wrote in an email to Tennessee Lookout. “I am honored to serve on the Duck River Planning Partnership and look forward to working with partners across the region to identify sustainable, collaborative solutions for protecting one of Tennessee’s most vital natural resources.”

The backlash was immediate. Some states with Democratic governors refused to comply, arguing that the directive lacks legal basis, fails to clearly define what constitutes “illegal DEI practices,” and threatens vital equity-based initiatives in their schools.
After lawsuits from the National Education Association teachers union and the American Civil Liberties Union, the Department of Education agreed to delay enforcement until after April 24.
But states across the country, both liberal- and conservative-led, are worried about losing other aid: the pandemic-era money that in some cases they’ve already spent or committed to spending.
The Department of Education has long played a critical role in distributing federal funds to states for K-12 education, including Title I grants to boost staffing in schools with high percentages of low-income students, and emergency relief like that provided during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Conservative-led states — particularly Mississippi, South Dakota and Arkansas — rely the most heavily on these funds to sustain services in high-need districts. North Carolina is also among the most reliant.
The 15 states with the highest percentage of their K-12 budget coming from federal funding in fiscal year 2022 — the latest year with data available from the National Center for Education Statistics — voted for Trump in the 2024 presidential election. Similarly, 10 of the 15 states receiving the highest amounts of Title I funding in fiscal year 2024 also voted for Trump.
Mississippi and Kentucky have sent letters to the Department of Education expressing concern over halted pandemic aid.
The clash over federal funding comes even as the future of the Department of Education is murky, given President Donald Trump’s pledge to dismantle the department.

DEI-related cuts
In letters to the Department of Education, state officials and superintendents in Illinois, New York and Wisconsin pushed back against the DEI directive.
New York officials said they would not provide additional certification beyond what the state already has done, asserting that there “are no federal or State laws prohibiting the principles of DEI.” Illinois Superintendent Tony Sanders wrote that he was concerned that the Department of Education was changing the conditions of federal funding without a formal administrative process. Wisconsin Superintendent Jill Underly questioned the legality of the order.
New York State Department of Education Counsel and Deputy Commissioner Daniel Morton-Bentley noted that the federal department’s current stance on DEI starkly contrasts with its position during Trump’s first term, when then-Education Secretary Betsy DeVos supported such efforts.
Colorado and California also confirmed they would not comply with the Department of Education’s order.
While some states with liberal leaders are gearing up for legal battles and possible revocation of funding, conservative-led states such as Florida have embraced the federal directive as part of a broader push to reshape public education.
In Florida, anti-DEI laws have been in place dating back to 2023. In fact, many school districts and the state education department say they plan to follow the federal department’s directives, noting the similar state laws.
Pandemic aid cancellations
In March, the Department of Education abruptly rescinded previously approved extensions of pandemic-era aid, ending access to funds months ahead of the original March 2026 deadline.
When the Massachusetts governor’s office voiced concern over that decision, the federal department’s reply on social media was blunt: “COVID is over.”
Sixteen mostly Democratic-led states and the District of Columbia filed a federal lawsuit against the Department of Education and Secretary Linda McMahon, challenging the abrupt rescission of previously approved extensions for spending COVID-19 education relief funds.
But backlash against abrupt federal cuts to education has not been limited to blue states.
Mississippi’s Department of Education warned the cuts would jeopardize more than $137 million in already obligated funds, slated for literacy initiatives, mental health services and infrastructure repairs. “The impact of this sudden reversal is detrimental to Mississippi students,” state Superintendent Lance Evans wrote in a letter to McMahon.
The letter also outlines the state’s repeated — but unsuccessful — efforts to draw down millions in approved funds since February.
Shanderia Minor, a spokesperson for the Mississippi education department, told Stateline the agency is awaiting next steps and direction about the funds and federal directives.
In Kentucky, state Education Commissioner Robbie Fletcher told districts — which stand to lose tens of millions in pandemic aid — that abrupt federal changes leave them “in a difficult position,” with schools already having committed funds to teacher training and facility upgrades.
According to Kentucky Department of Education spokesperson Jennifer Ginn, the state has about $18 million in unspent pandemic aid funds left to distribute to districts. And districts have about $38 million in unspent funds, for a total $56 million that could be lost.
Lauren Farrow, a former Florida public school teacher, told Stateline that schools that receive Title I money are already underfunded — and the federal threat only widens the gap.
“Florida is pouring billions into education — but where is it going? Because we’re not seeing it in schools, especially not in Title I schools,” said Farrow. “I taught five minutes away from a wealthier school, and we didn’t even have pencils. Teachers were buying shoes for students. Why is that still happening?”
Effects in the classroom
Tafshier Cosby, senior director of the Center for Organizing and Partnerships at the National Parents Union, a parents advocacy group, told Stateline that while most families don’t fully understand the various school funding systems, they feel the impact of cuts in the classroom.
Cosby said parents are worried about the loss of support services for students with disabilities, Title I impacts, and how debates about DEI may deflect from more urgent needs like literacy and teacher support.
“We’ve been clear: DEI isn’t the federal government’s role — it’s up to states,” she said. “But the confusion is real. And the impact could be devastating.”
Today, as a consultant working with teachers across Florida’s Orange County Public Schools — one of the largest districts in the country — Farrow says many educators are fearful and confused about how to support their students under changing DEI laws.
“Teachers are asking, ‘Does this mean I can’t seat a student with glasses at the front of the room anymore?’ There’s so much fear around what we’re allowed to do now.”
“There’s no one giving teachers guidance or even basic acknowledgment. We’re just left wondering what we’re allowed to say or do — and that’s dangerous.”

((Photo courtesy of The Conservation Fund)On Wednesday, the Rappahannock Tribe acquired the largest amount of its ancestral lands to date with the transfer of nearly 1,000 acres from The Conservation Fund, to be preserved in perpetuity under easement with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Virginia Board of Historic Resources.
All but a sliver of the four-mile stretch of shoreline that makes up Fones Cliffs, a cultural and ecological treasure that is the location of the tribe’s historic homeland, is now protected. The area is the habitat of one of the largest concentrations of nesting bald eagles along the Atlantic coast. 
“Tribal citizens will once again, after 350 years of being separated from their mother, the Rappahannock River, have unimpeded opportunities to practice life-sustaining traditions,” said Patricia Morris, the Rappahannock Tribe’s marketing coordinator, via email. “Hunting, fishing, and ceremonies can resume on the lands where their ancestors are buried.”

The tribe will co-steward the land with the Rappahannock River Valley National Wildlife Refuge, whose goal is to protect 20,000 acres of wetlands and its associated uplands along the Rappahannock River and its major tributaries. 
“We’re just real thrilled that this property is back in the hands of the people that will care for it best,” said Heather Richards, The Conservation Fund’s vice president for the Mid-Atlantic Region.
The preservation of an additional 1,000 acres will add to what is a “…very significant contiguous block of land that’s now managed for wildlife and native habitat, and that in and of itself is remarkable just in terms of the size of it and also the uniqueness of the cliffs,” said Richards. 
 A return to their homeland 

The Rappahannock people’s roots stretch back centuries before Virginia was first colonized by Europeans, and research has confirmed their presence on the ancient lands surrounding Fones Cliffs.
“Before colonization, limited archeological and historical evidence suggests people were in the river valley 10,000 years ago,” said Morris. “Captain John Smith found at least forty-three densely populated communities, indicating rich if unknown history.”
The Rappahannock people’s way of life was “centered around the river – fishing, oysters, hunting, agriculture, pottery, basket weaving, fish traps, and netting – all of which was based on the natural resources of the river,”  Morris said. 
When colonization and development displaced the tribe, forcing them inland,“it was miles away from the tribe’s life-sustaining practices,” Morris said. “The spiritual connection to the river was lost, devastating the culture and changing the history of the tribe’s struggle to survive.”
The tribe’s return to the river is the culmination of years of effort to acquire the land, which Morris said “felt a lot like climbing a mountain while carrying a moon-sized shopping bag of moving parts and pieces.”
The land transfer marks the second major acquisition of land by the tribe along the Rappahannock River in recent years. In 2022, the tribe celebrated its rematriation to 465 acres of land bordering the waterway.

The Rappahannock Tribe will now have opportunities to  expand its Return to the River program, which trains tribal youth in traditional river knowledge and practices. 
The tribe is also planning to build a small visitors’ center on the newly acquired land, new pow wow grounds, walking trails and public education and recreation opportunities through a grant from the American Environmental Restoration Initiative and the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation.
 Not an easy win  

Just over two years ago, the fate of the land was entirely unknown. It was in the hands of the Virginia True Corporation, a developer with big plans for the property, including the construction of an 18-hole golf course, a resort subdivision, luxury condos and federally funded housing.  
In 2022, the Virginia True Corporation put the property up for public auction as a result of bankruptcy proceedings. The Conservation Fund was the highest bidder in the public auction for the land and successfully acquired the property for $8.1 million. 
Then came more than two years of efforts to secure the funding needed to conserve the land through an easement with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service before it could be transferred into the possession of the Rappahannock Tribe. 
After some “ordinary” delays in that process, the easement was completed in December of last year, and The Conservation Fund was “able to move pretty quickly to get the fee title into the hands of the tribe,” said Richards. 
 River worries 

The tribe’s long-awaited return to the River comes at a time of great concern for the health of the Rappahannock River itself. This week, it was designated as the sixth most endangered river in the U.S. by the nonprofit American Rivers. 
The nonprofit stated that “increased strain on water resources and the absence of unified water management threaten the river’s ability to meet the needs of both people and nature.”
Recently, counties along the Rappahannock River have requested to withdraw more water from it than ever before in response to residential, commercial and industrial growth in the region, raising concern amongst indigenous leaders and conservationists. 
The Rappahannock River stretches roughly 200 miles from the Blue Ridge Mountains to the Chesapeake Bay and supports a diverse range of ecosystems that provide critical habitat for fish and wildlife, according to American Rivers.

(Photo by Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)Virginia colleges and universities are feeling federal pressure to end diversity, equity and inclusion policies that promote representation from various backgrounds, and George Mason and Old Dominion Universities are the latest to make or propose changes that align with President Donald Trump’s Jan. 21 executive order to end DEI efforts within the public sector.
The University of Virginia was among the first in the state to respond to the rollbacks, and the Board of Visitors voted to dissolve the Office of Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Community Partnerships March 1.Gov. Glenn Youngkin praised the move and asserted that “DEI is done at the University of Virginia.”
Trump wrote in his order that “illegal DEI and DEIA policies” violate civil rights laws.
“The federal government is charged with enforcing our civil rights laws,” the executive order states. “The purpose of this order is to ensure that it does so by ending illegal preferences and discrimination.”
The federal government has also warned ODU and other universities and colleges to end race-based decision making​​, or they would lose federal funding.
 After renaming DEI office and axing related staff positions, George Mason considers more changes

On Thursday, GMU’s Academic Programs, Diversity and University Community Committee considered a plan recommending the Board of Visitors adopt a resolution to comply with Trump’s order by eliminating all programs, training and processes not specifically required by federal or state law and, if necessary, scrapping staff positions within 30 days of the resolution’s approval.
However, student and faculty representatives challenged the effort at Thursday’s meeting, emphasizing the importance of DEI for inclusivity and student success.
Solon Simmons, president of the university’s Faculty Senate, said at least 90% of faculty members are opposed to the resolution. He also said more time is needed to debate the proposed clauses and that the proposal appears exclusive, opposite of the university’s culture.
“The thing that stuck to me was this idea that at Mason, we want people to belong, and then … there’s a compliance piece, which I think is really important for the board to do, but if we want everyone to feel like they belong, things like this probably are not going to help that,” Simmons said.
Bryan Caplan, an economics professor at the university who was invited to speak by committee chair and Youngkin appointee Lindsey Burke, supported the idea of the committee’s dissolution. He compared DEI to McCarthyism, an era of political persecution for progressive Americans and alleged communists in the 1950s.
“Renaming McCarthyism would not have removed the threat it posed to freedom of thought on campus, and renaming DEI does not remove the threat it poses to freedom of thought on campus,” Caplan said. “GMU’s DEI has never done anything to me personally … but this has to be done to protect GMU from all the witch hunts that we’re going to see in the future (if) we don’t do the right thing, right now.”
The resolution also proposes to dissolve the university’s Bias Incident Response Team, designed to mitigate or prevent bias occurrences, and the Access to Research and Inclusive Excellence program, which is responsible for examining university practices in identifying bias.
The university has also recently renamed the DEI office to the Office of Access, Compliance, and Community (OACC), provost and executive vice president Jim Antony and committee members highlighted, and eliminated certain positions, to ensure compliance with new executive orders.
Anthony said the Board of Visitors was scheduled to receive a comprehensive report from faculty on the university changes related to DEI in February, but the board tabled the presentation.
GMU staff did share that two vacant positions in the former DEI office were eliminated, the Antiracism Inclusive Excellence initiative was dissolved and inclusive excellence plans have been excised from the university president’s goals. 
Staff also recommended the committee engage in more dialogue before passing any resolution, to ensure it aligns with the university’s values and goals after finding a few contradictions between the proposed DEI resolution and the board’s antisemitism resolution that passed in February. 
Cameron Harris, faculty representative to the committee, said the antisemitism resolution invites OACC to use the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance Working Definition for training and education. However, it is not allowed in the proposed resolution.
“The resolution seems to limit education, training and most importantly, the valuing of our diversity,” Harris said.
Burke criticized DEI at the meeting, linking it to critical race theory, and suggested it undermined merit-based admissions and academic excellence. 
She also mentioned that other school leaders are dissolving DEI initiatives at institutions like the University of Virginia, James Madison University, VCU and Virginia Tech. She expects an updated resolution to be ready for the Board of Visitors’ May 1 meeting.
Va. community colleges end diversity, equity and inclusion practices

“Our job on this board is to make sure we are complying with the law and not jeopardizing the federal or state funding that may be received,” Burke said. “Federal funding is a privilege, not a right.” 
 Old Dominion’s quiet DEI changes

Unlike Mason, Old Dominion University made several changes to its DEI initiatives that remained unknown to the public for weeks. The Virginian-Pilot first reported the changes last week.
One of the major differences: ODU’s Institutional Equity & Diversity webpage was renamed Talent Management and Culture, with the banner now stating “Equity Compliance, Respect and Community.”
The original banner stated “equality, diversity, respect and inclusiveness for all.”
The new webpage excludes links to ODU’s Monarch Task Force for Inclusive Excellence, Monarch Plan for Inclusive Excellence 1.0, John R. Broderick Diversity Champion Award and it no longer states “Celebrating 85 Years of Diversity.” 
The task force’s status is unclear, with its page now leading to a 404 “page not found” error.
The nine-member Diversity and Inclusive Excellence staff page was removed from the institution’s website. The webpage now reads “access denied.”
Most of the staff appears to have remained under the new office, Institutional Equity and Culture, except for an office manager position. The remaining positions cover training, community relations, outreach, and Title IX regulations.
One of the staff members is Veleka Gatling, previously the associate vice president for equity and inclusive excellence under the Institutional Equity & Diversity office. Gatling is now the associate vice president for community relations in the Community Engagement and University Events office.
September Sanderlin was also listed under the directory as vice president for human resources and DEI in the human resources office. Her title is currently vice president for talent management and culture.
Other clues preceded ODU’s departure from DEI. Stanley Goldfarb, also a Youngkin appointee, asked about DEI in the university’s medical school curriculum and requested to meet with the school’s dean before he was removed fromODU’s Board of Visitors by Senate Democrats in May.
Goldfarb, who recently spoke on Fox & Friends Weekend about his departure, did not specify why he wanted to see the curriculum or why he wanted to meet with the dean, which he attributed to  Secretary of Education Aimee Guidera’s recommendation.
Goldfarb chairs an organization called Do No Harm, which he said represents physicians, nurses and medical students, patients and policymakers and is dedicated to keeping identity politics out of medical education, research and clinical practice. 
“We think all patients should be treated the same, that this should be a colorblind environment, that physicians should be the best individuals that are available to practice medicine and care for all patients,” Goldfarb said on Fox & Friends Weekend. “And as far as I’m concerned, it has nothing to do with the proper practice of medicine.”
Youngkin signs several maternal health bills, tweaks another on unconscious bias training

Several studies have revealed implicit bias — which DEI policies can counteract — plays a role in America’s health care system. A 2016 UVA study found “a substantial number of white medical students and residents hold false beliefs about biological differences between black and white people (e.g., black people’s skin is thicker; black people’s blood coagulates more quickly) that could affect how they assess and treat the pain experienced by black patients.” Bias can also influence how artificial intelligence applications in health care exacerbate existing disparities, research shows. 
Virginia’s legislature passed bills this session that would require medical professionals to complete unconscious bias training before renewing their licenses. Youngkin amended the measures, removing the mention of cultural competency and unconscious bias in the original wording, a change lawmakers rejected. The bill now awaits the governor’s approval as-is or veto.

Gov. Glenn Youngkin on Thursday announced the release of two new dashboards — one tracking maternal mortality and the other pregnancy-associated deaths — alongside an upgraded Maternal and Child Health (MCH) Dashboard that breaks down preterm birth, infant mortality, low birthweight and prenatal care data by region, race, and ethnicity.
“More moms are alive today because of the unprecedented work of the Virginia Department of Health, the Virginia Department of Medical Assistance Services, health care providers and community partners,” Youngkin said in a statement. 
“Today’s launch is another key step to provide the data needed for this all-hands-on-deck mission. We are making significant strides, but we will not stop working until every baby in Virginia is born to a healthy mom.”
Preliminary numbers from the Virginia Department of Health (VDH) show encouraging signs: maternal mortality in 2023 and 2024 was half what it was during the height of the crisis in 2021, when 47 deaths were reported among more than 95,000 births.
But state officials and advocates say there is still a long way to go, especially for Black mothers, who face significantly higher risks of complications and death during pregnancy.
“Pregnancy and new motherhood should be a sacred time in the life of a mom and her baby. Last year, for more than 20 women and their families, it was a time of tragedy and loss,” said Virginia Health Secretary Janet Kelly. “With accurate, actionable data we can help providers all across the commonwealth do more to support healthy babies and healthy mothers and prevent these tragedies in the future.”
The dashboard upgrades are part of Executive Directive Eleven, signed by Youngkin in December, which directs state agencies to improve maternal health outcomes through better data, expanded access to quality care and increased public awareness. That order built on Executive Order 32, which revived Virginia’s Task Force on Maternal Health Data and Quality Measures last summer.
State Health Commissioner Dr. Karen Shelton, an OB-GYN, said many maternal deaths are linked to conditions like mental health challenges, cardiac issues, and chronic disease — areas where early intervention can save lives.
“For too many women, mental health, cardiac disease and other chronic diseases create difficulties during pregnancy that can lead to death,” Shelton said. “As an OB-GYN, I am grateful for the collaborative effort that has already saved lives and believe the new Maternal and Child Health dashboards will improve transparency, ensure data-driven decision-making and help us achieve even better results in the years ahead.”
The new dashboards are being released during Black Maternal Health Week, a nationwide campaign founded by the Black Mamas Matter Alliance to raise awareness and push for systemic changes to improve maternal outcomes for Black women. 
In Virginia and across the country, lawmakers are using the week to call for stronger protections and better access to care for communities disproportionately impacted by maternal mortality.
Virginia’s updated dashboards allow users to filter by year, region, race/ethnicity, and locality, providing a granular look at key indicators like maternal smoking rates, prenatal care access and birth outcomes. 
The dashboards were developed through collaboration between the VDH Office of Family Health Services, the Division of Population Health Data, the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, and the Office of Information Management.
Though Virginia’s overall maternal and infant health stats track closely with national averages, state officials say the goal is to close the persistent racial and geographic gaps that leave some mothers more vulnerable than others.
“Healthy moms mean healthy babies,” Youngkin said. “And healthy babies are the foundation of a strong and thriving Virginia.”

Maryland’s high school graduation rate climbed to 88% in 2024, reaching its highest point since 2017, according to the Maryland State Department of Education (MSDE). The increase of nearly 2 percentage points over the previous year marks a significant recovery following pandemic-era declines.
The 2024 data from MSDE shows significant gains among student groups that have historically faced barriers to graduation. Hispanic students saw their graduation rate rise over seven percentage points from 2023-2024, while multilingual learners experienced a dramatic increase of over 10%.
“Last year was the largest year-over-year gain of any student group, and I think that’s a testimony to targeted, sustained supports that are making the difference,” said Theresa Timmons Parrott, an MSDE official focused on multilingual education. “It’s a step in the right direction, but it’s not the finish line.”
Anne Arundel County Public Schools reported a graduation rate of 89%, two percentage points above the state average. North County High School in Glen Burnie, a Title I school, achieved a 7% increase in its graduation rate.
﻿
Bob Mosier, chief communications officer for Anne Arundel County Public Schools, said “every student group is different, and so it’s providing students with what it is that they need on an individual basis to be successful.”
“A nearly full-point jump in overall graduation rate is a very significant accomplishment,” said Mosier. “We also had six schools that increased by two percentage points or more.”
Mosier credited the district’s progress in part to Project Graduation, a systemwide initiative launched two years ago to provide tailored support to students at risk of not finishing high school on time.
“It really is a laser-like focus on individual students and what those students need in order to graduate, graduate on time,” Mosier said about the project. “We put that in place two years ago, … and we’re starting to see that pay off now.”
In Baltimore City, the four-year graduation rate rose by one percentage point for the 2023 graduating class. MSDE said the district focused on ninth-grade intervention and reducing chronic absenteeism, two predictors of long-term academic success. According to MSDE’s public dataset, Baltimore also saw improved outcomes among English language learners and students experiencing homelessness.
Statewide, female students continued to graduate at higher rates than male students, and white and Asian students graduated at higher rates than their Black and Hispanic peers. Students with disabilities graduated at a rate of 69%, still well below the statewide average. Economically disadvantaged students’ graduation rate increased slightly from 2023, graduating at a rate of 82%.
The graduation rate report comes as Maryland begins to implement the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future, a landmark education reform law that aims to expand early childhood education, increase college and career readiness and close equity gaps. Several of the strategies outlined in the Blueprint — including community school models and increased funding for English language learners — align with areas of progress highlighted in the 2024 data.
“If you dig down into the Blueprint, it really lays the foundation for the strategies we’re seeing pay off,” Parrott said. She attributes a large portion of the progress made to broaden access to early childhood education, target funding for multilingual learners, and mandate college and career readiness pathways by tenth grade.
 
﻿
While the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future has driven recent graduation gains, lawmakers enacted adjustments this year due to a projected $3 billion budget shortfall. The Excellence in Maryland Public Schools Act, passed in April 2025, includes a three-year delay in implementing teacher collaborative time and provisions to freeze increases in funding if state revenues significantly decline.
Still, regional disparities persist. While some districts reported graduation rates above 90%, others, particularly in rural counties on the Eastern Shore and in Western Maryland, sit at 80% and below. Education advocates say these gaps underscore the need for continued investment and monitoring.
“This is great news for Maryland,” State Superintendent of Schools Carey Wright said in a press release from MSDE. “When we set high standards, deliver strong instruction, and invest in proven supports, our students show that they will exceed expectations.”
As the 2025 graduating class enters its final year, educators and policymakers are cautiously optimistic. The latest data suggests that Maryland’s post-pandemic recovery is underway, however state education officials say it will require long-term commitment to equity, funding and student support services to maintain.

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)Fabian Schmidt, a German-American man living in Nashua, was returning home from a visit to Luxembourg on March 7 when he was detained by immigration officials at Boston Logan International Airport in early March and taken to a detention center in Rhode Island, according to his attorney.
Schmidt’s family said that, upon his detainment, Schmidt was stripped naked, placed in a cold shower, and violently interrogated, according to a press release from attorney David Keller. He was also reportedly being denied his medications for anxiety and depression, and being given little food and water as officials pressured him to relinquish his green card.
His mother, Astrid Senior, told NBC News that she doesn’t know why her son was being held.
“I feel helpless, absolutely helpless,” she told the news broadcaster.
Schmidt has lived in the U.S. since he was a teenager and has legal permanent resident status, according to the family. Court records in California, where he previously lived, show that he faced misdemeanor charges for possession of a controlled substance and driving under the influence in 2015 and 2016, respectively, among other minor charges. However, his family said those issues had been resolved in the courts and are no longer ongoing.
Officials with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security — which includes Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection — have not provided a justification for Schmidt’s detainment. They have, however, denied the allegations that he was violently interrogated.
“These claims are blatantly false with respect to CBP,” Hilton Beckham, assistant commissioner of public affairs for Customs and Border Protection said in a statement to the Bulletin. “When an individual is found with drug-related charges and tries to reenter the country, officers will take proper action.”
Schmidt has a court date scheduled in June in Boston.
“I’ve been very disturbed by the reports that I’ve read about this case,” U.S. Rep. Maggie Goodlander, who represents New Hampshire’s 2nd Congressional District and Schmidt’s Nashua, said. “We have been in close communication with Fabian Schmidt’s family, and we are working to get as much information as we can and to support in every way that we can.”
U.S. Sen. Maggie Hassan said her office, in collaboration with Sen. Jeanne Shaheen’s office, has inquired within DHS and spoken with Schmidt’s family. She declined to speak on the issue during an event Monday, and said she is “honoring the wishes of the family and their legal advisers.”
“We are in touch with Homeland Security and Mr. Schmidt’s family, but we are also respecting their privacy,” Hassan said. “There’s ongoing litigation about it, so we will respect the privacy but we continue to be in touch with them.”
She would not say whether she knows the justification for his detainment.
Gov. Kelly Ayotte’s office did not respond to requests for comment.
Part of a broader Trump administration strategy
Schmidt is not the only legal U.S. immigrant to be part of a high profile legal battle over their immigration status. President Donald Trump, who made cracking down on immigration and mass deportation central tenets of his campaign in 2024, and his administration have launched a public campaign of deportations and detainments that have been decried as illegal and unethical after being reported by the press.
In one of the highest profile immigration-related incidents, Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate student and an Algerian citizen with permanent legal resident status in the U.S., was arrested by ICE officials in his New York City apartment on March 8, one day after Schmidt was detained. Khalil, who was born to Palestinian parents in a refugee enclave in Syria before ultimately immigrating to the U.S. and marrying a citizen, was an organizer of protests on Columbia University’s campus against the Israeli occupation and military action in Gaza. The State Department is currently attempting to revoke his legal status in the country and deport him as punishment for his role in the protests, a move that has generated an uproar among progressives and immigration advocates who believe Khalil has a protected right to free speech. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Khalil engaged in “antisemitic protests and disruptive activities, which foster a hostile environment for Jewish students in the U.S.” On Friday, a judge in Louisiana ruled that the State Department can deport Khalil. A federal court in New Jersey is expected to hear further appeals in the case.
Several other university students who protested Israel’s war in Gaza have also been targeted by the Trump administration.
Tufts University Ph.D. student Rümeysa Öztürk, from Turkey with a student visa, was arrested by ICE agents on March 25 in Somerville, Mass. Video of her arrest, which shows six agents in plain clothes, some of whom were obscuring their badges or wearing hoods or face coverings, went viral online and sparked furor. While federal officials have not publicly provided justification for her arrest, Öztürk was the author of a 2024 op-ed in the university’s student newspaper calling for the university to “acknowledge the Palestinian genocide” and “disclose its investments and divest from companies with direct or indirect ties to Israel.” Hamas was not mentioned in the op-ed.
Another Columbia University student, Yunseo Chung, an undergraduate student who has lived in the U.S. since she was 7 and is a permanent legal resident, was another target of ICE after the administration attempted to deport her over her involvement in the pro-Palesintian protests. However, the administration has been so far unsuccessful in deporting the woman, who was born in South Korea, amid a legal battle. Rubio, in a press conference last month, said the Trump administration has revoked over 300 visas of students who have engaged in pro-Palestine protest activity.
The Trump administration has also moved to purge Venezuelan and other Latin American migrants from the country under the auspices that they have connections to the violent Tren de Aragua  and MS-13 gangs. In March, the Trump administration flew 238 men to El Salvador with no due process. There, they are being detained in a notorious mega prison called the Terrorism Confinement Center, known for brutal conditions and under the control of Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele, who has described himself as “world’s coolest dictator.” The administration reportedly used some of the men’s tattoos and clothing as the sole evidence of their gang affiliations. However, an analysis of those deportees by CBS News found no criminal records for 179, or roughly 75%, of them.
That includes Kilmar Ábrego García, a Salvadoran citizen who’s lived in Maryland for 15 years. Even after admitting in court it deported him due to “administrative error,” the Trump administration refuses to bring Ábrego García back to the U.S., saying it is up to Salvadoran officials to decide his fate. This is despite the Supreme Court ordering the Trump administration to “facilitate” his return to the country. In an appearance at the White House Monday, Bukele said he would not return Ábrego García, calling the idea “preposterous” and asking, “How can I smuggle a terrorist into the United States?”
Those deported also include a makeup artist who immigrated from Venezuela to California in August named Andry Hernandez Romero. He had no criminal record, no known gang affiliation, and was undergoing the asylum process after fleeing his country over fears he would be persecuted for being gay and his political beliefs, according to his lawyers. Trump invoked the 1798 Alien Enemies Act in these Salvadoran deportations. The move has been criticized for refusing to give the men due process and for its brutality. Rubio said Sunday that another 10 people have been sent to El Salvador.
On Friday, Trump authorized the military to take control of land along the southern border. His announced plan is to station military troops there to detain immigrants traveling into the country from Mexico. He has also previously declared a national emergency arguing “America’s sovereignty is under attack” and that the border is “overrun by cartels, criminal gangs, known terrorists, human traffickers, smugglers, unvetted military-age males from foreign adversaries, and illicit narcotics that harm Americans.”

These are regular people who have done everything “right” — either they signed up for their Medicare or Medicaid coverage, held onto jobs with employer-sponsored plans or were self-insured on the marketplace. Then, they got cancer and the bills started rolling in without any end in sight. Soon, the bill collectors and credit agencies came knocking. These are nurses, educators, and single parents — people who weren’t just battling cancer but debt collectors, too.
For many Virginia families dealing with a serious illness, this is not hypothetical; it is their everyday struggle. Recent reports indicate that as many as half of Virginia adults are currently navigating medical debt or have done so within the past five years. We can’t expect our neighbors, at their sickest and most vulnerable, to live under the weight of such physical and financial stress, forced to choose between lifesaving treatments or keeping a roof over their families’ head and also answer persistent, threatening calls from creditors.  
Thankfully, in Virginia, we’re seeing lawmakers take decisive action to tackle the mounting issue of medical debt and alleviate its heavy burden on families. In 2024, Gov. Glenn Youngkin signed legislation to prohibit credit-reporting for medical debt, which safeguards patients’ credit scores and enables greater financial stability. This year, the General Assembly passed House Bill 1725 sponsored by Del. Karrie Delaney, D-Fairfax, a bipartisan bill that aims to provide further protections to patients by shielding them from unfair medical debt collection practices. 
Youngkin has the opportunity to formalize these protections for patients, and it’s the hope of many Virginians that he does. The proposal, as passed by the General Assembly, seeks to make interest rates and accrual less punitive for Virginians dealing with medical debt, prohibit wage garnishment for patients who qualify for financial assistance and protect patients’ financial assets. 
The hope is that, by reducing the negative consequences of medical debt through this legislation, Virginia can promote healthier families, more stable communities and a stronger Commonwealth. By signing the legislation as-is, Youngkin can address the unending harms of medical debt that lead families into financial toxicity. 
Since its introduction at the start of the legislative session, HB 1725 has earned sweeping support across medical, public health and patient advocacy groups. Those within and who represent the cancer community have, for years, been sounding the alarm on the cascading harms of medical debt on patients and families, citing results from a recent survey of cancer patients and survivors that paints a troubling picture. The survey found that nearly half of cancer patients and survivors reported having medical debt related to their illness. Among them, 30% have faced credit problems and 8% have lost their homes or been forced into unsafe living conditions. Furthermore, 46% of patients and survivors with cancer-related medical debt felt harassed by creditors and debt collectors, who commonly threaten credit scores as an intimidation tactic.
This is especially troubling for younger Americans who, according to recent reports, are being diagnosed with cancer at increasingly younger ages. In many cases, these diagnoses are coming before these younger patients have a strong financial footing. HB 1725 would provide Virginia with an opportunity to promote the financial future and mobility of younger Virginians, which could entice young families and graduates of our state’s great universities to stay, establish roots and build a life here. 
Affordability is important to Youngkin. A veto on HB 1725 would run counter to his commitment to address Virginians’ high cost of living. 55% of state residents have experienced at least one health care affordability burden in the past year, making it even more important that the governor sign this legislation.
Youngkin has until the end of April to act, and Virginians cannot afford to lose momentum on this key issue. Inaction threatens to compound existing hardship and force more families out of our state or into the depths of financial ruin.  Youngkin has the power to shift the reality of disease to one where patients can focus on the most important thing: fighting for their lives.

Sometimes, you have to wonder what century it is that some of our state lawmakers inhabit.
For a classic example of how detached from reality some have become, check out a new proposal advancing in the legislature to establish censorship boards in every school district charged with banning books that quote “include descriptions of sexual activity” or are quote “pervasively vulgar.”
First of all, the definitions are impossibly vague and will invite all kinds of destructive meddling from people who are no more skilled in evaluating literature than they are at teaching physics or chemistry.
But even setting aside the offensiveness of establishing government-run censorship boards, the notion of banning books – of all things — because they discuss sex in a society in which most kids are regularly online and vast numbers while away their days playing hyperviolent video games, would be laughable if it weren’t so sad.
If only kids could be inspired to read books.
The bottom line: Appointing censorship boards to ban books has always been a bad idea. In 2025, it’s downright ridiculous.

(Photo by Ethan DeWitt/New Hampshire Bulletin)In February, the Trump administration sent a letter to all state education departments with a broad message: diversity, equity, and inclusion programs in public schools must come to an end. Every public K-12 school and university must stop policies related to “diversity, equity, and inclusion,” or face a potential loss to their funding, the letter stated.
This month, a New Hampshire federal judge is grappling with whether to stop the government from enforcing the letter.
A group of organizations – the National Education Association, the National Education Association of New Hampshire, and the Center for Black Educator Development – have sued the U.S. Department of Education in the U.S. District Court of New Hampshire to block enforcement of the letter. The suit is being litigated by the American Civil Liberties Union’s Racial Justice Program and the American Civil Liberties Union of New Hampshire. 
On Thursday, Judge Landya McCafferty presided over oral arguments in the lawsuit. She’s weighing whether to issue a preliminary injunction. 
The requirement is not immediate; after an extension agreed to last week, state education agencies have until April 24 to certify that the state’s schools have agreed to the conditions in the letter. But plaintiffs are hoping McCafferty issues the injunction sometime next week to halt enforcement before that deadline arrives. 
Plaintiffs argue that because the letter threatens financial repercussions against school districts that allow for DEI programs, it could in turn force schools to drop support for NEA and CBED teacher diversity programs. And the NEA says vagueness of the letter will push its teacher members to take defensive measures and avoid teaching certain topics if they think there will be professional consequences for doing so. 
But the government says plaintiffs are overreacting to the letter, which they say simply warns school districts not to fall afoul of Title VI, a federal statute that prevents discrimination in public programs based on race or national origin, and promises investigations and potential withholding of federal funding for those districts that do.
The letter that kicked off the dispute, known as a “dear colleague letter,” presents a stark portrait of public schools.
“Educational institutions have toxically indoctrinated students with the false premise that the United States is built upon ‘systemic and structural racism’ and advanced discriminatory policies and practices,” the letter reads. “Proponents of these discriminatory practices have attempted to further justify them — particularly during the last four years — under the banner of ‘diversity, equity, and inclusion’…” 
The letter relies on Students for Fair Admissions Inc v. President and Fellows of Harvard College, a landmark 2023 U.S. Supreme Court decision in which the court held that the race-based admissions policies at Harvard and the University of North Carolina had violated the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment.
And it says the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights would “vigorously enforce the law” and that institutions that failed to comply with federal law may “face potential loss of federal funding.”
“The Department will no longer tolerate the overt and covert racial discrimination that has become widespread in this Nation’s educational institutions. The law is clear: treating students differently on the basis of race to achieve nebulous goals such as diversity, racial balancing, social justice, or equity is illegal under controlling Supreme Court precedent.”
To the U.S. Department of Justice, the letter is not an official agency rule; rather, it is an interpretive guidance. That means it can’t be struck down by a court the way a rule can, they argued. 
Abhishek Kambli, a U.S. deputy associate attorney general who traveled to Concord to argue the case Thursday, said the letter is simply articulating existing law preventing school districts from classifying students according to their race. Kambli pointed to the Students for Fair Admissions decision, and said the dear colleague letter is simply trying to stop K-12 schools from that kind of discrimination, Kambli told the court Thursday. Already, U.S. case law has established that schools should not make distinctions on the basis of race or other characteristics except in rare circumstances, Kambli argued. And he said those circumstances must face a legal test of strict scrutiny to pass. 
The plaintiff’s hardship, Kambli said, “is due to self-censorship based on a misunderstanding of what the dear colleague letter says.”
Kambli added that the government does not claim diversity, equity, and inclusion itself is illegal; rather, it claims that schools that are already breaking the law by classifying students by race should not use the concept of DEI as an excuse to do so. 
And he said despite the colorful language in the letter, any decision by the federal government to withhold funding to a school could come only after an investigation, and would include the possibility of an appeal. “It’s a lengthy process,” he said. 
But plaintiffs say the government’s characterization understates the impact and scope of the letter. 
The letter creates the possibility of consequences for teachers because of its threat to punish school districts, who directly employ those teachers, Sarah Hinger, deputy director of the ACLU’s Racial Justice Program argued Thursday. And she said the letter contains pronouncements that are hard for teachers to apply to their instruction.  
“Every day, today, tomorrow, they go to work and they are tasked with following the dear colleague letter, along with all their other obligations,” Hinger said. “They are chilled now in their ability to speak… They are uncertain of what practices they can engage in.” 
Hinger also pointed to the Trump administration’s swift move to withhold funding from Columbia University and Harvard University, suggesting that the administration could move quickly to block funding to public schools if it decides to. 
“The chill from that is happening now, and plaintiffs are not required to wait until they are hauled into court in order to challenge an unconstitutional law,” she said. McCafferty appeared sympathetic to plaintiffs, asking Kambli questions about how teachers could cover periods of American history like Reconstruction or the Jim Crow South without worrying they were improperly teaching that America has structural racism. 
The case bears similarity to another lawsuit alleging that New Hampshire’s 2021 “banned concepts” law prohibiting public school teachers from advocating for certain topics around race and gender is unconstitutional. In 2024, the U.S. District Court of New Hampshire agreed with plaintiffs and struck that law down; the decision is currently being appealed in the First Circuit Court of Appeals.
But Kambli said those lawsuits were different because they involved state laws that directly affected teachers. The dear colleague letter should not have a direct effect on the topics that can be taught, he argued. 
“It goes toward how they treat students,” he said. “It doesn’t go toward what they teach.”
And Kambli argued the suing organizations are not linked directly to the Department of Education’s enforcement action, and lack standing to bring a case in the first place. 
Lawyers for the ACLU are attempting to add a handful of New Hampshire school districts as parties to the case, in order to make additional arguments about how the letter would unfairly affect them. But the government argued it needs more time to file a motion countering those arguments, and McCafferty has not yet approved the districts’ inclusion to the case.
For now, the parties are expecting McCafferty to issue a ruling on the injunction before next Thursday. Lawyers for the government asked her to issue a narrow injunction that affects only the named plaintiffs if she must issue one; lawyers for the plaintiffs urged a nationwide injunction. 
Under the agreement reached last week, any New Hampshire school district that signs a letter certifying that they will comply with the letter will not be bound to that letter until April 24, meaning that if the court enjoins the letter before then, the district will not be subject to it. As of Thursday, 165 New Hampshire school districts have signed on, according to the Department of Education’s website. 
At a press conference after the hearing, Hinger said she hopes McCafferty will act quickly.
“I think that the government has shown a track record of avoiding and ignoring careful due process, moving swiftly against institutions and using the full power of its authority against individuals in the education sector and beyond,” she said.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ACLU-Hinger-press-conference-1024x657.jpg,,,2025-04-18 05:01:52.373538

States worry that an executive order and federal funding cuts could weaken their cybersecurity efforts. (Joe Raedle/Getty Images)For the first half of his career in law enforcement, working as a police officer in South Florida, Chase Fopiano did not think cyberattacks on police agencies were a serious threat.
Many of his law enforcement colleagues were under the same impression — that since they were the most likely to investigate the attacks, there was no way cybercriminals would go after them.
By about 2015, as technology advanced and hackers became more creative, that changed, Fopiano said. Now, from the U.S. Secret Service to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, there are thousands of attempts to compromise networks or organizations every day, he said.
“A lot of those [attempts] are toward government or even police, especially because they know that we’re not as prepared as we should be,” said Fopiano, who now oversees cybersecurity as part of a regional task force.
Spanning health care facilities to court systems, states and local communities are facing a rise in cyberthreats. They include threats to critical infrastructure, increased activity from foreign actors, continued ransomware attacks and more, according to a recent report from the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center.
Budget restrictions, staff issues and AI are threats to states’ cybersecurity

But President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order shifting some of the responsibility from the federal government to states and localities to improve their infrastructure to address risks, including cybercrimes. And federal cuts have reduced resources for state and local officials, including a cybersecurity grant program and a key cybersecurity agency.
States and localities are taking steps to address the problems, such as establishing new penalties for tampering with critical infrastructure, centralizing state IT personnel and setting standards in areas from elections to health care.
But the Trump order and federal funding cuts, a shortage of IT experts at the local level and an overall lack of preparedness could weaken their efforts.
In December, a major cyberattack forced Rhode Island to take down its online portal used by residents to obtain Medicaid benefits and SNAP, commonly known as food stamps. The personal data stolen from Rhode Island’s public benefits network — including Social Security numbers and banking information — was later found on the dark web.
In February, a “sophisticated cyberattack” hit the office of Virginia Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares, which led agency officials to shut down computer systems and resort to paper court filings.
Last week, hackers also breached the computer network of the Fall River School District in Massachusetts. The school district is working with third-party experts and law enforcement to determine if anyone’s personal information was targeted, according to MassLive.
In 2023, of the 48 states that participated in the Nationwide Cybersecurity Review, a voluntary self-assessment conducted by federal agencies that examines how well governments are prepared to respond to cyberattacks, only 22 states reached or surpassed the recommended levels of security in their systems.










The notion that the federal government could just withdraw and expect states and localities to step in is just not realistic.


– Samir Jain, Vice President of Policy at the Center for Democracy & Technology


Cybersecurity has become increasingly important over time because more government services and data are digitized, said Samir Jain, the vice president of policy at the Center for Democracy & Technology, a nonprofit that advocates for digital rights and freedom of expression.
But a national shortage of people with that expertise — especially at the local level — creates a challenge.
“The federal government has traditionally played at least some role in trying to fill some of those gaps,” Jain said. “And so the notion that the federal government could just withdraw and expect states and localities to step in is just not realistic.”
Local governments and law enforcement agencies also have other priorities, Fopiano said. The police need cars, guns, shields and other resources that generally take precedence over cybersecurity.
Today, Fopiano is the cybersecurity chair of the Southeast Regional Domestic Security Task Force in Florida, overseeing cyber activity from South Florida to the Florida Keys. The attacks continue to rise, he said.
“Terrorist groups are getting into cybercrime, cartels are getting into cybercrime, you have kids just learning about hacking and just fooling around,” he said. “The audience of who’s doing it has definitely expanded and led to that rise in overall cybercrime.”
Cuts to federal resources
In 2022, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced a first-of-its-kind cybersecurity grant program, providing more than $1 billion in funding for states, localities, tribes and territories to address cybersecurity risks and threats.
The State and Local Cybersecurity Grant Program, created under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, awarded $279 million to states and localities in fiscal year 2024. The Tribal Cybersecurity Grant Program awarded another $18 million for tribes in its first year.
But the grant program is set to expire in September, with no current plans to renew it. At a hearing this month, several state and local officials urged Congress to reauthorize the program. But U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who refused the federal aid during her tenure as governor of South Dakota, questioned the program’s efficacy.
The Trump administration is also cutting as many as 1,300 employees from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, which administers the grants alongside the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
Governments often struggle with massive new IT projects

The program has allowed states to assess the security of their networks, develop cybersecurity training, implement multi-factor authentication features — which requires users to provide more than one form of verification to access a site or service — and much more, said Alex Whitaker, the director of government affairs at the National Association of State Chief Information Officers.
“This has been a really great program because we’re seeing a lot of great evidence for how states and their counterparts in local government are improving their cyber defenses,” Whitaker said.
Counties also rely on a number of federal resources to strengthen their defenses, including services provided by CISA, said Rita Reynolds, the chief information officer at the National Association of Counties and managing director for County Tech Xchange. NACo is an organization that represents county governments across the United States.
The Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center, for instance — a key collaboration between CISA and the Center for Internet Security to help state and local governments with cybersecurity operations — lost some of its federal funding for certain programs last month, Reynolds said.
In trying to keep up with emerging threats, counties are still trying to find resources to help them implement multi-factor authentication, convert government pages to “.gov” domains and other methods of protecting their infrastructure, she said.
“Are counties prepared?” Reynolds asked. “I would say they’re not as prepared as they’d like to be. And in some cases, they are looking at how to strategically approach this now that resources are disappearing.”
In a statement, CISA spokesperson Jared Auchey said Trump’s executive order empowers state and local governments “to make risk-informed decisions and investments to improve their preparedness.” The agency will work with state and local officials to ensure they have the information and support they need, Auchey added.
Lawmakers step up
In 2024, 33 states adopted resolutions or enacted legislation regarding cybersecurity, according to a database from the National Conference of State Legislatures, a nonpartisan public officials’ association.
Many of those measures sought to protect states’ critical infrastructure, including water systems, government services, health care and more. Florida, Louisiana, West Virginia and other states created new criminal and civil penalties for people who attempt to tamper with critical infrastructure.
In Minnesota and Washington state, lawmakers passed measures allowing or requiring state and local governments to invest in cybersecurity protections related to election administration. Connecticut and Florida also passed legislation to secure health care facilities from cyberattacks by having hospitals create plans or by supporting investments in new technologies.
Other states are looking for solutions from outside vendors. South Dakota has set aside $7 million for a company to examine local governments for vulnerabilities to hackers.
Rhode Island state government hit by major cyberattack

With attacks occurring at every level of government, New Mexico Democratic state Sen. Michael Padilla, the Senate majority whip, sponsored legislation in 2023 to create the state’s office of cybersecurity. As chair of the Senate Science, Technology and Telecommunications Committee for 10 years, he plays a significant role in most of the state’s cybersecurity legislation.
Through the committee’s work, Padilla says New Mexico is in good shape to fend off cyberattacks — and the state’s cities and counties are joining in.
“I think New Mexico is in a very good position because what we decided to do by creating that office is to ensure that any transactions that occur with state government here [in New Mexico] have to meet a minimum set of security standards,” he said.
In Indiana, Republican state Sen. Liz Brown filed legislation that would encourage state agencies and groups to develop cybersecurity policies. The bill was approved by both chambers, with the Senate agreeing to changes sent from the House.
“You have to protect your infrastructure,” Brown said. “We don’t want utility systems to be shut down. We don’t want wastewater or freshwater treatment plants or even the water supply being contaminated or harmed in some way. Our systems all have backups, but even so, we know there are bad actors.”
Some states are also preparing to reshuffle their offices or create new ones to centralize their cybersecurity efforts. Arkansas, for example, enacted legislation this month to create a new state cybersecurity office, which will monitor the state’s computer networks and respond to cyberthreats.
In Alabama, rather than having information technology people scattered throughout the government, Republican state Rep. Mike Shaw wants cybersecurity personnel centrally managed.
Shaw’s legislation, which passed the House and is currently in the Senate, would give the Alabama Office of Information Technology central authority to maintain the needs of all of the state’s departments.
The centralization would make it easier to pursue cybersecurity initiatives in the future, Shaw said.
“The federal government is really big, and it’s really hard to come up with a one-size-fits-all solution for things like cybersecurity, data privacy and technology in general,” Shaw said. “So, in some sense, it’s good that the states are coming up with their own.”

For the farm to reach its long-term viability goals, DiNardo is hoping to build a pavilion and other infrastructure to attract more customers. (Rebeca Pereira for CommonWealth Beacon)Twice a year, Kathryn Szerlag, a professor of soil and water chemistry at Texas A&M, traverses the country to reunite with relatives on their family dairy farm in Northbridge, Massachusetts.

“All of [my research] came from playing in the cow manure,” she reflected on a Friday in December, the day before boarding a flight home for the holidays. “That was my day care: a pair of rubber boots.”
The farm provided a singular education. Before academia, Szerlag was a country kid entrusted with testing the butterfat concentration of the milk of 300 cows. It was there, wading in dung, that she ultimately found her subject matter: the environmental degradation wreaked by high phosphorus levels in animal manures.
The farm has remained in agricultural production for four generations, bulwarked by Szerlag’s father, her late uncle, Frank, and his son, Stephen. But it hasn’t persisted unscathed.
  Kathryn Szerlag’s family, which has owned and operated a dairy farm in Northbridge, for generations, had to sell a portion of their land to a developer to make ends meet. (Courtesy of Kathryn Szerlag)

More than a decade ago, the Szerlags sold a field and a wooded swath of land to a real estate developer. Public records show the development, Presidential Estates, carved into the erstwhile farmland a cul-de-sac of single-family homes. In compliance with the town of Northbridge’s requirement that open space account for at least one-third of a development, the remainder of the land was deeded to the Metacomet Land Trust in 2019.
The Szerlag’s land sale isn’t an uncommon choice. Census data indicate that, with their backs against the wall, many farmers sell fragments of their land to support the rest of their business. Since 1997, the number of Massachusetts farms smaller than 50 acres has swelled while the number of larger farms has plummeted.
Some farmers sell their land because there is no one to take over the family business — in Massachusetts, there are three times as many farmers over the age of 65 as under the age of 35. Others do so because the price of agricultural production has become too burdensome. An acre of farmland now costs $14,300 in Massachusetts — third most expensive nationally after New Jersey and Rhode Island. Over the past three decades, the cost of farming itself has nearly doubled.
The latest data from the US Agricultural Census show more than 100,000 acres of farmland in Massachusetts have been lost since 1997.
Almost a quarter of those acres was lost between 2017 and 2022. That’s an average of losing just under 15 acres of farmland a day, approximately 15 football fields end zone to end zone, roughly double the rate of farmland loss nationwide.
The American Farmland Trust, a nonprofit working to conserve agricultural lands, estimates that, without stronger protections, the state stands to lose between 50,000 and 90,000 acres of farmland by 2040 — a possibility Massachusetts may manage to thwart as the levers of the state Legislature begin to arc toward more aggressive farmland preservation.
More than a way of life, farmland loss across New England risks the region’s food security and the environmental contributions of farmers applying regenerative, climate-conscious agricultural practices. These approaches restore soil health, sequester carbon, improve water retention, and reduce erosion, helping the region withstand extreme weather events as the effects of the climate crisis worsen. And it is in service of these stakes that, on Beacon Hill, a commission is poised to issue a series of recommendations for confronting the 21st-century challenges facing farmers in Massachusetts.
At the Community Harvest Project, a nonprofit farm in Harvard, Tori Buerschaper trailed behind a cohort of volunteers weaving through rows of apple trees. She watched on as they sorted first grade apples from those that were blemished or bruised, bagging good ones by the dozen and setting gnarled ones aside to send to the cider mill.
The nonprofit designed this workflow to not only bridge the disconnect between consumers and the food they eat but to illuminate the realities of hunger in Massachusetts.
“We luckily live in one of the most prosperous states in the US, where it’s easy to think there isn’t hunger,” Buerschaper said. “When people have limited income, they’re forced to pick and choose. The thing you kind of get to last, or that you can more easily cut out, is food.”
So far, the model they built has been a success. In 2023 alone, CHP hosted more than six thousand volunteers at its orchard in Harvard and at its 15-acre farm in Grafton. Together, each year, the two locations yield 300,000 pounds of apples, cabbage, tomatoes, peppers, eggplant, squash and other produce that’s sold to 26 partner agencies committed to combating food insecurity.
But the nonprofit’s operation wasn’t always this expansive.
In 2014, CHP was farming on leased land when donors in Harvard gifted the nonprofit 75 acres of orchard and rolling hills after more than 50 years of private ownership.
Land is in high demand in the central Massachusetts town, and Buerschaper explained that her nonprofit “could have made the decision to sell it to the highest bidder.”
“It’s very likely that would have been a developer over a farmer,” she said.










We luckily live in one of the most prosperous states in the US, where it's easy to think there isn't hunger. When people have limited income, they're forced to pick and choose. The thing you kind of get to last, or that you can more easily cut out, is food. 


– Tori Buerschaper, Executive Director at Community Harvest Project, Inc.


Years later, standing watch over the orchard’s undulating hills, these considerations seem to Buerschaper a distant reality. Now, owing to the state’s Agricultural Preservation Restriction program, or APR, the nonprofit’s land is safeguarded against any future development.
If a farmer is looking to buy land and conserve it — or protect land they already own from future development — the Massachusetts Department of Agriculture, or MDAR, will pay the farmer the difference between the land’s market value and its developable value. From then on, the state owns an easement on the land, meaning it can dictate the terms of any future land sale and use, ensuring that land remains in agricultural production in perpetuity.
Since it was established in 1977, the APR program has conserved more than 950 parcels — or 70,000 acres — of farmland across the state, and it has served as a template for farmland conservation programs across the nation. These deed-restricted acres will be farmland forever.
In 2023, CHP closed on an APR totaling almost $3 million, money that CHP’s board of trustees chose to invest. Buerschaper said the nonprofit plans to withdraw $80,000 from its investment portfolio per year. She said the funds have helped ease financial fears about “the growing pains [that] never really stopped.”
APR is one of the best tools the state has to preserve farmland. Other programs exist under the breadth of MDAR’s purview: a land licensing program for state-owned farmland; a succession-planning workshop, Farm-Pass, to help aging farmers transfer their business to a new owner; and numerous grant opportunities designed to keep farms viable and farmers employed.
But these programs are only a treatment, not a cure, for the seemingly insurmountable financial hurdles which push many farmers to sell. APR money can run out with time, and enrolling in the program to begin with may not even occur to farmers needing an immediate remedy for their financial troubles.
The application process requires patience and foresight: Once a farmer applies to the program, staff at MDAR and a third-party appraiser assess the farm’s resource value and work with the landowner to come up with a funding plan. The state’s Agricultural Lands Preservation Committee then votes twice before giving the transaction final approval. In some cases, farmers can opt in to receive federal funding from the USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service, extending the application process even further.
While MDAR is bound to this existing procedure, which can take years, developers are not.
With deeper pockets and greater agility, developers tend to have an advantage over the state’s interest in preservation, especially as the business of farming becomes more and more untenable.
In 2016, Sean Stanton purchased North Plain Farm in Great Barrington, land that had been protected by the APR program for decades and in agricultural production for centuries. Then, three years ago, he closed on another APR that allowed him to purchase a 75-acre property a quarter mile down the road.
MDAR encourages farmers to look for local partners to help fund up to half of the value of their easement. In Stanton’s relatively anomalous case, the town of Great Barrington contributed $92,000 to the purchase. Meanwhile, MDAR awarded him $828,000.
The state’s near-million-dollar investment in North Plain Farm wasn’t the first or the only support it gave. Stanton has received grant funding from MDAR’s Farm Viability Enhancement Program to purchase new farm equipment, and he’s taken business classes through the agency’s Tilling the Soil of Opportunity program. The funding he’s received from the state has helped support his business, but it hasn’t inoculated the farm against financial distress.

Until he decided to go back to school, enrolling in a social work master’s program at Westfield State, Stanton said he was “for years, digging a bigger financial hole.” Now, he hopes to practice as a clinical social worker as soon as 2026. He’ll become one of more than half of the state’s farmers who do not list farming as their primary occupation, and he wonders what will happen when his well of APR funds runs dry.
On the farm, he teased a joke about how farmers make money.
“This is so depressing,” he warned. “How do you make a million dollars farming? Start with two.”
For farmers who have held their APRs for longer than Stanton, concerns about their businesses’ longevity are even more acute.
In July 2001, Dean Mazzarella stood on Pleasant Street, where the road bends and slices across Sholan Farm in Leominster, and accepted a check from the Commonwealth to purchase the farm and to conserve it as farmland in perpetuity.
Mazzarella has been mayor of Leominster for more than 30 years, and by 2001 he had already seen numerous farms in and around the city succumb to a fate that Sholan Farm only narrowly escaped. Over time, Sholan’s owners aged and stopped farming the land. When the land entered the real estate market in 1999, developers drafted a plan to convert the farm’s 167 acres into houses.
That’s when the possibility arose for the city to buy the land instead. With support from the state, the city closed on an APR that totaled $4.75 million. MDAR contributed $2.6 million toward the purchase, and the Department of Conservation and Recreation funded another $1.6 million to support the farm in conserving reservoirs on the land. The city pitched in $500,000 to purchase the land and fundraised the remaining value of the easement through Friends of Sholan Farm.
In the process, Mazzarella found an ally in Joanne DiNardo, who now operates and manages the farm alongside 75 volunteers. DiNardo said the lump sum infusion from the state and other partners “helped us save the farm.” But for Sholan to meet its long-term viability goals — to expand its offerings, to stay open 12 months out of the year, to build a pavilion and other infrastructure that could attract more customers — DiNardo said a “one and done” investment won’t be enough.
Unlike privately-owned farms enrolled in the APR program, city-owned farms like Sholan aren’t eligible for APR improvement grants that could help keep the business afloat for years to come.


If Sholan’s APR money runs out and the business isn’t otherwise profitable, the city could feasibly sell or lease the land to other farmers, maintaining compliance with the terms of the easement. The land would stay in agricultural production, but the city, like all farmers who sell in the face of financial hurdles, would pay the cost.




“Maybe more cities would buy orchards, you know, farms, and maybe get schools to run them or volunteers, like we do. But after you buy the land, you’re on your own,” Mazzarella said. “So, what’s the incentive?”


Beyond these pastoral terrains and panoramic fields, over the course of the last two years, a coalition of legislators and state agricultural leaders heard testimony on the future of the Commonwealth’s agricultural sector.
Led by state Sen. Jo Comerford and state Rep. Kate Hogan, the 21st Century Agriculture Commission is expected to recommend a slate of reforms aimed at tackling climate change’s impact on farms and the demand for educational and technical assistance for farmers. Their recommendations, previewed at a public hearing in July, also address the state’s farmland freefall and the financial obstacles facing farmers. Initially scheduled to be released in December, the commission’s report received a year-long extension and will be released to the public before the end of 2025.
Crucially, the commission is poised to recommend including farms smaller than five acres in the state’s existing agricultural lands tax exemption, a change that could only be accomplished by amending Chapter 61A of the state constitution.
This measure, a reflection of how “farming has changed in Massachusetts,” is also a matter of equity for Winton Pitcoff, deputy commissioner of MDAR. “It’s important that farmers who have been excluded for a variety of reasons — particularly farmers of color through systemic racism that can’t afford large tracts of land — it’s important that we make sure that they can farm if they want to. That means making sure they can access land.”
Farmland preservation has already secured an important step forward with a measure enshrined in the multibillion-dollar economic development bond bill. For months, the must-pass bill idled unresolved following the end of the formal session, but lawmakers returned for a vote and sent the bill to Gov. Maura Healey’s desk in November.
The measure authorizes MDAR to buy, protect and sell farmland, giving the agency enough purchasing power and agility to beat out developers vying for flat, open land unlike the APR program, which is a safety net that requires foresight and patience.
“It’s pretty appealing when someone is able to give you a check right on the spot to buy your land. That’s usually a developer. That’s what leads to conversion,” explained Pitcoff. “It’s not like the department wants to become a landlord and buy lots of land. What this does is give us the flexibility to purchase land more quickly.”
The agency will need to build its buy, protect and sell program from the ground up, writing new regulations and advocating for funds from the state budget each year.
Also included in the economic development bond bill is an initiative to cut some of the red tape around non-agriculture activities on APR farms – a change that will help forge alternative revenue streams for these businesses. As long as the land in question remains in full-time commercial agriculture, MDAR may grant farmers special permits for hosting weddings, classes, charity runs, and other agritourism events adjacent to actual agricultural production.


Previously, farmers like Tori Buerschaper, who hosts a 5k fundraiser at CHP, would need to apply for a discreet permit with each occasion they plan to host an activity. The new permits will be valid for at least one year, and MDAR will have the option to renew these grants, which ultimately aim to promote what the text of the bill refers to as the “long-term productivity of the agricultural resource and the sustainability of the farm enterprise.”

In the eyes of Jared Freedman, Comerford’s chief of staff, the next step for Massachusetts is to recruit support for farmland preservation beyond the marbled halls of the State House, creating financial incentives for municipalities to prioritize preserving farmland.
This model already exists through the PILOT, or payment in lieu of taxes, program, which helps cities and towns recover some of the revenue they lose from state- or nonprofit-owned lands, institutions, renewable energy installations, and more. Land owned by the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority, for example, is property tax-exempt, and therefore returns no tax revenue for local communities.
In return for hosting state-owned lands, 297 communities receive aid through the PILOT program.
Freedman suggested it could be expanded to aid the state’s efforts to work with cities and towns to prevent farmland loss.
“These municipalities are struggling to pay for their schools, to pay for their fire, to pay for their EMS, to repave their roads,” Freedman said. “If you’re gonna try to protect forests and farmlands, the municipalities can’t suffer.”
In the state with one of the highest rates of farmland conversion, the stakes have never been higher.

President Donald Trump imposed 25% tariffs on aluminum and steel imported into the United States, and a 25% tariff on Canadian barley — three things that are vital to the craft beer industry. A tariff is a tax on imported goods.

“The tariffs in general have been chaotic and disruptive to our supply chain,” said Collin Castore, co-founder of Seventh Son Brewery in Columbus. “It’s just … kind of pointless.” 
Seventh Son produces 5,000 barrels of beer annually — 3,500 is roughly its wholesale volume and about 70% of that is packaged in aluminum cans, he said. The brewery uses roughly 750,000 cans per year. 
“Breweries are facing potential tariffs on malted barley, aluminum cans, stainless steel equipment, and energy, all required in the manufacturing of beer,” according to the Ohio Craft Brewers Association. “The increased prices that importers charge to their business customers to offset tariffs are likely to cause consumer price inflation in the best case scenario and closure of small businesses in the worst.” 
The U.S. relies on Canadian imports for barley, aluminum, and steel — the three key resources in brewing beer. Barley is the base grain for beer, aluminum is used for packaging beer in cans, and stainless steel is used to brew beer. 
“There simply is not enough domestic cultivation of barley or production of primary aluminum to sustain the industries that rely on these products without imports from Canada and elsewhere,” according to the brewers association. 
Seventh Son bought four months worth of aluminum cans earlier this year, which has helped it keep prices the same, Castore said. 
“We take raising prices very seriously,” he said. “And it’s also not really a switch that you can toggle on and off terribly easily. … It’s not quite as easy as somebody just signing a blanket tariff order.”
Just like in any other industry, some people are going to buy less craft beer if prices go up, Castore said. 
“If this kind of chaotic environment continues, general consumer sentiment and spending at some point is going to take a hit, and that affects taprooms and six-pack purchases and everything in between,” he said. 
During Trump’s first term in office in 2018, he slapped a 25% tariff on steel and a 10% tariff on aluminum imports.  
State of craft breweries 
For the first time since 2005, the number of craft breweries decreased nationwide in 2024, according to the Brewers Association. There were 9,612 operating U.S. craft breweries in 2024. During that same year, 434 breweries opened while 501 closed.  
Craft brewers produced 23.1 million barrels of beer in 2024, a 4% decrease from 2023. 
There were only about 70 breweries in Ohio when Seventh Son opened in 2013 and today there are more than 440, according to the Ohio Craft Brewers Association. Forty-six breweries opened in Ohio last year and 53 breweries are in planning. 
Ohio craft breweries’ economic impact was $1.27 billion in 2022 and more than 12,000 people were employed by Ohio craft breweries that year.

(Getty Images)When we welcome a child into the world, we do so with hope, determination, and an unspoken understanding that, over time, they will grow into independent adults. We nurture them through childhood, guide them through adolescence, and eventually send them off into adulthood with the skills and support to navigate life on their own.
But for thousands of families across New Hampshire, this traditional parenting path is not reality.
At Lakes Region Community Services (LRCS), we support individuals with developmental disabilities and acquired brain disorders who need lifelong assistance. They depend on services funded through Medicaid waivers to live independently, safely, and with dignity — in their homes and communities.
But today, many of them are waiting.
They wait for staff — due to a workforce crisis that has left our system of care severely understaffed. Direct support professionals are the backbone of our work, but low wages, high stress, and lack of state investment have made it nearly impossible to recruit and retain qualified caregivers. Families who qualify for services can’t use them because there’s no one available to deliver them.
Now, to make matters worse, a budget crisis is threatening to add another wait — for funding.
The combination of these two crises is devastating. Without workers, people wait. Without funding, more people will be forced to wait longer. The proposed state budget is effectively bottlenecking services at both ends — failing to fund the resources we need and failing to build a workforce that can deliver them. The result? A growing number of adults with disabilities left in limbo, and families left to carry the full weight of care with no relief in sight.
Without these essential services — funded through Medicaid waivers and coordinated by nonprofit organizations like LRCS — many adults with disabilities will be forced into more restrictive, more expensive, and less humane forms of care. Natural family caregivers who are currently sustaining them are saving the state millions of dollars every year simply by keeping their loved ones at home. But that system is stretched to its breaking point.
It is unrealistic, and ultimately unjust, to expect parents — many of whom are entering their 60s, 70s, and 80s — to provide 24/7 care indefinitely. These are parents who have spent decades managing complex medical needs, advocating for education and services, and serving as unpaid caregivers while navigating their own health and aging. Their children — adults with disabilities — are still waiting for the resources and support that would allow them to live in supported apartments, hold jobs, volunteer in their communities, and live with dignity and autonomy.
The alternative? A system that is not prepared. New Hampshire simply does not have enough professional, non-family providers. If families cannot continue, and services are not in place, the state will be faced with an influx of individuals requiring round-the-clock care — care that is not only vastly more expensive, but far less person-centered.
This is not just a crisis in human terms. It is a policy failure with very real fiscal consequences.
Investing in Medicaid waiver services — ensuring that individuals with developmental disabilities and acquired brain injuries have timely access to the supports they need  — is a sound economic decision. More importantly, it is a moral obligation. These individuals are our neighbors, our community members, and in many cases, our family. They deserve to live lives of purpose, safety, and dignity — just like anyone else.
At LRCS, we remain committed to this vision, our mission. But we need the support of policymakers, the business community, and the public to make it real.
We cannot continue to ask families to bear the burden and add additional burdens when services are further reduced by budget cuts.
We need a state budget that prioritizes people with disabilities and invests in a sustainable, professional workforce. We need legislative leadership that recognizes that investing in community-based supports is not only the right thing to do — it’s the smart thing to do.
Because when people with disabilities are supported to live and work in their communities, everyone benefits. 
The individuals and families we serve have waited long enough. The workforce is stretched to its limits. And the budget cuts to Medicaid we’re facing cannot become reality.
They can’t wait. And they shouldn’t have to.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/medicaidtrump-1024x650.jpg,,,2025-04-18 05:01:52.373538

They’ll be part of more than 600 events planned nationwide.
The group 50501 is organizing the effort after joining dozens of others in sponsoring massive “Hands Off!” rallies across the country on April 5. It says its mission is to “fight to uphold the Constitution and end executive overreach.”
Since his inauguration, Trump has raised numerous concerns in that regard. He’s ignored court orders, tried to gut the independent federal antitrust watchdog, empowered the world’s richest man to fire tens of thousands from the Social Security and Veterans administrations, the Park Service, and numerous other agencies.
Trump also is trying to unilaterally alter the status of hundreds of thousands of migrants who are legally in the country and force them back to hazardous homelands such as Afghanistan and Haiti. In addition, Trump is trying to use the government to attack law firms that have sued him and his enemies, and go after a state attorney general who successfully sued him in 2023.
Melissa Portala, a leader of Toledo Persist, said that it’s vital for people to exercise their right to protest to protect all their other democratic rights.

“We need people to stand up and show the rest of the public that people are speaking out,” she said. “If they don’t see that, then they feel helpless, and a lot of people do feel helpless until they see other people speaking out… Public protest is the only way that people have to be visible. This is how we can have our voices heard.”
On April 5, millions turned out across the country to protest the actions of Trump and his administration — including tens of thousands across Ohio. In Toledo alone, between 3,000 and 4,000 showed up, according to the estimates of organizers who used clickers, Portala said.
“We started on one side of a bridge,” she said. “It took 45 minutes to walk across it, the crowd was so big.”
Portala said she expected smaller crowds this time around for several reasons. 
The group 50501 is the sole national organizer, while dozens of groups were behind the April 5 protests. This one was called with less lead time for local organizers to plan and get the word out. And this Saturday’s protests fall the day before Easter, when many have longstanding family obligations, Portala said.
Details about the 47 Ohio protests can be found here. A national listing can be found here. 
Portala said she expects participation in such events to grow in the coming months.
“I think the population is waking up and saying, ‘Oh my goodness, we’re in some deep trouble here, we need to actually take some action,'” she said.

A federal judge in Ohio permanently blocked a parental consent law for social media this week. The measure, approved as part of the 2023 budget bill, would have required social media companies verify a user’s age and block access to kids younger than 16 unless they have parental consent. The court had halted it while the case progressed and the statutes were never enforced.
From the outset, the proposal’s puzzling definitions, carve outs, and cumbersome verification methods made for a rickety structure. Despite lauding the effort to protect children, U.S. District Judge Algenon Marbley determined, “the act as drafted fails to pass constitutional muster and is constitutionally infirm.”
“Even the government’s most noble entreaties to protect its citizenry must abide in the contours of the U.S. Constitution, in this case the First Amendment,” he added.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, who championed the provisions alongside former Lt. Gov. Jon Husted, disagreed with the ruling.
“We know how harmful social media is to children without parental involvement,” he said in a written statement. “This law is a commonsense solution that allows social media usage by a child under the permission of a parent, just like going on a school field trip or participating in youth sports. This ruling should be appealed.”
A spokeswoman for Attorney General Dave Yost said, “We’re reviewing the decision and will determine the next steps.”
Meanwhile, lawmakers are already back at the drawing board, working on new legislation that imposes age verification at the level of a phone’s app store, rather than platform by platform. Those bills have yet to get a hearing, but the group that successfully challenged Ohio’s existing restrictions testified against similar legislation in Utah.
Ohio Republicans propose new social media age verification plan

Marbley’s reasoning
Ohio’s law requires websites and online communities that “target” children or can be “reasonably anticipated” to be accessed by them to verify a user’s age. That verification can happen with an email, credit card, over the phone or by video conference among other options. There’s an 11-factor list to determine whether a website falls within the law’s scope and has carveouts for product review sites and “widely recognized” media outlets.
The trade group NetChoice argued the law plainly violates the First Amendment by regulating speech based on its content or the speaker. The group added the state’s explanation of which companies must comply is unconstitutionally vague. Yost fired back that the law isn’t about speech at all, it has to do with whether minors can enter into contracts. “At worst,” the state argued, the law “only incidentally implicates speech.”
Marbley dismissed the state’s contention that the law doesn’t regulate protected speech.  He drew a comparison between social media companies and publishers, and while acknowledging the analogy is “imperfect,” it demonstrates that the law restricts speech “in two consequential ways.”
“It regulates operators’ ability to publish and distribute speech to minors and speech by minors,” he explained, “and it regulates minors’ ability both to produce speech and to receive speech.”
As for the argument that the measure is really about contracts, Marbley pointed to the law’s emphasis on socially interactive features.
“These provisions do not strike at the commercial aspect of the relationship between covered websites and their users,” he wrote, “they tackle the social speech aspect of it.”
Digging further into the dispute over whether the restrictions are content-neutral, Marbley again set aside the state’s arguments. He wrote the determination whether a website targets or would likely be accessed by children “certainly requires consideration of the content on an operator’s platform.” He added the law’s 11-factor list makes it plain that content is the “essential consideration.”
Marbley found fault with the law’s carveouts for review and news media sites as well. He described giving a pass to so-called established media as “eyebrow-raising” and questioned treating a product review site differently than a book or film review site.
The law is “favoring engagement with certain topics, to the exclusion of others,” he wrote, “That is plainly a content-based exception.”
And although Marbley acknowledged the law could still stand if it’s narrowly tailored and serves a compelling state interest, he found the state simply hadn’t cleared that bar.
“Ohio’s response to a societal worry that children might be harmed if they are allowed to access adult-only sections cannot be to ban children from the library altogether absent a permission slip,” he wrote.

(Photo by Graham Stokes for Ohio Capital Journal. Republish photo only with original article.)A case regarding parental rights in a same-sex relationship will be heard by the Ohio Supreme Court this month. It could test not only Ohio law but the federal Supreme Court decision on same-sex marriage.
The state’s highest court will hold oral arguments in a case appealed from the First District Court of Appeals to decide the parental rights of a woman who was in a relationship with the children’s mother when the child was born. But the woman was never married to the mother, and does not have adoptive rights to the children.
Priya Shahani and Carmen Edmonds were in a relationship for more than a decade, and had thoughts of getting married. But the bulk of their relationship occurred before the 2015 U.S. Supreme Court decision Obergefell v. Hodges, an Ohio-based case that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide.
Edmonds argues the couple travelled to Boston with plans to get married, but decided against it, due to the fact that Ohio would not recognize the marriage at that time. The state also does not recognize common-law marriages.
During the course of the relationship, Shahani had three children using a sperm donor that court documents say was chosen because he matched Edmonds’ nationality.
Shahani and Edmonds sought to legally dissolve their relationship after 11 years, an agreement that included scheduled parenting time for Edmonds, but the children still held hyphenated names.
It wasn’t until after Shahani removed the hyphenate from the children’s names and filed to terminate their shared-custody agreement that the case started. Edmonds argued that the couple’s “marriage-like relationship” gave her rights to the children.
A lower court awarded Edmonds “companionship time,” but otherwise effectively ruled against both women. It refused to terminate the shared custody agreement while also not allowing a “parentage” decree for Edmonds.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
When both went to the First District Court of Appeals for answers, Edmonds brought up the Obergefell case legalizing same-sex marriage.
Edmonds argued that under that decision, parental rights statutes apply in this case as they would for married couples. The appellate court said the trial court needed to hold a hearing to decide whether the couple would have been married if the same-sex marriage decision had been in place.
Ohio law only recognizes parents if they are married, have a biological connection, or have legally adopted the child, something that requires marriage in the case of the “second parent.”
The ACLU of Ohio said state parentage laws, combined with the Obergefell decision, “provide a pathway for Ms. Edmonds and other non-biological, non-adoptive, same-sex parents who were unable to have their marriages legally recognized in the state of Ohio during the course of their relationship to establish legal parentage and confer the accompanying rights and responsibilities of parenthood.”
Shahani, noted that she made “the major child-related decisions” including expenses and medical needs. She told the supreme court that giving Edmonds parental rights goes against both state law and the Obergefell decision, even if state statutes were looked at with gender-neutral language.
“This case is about whether Ohio’s courts can reinvent history as a mechanism for seizing a fit parent’s constitutionally protected rights,” attorneys for Shahani wrote in an October brief to the court.
In a state where common-law marriage isn’t recognized, the attorneys said the state constitution, as well as the U.S. Constitution, doesn’t allow state courts to “manufacture an unlicensed marriage into existence.”
“The foundation upon which a ‘would have been married’ standard rests is a hypothetical injury that the individual may have been denied a marriage license if they had applied for one, or the state may not have recognized a marriage had there been an out-of-state marriage,” attorneys told the state supreme court.
Shahani refutes Edmonds’ claim that the two travelled to Boston to get married, then changed their minds. But even if that were true, the legal result should be no different, she argues.
“Even in Ms. Edmonds’s version of events, she would not have been married to Ms. Shahani when the insemination occurred, and therefore would not have parental rights,” court documents stated, citing a state statute regarding artificial insemination of a married woman.
The law, effective as of March 2001, specifies a woman “and her husband” must sign a written consent to the insemination for the “non-spousal artificial insemination” to occur.
The case was mentioned as one of the “state oral arguments to watch” this month by the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU. The center identifies “prominent or interesting state court cases,” which this month include the Ohio parental rights case, along with a challenge to Wyoming’s abortion ban, an appeal to New York City’s greenhouse gas emissions caps, the process of electing appellate judges in Arizona and voter power over zoning changes in an area of Georgia where descendants of slaves have historically taken up residence.
Oral arguments in the case will be heard on April 22 by the Ohio Supreme Court.

For many years, Eric Wunderlin’s health issues made it hard to find stable employment.
Struggling to manage depression and diabetes, Wunderlin worked part-time, minimum-wage retail jobs around Dayton, Ohio, making so little he said he sometimes had to choose between paying rent and buying food.
But in 2018, his CareSource Medicaid health plan offered him help getting a job. It connected him to a life coach, who helped him find full-time work with health benefits. Now, he works for a nonprofit social service agency, a job he said has given him enough financial stability to plan a European vacation next year.
“I feel like a real person and I can go do things,” said Wunderlin, 42. “I feel like I pulled myself out of that slump.”

And for Republicans pushing to require Medicaid enrollees to work, Wunderlin’s story could be held up as evidence that government health coverage can help people find employment and, ultimately, reduce their need for public assistance.
Yet his experience is rare. Medicaid typically does not offer such help, and when states do try to help, such efforts are limited.
And opponents point out that most Medicaid recipients already have jobs and say such a mandate would only kick eligible people off Medicaid, rather than improve their economic prospects. Nearly two-thirds of Medicaid enrollees work, with most of the rest acting as caregivers, going to school, or unable to hold a job due to disability or illness, according to KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.
Existing efforts to help Medicaid recipients get a job have seen limited success because there’s not a lot of “room to move the needle,” said Ben Sommers, a professor of health care economics at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Most Medicaid enrollees already work — just not in jobs with health benefits, he said.
“The ongoing argument that some folks make is that there are a lot of people freeloading in Medicaid,” he said. “That’s just not supported by the evidence.”
Using Health Programs To Encourage Work
The GOP-controlled Congress could allow or require states to implement a Medicaid work requirement as part of revamping and downsizing Medicaid. The first Trump administration encouraged those work mandates, but many were struck down by federal judges who said they were illegal under federal law.
Policy experts and state officials say more attention should be paid to investments that have helped people find better jobs — from personalized life coaching to, in some cases, health plans’ directly hiring enrollees.
They argue work requirements alone are not enough. “The move to economic mobility requires a ladder, not a stick,” said Farah Khan, a fellow with the Brookings Institution, a nonpartisan think tank.
While Medicaid work requirements have been debated for decades, the issue has become more heated as 40 states and Washington, D.C., have expanded Medicaid eligibility under the Affordable Care Act to the vast majority of low-income adults. More than 20 million adults have gained coverage as a result — but Republicans are now considering eliminating the billions in extra federal funding that helped states extend eligibility beyond groups including many children, pregnant women, and disabled people.
Only Georgia and Arkansas have implemented mandates that some Medicaid enrollees work, volunteer, go to school, or enroll in job training. But a study Sommers co-authored showed no evidence work requirements in Arkansas’ program led to more people working, in part because most of those who could work already were.
In Arkansas, more than 18,000 people lost coverage under the state’s requirement before the policy was suspended by a federal judge in 2019 after less than a year. Those who lost their Medicaid health care reported being unaware or confused about how to report work hours. Since 2023, Arkansas has been giving Medicaid health plans financial incentives to help enrollees train for jobs, but so far few have taken advantage.
Some plans, including Arkansas Blue Cross and Blue Shield’s, offer members $25 to $65 to complete a “career readiness” certificate. In 2024, some Arkansas health plans offered enrollees educational videos about topics including taxes and cryptocurrency.
Health plans don’t have an incentive to help someone find a better-paying job, because that could mean losing a customer if they then make too much to qualify for Medicaid, said Karin VanZant, a vice president at Clearlink Partners, a health care consulting company.
Rather than offering incentives for providing job training, some states, such as California and Ohio, require the insurance companies that run Medicaid to help enrollees find work.
In Montana, where some lawmakers are pushing to implement work requirements, a promising optional program nearly collapsed after state lawmakers required it be outsourced to private contractors.
Within the program’s first three years, the state paired 32,000 Medicaid enrollees with existing federally funded job training programs. Most had higher wages a year after starting training, the state found.
But enrollment has plummeted to just 11 people, according to the latest data provided by the state’s labor department.
Sarah Swanson, who heads the department, said several of the nonprofit contractors that ran the program shuttered. “There was no real part in this for us to deliver direct services to the folks that walked through our door,” she said. The state hopes to revive job training by allowing the department to work alongside contractors to reach more people.
The Hunt for Results
State officials say they don’t have much data to track the effectiveness of existing job programs offered by Medicaid plans.
Stephanie O’Grady, a spokesperson for the Ohio Department of Medicaid, said the state does not track outcomes because “the health plans are not employment agencies.”
Officials with CareSource, which operates Medicaid plans in multiple states, say it has about 2,300 Medicaid and ACA marketplace enrollees in its JobConnect program — about 1,400 in Ohio, 500 in Georgia, and 400 in Indiana.
The program connects job seekers with a life coach who counsels them on skills such as “showing up on time, dressing the part for interviews, and selling yourself during the interview,” said Jesse Reed, CareSource’s director of life services in Ohio.
 
Since 2023, about 800 people have found jobs through the program, according to Josh Boynton, a senior vice president at CareSource. The health plan itself has hired 29 Medicaid enrollees into customer service, pharmacy, and other positions — nearly all full-time with benefits, he said.
In 2022, California started offering nontraditional health benefits through Medicaid — including help finding jobs — for enrollees experiencing homelessness or serious mental illness, or who are otherwise at risk of avoidable emergency room care. As of September, it had served nearly 280,000 enrollees, but the state doesn’t have data on how many became employed.
The University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, which is among the largest private employers in Pennsylvania, running both a sprawling hospital system and a Medicaid plan, has hired over 10,000 of its Medicaid enrollees since 2021 through its training and support services. Among other jobs, they took positions as warehouse workers, customer service representatives, and medical assistants.
The vast majority left low-paying jobs for full-time positions with health benefits, said Dan LaVallee, a senior director of UPMC Health Plan’s Center for Social Impact. “Our Pathways to Work program is a model for the nation,” he said.
Josh Archambault, a senior fellow with the conservative Cicero Institute, said Medicaid should focus on improving the financial health of those enrolled.
While the first Trump administration approved Medicaid work requirements in 13 states, the Biden administration or federal judges blocked all except Georgia’s.
“I don’t think states have been given ample chance to experiment and try to figure out what works,” Archambault said.

This story was originally published by Canary Media.
Ohio consumer and environmental advocates are calling on state regulators to address disparities within FirstEnergy’s grid after a recent report found disadvantaged communities are more likely to rely on older, more outage-prone equipment.
Areas defined as disadvantaged under the Biden administration’s Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool were twice as likely to have low-voltage circuits compared to other parts of FirstEnergy’s Ohio territory, according to the study by the Interstate Renewable Energy Council. Equipment was also generally older and had less capacity for normal and overload situations.
The results reflect historical patterns of underinvestment in disadvantaged communities, the report says, but the full scope of the problem — including across Ohio’s other utilities — is unclear due to the lack of information from utilities and regulators.
“The public availability of any utility data is very, very limited in Ohio,” said report author Shay Banton, a regulatory program engineer and energy justice policy advocate for the Interstate Renewable Energy Council.
The Ohio Environmental Council submitted the report as part of FirstEnergy’s pending rate case before the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio and is asking regulators to address the topic in an evidentiary hearing set for May 5.
Ohio corruption scandal looms over FirstEnergy rate case

The state of the local grid matters when it comes to the reliability of customers’ electric service, their ability to add distributed renewable energy resources like rooftop solar, and a community’s potential to attract business investments that could improve its economic conditions.
Regulated electric utilities file reliability reports each spring that focus on two commonly used metrics. The system average interruption frequency index, or SAIFI, shows how many outages occurred per customer. The customer average interruption duration index, or CAIDI, measures the average length of time for restoring service to customers who lose power.
The annual reports also list factors involved in outages, with breakouts for transmission-related service problems and major events. Major events such as severe weather are considered statistical outliers that don’t count for calculating whether utilities meet their company-specific standards for CAIDI and SAIFI.
While weather accounted for the majority of time Ohioans went without power last year, equipment failures also triggered thousands of outages. For the ninth year in a row, at least one Ohio utility company failed to meet reliability standards, reports filed this month show. Both AEP Ohio and FirstEnergy’s Toledo Edison missed their marks for the average time before power is restored for customers who experience outages.
The Public Utilities Commission of Ohio also collects data on the worst-performing circuits. Individual circuits serve anywhere from a few hundred to several thousand customers. However, the state doesn’t post these reports online or disclose the circuit’s exact locations, which could be used to show whether they are concentrated in disadvantaged communities.
The SAIFI and CAIDI metrics used by state regulators did not show significant disparities between disadvantaged neighborhoods and other areas in FirstEnergy’s territory. But Banton said those reliability metrics rely on averages for large groups, which can obscure disparities. They said that utilities should also be required to publicly report the number of customers experiencing frequent service interruptions and the number of customers who faced long outages.
Utilities in Ohio tend to be reactive in dealing with circuit problems, Banton said. Communities can face longer outages if utilities wait for equipment to fail before replacing it. Instead, Banton wants utilities’ capital investments to address current disparities and then prevent them from recurring in the future.
“The bottom line is that consumers should get reliable service, and utilities are obligated to provide reliable service,” said Merrilee Embs, a spokesperson for the Office of the Ohio Consumers’ Counsel, which did not work on the report. The group is concerned about whether utilities’ capital improvement spending directly benefits customers — an issue that relates to grid disparities.
“FirstEnergy’s (and other Ohio utilities’) failure to implement grid modernization plans in a way that benefits residential consumers likely contributes to grid disparities such as those described in the [study],” Embs wrote via email after reviewing the report.
FirstEnergy has challenged the Ohio Environmental Council’s objections about grid disparities in its rate case. Meanwhile, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio is due to consider revisions to the annual reliability reporting requirements by Sept. 30, 2026. The commission will likely start accepting comments on the rules later this year, said spokesperson Matt Schilling.

 How the local grid impacts clean energy and economic development

The quality of a neighborhood’s grid influences more than whether residents’ lights stay on.
“These inequities can have serious consequences for customer access to distributed energy resources, which can save money,” said Karin Nordstrom, a lawyer for the Ohio Environmental Council.
Rooftop solar or other distributed clean energy can add to traffic on local grid circuits, posing a challenge for equipment that’s older or has lower voltages or capacity. Those circuits generally can handle less grid traffic, Banton said. In contrast, newer, high-voltage circuits tend to have ​“less bumps and less potholes [along with] better on-ramps.”
The grid’s quality and capacity also impact an area’s economic development. Historically, utilities have focused capital investment on places where people are moving or where they expect new industrial demand. That approach exacerbates inequity, Banton said. Even if businesses otherwise wanted to move to disadvantaged areas, poor electrical infrastructure may lead them to go elsewhere to avoid huge costs for upgrading the local grid, they said.
“The energy transition is in full effect, but many of the communities that suffer first and worst from climate change are not able to make the transition due to underinvestment in infrastructure,” said Tony Reames, a professor of environmental justice at the University of Michigan School for Environment and Sustainability, who did not work on the new report. He served at the U.S. Department of Energy as deputy director for energy justice and principal deputy director for state and community energy programs during the Biden administration.
Because utilities have failed to invest in and maintain the grid evenly throughout their service territories, an equity-based approach to infrastructure modernization should make sure resources now go to areas that were left behind, Reames said.
He supports the report’s call for more granular data, including details on customers with repeated or prolonged outages. The report also calls on utilities to publish maps showing grid capacity, and information about which census tracts are served by each circuit and substation transformers.
“I often say, ​‘The data you don’t have is the problem you don’t see,’” Reames noted. ​“Difficulties accessing data or the lack of certain data availability are sometimes a result of entities not wanting to confirm issues that are anecdotally known.”

On YouTube, I found a video covering the shooting with three times as many views as any other reporting. As of Friday, the video has 128,000 views. 
The 13-minute video, titled “Murder of Kansas Priest Shows Growing Threat to Churches: Why Kansas Churches Should be on Alert” was posted on the Christian Warrior channel on YouTube. 
The channel, created and hosted by former police officer Keith Graves, has more than 180 other videos. While some videos describe recommended training for church security teams, others focus on recent violence at churches across America.
“Gunshot Victim Hides in Church During Gathering”
“Church Security Volunteer Dies Shielding Kids from Gunfire”
“How to Protect Your Church From Imminent Terror Attacks”
The channel’s description reads, “If you love Jesus and you love guns, you’re in the right place. The Christian Warrior is focused on giving you the knowledge and skills to protect your church. We do this by giving you shooting drills, qualification standards and training ideas.”
As I prepared to interview Graves this week, I reflected on how these words create vertigo when set next to my life in Christian churches. Warrior? Guns? Shooting Drills? Training? I wondered whether Graves’s reaction was another sprouting of aggressive American gun culture. 
I braced for him to lecture me on right-wing conspiracy theories and the virtues of concealed carry.
The conversation was something else entirely.
*
My childhood was spent in the white-walled sanctuaries of Presbyterian churches in Pennsylvania and suburban Chicago. My sister and mom in matching seersucker dresses with ruffles. My mustached dad in a suit with a starched white button-down collar. The gentle melody of an Easter hymn wafting out the windows on a spring Sunday morning.
In the dark-wood pews of those churches, my biggest worries were whether I was singing in tune and whether I could keep from fidgeting during the epic sermon.    
With that experience in my rearview mirror, I felt a clash of worldviews with Graves’s security stance in his Seneca video and elsewhere on his channel. 
“Churches have to remain spiritually grounded while also elevating their tactical awareness,” Graves says near the end of the Seneca video. 
He advises parishioners to find a local police officer, an ally on the inside who will give the honest truth about what is happening in town. The implication? There might be something dangerous hidden from your church. 
Coupled with the imagery of guns on almost every YouTube preview, the alarm that I sensed as coming from Graves is foreign to my Sundays at church.
His warnings about church security in Kansas were also disturbing.  
“There is a lot of crime against Catholic churches in Kansas specifically over the past month,” Graves said. “And if you are in the Kansas area, you need to know about it. This is what my contacts are telling me.” 
He described recent vandalism at a Catholic church in Wichita and the protest at the Kansas statehouse by satanists, which led to arrests. 
In the video, Graves continued: “Officers in the area are watching these patterns carefully. It’s possible that this recent murder is connected to the escalating anti-Christian trends. But we don’t have a motive confirmed yet.” 
Should we be as concerned as Graves, I wondered, or is this a moral panic fueled by his reaction to headlines about church violence? After all, every kind of apocalyptic news travels easily into our social media feeds.
*
Graves started his Christian Warrior YouTube channel after he retired after years of law enforcement work in Oakland and Berkeley, California. 
“I could not do any of this until I retired,” Graces told me in our interview. Because cops don’t have a First Amendment right. We can’t speak publicly about anything.”
Since then, his videos (with 139,000 YouTube subscribers) and weekly newsletter (with 40,000 subscribers, he said) have documented church violence, along with security tips to prevent it. Alerts to his inbox arrive each morning after crawling the web for keywords like “Church shooting” or “Church stabbing.”  
“Obviously, the violent things that happen at churches are the ones that get views,” Graves said. “And I hate that. I absolutely hate it.”
Since starting the channel, Graves said he has mostly moved away from his previous consulting as a speaker on narcotics law enforcement. Now, from his home in Idaho, he records himself, microphone in the foreground and framed firearms in the background. 
He uses a social media forum, with 50,000 certified law enforcement officials in it, to research the latest church crimes. He would not share the social media platform during our interview. 
“I will pray before I do every video,” Graves said. “And pray that I say the right things, because I don’t want to cause panic, right? 
Graves sees the world as a precarious place for Christians in 2025 — the most dangerous atmosphere for Christians in modern American history. 
“I do think that there is a cultural movement to have some hate against Christians. Then you look at the Christian faith, you see less and less people coming to church over the last couple decades for sure.”
Graves said that he monitors terrorist chats online, and that he’s “never seen them be so fervent about their hate towards Christians when you look at the jihadi side.” 
He compares the level of threat to America before the attacks of September 11, 2001, and worries about attacks coordinated by ISIS and Al-Queda.  
Graves connects the hostility that he sees toward police officers and Christians. 
“Being a police officer, I know there are people that dislike me so much they would love to kill me,” Graves said. “But there are people that hate Christians and Jews so much that they would like to see you dead. And I don’t think people have ever thought about that before, because they just lived a fortunate life.”
The dire tone is hard to square in some ways with the cultural and political power that Christians hold in America. Graves sees the atmosphere as nonetheless threatening.
I told Graves how including “warrior” sounds a lot like vigilantism to me. I explained my worry of Christian militias seeking justice in the name of church security, armed with guns and tactical vests. 
“You’re trying to make the name ‘warrior’ this bad name,” Graves said. “People have been using (the word) ‘sheepdog’ forever in the church security field. And I’m like, I’m not a sheepdog. I’m a warrior. I’m here to protect my people. I’m here to keep evil away from them. And warrior isn’t a bad name. I’m a Christian, I’m a warrior, and I’m here to protect the people that are within the church. Does that mean I’m going to go on the offense and start hurting people? Absolutely not.”
“True vigilantism, taking the law into your own hands, we all know it’s wrong, right?” he continued. “It’s biblically wrong. It’s criminally wrong. There’s everything wrong about it. I don’t know why anybody would want to go that route to begin with. It firmly goes against scripture.” 
*
Halfway through the interview, Graves and I circled back to my central question: Is his YouTube channel addressing a substantial threat to religious people in America or is it overreacting to shocking headlines?
“Here’s the problem, if you don’t report (on church violence), then people continue thinking that there’s not going to be a problem,” he said, adding: “You just have to look at what’s happening and realize that it’s a possibility. You just have to realize it’s minimal. It’s just not zero.”
It took me that long to remember that my family is proof that the threat is not zero. 
Eleven years and one week ago, my wife and two children were barricaded in a bathroom at the Jewish Community Center of Greater Kansas City. My 9-year-old daughter and 5-year-old son were still wet from their swimming lessons with friends. 
Staff from the community center ordered them into the women’s locker room. The lockdown kept them there for more than an hour. Outside, an anti-semetic gunman killed a grandfather and his grandson in the parking lot of the facility before killing another woman at a nearby retirement community.
What if the Christian Warrior channel had existed in 2014? Would it have helped to have Graves’s review of the shooting and the law enforcement response?
I’ve thought about that all day — whether these Christian Warrior videos scoot us closer to being a more secure land of churches with well-trained security teams. Or whether they turn up the flame of panic and militarism under an already boiling pot.

The Trump administration has recently revoked the visas of more than 1,300 foreign college students  – detaining some – and launched immigration enforcement actions on college campuses across the country. This has raised concerns among the more than 1.1 million international students studying at U.S. universities.
Headlines are filled with perspectives from immigration and civil rights experts, but one aspect of the story often goes overlooked: the tremendous economic impact international students have on local communities.
Although the actual impact on enrollment won’t be known until the next academic year, interest from foreign students in pursuing graduate-level education in the U.S. fell sharply in the early days of the Trump administration, one analysis showed.
If these global scholars stay home, that’s bad economic news for cities and towns across the United States.
 A $44 billion economic impact

Higher education is America’s 10th-largest export, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. (Yes, even though students are coming into the U.S. for their education, economists consider it an export.)
Last year, U.S. colleges and universities attracted international students from 217 nations and territories, including one student from the island nation of Niue in the South Pacific. Their economic contributions added up to more than the value of U.S. telecommunications, computer and information services exports combined.
While the national impact is impressive, the effects at the local level are even more important. After all, nearly every city across the U.S. has at least one institution of higher learning.
The average international student brings a wallet stuffed with about $29,000 to spend on everything from tuition to pizza. As these students rent apartments, buy books and order DoorDash delivery to fuel all-nighters, they’re pumping money into the local community.
This money translates into American jobs. On average, a new job is created for every four international students enrolled in a U.S. college or university. In the 2023-24 academic year, about 378,175 jobs were created. And that’s just counting jobs that are directly supported by international students, such as local business hiring to staff retail shops and restaurants. If you count those jobs indirectly supported by international students, such as employees at a distribution center, the number is even higher.
 A boon to local economies

In any of the 50 largest American cities, you’ll find at least one college or university with international students on campus. For these communities, global learners bring a most welcome financial aid package.
Consider Boston. Greater Boston hosts more than 50 colleges and universities, including Boston University, where I teach multinational finance and trade. The city’s economic gains from the more than 63,000 international students attending these schools are huge: about $3 billion.
Prestigious private schools are a draw, but hands down the biggest pull for international students are state universities and colleges. Of the nation’s top schools enrolling these students last year, 29 were state colleges and universities, attracting over 251,300 students.
In the top three of those public institutions alone − Arizona State University, the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and the University of California, Berkeley − international students contributed nearly $1.7 billion, supporting over 16,800 jobs. Expand that to the top 10 − the University of California system takes four of those spots − and the numbers pop up to $4.68 billion and 47,136 jobs.
 Bringing the world to Mankato

Yet international students aren’t just boosting the economies of major university towns. Consider Mankato, a small city of 45,000 about 80 miles from Minneapolis that hosts a Minnesota State University campus. In the 2023-24 academic year, about 1,716 international students called Mankato their home away from home.
Those students brought an infusion of $45.9 million into that community, supporting around 190 jobs. There are dozens of similar campuses in cities and towns like Mankato across the country. It adds up quickly.
!function(){“use strict”;window.addEventListener(“message”,(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[“datawrapper-height”]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(“iframe”);for(var t in a.data[“datawrapper-height”])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data[""datawrapper-height""][t]+""px"";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
In addition to private and public universities, community colleges attract thousands of global scholars. Although their international enrollment declined during Covid-19, community colleges are resurgent, attracting some 59,315 international students in 2024, with China, Vietnam and Nepal leading the countries-of-origin list.
Generating about $2 billion and supporting 8,472 jobs, they have a major economic impact − particularly in Texas, California and Florida, where the majority of these students come to learn.
Texas leads the nation with the three community colleges with the largest international enrollment: Houston Community College, Lone Star College and Dallas College. Of the $256.7 million and 1,096 jobs international students brought into those institutions, Lone Star led the pack with $102.3 million and 438 jobs, nearly one job created for every two international students − double the national average.
Due to changing demographics, American colleges enroll 2.3 million fewer domestic students than they did a decade ago − a decline of 10.7%. Colleges and universities are increasingly looking to international students to fill the gap. What’s more, universities tend to see international students as subsidizing domestic students, particularly since international students are generally ineligible for need-blind admissions.
Moreover, the vast majority of international students are funded by family or foreign sponsors. Few require student aid packages. In fact, less than 20% of all international students receive grant funding from a federal source, and most of that goes to postgraduates doing advanced research. If you look at undergraduate exchange students alone, just 0.1% receive any sort of public funding.
One thing’s for sure: Whether they’re attending small-town community colleges or the Ivies in big cities, international students bring a “high degree” of economic impact with them.

As Republicans in Congress consider cutting the federal share of Medicaid funding, states are weighing numerous options to scale back their programs. But voters in three states have significantly limited those options by enshrining Medicaid expansion in their constitutions — creating a potential budget disaster and a political challenge for the GOP.
Over the past several years, voters in conservative Missouri, Oklahoma and South Dakota have amended their state constitutions to require their Medicaid programs to cover all adults below the age of 65 who earn equal to or less than 138% of the federal poverty level ($21,597 for an individual in 2025). Those states are among the 40 plus the District of Columbia that expanded Medicaid eligibility under the 2010 Affordable Care Act, with the federal government picking up 90% of the cost.
But much of that federal funding could soon vanish. Republicans in Congress are debating several options to achieve $880 billion in Medicaid cuts. One proposal would slash the 90% rate to the lower match rates states get for the traditional Medicaid population, mainly children and their caregivers, people with disabilities and pregnant women. Those percentages range from 50% for the wealthiest states to 77% for the poorest ones.
If Congress goes that route, states would have to come up with $626 billion over the next decade to keep the roughly 20 million people in the expansion population on the rolls.
Nine states (Arizona, Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Montana, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Utah and Virginia) already have laws on the books that would automatically roll back Medicaid expansion if the federal funds dip. Some states are considering requiring people to work, go to school or volunteer in order to receive Medicaid benefits, a condition that would trim the rolls and save money.
But because Missouri, Oklahoma and South Dakota have put Medicaid expansion in their constitutions, they can’t easily take those steps.
Republicans in Congress are eyeing cuts to Medicaid. But what does Medicaid actually do?

“Legislators cannot change that law without going back to voters for a whole other campaign to change the constitution,” said Kelly Hall, the executive director of the Fairness Project, a nonprofit that helped put the constitutional amendments on the ballot in all three states.
“Even if the federal government cuts their contribution towards funding Medicaid expansion, those three states do not have the option to reduce eligibility or benefits for the Medicaid expansion population,” she told Stateline. “They will have to find those resources.”
Medicaid is a huge component of state budgets. Including the federal matching money, states spend an average of nearly a third of their budgets on Medicaid. And the program is also the single largest source of federal funds for states.
Missourians voted in favor of a constitutional amendment to expand Medicaid in August 2020. When state lawmakers refused to fund the expansion, residents sued the state’s Department of Social Services. In 2021, the state Supreme Court ruled that the legislature had to find the resources for Medicaid expansion — a huge win for progressives.
For 2025, Missouri allotted $18.2 billion for Medicaid, with the federal government covering $12.7 billion of that, or about 70%. If Congress cuts the federal share of Medicaid funding by $880 billion over the next decade, it would leave Missouri with a budget hole of around $1.7 billion next year, according to research from nonprofit group the Commonwealth Fund. That would force the state to come up with some options to avoid fiscal disaster.
Timothy McBride, a health policy analyst and co-director of a program at the Institute for Public Health at Washington University in St. Louis, told Stateline that these include raising taxes, cutting enrollment for other Medicaid populations, diminishing reimbursements to providers, getting rid of optional medical services such as dental care or ceasing payments for equipment like wheelchairs.
A fifth of Americans are on Medicaid. Some of them have no idea.

Raising taxes is not a likely or popular choice in Republican-leaning Missouri, McBride noted, while adding that cuts to providers would further endanger struggling hospitals.
“We lost 10 hospitals in Missouri in the last few years. And if you start cutting their payment rates, that’s going to just put them at risk,” McBride said. “The real money is in the disabled and the elderly populations. And so if you really wanted to quote-unquote save money, that’s probably where you’d have to look. But that’s really controversial.”
The state budgetary implications of a potentially sharp decline in federal Medicaid funding have influenced some prominent opponents of Medicaid expansion to have a change of heart. U.S. Republican Sen. Josh Hawley supported efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act in 2018 when he was Missouri’s attorney general. Now, Hawley has said he would refuse to vote for any Medicaid cuts.
“I’m not going to vote for Medicaid cuts, benefit cuts. Work requirements are fine. But 21% of the residents in my state receive Medicaid or [the Children’s Health Insurance Program]. That’s a lot of people,” he told reporters on Capitol Hill in February.
Republicans in the closely divided U.S. Congress might have trouble pushing through Medicaid cuts if other conservative lawmakers from Missouri, Oklahoma and South Dakota follow Hawley’s lead.
Oklahoma voters expanded Medicaid via a constitutional amendment in 2020. South Dakota followed suit in 2022. Republicans in all three states want to impose work requirements on able-bodied Medicaid recipients, but doing so would not save enough money to make up for the loss of federal dollars.
South Dakota Republican state Rep. Will Mortenson said he respects that voters chose to expand Medicaid, and added that the state has “faithfully” implemented it. But the decision to amend the state constitution “can only be described as a foolish decision,” he said in an interview.










Now, as we're staring down the barrel of the federal government contemplating changes to Medicaid … our state is hamstrung.


– South Dakota Republican state Rep. Will Mortenson


“A constitution is not meant to be a flexible document that you change annually or even every other year,” Mortenson said. “And so now, as we’re staring down the barrel of the federal government contemplating changes to Medicaid, including for the expansion population, our state is hamstrung in that we cannot effectively respond to those changes.”
Mortenson is one of the lead sponsors of a bill that would ask voters to consider a ballot measure in the next general election to amend the constitution again, this time conditioning Medicaid expansion on the level of federal assistance. The measure has passed both chambers of the legislature.
But some of the supporters of the original constitutional amendment say they would fight any attempt to change it. Any restrictions, including work requirements, would severely harm working-class people, said Doug Sombke, head of the South Dakota Farmers Union. Sombke told Stateline that most farmers in the state struggle to make ends meet and certainly cannot offer high wages or health care benefits to their workers.
“There’s just no extra income,” Sombke said. “And, in South Dakota, we’re a right-to-work state, so you can get fired for any reason. As a worker, you really don’t have a lot of choice.”
Hall, of the Fairness Project, said amending the constitution is the most effective way to expand Medicaid in states where conservative-leaning lawmakers have been reluctant to do so. She said she suspects that voters in other states might pursue the constitutional amendment strategy if their state lawmakers try to roll back expansion.
“I do think that it’s possible that if we see these cuts move forward in D.C., and states are making highly unpopular choices to cut benefits for people, that we will see this issue back at the ballot box,” Hall said. “But for right now, I would say we’re seeing the power of constitutional amendments to protect benefits in action in real time.”

(Stock.adobe.com image by s_l)As many as 109,000 Marylanders could get thrown off Medicaid if Congress follows through on a proposal to impose a work requirement for the coverage, according to a new report.
The report from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation comes as some lawmakers are looking for ways to cut billions in federal spending in coming years. One proposal, to require that able-bodied adults work at least 2o hours a week to receive the benefits, would trim an estimated 7% of recipients — 109,000 people in Maryland, and about 5 million nationwide, the report estimates.
“That would be a significant amount of coverage lost,” said Katherine Hempstead, senior policy officer for Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. “And it would have really hard consequences for people who would lose their coverage.”
The study based its estimates on work requirement language in a 2023 bill, the Limit, Save, Grow Act, which would have required Medicaid recipients to work at least 80 hours a month unless they were exempt as a student, a family caregiver or because of a disability.
The report comes as House Republicans and the Trump administration l0ok to cut billions in federal spending over the next decade. The budget resolution recently adopted by the U.S. House of Representatives directs the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which oversees Medicaid, to cut $880 billion over 10 years.
Such reductions would likely require cuts to Medicaid, the joint federal-state health care plan for low-income residents – but exactly how those cuts would be implemented is yet to be decided. Work requirements is one of the options on the table, along with other measures to cut spending to Medicaid.
House Appropriations gets a crash course on potential Trump cuts to Medicaid

“There is this quest to find some budget cuts … Work requirements is one of the options that seems to gathering a little bit broader support than some of the others,” Hempstead said. She believes it’s important to know how work requirements could impact health care coverage, even if Congress decides not to add work requirements.
Proponents of work requirements say the policy would help move people into the workforce and help save taxpayer dollars.
The Foundation for Government Accountability, a conservative think-tank, said that work requirements “move millions of able-bodied adults from welfare to work,” in a post earlier this week.
“This, in turn, would save taxpayers billions of dollars, preserve resources for the truly needy, and put the Medicare and Social Security trust funds on more solid ground,” the foundation said.
House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) said in a February interview with CNN that the work requirements would not “cut benefits for people who rightly deserve” them.
“You don’t want able-bodied workers on a program that is intended, for example, for single mothers with two small children who is just trying to make it,” he said. “That’s what Medicaid is for – not for 29-year-old males sitting on their couches playing video games. We’re going to find those guys and were going to send them back to work.”
But opponents of work requirements say that those policies do not reflect the challenges of finding work and proving eligibility to federal officials in order to keep coverage through Medicaid.
The report focused on states that have opted to increase Medicaid coverage through the Affordable Care Act expansion, which allows participating states to provide coverage for households that earn up to 138% of the federal poverty level income. Maryland is one of the 40 expansion states.
The report estimates that some 5 million people who live in those states could lose health care coverage if Congress imposes a work requirement to qualify for Medicaid. That would equate to about 6.9% of all 72 million people on Medicaid across the United States.

For Maryland, a work requirement could result in between 95,000 to 109,000 people losing coverage out of 1.5 million currently enrolled in Medicaid, according to the report.
The state with the largest raw number of people who could lose coverage would be California, with between 1 million to 1.2 million people affected out of the total 14 million current Medicaid recipients in the state. On the other end, between 5,000 and 6,000 of North Dakota’s 104,000 Medicaid recipients could lose coverage due to work requirements, according to the RWJF estimates.
But Hempstead also fears that work requirements will ultimately kick people off Medicaid who may still qualify for it. She said that people can often get caught up in the bureaucratic paperwork, which can be taxing for people who rely on Medicaid, as people have to prove whether they have work, are looking for work, or have a reason why they can’t work.
“Even if you accept the idea that people should have to work to get their health insurance,” she said, “what happens with work requirements is a lot of people lose coverage that are working — or are caregiving or are doing other things — and shouldn’t lose their coverage.”
Meanwhile, Hempstead noted the those who lose coverage due to work requirements would strain hospital systems, as uninsured people seek health care through other means, such as the emergency room or through charity care. That could exacerbate Maryland’s lengthy emergency room wait times, which are already some of the highest in the nation.
“There is a lot of spill-over into the health care system. As the uninsurance rate goes up and people don’t have health insurance, they try to ignore things and try to not get care. And sometimes things go away on their own and sometimes they don’t,” she said. “When things are really, really bad, they’ll go to the emergency room, where people will know that they will get treated.”
Ferguson warns of ‘Maryland recession’ as report says state has greatest risk from federal cuts

Benjamin Orr, executive director for Maryland Center on Economic Policy, said that work requirements are counterproductive and will take health insurance away from people who need it, regardless of employment.
“Our society does better when its members are healthy,” Orr said “The idea that we’re going to deny health coverage to 100,000 Marylanders or more is counterproductive to a healthy prosperous society.”
Orr also added that with talks of a looming recession, people are going to have a hard time finding jobs to fulfill work requirements to maintain health coverage. He noted that Maryland “is particularly susceptible to” layoffs in the federal government and other major institutions impacted by decisions from the Trump administration.
“It’s not a good time to be looking for a job, as we are on the cusp of a state-level recession, if not a national recession,” Orr said. “Even folks who might, otherwise in a healthy economy, be well positioned to find work may struggle to find work.”
Hempstead agrees that the work requirement logic is “backwards.”
“When people are healthy, they can work more,” she said. “It’s kind of a bad theory that you ought to be able to work in order to earn access to health care.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/AdobeStock_167846258-1.jpeg,,,2025-04-18 03:03:08.027201

How much things have changed in the decade since depends on who is answering the question","A mural of Freddy Gray at the intersection of N. Mount and Presbury streets in Baltimore, where he was arrested 10 years ago. Spinal injuries during his arrest led to his death a week later, on April 19, 2015. (Photo by Mark Makela/Getty Images)Melvin T. Russell, the retired chief of the Baltimore Police Community Division, said he remembers the lack of empathy among police commanders in the wake of Freddie Gray’s death after an arrest 10 years ago.
That’s when he knew “our city was really in trouble.”
“I didn’t see any remorse, there was no real concern within the department,” Russell said. “The concern didn’t come until finally there were the protests on a level that I had not seen in all my years in law enforcement.”
Russell’s comments came during a recent symposium to mark the 10th anniversary of Gray’s death in police custody, an incident that sparked protests followed by days of unrest, criminal charges and a reckoning for the city and its police department.
How much things have changed in the intervening 10 years depends on who is answering the question.
Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott points to the statistics to buttress his argument that relations between the police and citizens have improved over the past decade.
“When you think about having 2.400-plus [civilian] complaints [in 2015] and now it’s down to 800, and 12 police-involved shootings now down to four,” Scott said.
“The clearance rate of homicides is also up, because people are talking to the police more,” he said, “but we still have a long way to go.”

Dayvon Love, director of public policy for the group Leaders of a Beautiful Struggle, agrees that some progress has been made in police reform, but also that there are still shortcomings.
“Police investigatory records are now accessible to the public, there’s a change in use-of-force standard, so there are a bunch of things that have shifted the levers that the community has access to, including the police accountability boards,” Love said. “But I think the culture of the police department has not changed.”
Marvin “Doc” Cheatham vividly remembers the Sunday morning 10 years ago,
April 12, 2015, when his friend Freddie Gray was arrested in West Baltimore after a foot chase with police officers.
“You could hear him scream, and you can tell the difference between someone acting and someone actually in pain. He was actually in pain,” said Cheatham, president of the Matthew Henson Community Development Corp.
Cheatham describes Gray as “a jovial guy, but you knew he was up to something mischievous. He ran through the neighborhood selling drugs but was not a major drug dealer.”
Gray, who was 25, had been arrested 15 times in prior years on a variety of charges. After his arrest, captured on cell phone video by a nearby resident, police recovered a small knife. They cuffed him and placed him in the back of a police vam, but did not secure him with a seat belt – for the purpose of giving him what was later described in court testimony as a “rough ride,” where police attempt to bang up those arrested as they are tossed around in the back of the vehicle.
When police later checked on Gray, he was lying unconscious and was then transported to the Shock Trauma Center at the University of Maryland Medical Center.
Gray died a week later, on April 19, 2015. The medical examiner ruled his death a homicide, apparently from a spinal cord injury suffered inside the police van.
On the day Gray died, Russell recalls confronting angry protesters outside the Western Police District, some screaming, “Tell us why you killed Freddie.”
“I represented the police department, and at that moment, I thought I better have some answers,” Russell said.

Gray’s death sparked countless protests throughout the city. Days later, those protests erupted in violence that went on for days throughout the city, but concentrated in West Baltimore.
On Monday, April 27, dozens of police officers were pelted with rocks thrown by young people near Mondawmin Mall. A CVS store was set on fire at the corner of Pennsylvania and W. North avenues. Hundreds of locally owned businesses also were heavily damaged or destroyed.
For several days, a citywide curfew was imposed during overnight hours. More than 100 police officers were injured.
Four days later, then-Baltimore City State’s Attorney Marilyn Mosby announced the indictments of six officers connected to Gray’s arrest, on a variety of charges. The announcement, televised live on Baltimore TV stations, was greeted with cheers and celebration by residents throughout the city.
“I think she [Mosby] saved our neighborhoods,” Cheatham said. “If she hadn’t had the police officers charged, you would have still had a neighborhood that was upset, and they probably would have done more damage.”
Ultimately, none of the six officers was convicted. A mistrial was declared in Officer William Porter’s case, and Officers Caesar Goodson Jr. and Edward Nero were acquitted of all charges.
In July, 2016, Mosby held a news conference in the West Baltimore neighborhood where Freddie Gray was arrested, and announced she was dropping all charges against three others: Lt. Brian Rice, Sgt. Alicia White and Officer Garrett Miller.
Eight years ago, U.S. District Judge James K. Bredar authorized a consent decree between the Justice Department and the Baltimore Police, which called for major reforms in the department.
Those changes include an overhaul in policies for transporting people in custody, including extensive training and upgrading vehicle equipment maintenance. Officers are now equipped with body cameras, and cameras have been installed in all police vans.

In a statement, Police Commissioner Richard Worley said, “The public has my full commitment that these changes reflect a true cultural shift within BPD, a fundamentally reformed agency that serves as a national model for reducing violent crime and upholding constitutional policing.”
But Baltimore Attorney William H. “Billy” Murphy Jr., who represents Gray’s family, says there is still a major problem with the department that impacts public safety.
“I’m very concerned that Baltimore does not have enough police officers,” Murphy said. “If he [Mayor Scott] has one problem with what’s going on, that’s it.”
A Baltimore Police spokesperson said there are currently about 500 vacancies for sworn officers and “the department has hired 70 new recruits since the start of 2025,” nearly double the number hired at this time last year.
In 2021, the General Assembly enacted legislation that transferred control of the Baltimore Police Department from the state to the city. Murphy said he hopes the change will let the mayor will take an active role to implement major changes in the department by removing corrupt officers to enhance public confidence.

Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) was finally able to meet Thursday night with Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, the Beltsville resident who was erroneously deported last month to his native El Salvador, where he has been held incommunicado in that country’s megaprison for terrorists.
The meeting followed two days of attempts by Van Hollen to see Abrego Garcia, including an attempt earlier Thursday when soldiers turned away him and Chris Newman — the lawyer for Abrego Garcia’s wife and his mother — at a checkpoint about 3 kilometers away from the Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo, or CECOT, where Abrego Garcia is being held.
Van Hollen said that while the soldiers allowed other cars to pass, they said they had “been ordered not to allow us to proceed any further than that point.”
It is unclear what led to the the change in policy, but Van Hollen posted a photo on social media after 9 p.m. Thursday of him talking with Abrego Garcia.
“I said my main goal of this trip was to meet with Kilmar. Tonight I had that chance,” Van Hollen said in his post. “I have called his wife, Jennifer, to pass along his message of love. I look forward to providing a full update upon my return.”
Abrego Garcia, seen in the photos in jeans, a checkered shirt and a Kansas City Chiefs ballcap, appears healthy. It was a different look than the shaved heads, baggy white shorts and T-shirts and Crocs or sandals that CECOT inmates are wearing in most photos of the facility.

Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele, who insisted during a White House meeting Monday with President Donald Trump that his country had no intention of releasing Abrego Garcia, trolled Van Hollen with his own social media posts of the meeting shortly before the senator’s Thursday. Bukele mockingly referred to Abrego Garcia “miraculously risen from the ‘death camps’ & ‘torture,’ now sipping margaritas with Sen. Van Hollen in the tropical paradise of El Salvador.”
“Now that he’s been confirmed healthy, he gets the honor of staying in El Salvador’s custody,” Bukele posted.
Van Hollen unsuccessfully sought a meeting when Bukele was in Washington, and again when he traveled to El Salvador Wednesday. He was able to meet instead with Salvadoran Vice President Félix Ulloa, who denied his requests Wednesday to either visit or speak on the phone with Abrego Garcia.
The Maryland Democrat arrived in the Central American country Wednesday in an effort to help bring Abrego Garcia, whom the Justice Department admitted in court was deported in error, back to the United States, or at least check on his wellness.
A U.S. immigration judge issued a protective order in 2019 allowing Abrego Garcia, an undocumented immigrant in the U,S., to daus here because sending him back to his home country would put him in grave danger from gangs there that he said caused him to flee in the first place.
Van Hollen said that since Abrego Garcia was sent to CECOT, he had not spoken with anyone outside of the prison walls until their meeting Thursday. “This inability to communicate with his lawyers is a violation of international law,” Van Hollen had said earlier Thursday.
The senator pointed out that El Salvador is a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
“That covenant says, and I quote, ‘A detained or imprisoned person shall be entitled to communicate and consult with his legal counsel,’” he said.
Van Hollen also said he met with the U.S. Embassy in El Salvador and they discussed “the full range of important bilateral relations between the United States and El Salvador.”
White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt and other Republicans have criticized Van Hollen for making the trip, repeating the accusation that Abrego Garcia is a gang member.
Representatives for the White House and DHS did not respond to messages seeking comment Thursday.
Appeals court slams administration’s inaction
Meanwhile, Abrego Garcia’s case continues to work its way through U.S. courts as a flashpoint conflict between two branches of government that has led to the precipice of a constitutional crisis.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
On Thursday, a federal appeals court panel dismantled the administration’s latest appeal, saying the government had done “essentially nothing” to attempt to return Abrego Garcia in compliance with last week’s Supreme Court order.
A three-judge panel for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit said the executive branch was due deference in conducting foreign policy, but that the administration’s inaction in seeking Abrego Garcia’s return amounted to defiance of a judicial order.
The unanimous ruling was written by 4th Circuit Chief Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III, who was nominated by Republican President Ronald Reagan. The other two judges, Robert Bruce King and Stephanie Thacker, were nominated by Democratic presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama.
“The government is asserting a right to stash away residents of this country in foreign prisons without the semblance of due process that is the foundation of our constitutional order. Further, it claims in essence that because it has rid itself of custody that there is nothing that can be done,” the panel wrote. “This should be shocking not only to judges, but to the intuitive sense of liberty that Americans far removed from courthouses still hold dear.”
The appeals ruling responded to the government’s appeal of U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis’ order this week for the Trump administration to offer evidence on how it has sought to help with Abrego Garcia’s release from CECOT.
The U.S. Supreme Court ruled last week that the Trump administration must “facilitate” — but stopped short of requiring — his return to the United States.
In unusually frank language, the 4th Circuit panel warned Thursday the conflict between the executive and judicial branches threatened the foundation of U.S. government.
“If today the Executive claims the right to deport without due process and in disregard of court orders, what assurance will there be tomorrow that it will not deport American citizens and then disclaim responsibility to bring them home?” the court asked. “And what assurance shall there be that the Executive will not train its broad discretionary powers upon its political enemies? The threat, even if not the actuality, would always be present.”
Near the end of the order, the panel urged the administration to obey the judicial branch.
“We yet cling to the hope that it is not naïve to believe our good brethren in the Executive Branch perceive the rule of law as vital to the American ethos,” the judges wrote. “This case presents their unique chance to vindicate that value and to summon the best that is within us while there is still time.”
Neither country taking action
The 4th Circuit panel pointed out that the leaders of both the United States and El Salvador claimed they had no power to return Abrego Garcia.
“We are told that neither government has the power to act,” they wrote. “The result will be to leave matters generally and Abrego Garcia specifically in an interminable limbo without recourse to law of any sort.”
During a White House visit this week, El Salvador President Nayib Bukele said he would not bring Abrego Garcia back to the United States.
The Trump administration has admitted in court that Abrego Garcia’s deportation stemmed from an “administrative error.” The administration continues to accuse him of being part of the gang MS-13, despite no charges or convictions of any criminal offenses against him, including gang-related crimes.

That’s not a culture war —it’s a takeover.","Harvard University —long a symbol of academic independence— now faces a defining test in refusing President Donald Trump’s demands for federal intrusion into academia. Vulnerable Connecticut colleges and universities include Yale, Wesleyan, the University of Connecticut and its health center-medical school with Jackson Laboratories. 
Who’s next? Trump may be just getting started.
President Trump and his allies, under the guise of fighting antisemitism, are advancing a broader campaign for political and ideological control over higher education.
If Harvard had surrendered to growing demands from President Donald Trump and his allies —demands cloaked in concern about antisemitism, but driven by broader ambitions of political control— the university risked more than just its reputation.
Standing up to fight, it may lose up to $9 billion in research and other funding, with $2.2 billion in multi-year grants and $60 million in contracts already halted for refusing to play ball with Trump.
These institutions aren’t apprentices in the education market—but Trump’s plan is to bully and humiliate them into submission, just like on his caustic reality TV show by the same name.
The problem? He’s not playing with TV contestants this time. He’s playing with millions of students’ futures—students who need serious, grounded education to survive in today’s volatile economy.
Further, Harvard refused to risk compromising the very idea of what a university should be. Columbia University should have stood up earlier rather than set a tone for sacrificing integrity and academic freedom by conceding to demands when threatened with a $400 million loss.
Princeton, Stanford and Yale are among the growing list of universities standing with Harvard now.
Today, it’s research grants. Tomorrow, it could be federal financial aid —jeopardizing access for students whose futures depend on it. The administration’s tactic is clear: Use funding as leverage to force ideological compliance.
If Trump, the founder of the failed Trump University, succeeds in repurposing real universities and colleges to serve political ends, the light of free inquiry dims. That’s not a culture war—it’s a takeover.
As a Harvard Kennedy School graduate approaching my 40th reunion, I reflect on what we learned: to think critically, argue thoughtfully, and grow through discomfort. We weren’t told what to believe—we were taught how to reason.
That education wasn’t just academic —it was also moral. It prepared us to serve the public interest with clarity, conscience, and courage. In a noisy world, we were taught to anchor ourselves to facts, reason and empathy.
That approach remains vital today—not just at Harvard, but nationwide. As a professor for nearly 40 years at the University of Hartford and over a decade at Manchester (CT) Community College, I know what’s at stake.
And I believe Harvard is right to tell the government: This line we do not cross.
Here’s why:
Repel political pressure. By surrendering to political pressure, universities risk losing the very essence of what makes them vital to democracy: independence of thought.
Across the country, and now with Harvard in the spotlight, higher education is being tested. If universities begin removing leaders, rewriting policy, or silencing dissent in response to political outrage —particularly from figures like Donald Trump— they aren’t reforming. They’re yielding. Governance should rest with faculty senates, trustees, and shared academic principles—not with any political rally, social media campaign, or Oval Office demand.
Wrenching weaponization. One especially troubling tactic is the broad weaponization of antisemitism allegations. Antisemitism must be called out, always. But branding all criticism of Israel or support for Palestinian rights as antisemitic forces institutions into a false choice between integrity and appeasement. The result? Dissenting voices—especially those of students and faculty—go quiet, not because they’re wrong, but because they’re risky.
Contagious chilling effect. Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) programs—already under political attack—are essential to opening access and deepening learning. Gutting them to avoid headlines sends a dangerous message: that inclusion and equity are optional, expendable under pressure. And when research must stay inside “safe” ideological lines, academic inquiry narrows. Big questions go unasked. Truth is buried—not because it’s false, but because it’s inconvenient.
Disappearing donors. The influence of major donors, many of whom are now responding to specific political concerns such as pro-Palestinian protest, has only compounded the problem. Institutions that allow funding to dictate principle trade their mission for money. Academic freedom can’t survive in an environment where every dollar comes with a litmus test.
This is not just a Harvard issue. It’s not even just a Trump issue. It’s everyone’s issue who values education.
It’s a warning about precedent. What happens at one elite institution shapes many others, whether private or public, small or large. Today, the targets are Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, and Middle East discourse. Tomorrow, it could be climate science, abortion, or how U.S. history is taught.
Higher education doesn’t exist to echo power. It exists to question it. If we care about the survival of free inquiry and democratic thought, the line must be held—right now.
It is worth the time for anyone caring about education’s promise, and every university and college administrator, professor, staff member and student to read Harvard’s response for protecting the line.
“We have informed the administration through our legal counsel that we will not accept their proposed agreement. The University will not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights,” Harvard President Alan M. Garber wrote in announcing the decision to fight back.
The administration’s actions overstep federal authority, violating Harvard’s First Amendment rights and exceeding Title VI limits. They also undermine the core values of private universities: the freedom to decide what to teach, who to admit and hire, and which areas of inquiry to pursue—free from government control, regardless of political party, he said.
“Our motto—Veritas, or truth—guides us as we navigate the challenging path ahead. Seeking truth is a journey without end. It requires us to be open to new information and different perspectives, to subject our beliefs to ongoing scrutiny, and to be ready to change our minds. It compels us to take up the difficult work of acknowledging our flaws so that we might realize the full promise of the University, especially when that promise is threatened,” Garber wrote.
Take heed parents, students, and other universities and colleges.
You might be next facing Trump demands.

For some, it means access to the best doctors and hospitals. For others, it means a courageous battle against a chronic, and perhaps incurable disease. And for many, it means struggling with how to pay their bills.
Connecticut has been a leader in helping residents deal with medical debt.  Late last year, Gov. Ned Lamont announced a program that utilized funds from the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) to eliminate $30 million in medical debt for 23,000 Connecticut residents.
While that pennies on the dollar approach was great news for those residents, at the time, state Sen. Saud Anwar (D-Windsor), co-chair of the public health committee,made an excellent point:  Connecticut needs to do more to prevent high healthcare costs for residents in the first place.
Unfortunately, a program that already exists at the federal level, designed to lower drug costs and improve access to medication for low-income Americans, has been corrupted.
The 340B federal drug discount program was created in 1992 and is the second largest drug program in the country. It was designed to help reduce the financial burden of accessing medication for the uninsured and under-insured. However, the system has been misused; 340B has morphed into a way for large tax-exempt hospitals and for-profit chain pharmacies to markup medicine prices and boost their profits.
While some 340B participants, such as community health centers and other safety-net clinics, reinvest income from the 340B program back into patient care as required by federal law, other program participants lack transparency into how, or if, savings are helping low-income patients.
In this program, manufacturers sell drugs to 340B hospitals at deeply discounted prices. The hospitals then contract with pharmacies to dispense those medicines. The intent was that the contracted pharmacies would be in low resource areas and pass along the discounts to their uninsured and under-insured consumer base. There is little evidence, however, that this program is operating in the manner it was designed.In fact, a comprehensive analysis found that most patients received “zero or close to zero” discount on the price of their drugs even though those treatments were purchased at steep discounts through the 340B program.  In 2022 alone, hospitals and big chain pharmacies pocketed more than $50 billion in discounts that were intended for patients.

From IQVIA fact sheet on its 340B study, Credit: IQVIA fact sheet
Because of a lack of oversight and transparency within the 340B program, hospitals have gotten away contracting primarily with big chain pharmacies in  wealthier, whiter neighborhoods and out of state, where customers have private insurance and pay full price.
In Connecticut,60 percent of 340B pharmacies that are supposed to be serving the low-income population are instead located in affluent neighborhoods. Furthermore, 139 pharmacies, roughly 30 percent of the total number of pharmacies, are located outside of Connecticut, with some as far away as Texas. This begs the question – how does that help our residents? To put it simply, it does not.
It is time to ensure that this gaming of the system stops and that those who the program was intended to help, are indeed being supported. As a federal program, legislation can only occur at the federal level to address these issues.
That is why Connecticut lawmakers should reject the 340B provisions in SB11—a wide ranging bill that will do nothing to help patient costs but could exacerbate the already bloated issues within 340B.
Our Congressional lawmakers need to lead this charge and increase regulations on 340B contracts.
Any fix must include stipulations as to how and where the discounted drugs can be sold and to whom. There needs to be more transparency and accountability down the distribution chain so that our most vulnerable populations are able to get the medications they need at the cost they can afford.
The 340B programhas the unique opportunity to advance health equity by supporting safety-net providers in underserved communities, but misguided eligibility standards and loopholes have 340B hospitals and their associated pharmacies to prioritize profits over patients. It’s time for that to change.

But only if we act now.  CT can’t wait for Washington, and our residents can’t wait for care.","When it comes to Connecticut’s health care system, there’s one truth our state leaders can’t afford to ignore: Care at come is among the most cost effective, compassionate, and sustainable services within our broader public health landscape. 
Helping Connecticut residents receive care at home reduces hospital admissions, prevents costly complications, and ensures continuity of care over time. By reaching people where they live, we help close gaps in access and save the state millions of dollars, especially for our most vulnerable populations.

Ann Olson and Bree Sanca
“Care at home” refers to the full spectrum of home-based services in Connecticut, including skilled medical home health, non-medical homemaker-companion care, and end-of-life hospice care.  Together, these services allow individuals to recover, remain independent, and age with dignity in their own homes, surrounded by family and familiar comforts.
However, despite these benefits and despite the thousands of state residents currently relying on care at home, our state now finds itself at a crossroads of inaction. The reason is simple: while there is strong support to invest in care at home, some leaders in Hartford are hesitant to act due to the current uncertainty at the federal level regarding health care funding. While these lawmakers may be well-intentioned (hoping to understand the federal impact on our state system before making decisions), waiting to act would push Connecticut further into to a crisis.
Here’s the reality: Medicaid-supported personal care at home costs the state far less than institutional care. Caring for an individual at home costs roughly $3,300 per month ($55/day). Compare that to nearly $10,000 per month in a nursing home facility. That’s a savings of nearly $80,000 a year per person. Home-based care isn’t just more dignified; it’s more fiscally responsible.
Skilled care at home offers even more cost savings to the state.  Two striking examples are:

Behavioral health nursing visits to ensure those with mental illness or substance- abuse disorder are taking their medications and stable in the community—average cost per day for community care is $100 versus $1,000 per day for a hospital stay.
Complex care nursing is another critical care-at-home service for children and adults who have medically complex conditions requiring highly skilled, in-home nursing care (feeding tubes and tracheostomy tubes or ventilators to help them breathe, live, and grow safely in their homes with their families). Average cost for care at home is $1,000/day vs average cost for institutional care is $10,000/day.

And yet, Connecticut’s care at home programs and services are hanging by a thread. Many Medicaid care-at-home rates have not been adjusted since 2007. In addition, we are losing workforce because neighboring states—Rhode Island, Massachusetts, New York— are all offering significantly higher rates, drawing caregivers across state lines.
Lack of workforce and inadequate reimbursement rates means fewer options for families, fewer workers to care for the elderly and people with disabilities, and more clients stuck in hospitals or moved to nursing facilities, costing the state and taxpayers more money. It also means devastating consequences for the thousands of workers—predominantly women and people of color —who rely on this profession to support their own families.
Studies show that delivering care at home reduces unnecessary hospitalizations and emergency visits, helping individuals stay healthier while saving the state millions.  Investing in care at home is the smart thing to do – economically, socially, and morally.
In this context, waiting for Washington is not a strategy. It’s a dangerous gamble —and the odds are stacked against the people who need care and the workers who provide it. If state leaders fail to act now, they will be part of the problem for not tackling a solution.
We don’t need to look to Washington for answers—we already have them. The answer is simple. Implement the following rate increases now: 13% for personal care services and a 10% for skilled home health, followed by 10% annual increases over the next three years to catch up with inflation. These are not extravagant requests. They are critical to preserving a care model that works for Connecticut economically, socially, and morally.
Making these changes is not only in the best interest of state residents and workers, it will also help insulate us from potential federal cuts. If federal cuts come to fruition, Connecticut’s ability to care for its most vulnerable residents will depend on the strength of our home care system. These services are the backbone of our health care infrastructure, quietly delivering consistent, high-quality care that keeps people out of hospitals and nursing homes.
By investing now, we create a resilient system that can absorb future shocks and continue delivering essential care when other parts of the safety net are strained.
If state leaders are serious about fiscal responsibility, economic equity, and preserving care that works, the time to act is now. Because when the federal cuts come —and they likely will —Connecticut won’t have the luxury to scramble. If we don’t invest now, we won’t have a workforce left to provide the most cost-effective care we have.
Care at home is not a problem to be solved, it’s the solution. But only if we choose to act now.  Connecticut can’t wait for Washington, and our residents can’t wait for care.

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Along with announced a veto of an education funding bill on Thursday, Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy introduced new legislation with a lower per student funding boost, plus additional funding and policy items focused on charter schools and homeschool programs.
Dunleavy held a news conference at the Alaska State Capitol on Thursday, saying there were two reasons for the veto.
“One of the reasons is that the revenue situation has deteriorated a lot since we submitted the bills and worked off the budget in December,” Dunleavy said. “And the second reason for the veto is there’s no policy with this.”
Last week, the Legislature passed a stripped-down version of House Bill 69, taking out all policy items, and putting forward a simple two-line version that increased the base student allocation — the core of the funding formula — by $1,000 in the funding formula. The bill originally was focused solely on a funding increase, and legislators had added some policy changes sought by the governor, only to remove those proposals after he continued to criticize the different versions of the bill for falling short.
Dunleavy had called the move a “joke” and promised to veto the bill. On Thursday, with the veto announcement, he urged legislators to reconsider his policy proposals to advance school funding this session. 
“We still have 34 days left in the session. We still have plenty of time to get a bill passed,” he said. “We know what the policies are. We know how to get to the end game here.”
The governor’s new proposed bill includes a $560 increase for the base student allocation, plus another $35 million per year in “targeted investments” for specific programs, resulting in what the governor’s office calls a “BSA equivalent” of $700.
However, that would result in a year-over-year decrease in the BSA because last year’s budget included a one-time funding bonus equivalent to a BSA boost of $680.
The governor’s policy proposals includes $13.6 million to fund homeschool students at the same level as the core BSA amount for students in brick-and-mortar schools; the state currently funds homeschooling at 90% of the BSA. In addition, Dunleavy proposed $21.9 million in incentive grants aimed at improving reading proficiency, an expansion of the application and appeals process for charter schools, and statewide open enrollment, which would allow families to choose which school students attend.
“This is a bill that, if agreed upon by the Legislature, I’ll sign tomorrow morning. I’ll sign Monday. I’ll sign Tuesday … because it will have policies in there,” Dunleavy said. “We support funding, but we’re not going to support a very large, unbalanced, one-sided coin that is just funding, when we have opportunities to improve educational outcomes.” 
Now, the 60 members of the House and Senate are headed to a joint session where they could override the veto. 
Overriding the veto would require votes from 40 of 60 legislators. Last year, the Legislature failed by one vote. This year, multiple legislators said there are unlikely to be 40 votes for an override. The House and Senate passed HB 69 with a combined 32 votes.
A joint session to vote on the veto override is tentatively scheduled for Tuesday, April 22. 
“You simply never know,” House Speaker Bryce Edmon, I-Dillingham, told reporters on Thursday of the veto override vote, adding that school districts are in crisis. “We have heard time and again this session, (from) schools that are beyond their capabilities of any reserves that they had. Our public school system in Alaska is in crisis, and that’s something that we need to focus on.” 
Edgmon said the House majority caucus is open to negotiate with Dunleavy and consider his policy proposals, but he’s concerned it doesn’t address the state of schools now, some facing major deficits and budget shortfalls. 
“What happens if that gap isn’t met this year? What transpires in year two or three or four?” Edgmon said, adding that this question is particularly important for districts that are struggling to keep schools open. “And I didn’t hear a clear answer from the governor, and that concerned me.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXWith 34 days left in the session, Edgmon said the funding boost is a major priority. “It’s going to be a heavy lift, but we’re up for it, and we’re going to do everything we can,” he said. “And we ask our school districts to be patient, to know that we’re doing our best.”
Rep. Rebecca Himschoot, I-Sitka, who sponsored the bill, also urged the veto override. 
“Honestly, the $1,000 BSA is what our districts need,” she said. “They need twice that. So to back away from the override vote, would I think be the wrong move at this point. We need to push for that override.”
Himschoot agreed there are areas in Dunleavy’s new legislation that could be negotiable. “There are some things there that we can definitely work with,” she said. “But the deal is not sealed in any way on that bill right now, I know that educators across the state are being laid off. We have school programs being cut. Once you cut it, you don’t necessarily get it back,” she said.
In an interview after the governor’s news conference, Himschoot pointed to a comment by Dunleavy. 
“One thing the governor said was we need to put our resources where the biggest problem is,” she said. “And the biggest problem our districts have right now is they’re either over a funding cliff or they will be next year…. right now, while we’re talking, they are going off the edge.”
Educators and advocates react to the veto
School district officials, students, parents and advocates have testified to lawmakers over weeks during the session that Alaska schools are in a financial crisis, and face steep cuts to programs, school closures and the loss of teachers and staff without the funding boost. Already, school districts have sent out hundreds of notices of potential layoffs, some accounting for a $680 to $1,000 per student increase. 
On Thursday, the state’s largest teachers’ union, NEA-Alaska, criticized the veto and urged an override. “To say I am disappointed Governor Dunleavy vetoed education funding is an understatement,” said Tom Klaameyer, NEA-Alaska president, in an emailed statement. “Unfortunately, it’s not surprising. We knew this Governor was going to play politics with Alaska students’ futures – and it’s disgraceful….  I urge every legislator to vote to override Governor Dunleavy’s veto and do the right thing for our kids.” 
Caroline Storm, executive director of the nonprofit Coalition for Education Equity, said in an interview Thursday that the group is preparing a lawsuit against the state saying that it is failing to maintain adequate schools, as required under the state constitution.
The group sued the state in 2004, in Moore vs. State of Alaska, where a judge ruled that the state was failing to support underperforming schools. Storm said today, the state is again not fulfilling its obligation, for both funding districts and adequately meeting education standards. 
“I know for a fact that there are several districts that are unable to even provide their students with elective opportunities, and those students have to do some other sort of correspondence course to get the requirements they need to graduate,” Storm said. “So if we’re not able to fund districts to the point where they can have a teacher present to offer those electives, or those art standards or anything, we’re not providing an adequate education.”
Budget still in flux 
Last year, legislators approved a one-time $680 boost to the BSA. That was worth roughly $174 million statewide. The increase proposed in HB 69 would have permanently increased that funding boost by $79 million, or $253 million statewide.
Anticipating Dunleavy’s veto, the Alaska House of Representatives voted to include a one-time, $1,000 BSA boost equivalent to HB 69 in the state’s draft operating budget.
It isn’t yet clear whether the Senate will affirm that increase, because the House’s draft budget also includes a major deficit. 
The legislation the governor proposed on Thursday would cost $179.1 million. 
As of Thursday, the draft budget bills adopted by the Legislature this year contain about $6.6 billion in spending. The Alaska Department of Revenue is expecting $6.1 billion in state revenue over the next year, resulting in a projected deficit of almost $500 million.
Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Dunleavy said that if the Legislature is able to balance the budget while still approving a one-time $1,000 BSA boost, he’d consider it.
“I would have a discussion with finance leaders to take a look at that, see where we would draw that money from to make that happen. But I’d be willing to have that discussion,” he said.

Jim Himes warns of Trump’s ‘creeping authoritarianism’,Lisa Hagen,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/17/ct-rep-jim-himes-criticizes-trump/,U.S. Rep. Jim Himes unleashed a barrage of criticisms at the Trump administration and the state of the U.S. Congress on Thursday night.,"Warning of “creeping authoritarianism,” “testosterone-addled craziness” and the celebration of “abject cruelty,” U.S. Rep. Jim Himes unleashed a barrage of criticisms at the Trump administration and the state of the U.S. Congress on Thursday night.
Speaking at The Connecticut Mirror’s “In the Room” series hosted by John Dankosky at the Ferguson Library in Stamford, Himes said the Congress he serves in now — “a wholly owned subsidiary of Trump Inc.” — is almost unrecognizable from the one he first joined nearly two decades ago 
That evolution has brought a lot of frustration for him, and more rarely some glimpses of hope, during the dramatic overhaul of government under the Trump administration.
Himes had no shortage of fiery rhetoric Thursday night about the funding cuts and other moves by President Donald J. Trump, who he said is “a bully, and like all bullies, he’s a coward.” 
Himes talked in eyebrow-raising hypotheticals about the prospect of whether he would break the law by speaking publicly about classified information, if it meant holding the administration accountable, in rare circumstances.
Himes plays a key role in overseeing the intelligence community and threats to the U.S. as the ranking member on the House Intelligence Committee. But much of that, he noted, happens behind closed doors because of the sensitive nature of the work.
In one possible scenario, Himes said, if Trump mobilized the CIA to go after an American in the United States, he would feel the need to defy the norms of his committee and provide the needed oversight.
“I’d have to go in front of a camera and commit a felony, which is to say, disclose classified information,” Himes said.

He does not anticipate that happening, but said it is not “crazy farfetched,” since the formation of his committee came in the wake of the Nixon administration doing something similar.
He mused about that again later in the evening when talking about law firms and other institutions being frightened to take a stand against the White House.
“I know it’s scary. Again, I’m sort of thinking about, you know, my upcoming stint in a jail somewhere,” Himes said, somewhat jokingly.
Connecticut’s congressional delegation has taken a more front-and-center role in defying the White House in recent weeks.
U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy has emerged as a leading national voice of the opposition and has been outspoken that the Democratic Party did not do enough to address constituents’ anxiety, especially around cost of living.
Other Connecticut members have had some breakout moments as well. U.S. Rep. John Larson had a semi-viral moment when he railed against Republicans over Social Security. And last week, U.S. Rep. Jahana Hayes joined a few other members from both parties at a televised CNN town hall, where she spoke of the “chainsaw approach.”
Himes has similar concerns as Murphy. On Thursday, Himes said the party still needs to reckon with its losses in the last election and respect the outcome of Republican-led majorities and the White House. Himes said he is “trying to be both reassuring and motivating” for constituents but did not shy away from the realities of what it means for Democrats to be in the minority party.
He acknowledged the calls from the base of the party who want lawmakers to do more and fight back with the realities of their limited powers. Ultimately, Himes said, Democrats will need to win back the U.S. House next year and overcome the GOP’s narrow majority.
“Keep the activist base happy. … The other thing we need to do, we damn well better take back the House of Representatives,” Himes said.
But when asked about the lack of norms and decorum in the current political climate and whether Democrats need to play on the same level, Himes was defiant.
“If this country has become so indecent and so appalling that we celebrate the least common denominator, I don’t want to be part of it,” Himes said.
Because of his role on the Intelligence Committee, Himes was best-positioned to ask why national security officials were using the encrypted app Signal to discuss an imminent attack on Houthi targets in Yemen, how a journalist ended up in the chat and whether classified information was shared.
When asked if there are people in the intelligence community who know what they’re doing, Himes named National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, who used to serve with Himes in Congress before joining the Trump administration. Waltz was involved in the Signal chat.
Like other officials, Himes said, Waltz is under pressure to comply with the White House.
“Humans are humans. You put them into a context where the rules don’t matter, where competence doesn’t matter, where there is no accountability. Good people do dumb things,” Himes said. “It doesn’t matter whether these people are competent or not because they’re just in a circus.”
The congressman was also pressed about his vote to censure U.S. Democratic Rep. Al Green of Texas, who shouted down Trump during his joint address to Congress last month. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., ordered him to be ejected from the chamber. 
Republicans moved to censure Green, a resolution that garnered support from just 10 Democrats, including Himes. He again defended his vote, saying it was consistent with his vote to reprimand GOP Rep. Joe Wilson of South Carolina who interrupted former President Barack Obama’s 2009 address to Congress by shouting “You lie!”
But he noted he had a tough two-hour conversation with the Connecticut NAACP about his vote to punish a Black congressman who has been one of the most vocal opponents of Trump and pushed for his impeachment in his last term.
“I was caught off guard … by the pain it caused for my African American constituents, I apologized to the NAACP for missing that,” Himes said. “You can tell I have a very serious concern for leaders who are inconsistent about the rules.”
Himes argued that the tide may start to shift as Republicans become more openly critical of Trump’s tariff strategy and as some vulnerable GOP members raise concerns about the possibility of Medicaid cuts to offset the party’s major tax package.
His frustration and concern was evident throughout most of the hour-long conversation. He said he is starting not to see Congress as a co-equal branch of government. And he said politics has turned even uglier than when he first came to Congress in 2009. 
But he ended on a hint of optimism about the role he and others hope to play.
“At what point did this country decide it was going to celebrate abject cruelty against the most vulnerable people on the planet? Himes said. “I feel energized in saying we’re going to change that.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_6890-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-17 23:03:16.803795

An official with Homeland Security Investigations in Tallahassee took Lopez-Gomez, a 20-year-old born in Georgia, to a Wendy’s near the jail, where he reunited with his mother after spending more than 24 hours under arrest following a traffic stop in which he was a passenger.
Lopez-Gomez appeared shellshocked and spoke quietly as he discussed what happened when a Florida Highway Patrol trooper pulled over the car he was in on his way to work from Cairo, Georgia, to Tallahassee. The trooper made the traffic stop because the driver was going 78 mph in a 65 mph zone, according to the arrest report.
“I feel fine leaving that place, I felt bad in there. They didn’t give us anything to eat all day yesterday,” he told the Florida Phoenix in Spanish. He added that he had asked the trooper who made the arrest why he was being taken into custody, because he was a U.S. citizen.
His mother, also in Spanish, said the days ahead will be tough for the family and worries that Lopez-Gomez and his sisters will live in fear of deportation despite having been born in the country. She told the Phoenix she planned to sue over her son’s arrest.
“I don’t have a way to pay all the people who are helping us. People from other states have called us, and we don’t have a way to pay them; we can only thank them,” Gomez-Perez said.
The pair didn’t reunite until the evening, after Lopez-Gomez’s first court appearance earlier in the day. Leon County Judge LaShawn Riggans ruled Thursday morning that she lacked jurisdiction to release him because U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement had formally asked the jail to hold him for 48 hours.
After Riggans’ inspection of his Social Security card and birth certificate, which an advocate waved in the courtroom, the judge said she found no probable cause for the charge.
“In looking at it, and feeling it, and holding it up to the light, the court can clearly see the watermark to show that this is indeed an authentic document,” Riggans said.
The arrest record the trooper filed states that Lopez-Gomez had said he was in the country illegally but that he had handed over his ID. There was no mention of the Social Security card on the arrest report. However, Lopez-Gomez told the Phoenix he had shown the trooper a copy of his Social Security card and Georgia state ID.
The HSI agent who took Lopez-Gomez to Wendy’s directed questions to a spokesperson, who didn’t respond to the Phoenix’s request for comment or questions as of this publication.
After the reunion with his mom, Lopez-Gomez returned to the parking lot of the jail, where 30 protesters had been demanding his release. They met him with cheers and hugs.
Lopez-Gomez will have to return to the Leon County Courthouse on May 6. He was charged under a recently passed law that a federal judge has temporarily barred the state from enforcing, further calling into question the validity of his arrest, the charge, and detention.
Gov. Ron DeSantis signed SB 4-C into law on Feb. 14, and U.S. District Court Judge Kathleen Williams blocked its enforcement on April 4.
The law makes it a misdemeanor for undocumented immigrants over age 18 to “knowingly” enter Florida “after entering the United States by eluding or avoiding examination or inspection by immigration officers.”
Two other men who were in the car with Lopez-Gomez, the driver and another passenger, also made their first appearances on the same charge on Thursday. The driver was also charged with driving without a license.

Bob Ferguson balked at Democratic lawmakers’ latest tax package on Thursday, calling it “too risky” given the budget tumult that actions by the federal government could trigger.
“At a time of great economic uncertainty and assaults by the Trump Administration on core state services for working families, raising $12 billion in taxes is unsustainable, too risky and fails to adequately prepare Washington state for the crisis that looms ahead,” Ferguson said in a statement.
“We must ensure Washington is in the best possible financial position to weather more cuts and damaging economic policies from a Trump Administration that weaponizes funding to punish those it disagrees with and forces them into compromising their values,” he said. 
Ferguson did not cite any specific taxes he dislikes in the proposals that House and Senate Democrats viewed as the linchpin for completing their negotiations on an operating budget that overcomes a projected $16 billion shortfall over the next four years. 
Democrats have already slimmed their tax ambitions, discarding a set of hikes Ferguson previously came out against that could have raised as much as $21 billion over four years.
Absence of further guidance from the governor on what he’d like to see threatens to slow, even derail, their progress and could drive the Legislature into overtime when the regular session ends April 27.
Special session “is certainly not our Plan A for us,” House Majority Leader Joe Fitzgibbon, D-Seattle, said. 
Ferguson, who was in Seattle on Thursday, released the statement 20 minutes before he met virtually with Democratic leaders of both chambers. 
That conversation touched broadly on spending reductions and revenue raising. The governor did not spell out his preferences on taxes or how large a tax package is acceptable in the meeting.
“I think there are some proposals he is warmer to and some proposals he is cooler to,” Fitzgibbon said. “We have a lot to talk about in terms of options for paths forward.”
Ferguson has said repeatedly he wants to see a balance of progressive revenue and spending reductions. His staff provided options to some members this week.
“We have said that if the revenue number is too high, as he said in his statement, that we need more suggestions than they have provided so far,” Fitzgibbon said.
House Speaker Laurie Jinkins, D-Tacoma, said in a statement, that House Democrats share Ferguson’s “belief that a balanced approach combining progressive revenue and spending reductions is the right way to meet the needs of our state.”
She said her caucus appreciates all viewpoints and the governor’s preferences are taken into account as they look to ensure residents have shelter, food, access to health care, and strong public schools.
Two Republican senators applauded Ferguson’s critique of the Democrats’ latest tax plan.
“If we truly want our state to be ready for any sort of fiscal turbulence, let’s have a new budget that avoids tax increases completely — whether they’re ‘progressive’ or not,” Sen. Chris Gildon, R-Puyallup, the Republican lead on the Senate budget committee, said in a statement.
Sen. Nikki Torres, R-Pasco, assistant budget leader, said “To us, any new taxes would be risky. The question now is whether the Democrat legislators will heed the governor’s words or continue going back and forth with him.”
Democrats in the House and Senate jointly released a smorgasbord of tax proposals on Tuesday, including higher taxes on big businesses, hiking the rate on capital gains above $1 million and allowing a 1% annual limit on property tax growth to rise up to 3%.
They’ve pitched other hikes as well, such as an expanded tax on nicotine products like Zyn and a new sales tax on rented self-storage units. 
And they’re seeking to have some large businesses make a one-time pre-payment of sales tax owed to the state, a maneuver that would suck more tax revenue into the 2025-27 budget that otherwise would have been due the month after it ends.
Thursday’s conversation isn’t deterring Democrats from pursuing the new tax bills, yet. 
“At the moment, I think we need to keep our options open and keep our bills moving,” Fitzgibbon said. 
Earlier this month, Ferguson rejected tax plans from the House and Senate that leaned heavily on a tax that would’ve applied to residents with certain assets worth more than $50 million. The governor and others are not confident that tax would survive an expected court challenge.
Ferguson lauded the Legislature in his statement Thursday for moving on from the so-called wealth tax. 
A couple hours before lawmakers met with the governor, Jinkins told reporters she hoped to hear “things that he likes and things that he doesn’t like.”
“I’ve been waiting to hear some things that he likes,” she said. Asked if she had heard him cite anything that he likes in any proposal, she joked in response, “Have you?”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_0811-scaled-e1744939528175-1024x647.jpeg,,,2025-04-17 22:00:06.857721

(Photo by Jackie Llanos/Florida Phoenix)Juan Carlos Lopez-Gomez held his mother in a tight embrace and wept following his release from the Leon County Jail Thursday evening, where the U.S. citizen was held after his arrest for illegally entering Florida as an “unauthorized alien.”
An official with Homeland Security Investigations in Tallahassee took Lopez-Gomez, a 20-year-old born in Georgia, to a Wendy’s near the jail, where he reunited with his mother after spending more than 24 hours under arrest following a traffic stop in which he was a passenger.
Lopez-Gomez appeared shellshocked and spoke quietly as he discussed what happened when a Florida Highway Patrol trooper pulled over the car he was in on his way to work from Cairo, Georgia, to Tallahassee. The trooper made the traffic stop because the driver was going 78 mph in a 65 mph zone, according to the arrest report.
“I feel fine leaving that place, I felt bad in there. They didn’t give us anything to eat all day yesterday,” he told the Florida Phoenix in Spanish. He added that he had asked the trooper who made the arrest why he was being taken into custody, because he was a U.S. citizen.
His mother, also in Spanish, said the days ahead will be tough for the family and worries that Lopez-Gomez and his sisters will live in fear of deportation despite having been born in the country. She told the Phoenix she planned to sue over her son’s arrest.
“I don’t have a way to pay all the people who are helping us. People from other states have called us, and we don’t have a way to pay them; we can only thank them,” Gomez-Perez said.

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Oklahoma’s mental health department faces a $43 million deficit, and letters canceling some provider contracts were sent without the agency head’s knowledge, the agency’s commissioner said during a special legislative hearing Thursday. 
Oklahoma lawmakers questioned Commissioner Allie Friesen for hours amid reports of financial disarray at the Oklahoma State Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services and outrage over provider contracts being “cut” or “canceled.” She was one of 11 witnesses called by the committee to testify under oath. 
Friesen, who was appointed by Gov. Kevin Stitt in January 2024, said her administration inherited a “chaotic” situation and former agency leaders failed to make proper budget requests of the Legislature, leading to financial shortfalls. 
“What this administration will not tolerate is, ‘Make it look good and don’t show anybody the bad,’” she said. 
The extent of the shortfall has been under question, as officials originally believed it was $63 million. Friesen said further investigation after the deficiency was initially brought to her attention found it was $43 million. 
Some providers who have contracts with the agency have said they received notice that their contracts were altered or terminated retroactively, meaning funds for services already provided may not come. 
Letters referenced “incentive or bonus payments,” Friesen said, and some providers “independently” decided to lay off staff and close facilities.

“As soon as I realized that those are functioning not as a bonus, but rather as a core component of care, we pivoted,” Friesen said. “And we realized that we needed to quickly ask for a supplemental (appropriation), and we need to make sure that these providers have what they need.”
The agency requested a $6.2 million supplemental appropriation Monday to ensure “balanced budget and the continued delivery of essential behavioral health services” for the current fiscal year. It was unclear how the agency planned to fill the rest of the deficit.
Other letters canceled contracts for three Tulsa-area certified community behavioral health clinics in relation to a protest to a request for proposal, or RFP. 
Friesen said these letters were sent by the Office of Management and Enterprise Services without her or her general counsel’s knowledge. 
Christa Helfrey, a spokesperson for OMES, said in a statement after the hearing that the process has been reviewed to ensure there is “no potential lapse in communication or services for Oklahomans” and the agency is “committed to assisting all agencies with the procurement process.” 
Rep. Mark Lawson, R-Sapulpa, who chaired the special committee said there is “an ongoing dispute” over the process for soliciting bids for services in the Tulsa area that some claim was unfair. He said notices of cancellation, effective May 10, from OMES were sent to Family and Children’s Services, CREOKS Health Services, and Grand Mental Health, all of which are involved in the dispute. 
Tulsa District Attorney Steve Kunzweiler, who testified Thursday, questioned why all three cancellations were for providers in the Tulsa area and whether they were retaliatory against contractors who “challenged” the agency’s RFP. 
In its budget proposal this year, the Mental Health Department requested $569 million from the state Legislature for the 2026 fiscal year, a 48% increase from last year’s appropriation. Friesen said the agency is working on an amended budget request to present to the Legislature.

The Legislature must approve a state budget by the end of session in May. 
House budget chair Trey Caldwell, R-Faxon, previously told Oklahoma Voice the agency’s past administration had been paying prior year bills with new money, and it caught up with them.
The agency has several ongoing financial strains, including a recently approved consent decree expected to cost between $26 million and $45 million over three to five years, and the construction of a new inpatient behavioral health hospital that’s $124 million over budget. 
Friesen reported Thursday that the agency has reduced the competency restoration waitlist to 154 individuals, which is a 33% reduction from the time the lawsuit that led to the settlement was filed. 
A total of four staff members left the agency in December and were asked, but “not required,” to sign what Friesen referred to as both “nondisclosure agreements” and “settlements” during her testimony. 
The agency’s former chief financial officer, Richard Edwards, previously told Oklahoma Voice he resigned under threat of termination and was being used as a scapegoat for the financial issues.
The agreements did not resolve legal issues or complaints, Friesen said. Lawmakers requested to see the agreements, which Friesen said she will provide within the week, pending a review of their confidentiality. 
A handful of investigations into the agency have been requested, including to the state auditor, the Legislative Office of Fiscal Transparency, a “special investigator,” and Thursday’s special House committee. 
Ahead of Thursday’s hearing, House Speaker Kyle Hilbert, R-Bristow, said lawmakers weren’t sure how it was going to end and just wanted to “dig in” to find out “what in the world is going on.”
“Let’s get some answers,” Hilbert said. “And obviously there’s a lot of talk about the numbers, and that certainly matters, the budget matters. But we also have to talk about the people at the end of those numbers that are impacted by the decisions that have been going on.”
Investigations from the state auditor, the House, and LOFT are all in communication and collaborative efforts, he said. He was unsure what the plans of the special investigator were. 
Commissioner Friesen on Thursday also briefly referenced an investigation from the Office of the Inspector General, a federal agency that’s tasked with rooting out fraud, waste and other abuses and to improve Medicaid and Medicare efficiency. SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Stitt said Wednesday that if the committee finds something that needs to be “fixed,” he’ll be the first to take action. He reiterated his stance that funding for the agency is not being cut and said some contracts were under review where the request for proposal process “wasn’t done accurately.” 
“What you’re seeing now is because (Allie) got rid of her CFO, and she got rid of, like, four or five of her lieutenants, and then everything started coming up,” he said. “So sometimes, when you have people with agencies that have been there for 30, 40 years, they’re moving the ball pretty good. They understand how this, how this building works, and they’re paying every invoice so nobody squawks.”
After meeting for over three hours, House lawmakers said they planned to continue the hearing next week.
The Mental Health Department’s interim chief financial officer, a former chief of staff, the director of the Legislature’s fiscal oversight body, a few providers, and the purchasing director for the state will return next week to testify.

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)The scene outside Thursday’s Watertown Rotary luncheon turned raucous in the presence of South Dakota’s senior U.S. senator.
Not long after the event, staffers urged Republican U.S. Senate Majority Leader John Thune into a black sedan as protesters outside Watertown’s Elks Lodge yelled “do your job.” 
Before he left, though, Thune said he didn’t take issue with the people doing the yelling.
“We hear in our office on a fairly regular basis from people across the state on sort of all sides of the issues. Clearly these protesters are very anti-Trump policy, and so they have every right to make their voices heard,” Thune said. “We welcome that.”
The protesters want Thune to oppose several of the president’s efforts, and for him to hold public town halls.

The noon event where Thune took questions was open to Rotary Club members and media, not the general public. Several protesters said they’d reached out to Thune’s office through phone or email in recent months without a response.
“Our senator doesn’t have the guts to stand up to what Trump is doing,” said Kay Solberg, an organizer who said she plans to hold another protest in Watertown this weekend.
It was the second gathering of displeased citizens to greet Thune in as many days. More than 100 people protested outside a Thune event in Rapid City Wednesday.
Thune said he doesn’t see how a public town hall “accomplishes anything that we don’t accomplish on a daily basis.” He maintains that he’s “probably one of the most accessible politicians in South Dakota.” 
 
That’s why Thune was behind schedule on Thursday, his staff said. He’d taken two too many questions from Watertown Rotarians, held a second press conference that wasn’t scheduled, and stopped to shake hands again and again with Watertown residents who had lingering questions and concerns.
Wednesday marked Thune’s third event in the state this week during Congress’ April recess, following the Pennington County Republican Women’s meeting in Rapid City and an appearance at Northern State University in Aberdeen on Tuesday. He’s also spent hours visiting with the public at the state basketball tournament in Aberdeen in March, he said.

“If people have questions, we’re available on a regular basis,” Thune said.
Thune answered several questions during the Rotary meeting, addressing the uncertainty regarding foreign trade, immigration and cuts to entitlement programs. 
Thune encourages patience on tariffs
Thune has long been a critic of tariffs and supportive of free trade deals, but said South Dakotans should offer grace to Trump and his shifting tariff policy “to see what kind of deals he can strike.” 
At a town hall earlier this week, Augustana Economics Professor Reynold Nesiba said tariffs risk relationships with other countries. U.S. beef exports to China were halted, the former Democratic state lawmaker said, allowing Australia to fill the gap. The same can happen with China’s soybean imports, Nesiba said, shifting from the United States to Brazil.
Trump’s intention, Thune said Wednesday, is to negotiate better trade deals and create a “more level playing field,” especially regarding China’s trade practices. He said he’s heard support from agricultural producers in the state on the plan.
America should explore partnerships with other countries in the meantime, Thune said. He supported the Trans-Pacific Partnership during the Obama administration, which would have opened up markets in countries like Japan and South Korea.
“We have a lot of national security interests in the region, and they’re allies of ours and we can use that to isolate China,” Thune said. “What you don’t want is these countries running into China’s orbit.”
If Trump’s trade policies are “used in a way that gets a trilateral deal in place, for example with Japan and South Korea, that would be a win.”
Medicaid’s role in budget reconciliation
Republican U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson’s plan to pass a budget reconciliation bill by Memorial Day is “certainly aspirational,” Thune said. 

  Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., speaks with constituents at a Watertown Rotary meeting on April 17, 2025. (Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)

Since Republicans control the House and Senate, they can unlock the reconciliation process to fast-track major spending legislation and bypass the Senate’s 60-vote filibuster role with a simple majority.
Thune expects to iron out differences between budget resolutions from the House and Senate and send the finished product to Trump’s desk “hopefully by the middle of summer to create some economic certainty.”
Congress needs to “get it done right,” Thune said. 
“Whatever amount of time that takes, we’re going to do the right thing,” he said.
Republicans hope to leverage the process to extend and expand expiring tax cuts, increase border security and defense spending and cut federal spending throughout the budget. 
Medicaid is on the chopping block, Thune said. The House budget envisions a Medicaid cut of $880 million over a 10 year period, although the House Energy and Commerce Committee would have to hammer out how to save the money.
Medicaid cuts rippling through rural America could bring hospital closures, job losses

Medicaid is a federal-state health insurance program for people with low income. Medicaid spending is projected to cost $7.4 trillion over the next decade.
Thune proposed Medicaid work requirements rather than cutting the program as a way to “achieve a significant level of savings that would strengthen the program and not harm people who are beneficiaries.”
The change would generate more than $100 billion in savings over a decade, he said. 
South Dakota voters approved a constitutional amendment during the 2024 general election to allow the state to implement Medicaid work requirements if the federal government allows them. 
Thune says he’s ‘not worried’ about legal status of immigrants
Rotarian Don Goldhorn said he appreciated Thune’s appearance, but said some responses left him disgruntled.
Goldhorn and his wife sponsored a work visa for a Ukrainian family, he said, helping them adjust to life in the United States during Russia’s ongoing war with Ukraine. The two-year work visa will end in September, and Goldman is concerned the family won’t receive an extension and be forced to return to their besieged home country. 
“If they came here legally into this country,” Thune said, “and they’re law-abiding citizens here, I’m not worried.”
Other Rotarians received similar responses from Thune about the detention of Pro-Palestine protesters because of allegedly antisemitic behavior.
“I’m not satisfied,” Goldhorn told South Dakota Searchlight, “and it’s nothing personal against Sen. Thune. I went to get some specific answers, and I didn’t feel like there were specific answers.”
Driving past protesters to enter the building before the luncheon began, though, Goldhorn wondered if a town hall would accomplish what the protesters might hope it would. 
Thune could speak directly to all constituents, he said, and they could raise their concerns or dissatisfaction to him. But the Rotarian worries that larger, more public town halls could turn from peaceful to confrontational.

Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderOver 100 international college students and recent graduates who say their immigration records have been abruptly revoked may soon have some temporary relief.
In an Atlanta courtroom Thursday, U.S. District Court Judge Victoria Calvert said she is inclined to grant that relief.
“I just need to figure out the contours,” she said.
In the suit before Calvert, 133 students from universities around the country – including 26 from Georgia – said the administration of President Donald Trump and U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement improperly cut off their Student and Exchange Visitor Information System records, or SEVIS.
When it was originally filed last week, the case included 17 students and recent graduates, seven from Georgia. They attend schools including the University of Georgia, Georgia Tech, Emory University and Kennesaw State University.
Attorney Charles Kuck, who represented the students, said SEVIS was created after the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks to track international students. Losing SEVIS status would effectively end an international student’s ability to keep studying in the U.S.
“SEVIS is kind of like the Big Brother for foreign students, and if you violate any term in that, you get terminated,” he said. “But also, apparently, you get terminated when you don’t violate any terms in it, according to the new theory of ICE.”
Kuck said the students weren’t told the specific reasons for their terminations. Many of his clients have had minor run-ins with the law, including traffic offenses like speeding or driving with an expired license, a DUI charge that was reduced to reckless driving or in one case, a domestic violence charge that was later dropped for lack of evidence. Some said they have no criminal or traffic history.
Kuck said none of his clients have been accused of any infraction that would result in loss of SEVIS under federal rules, and he believes the government flagged his clients and others en masse using AI without any judicial review.
An Inside Higher Ed analysis found that as of Thursday, over 240 colleges around the country have reported 1,480 international students and recent graduates who have had their legal status changed by the State Department. Federal judges in other states have already issued orders to temporarily reinstate students.
International students make up about 8% of the nearly 346,000 students enrolled in Georgia’s public colleges and universities.
The revocations have sparked protests, including at Georgia campuses.
Kuck said many of the students are close to graduation, and some have job offers they stand to lose out on, including one as a Georgia Tech professor.
He said one of the plaintiffs has attempted suicide and many of the others are terrified.
“A lot of our clients are so fragile mentally, emotionally, they don’t know what to do, they’re very concerned about if ICE is going to knock on their door, I mean, they’re panicked. And so we’ve spent a lot of time, unfortunately, calming them down, saying relax, it’s going to be okay, we’ve got your back, you’re not going to get picked up, and this is all going to work out.”
Attorney David Powell with the U.S. Attorney’s Office argued that the students had not shown any evidence that they have suffered permanent harm. He said students should reapply for their SEVIS status and suggested that they could transfer credits and complete their studies in their home countries or in Canada.
He requested that any relief be narrowly tailored to allow students to finish semesters they had already paid for but not to include recent graduates who are in the country performing optional practical training, a program which allows them to work in the country while waiting in the lottery for an H-1B visa – a foreign worker visa that allows foreign citizens with specialized skills to work in the U.S. – or make other plans for the future.
The government has until midnight Friday to file a motion in the case, and Calvert could issue temporary relief shortly afterwards.
Calvert, who was appointed to the bench in 2022 by former President Joe Biden, scheduled a follow-up hearing April 24 to consider more permanent relief.

(Will Price | West Virginia Legislative Photography)Democrats in the West Virginia Senate are urging Gov. Patrick Morrisey not to sign a bill they say was not legally passed because of a “series of procedural irregularities.”
The letter concerns the Senate’s passage of Senate Bill 474, a governor-requested bill that would end diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives in the state. 
The House of Delegates passed the bill late on Saturday, the last day of the 60-day legislative session. The Democrats say the Senate erred in the procedures it took late Saturday night as it approved the House’s amended version of the bill. 
In a letter to the governor, Senate President Randy Smith and Senate Clerk Lee Cassis Thursday, Sens. Mike Woefel, D-Cabell, and Joey Garcia, D-Marion, the only two senators from the minority party, say that Senate Republicans improperly suspended a rule they apparently used to bypass considering several pending amendments from Garcia and pass the bill in the final minutes of session. They also argue the Republicans made two other procedural errors. 
“Due to the Senate’s patent disregard of established legislative procedure, the bill did not properly complete legislative action, and it should not be enrolled, authenticated, or presented to the Governor for approval,” the letter says. “If the bill is sent to the Governor, it must be vetoed on technical grounds due to the Senate’s failure to adhere to its own binding rules of  procedure.”
The Senate originally passed the bill March 26. The House passed the bill at 10:41 p.m. Saturday after nearly three hours of debate. When the bill went back to the Senate to approve the House’s changes, more than a dozen amendments from Garcia appeared to be pending on the legislation. 
Sen. Amy Grady, R-Mason, at first made a motion to concur with the House’s changes to the bill and pass it. The senate stood at ease for a few minutes before Grady withdrew the motion. 


 
A few minutes later, Sen. Eric Tar, R-Putnam, moved to suspend Joint Rule 3, which governs how amendments to amendments and disagreements are handled between the two legislative chambers, and concur and pass Senate Bill 474. The rule suspension required a two-thirds roll call vote by both chambers, but the approval was made by a voice vote and with objections heard. The Senate then passed the bill with a 31-2 vote.
A short time later, Tarr moved to reconsider the vote by which they concurred and passed the bill. The Democrats argue that the Senate failed to properly reconsider the motion. Tarr instead moved to withdraw his motion and then moved to concur with the House’s version of the bill. 
Next, Senate Majority Leader Patrick Martin, R-Lewis, moved the previous question. Smith turned down Garcia’s request that pending amendments be considered, saying that another motion had been called. 
The Senate then voted again to concur with the House’s version of the bill and then passed the bill. 
Even if the Senate’s first passage of the bill was done properly, the Democrats argue, the Senate was required to consider the pending amendments before it could concur in the House’s changes to the bill, and they failed to do so.
“If the senator and the governor don’t do the right thing, I think this will be litigated and the bill will go down in flames,” Garcia said in an interview with West Virginia MetroNews Thursday.
The West Virginia Democratic Party and the American Civil Liberties Union of West Virginia have also condemned the way the bill was passed. The ACLU-WV wrote in a blog post Monday that the Senate likely broke its own rules in rushing the bill through at the last minute. 
“If Gov. Morrisey signs the bill (which we fully expect he will) then we will see the state in court,” the organization wrote.
Representatives for Morrisey and Smith did not comment Thursday.

(Photo: Angela Dennis)Civil rights attorney Ben Crump visited Knoxville on Wednesday to discuss lawsuits against Knox County and the University of Tennessee Medical Center over the deaths of two Black men following encounters with county law enforcement officers.
Crump, who is representing the families of Daevon Saint-Germain and David Batts, compared the death of Saint-Germain to that of Breonna Taylor, who was killed during a police raid in Louisville, Ky, in March 2020.
“This is Knoxville’s Breonna Taylor,” Crump said. “The killing of an 18-year-old high school senior. There are so many unanswered questions as to why he was shot nine times, and no video footage exists to explain why this young man was killed that morning.”
Saint-Germain was shot and killed on Jan. 3 by Knox County Sheriff SWAT deputies during an early morning raid at his family’s south Knoxville home.
The Knox County Sheriff’s Office (KCSO) says deputies were carrying out a search warrant when Saint-Germain allegedly showed a firearm, prompting officers to open fire. The warrant was reportedly issued based on social media activity that investigators claimed linked Saint-Germain to drug sales, including marijuana and THC products.
But the details of what happened during the raid remain murky. SWAT officers involved were not wearing body cameras, a fact that has fueled growing concerns over transparency and accountability of the KCSO. Saint-Germain’s family, who were inside the home at the time, deny the allegations about him.

Despite the absence of body camera footage, Crump expressed confidence in his legal team’s path forward.
“With eyewitness accounts, physical evidence, and strong expert testimony, we believe we can bring a successful 1983 civil rights wrongful death lawsuit on behalf of Daevon’s family,” he said.
In March after a petition circulated calling for answers and police reform, Sheriff Tom Spangler expressed regret at the lack of body cameras but defended the actions of deputies.
Spangler announced at a community meeting that he directed his SWAT team members to begin using body cameras after discovering they were not equipped with them during the raid.
“They did not have cameras. I wish they had, but they didn’t and that’s it. But, with that said, they are already in place now,” he  said.
Crump also attributed the circumstances surrounding delivery of the warrant to racial bias.
“This was a kid with no criminal history,” said Crump. “And we are talking about an alleged social media post about marijuana. Can you imagine if they started kicking in everyone’s door in violation of the fourth amendment because of marijuana?
“Sadly this only seems to happen to Black people in this country,” he said.










David Batts needed help. It’s troubling so many times when a Black person in America is having a medical crisis or mental health crisis, it is not treated as a medical issue. 


– Ben Crump


Five days after Saint-Germain’s death, 46-year-old David Batts died on Jan. 8 following a violent encounter with law enforcement at the Roger D. Wilson Detention Facility. Batts was arrested the day before after causing an alleged disturbance at the Knoxville Area Transit center and was initially taken to the University of Tennessee Medical Center. There, he was accused of assaulting two nurses, which led to his transfer to the county jail.
Within minutes of his arrival at the facility, deputies attempted to force Batts to change into a jail uniform. When he did not comply, officers pepper-sprayed him, used a Taser on him four times, and struck him repeatedly. The blows to his face were so severe that family members later said he was nearly unrecognizable. Batts was found unresponsive the next day and later pronounced dead at the hospital.
Crump said that Batts was in need of care, not violence.
”David Batts needed help. It’s troubling so many times when a Black person in America is having a medical crisis or mental health crisis, it is not treated as a medical issue,” he said. “It is treated as a criminal issue, and it is met with excessive force and brutality.”
According to the KCSO, Batts was non compliant, which prompted officers to use force. Body camera footage released by the sheriff’s office shows Batts struggling to follow commands during attempts to check his vital signs. Batts was taken back to UTMC where he died in the hospital.
The Knox County District Attorney’s Office reviewed the incident and concluded that Batts’ death was caused by meningitis, not by the actions of law enforcement officers. 
“Based on my review of the body camera footage and the Medical Examiner’s preliminary findings, I have concluded that the officers involved responded to Mr. Batts’ assaultive and resistive behavior with appropriate force under the circumstances,” District Attorney Charme Allen wrote in a statement.
Crump, along with co-counsel Troy Jones, a Knoxville lawyer, said the legal team will file dual suits — one for medical malpractice against the University of Tennessee Medical Center and a federal civil rights wrongful death suit against the Knox County Sheriff’s Department.
Crump also urged Knoxville community members to stay vigilant and continue raising awareness about the deaths of Batts and Saint-Germain. He acknowledged the challenge of mobilizing in a city where only 17 percent of the population is African American, but emphasized that justice requires persistence even without overwhelming numbers. 
“I believe when you have truth on your side, you have a moral majority,” he said. “And so I want the community to remain engaged and have the same convictions they have with all these other cases across the country.”
Crump has represented families of other men and women who died following altercations with law enforcement, including Taylor, Tyre Nichols of Memphis and George Floyd, the Minnesota man whose killing launched nationwide protests in 2020.

(Courtesy of Big Sioux River Project)SIOUX FALLS – Keeping cattle waste out of the river that runs through the state’s largest city will cost about $11 million over the next five years, and the city will pay more than half the price.
One of the designers of the water quality program that money pays for, however, told an audience in Sioux Falls that past investments have paid off.
The Big Sioux River is polluted with dissolved soils, agricultural chemicals and livestock waste beyond levels safe for uses like fishing and swimming. City, federal and state money has been used for a little over a decade to pay landowners to leave strips of tallgrass or other vegetation in the land along the banks of a river or a tributary. The root systems in those buffer strips catch and filter out pollutants before they enter the water, and also prevent erosion.

During Thursday’s Big Sioux Stewardship Summit, program developer Barry Berg,  said his team and partners have enrolled over 100 stream miles into their buffer strip program since its inception.
“We finally reached the century mark with the program,” he said during a morning presentation.
The enrolled areas now total more than 4,000 acres, with an additional 250 to 300 slated for enrollment this spring, Berg said.
Under the primary model of the program, livestock are blocked from bank access from April through September. Farmers are allowed to cut the grass for hay after June 15. The idea is to keep cattle out of streams during hot summer months when they’re most likely to wade in and defecate, spiking E. coli levels.
Berg said advancing the program is an arduous process that involves enrolling landowners in conservation agreements, coordinating federal and state funding streams, and adapting grazing and haying practices to better protect streambanks and riparian vegetation.
A focal point of the effort is Skunk Creek, which flows about 70 miles from Brant Lake into the Big Sioux River near Sioux Falls. Skunk Creek now contributes over half of the water that flows over the falls at Falls Park and through the city, due to a diversion upstream on the Big Sioux near the airport.
Skunk Creek historically carries a lot of E. coli into the river. But today, he said 44% of its banks in the program’s footprint and 48% of adjacent pastureland acres have been enrolled. And that’s making a big difference, he said. It’s possible, he said, for the state’s integrated water quality report to take Skunk Creek off its list of impaired water bodies if the program keeps its momentum.
“Back in 2013 and 2014, we had samples on Skunk Creek with 50 to 70% exceeding standards,” for permissible E. coli and suspended solids, he said. “Now we’re down around 10 to 11% exceeding. If we get down below 10 and hold that for two years in the integrated report, they’re gonna say, ‘Hey, we’re passing. Skunk Creek is no longer impaired.’”

For Skunk Creek, “no longer impaired” would mean its waters would be safe for non-immersion recreational activities like kayaking or canoeing. Because it feeds the Big Sioux, that would move the river’s water quality within city limits closer to what advocates want: a swimmable river.
80% of tested surface water in South Dakota fails to meet state standards

Participating farmers see financial benefits, Berg added. He described working with one landowner to calculate returns on haying the buffer land. The landowner made more through incentive payments and hay than he would have by planting corn or soybeans.
When the last five-year phase of the project wraps up this summer, the water quality investments will have supported 16 watering stations, over 4,000 feet of fencing, 12,000 feet of pipe, and four barns, built with manure-trapping pits beneath them. Additionally, the final phase also saw over 1,000 acres of cover crop planted and 900 more acres enrolled in the buffer program. 
The next five years will continue that work, with $11 million already earmarked. That includes about $5.8 million from Sioux Falls, $3.2 million in federal grants and funding, $1.4 million in local cash and donations, $465,000 from Dell Rapids, and $263,000 from the East Dakota Water Development District. 
Berg said his long-term goal is to enroll 75% of Skunk Creek’s streambanks.
“If we can get there, I believe we’ll see it delisted for E. coli,” he said. “We’re already close.”
Travis Entenmann, director of Friends of the Big Sioux River, said the effort is not only about compliance and conservation, but the city’s future. A clean river, he said, is one that people can use.
“It’s a huge opportunity for us for tourism,” he said. “The idea that it could be 90 degrees outside and there’s not families recreating in the river; it is kind of sad. And we should want better.”
A voluntary, incentive-based approach is how the state primarily tries to tackle the issue of E. Coli contamination in its waters, but he said more could be done. 
“The three things that I believe will clean our river are regulation, enforcement of regulation, and land use change,” he later said.

Gret Hertz, R-Polson, wears a money jacket on the Senate floor  during the debate on House Bill 2 ""because we're giving away money.""Taking barely three hours on the Senate floor, the framework to appropriate more than $16.6 billion for Montanan’s biennial budget received a stamp of approval from legislators in the upper chamber on Thursday. 
That isn’t to say House Bill 2 passed smoothly. 
Democrats, and a coalition of nine moderate Republicans — who have worked to carry many of Gov. Greg Gianforte’s proposals through the legislature, to the consternation of their GOP peers — held together on almost every vote taken to amend the budget, including passing the final package 27-23. 
But more conservative members of the Republican caucus, which on paper is the majority party in the Senate, decried the budget as bloated and accused lawmakers of prioritizing politics over good policy. 
“We have a general fund budget that has grown by 17%. I feel sorry for those of you who will be coming back in future years,” said Sen. Greg Hertz, R-Polson, wearing a jacket and tie emblazoned with hundred dollar bills. “There are now 27 of you who have decided to push this budget through, and it’s a big number. So now you’re going to have to make some tough choices on the floor.”
Sen. Carl Glimm, R-Kila, chairman of the Senate Finance and Claims Committee, called the budget the “biggest one we’ve seen in recent memory,” excluding the last two biennia that were bolstered by federal COVID funding. 
The total appropriation in House Bill 2, which includes operations for the state government but excludes statutory appropriations, like hunting license fees going to game programs, is $16.6 billion for the next two years. The budget bill also excludes individual appropriation bills. 
Of that, Health and Human Services comprises 44% — or $7.3 billion — for the 2026 and 2027 fiscal years. Education accounts for $3.5 billion; transportation and natural resources makes up $2.9 billion; general government expenditures $1.6 billion and the judicial branch, law enforcement and justice accounts for $1.2 billion. 
“In the end it’s not perfect. It’s not exactly what we would probably draw up,” Senate Minority Leader Pat Flowers, D-Belgrade, told the Daily Montanan after the vote. “But as I said on the floor, we felt like it was a good compromise. We didn’t get everything we wanted, but we got some important things that we think will allow us to provide what we think are the services that Montanans want.”
While the budget took the House an entire day to go through each section, debating amendments to add or subtract funds from various departments and programs, the Senate kept discussion to less than three hours.

Twenty-two amendments were proposed, a majority by the chamber’s most fiscally conservative members, but only four passed — three brought by Democrats and one by Fort Benton Republican Sen. Josh Kassmier, who has emerged as a leader among the moderate Republicans. 
One amendment that passed, brought by Sen. Ellie Boldman, cut $35 million of spending authority from the state hospital to contract with traveling nurses. 
The Department of Public Health and Human Services spent $71 million for traveling healthcare staff at the state hospital during the current biennium, according to Boldman, a Missoula Democrat. However, the department has recently begun hiring state employees — a nurse a week — according to Boldman, saving a large portion of their budget. 
“This amendment reduces contract labor, supports the state continuing to do what we asked them to do, and hire state nurses at the hospital,” Boldman said. 
But Glimm pushed back, telling his colleagues that passing the amendment would leave patients in the state hospital without nurses. 
“The reason we haven’t hired state employee nurses is because we can’t get them. That’s why we hire traveling nurses at a much higher rate,” Glimm said. “… if you guys want to have not any nurses working there, I mean, a third of the staff, and you want them all to work triple over time and be worn out and burned out, and feel underappreciated, because we can’t supplement them?”
Another amendment  by Sen. Shane Morigeau, another Missoula Democrat, added $1.7 million back into the budget for the existing pretrial diversion program through the state Supreme Court. An amendment by Sen. Janet Ellis, D-Helena, slightly reduced appropriations for community college assistance programs.  
A majority of proposed amendments that were dismissed by the body aimed to shrink the budget — making cuts to Department of Labor programs, decreasing provider rates, after-school program funding, and reducing numerous budgeted positions across various departments.
Republican Senate President Matt Regier proposed an amendment to eliminate two of seven newly budgeted game warden positions at the Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks. 
“As an avid hunter and outdoorsmen, I know hunters are very ethical. I’d rather have our money going into decreasing my license, my tags, not out policing more,” Regier said. 
Flowers, who worked for FWP for much of his career, said the department’s enforcement division had been flat for a long time while the state’s population had only seen growth. 
“These workers are an important piece of the department’s effort to not only enforce the rules that are out there, but also they act as a liaison with sportsmen and women every day, They act as a liaison … so trying to maintain good relationships between landowners, outfitters, sportsmen, really falls on these warden positions,” Flowers said.
Senate Majority Leader Tom McGillvray, R-Billings, said he had a number of bad experiences being “harassed” by game wardens, raising his voice as he shared personal anecdotes. 
“We may need seven more game wardens, but the message from me today is don’t harass me. I’m tired of it,” McGillvray said, recommending game wardens receive more sensitivity training in the future. 
  A series of amendments, mostly aimed at reducing the state budget, failed in the Senate on April 17.
The debate over the game warden amendment failed 23-27, the same margin as roughly half the failed amendments. 
One more lopsided amendment, which failed in a 21-29 vote with just three Republicans joining Democrats, would have changed the funding authority for the current contract with CoreCivic to house 600 inmates in out-of-state facilities to be one-time-only, as opposed to ongoing funding. 
Frustrations with the way the floor debates kept going were evident throughout the morning. 
During discussion on the final funding package, Sen. John Esp, R-Big Timber, often referred to as the Dean of the Montana Senate, said the body had become more flawed over his lengthy tenure, devolving into short-term thinkers focused on sound bites for the next press conference. 
“Sadly, this is what Montana politics has morphed into. I’ve been in the majority and I’ve been in the minority, and I can tell you that most of those years, all things being equal, good policy initiatives were supported no matter who was in charge or who brought the idea forward,” Esp said. “In about three months, well, maybe even three days, nobody can remember what we talked about here on this board today, nothing.”
Glimm agreed with the sentiments, saying the bill’s outcome was predetermined by the Senate’s working majority coalition. 
“I would like nothing better than to have a good, honest debate and really dig in and see what the priorities of each step along the way were, because that’s how it’s supposed to work. But the reason it went so fast in Senate Finance and Claims and here on the floor too, is because the cake is baked,” Glimm said. “… that happened on day one.”
In the middle of the budget debate, Gov. Greg Gianforte held a press conference where he briefly spoke about the work being done in the Senate and the need to enact a balanced budget that limits spending.
“Our budget that we proposed — the path to security and prosperity — does that. It kept spending growth under the rate of inflation without growing the size of government. But as our budget has made it through the legislative process, it’s grown,” Gianforte said. “While I respect the role of the legislature, I reiterate we must pass a responsible budget in line with Montana’s priorities.”
Gianforte said that while the Constitution requires the state to have a balanced budget, he would “use the tools we have,” to ensure it doesn’t grow the government too much. 
Montana’s governor has the power to line-item veto items in an appropriations bill — he can sign the entire budget into law, but strike out specific parts he disagrees with. 
But Glimm, the Senate Finance chairman, said the budget was already too big when the governor proposed it, and the Legislature was skirting its authority by not reigning in that spending — setting up a conflict with the governor’s office. He said he’s voted for every budget bill in his six previous sessions in the Legislature, “but I can’t do it this time.”
“We’re passing everything under the sun, and I imagine that the governor is going to veto his way to a balanced budget,” Glimm said. “He’s going to veto that, and then he’s going to say, ‘Look at the crummy job that the legislature did. They passed all this stuff, and they sent it to me and I had to be the fiscally responsible one.’” 
Regier, a self-described “appropriations nerd,” told his Senate colleagues that he had grave concerns over the budget and the future of the state’s finances. The Legislative Fiscal Division initially had projected the state would have an ending fund surplus of $522 million.

“Look at where we’re out now, on the graph. Right there, the big headline, negative $500 million. We have spent it all over twice.” Regier said. “And just as it’s been said here before, we’re not done here making decisions.”
With tax policy decisions still coming up, Regier said he hoped the Senate would be able to prioritize offering relief for Montanans, rather than focusing on spending. 
Regier referenced Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who visited the state earlier in the session and said he’d directed the Florida legislature that they couldn’t spend a dollar more than the previous session. 
“That would be amazing for my constituents that are paying for all of this,” Regier said. “… In 2026, the lines cross and we go into the red. That’s not sustainable.”
“And with that, happy voting.”

March 3, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — A legislative committee failed to advance a bill Thursday meant to help implement and regulate medical cannabis in Nebraska, leaving the sponsor and advocates on the hunt for a new path forward.
The General Affairs Committee stalled, voting 5-3 against advancing Legislative Bill 677 from State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair. Senators tried to advance the bill as-is after none of the eight members entertained a motion on whether to amend the bill during continuing negotiations on how best to implement the overwhelming voter approval of medical cannabis in November.
Hansen, after the vote, described his legislation as “a must” for 2025 to prevent the “Wild West.” That’s because without legislative action, the regulatory commission voters created with the ballot measure has no effective power or funds to regulate medical cannabis.

There is still “some room” to come together, Hansen said, though the “clock is ticking.” 
“I don’t want to shut all the doors right now, but some doors are closing, and they’re closing fast, and so we have to act,” Hansen told reporters.
The lead spokesperson for Nebraskans for Medical Marijuana also said the fight isn’t over.
Regulatory commission
Unless the committee reconsiders, Hansen faces a tough path to getting LB 677 into law, though the legislative rules do provide a path. He can file a motion — requiring at least 25 votes — to pull the bill out of committee. That would require scheduling by Speaker John Arch of La Vista, who has opposed medical cannabis in the past.
The bill would then need to advance across three rounds of debate and pass with at least 33 senators, regardless of a filibuster, because it amends legal language voters approved.
Ballot measures are self-enacting, and Nebraskans have legally been able to acquire up to 5 ounces of medical cannabis with a written health care practitioner’s recommendation since mid-December, when Gov. Jim Pillen formally proclaimed the success of the measures and ushered the voter-approved language into law.

Hansen’s bill, which has the support of organizers of the 2024 medical cannabis campaign, would further expand the structure for regulating cannabis through the new Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission.
Without state funds, officials have said it is nearly impossible for the commission to act or craft regulations, as required, by July 1. Hansen’s bill would push back the deadline for regulations and licensing for more time to act.
The proposed committee amendment
The amendment that members of the General Affairs Committee negotiated with Hansen would additionally regulate cannabis through the state system’s prescription drug monitoring system in addition to seed-to-sale tracking systems, according to a copy obtained by the Nebraska Examiner.
Acceptable forms of cannabis would include edibles, concentrates, ointments, transdermal patches or creams, nebulizers and vaporizer cartridges or pens. However, smoking would be prohibited, and no cannabis flower or bud could be legally sold.
State Sen. Bob Andersen of north-central Sarpy County said he completely disagreed with allowing vaping, pointing to increased youth drug use.
A qualified “health care practitioner” would include only licensed physicians, osteopathic physicians, physician assistants or nurse practitioners, and practitioners could not recommend cannabis unless they have treated the individual for at least six months or if the physician primarily practices in Nebraska.

The committee amendment also would have limited “qualifying medical conditions” to 15 ailments:

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
Autism with frequent self-injurious or aggressive behavior.
Cancer.
Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis.
Epilepsy or epileptic seizures.
Hepatitis C that causes moderate to severe nausea or cachexia.
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).
Huntington’s disease.
Parkinson’s disease.
Spinal cord injury or disease with residual neurologic deficits.
Terminal illness with a probable life expectancy of under one year.
Tourette’s syndrome.
A serious medical condition or related treatment that causes severe nausea or cachexia.
Severe and persistent muscle spasms caused by multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury or muscular dystrophy.
Severe or chronic pain lasting longer than six months that is not adequately managed, in the opinion of a health care practitioner, despite treatment attempts using either conventional medications other than opioids or opiates or physical interventions.

The amendment also would explicitly allow the Medical Cannabis Commission and Nebraska Liquor Control Commission, which consist of the same three commissioners, to share resources in carrying out the respective laws.
The governor would be able to appoint two additional members to the Medical Cannabis Commission, one of whom would need to be a health care practitioner. The governor already appoints the three members of the Liquor Control Commission, bringing the allowable total to five commissioners.
State Sen. Stan Clouse of Kearney said he wanted to allow the governor to appoint up to two more outside members, such as law enforcement or supply chain representatives.
Ongoing litigation
State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha, committee vice chair, said he wanted to ensure the physician appointee had human medical experience and wasn’t, for example, a veterinarian. Pillen is a veterinarian, as is John Kuehn, a former state senator and one of the chief opponents to the medical cannabis laws. 
Kuehn has filed two lawsuits seeking to void the provisions, the first of which the Nebraska Attorney General’s Office joined and that the Attorney General’s Office and Kuehn lost. Kuehn is appealing to the Nebraska Supreme Court. The second is ongoing in Lancaster County District Court.

Cavanaugh said he generally is against creating an ailments list but that the identified conditions were “relatively reasonable,” though he wants post-traumatic stress disorder included.
Holdcroft said the list was created with input from the Nebraska Medical Association, including work led by former State Sen. Anna Wishart of Lincoln, who championed medical cannabis and was part of the past three ballot measures. Holdcroft said the association was strongly against allowing marijuana for PTSD.
On the ongoing litigation, Cavanaugh, a lawyer, said Attorney General Mike Hilgers and his office are giving advice to senators in ways that benefit the ongoing litigation.
“In this case, the attorney general is not representing the interests of the Legislature,” Cavanaugh told reporters. “He’s representing the interests of his office and I think this political agenda that he has continued to pursue before he was attorney general against the legalization of medical cannabis.”
‘Do it the right way’
State Sen. Jared Storm of David City, who has agreed with Hilgers and U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., to wait on any related medical cannabis legislation, repeatedly said during the Thursday committee meeting that Hilgers needed his day in court in front of the Supreme Court.
Storm brought his own bill, LB 483, to limit allowable cannabis to 300 milligrams — 0.21% of 5 ounces — and only allow oils or tinctures as acceptable uses.

Cavanaugh and State Sen. Rick Holdcroft of Bellevue, the committee chair, pushed back on Storm and said that the legal process had already played out once at the district court level, and Hilgers lost. Secretary of State Bob Evnen also placed the measures on the ballot, Holdcroft noted, and then voters weighed in. The AG’s Office has threatened to sue if the cannabis commission begins licensing.
Holdcroft acknowledged that should lawmakers pass LB 677, it might end the pending appeal to the Nebraska Supreme Court.
Speaking with the Nebraska Examiner, Storm said waiting just a little while could put the legal questions “to bed.” The Legislature is set to adjourn in June, possibly delaying action until early 2026, which could push any regulations more than a year down the road.
Storm told his colleagues that the ongoing lawsuits aren’t Hilgers against the cannabis industry but the AG acting on behalf of the state. Holdcroft and Cavanaugh said voters had spoken.
“I’m all for helping people, and if this ballot initiative comes out that it’s valid and accurate, then I’m all for moving forward to where we can help people,” Storm said. “But I want to do it the right way.”

‘I don’t see a way ahead’
Hansen said, “next session is not it,” and that lawmakers have the chance to act now.
Holdcroft, who opposed advancing LB 677 as is, said he, too, was a “little disappointed” after the work to craft a committee amendment fell short. He said he felt the divide came down on smoking as a “line in the sand,” while Hansen said he felt the flower and bud restriction was the breaking point.
Holdcroft said selling cannabis flower would be a gateway toward recreational marijuana, which Hansen heavily disputed. He has regularly said his bill has nothing to do with recreational marijuana.
“Right now, I don’t see a way ahead,” Holdcroft told the Examiner.
Holdcroft said he hasn’t heard anything of a pull motion yet, but he envisioned there could be a lot of pushback from conservatives in the Legislature. Hansen, who has often taken a Libertarian bent in the Legislature, is a Republican, as is Holdcroft.

‘It’s not over’
Crista Eggers, executive director of Nebraskans for Medical Marijuana, told reporters that the campaign and supporters are no strangers to roadblocks, challenges and “doors shut in our face.” 
Still, she remains confident in crafting the safest and best medical cannabis program and said voters knew what they were voting on.
“This will not be the end,” she said.
To supporters, Eggers said she wants them to know that despite the hiccup, which both she and Hansen thought could be the outcome, “we have every intention to keep fighting.”
“Giving up has never been an option. Being silenced has never been an option,” Eggers said. “It’s not over. It’s not done.”

This story was originally published by The Appeal.
As U.S. homelessness rates reach record highs, President Donald Trump has pledged to ban street camping, relocate unhoused people to privately-managed “tent cities,” and arrest anyone caught violating the new laws.
But while Trump’s threats certainly sound draconian, they’re not exactly novel. In recent years, several states have organized increasingly harsh homeless sweeps — perhaps most typified by Louisiana, where the governor recently oversaw a possible model for the sort of mass relocation that Trump has promised.
Federal officials seem to be taking note. According to a local official who spoke to The Appeal, in early February, Homeland Security Director Kristi Noem quietly visited a warehouse where Gov. Jeff Landry had relocated nearly 200 homeless people, sometimes under threat of arrest. And in March, Trump appointed Madison Sheahan, a state official whose agency enforced Landry’s crackdown, to become deputy director for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) did not respond to a request for comment.
Sheahan, who is 28, was appointed secretary of the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries (LDWF) by Landry in 2023, though she had no background in conservation or ecology. She previously worked on Noem’s campaign for South Dakota governor and was executive director of the Republican Party there, where she worked on banning trans athletes from college sports. Otherwise, her qualifications are questionable: besides issuing rules for sawfish harvesting and letting military veterans hunt bears, Sheahan’s most relevant experience over the last year seems to be lending her officers to Landry to round up homeless residents.



Attorneys for the unhoused have now filed a class action suit against the state — including Sheahan’s LDWF — to block Landry’s crackdown. As the case unfolds in New Orleans’ civil district court, Louisiana’s situation could serve as a bellwether for how Trump 2.0 will address unsheltered homelessness—and even the detention of migrants.
Jesse Rabinowitz, communications director for the National Homelessness Law Center, called Sheahan’s promotion “really concerning.” He added that what’s happening in New Orleans is “a real-life example of what could happen on a larger scale.”
The sweeps by Louisiana state agencies are part of “how conservative electives can punish people living in more progressive parts of the state,” warned Rabinowitz. “They did it with migrants, and they’ve said they’re going to do it with homeless folks. And we have to believe them.”

Louisiana’s crackdown began during singer Taylor Swift’s October tour dates in New Orleans. In the days leading up to the concerts, Landry directed Louisiana State Police (LSP) and LDWF officers to “sweep” downtown encampments of hundreds of unhoused people, pushing them all into one designated area a few blocks away. The sweeps drew national attention.
City council members and Mayor LaToya Cantrell condemned Landry’s actions. One council member’s chief of staff later said in an affidavit that, when she visited the government-run encampment, “one gentleman asked me where he could get a tent,” because state officers had thrown his away.
As a result, she said, “he got bitten by rats the night before because he did not have a tent to go inside.”
Lawyers representing unhoused people swiftly sued. But the ensuing court battle took a worrying turn in January, when the Louisiana Supreme Court ruled that cities cannot abridge the state’s police power. LSP can now conduct sweeps without following city ordinances, meaning they don’t have to provide sufficient warning beforehand. That ruling could signal to other red states that courts will let them send state agencies into blue cities, such as Austin or Nashville, and ignore any municipal-level protections in place.
A week after that ruling, LSP and DWF officers again descended on downtown New Orleans’ encampments. This time, they sent more than 100 people to a warehouse seven miles away called the “Transition Center.” Attorneys for the unhoused demanded another restraining order, but courts denied the request.
“Governor Landry’s interest in moving the encampments was to provide warm shelter and a place for the unhoused to be secure from potential harm during the Super Bowl and Mardi Gras,” a judge wrote.

The Transition Center sat in a former packaging warehouse alongside New Orleans’ industrial canal. While the press was not allowed in, photos shared from within the Center show rows of cots separated by black cloths, and some couches facing a television, in a warehouse with no eye-level windows. Residents reportedly received three meals daily and could leave freely, though neither a bus stop nor sidewalk sits near the site. Access was restricted to those with authorization.
Several service organizations worked in the warehouse. After initial difficulties, some employees say the remaining residents were satisfied with conditions. A medical worker told The Appeal he appreciated seeing patients consistently, and “we were able to get people healthier than when they arrived.”
Now that those events have finished, the warehouse has closed.


SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE

After the initial October sweeps, a judge ordered LSP and LDWF to “not destroy or dispose of the property of unhoused people without judicial process” and to provide notice of sweeps as set out in New Orleans’ municipal ordinances.
But the New Year’s Day truck attack that killed 14 people in New Orleans, including a sleeping unhoused person, seems to have changed the calculus. Within hours, Landry issued an executive ordergiving him emergency powers to “direct and compel the evacuation of all or part of the population, from any stricken or threatened area.” The following week, the Louisiana Supreme Court dissolved the preliminary injunction. One justice wrote that, in the wake of the Jan. 1 attack, the sweeps were “about public safety.”
Court affidavits show how the case has already emboldened police to criminalize people experiencing homelessness.
According to the lawsuit, 12 LDWF officers and “five or six” LSP troopers approached 32-year-old plaintiff Raymond Scott when the major sweeps began in January. Scott is unhoused and has already lost valuables during sweeps. Last summer, a city worker reached into his tent and took a treasured owl figurine Scott inherited from his great-grandmother, then disposed of it even as Scott “begged them not to take it,” according to a court affidavit he later filed.
“You have two choices,” a trooper said. “Come willingly, or we cuff you, detain you, and bring you to the Transition Center.”
Scott said he didn’t want to go.
“You know you can be arrested for being homeless now?” a trooper allegedly replied. Scott then said he wanted to call his lawyer.
Scott’s attorneys argue that the US Supreme Court’s 2024 ruling in Grants Pass v. Johnson does not permit Landry’s sweeps, since Grants Pass concerned whether arresting people for sleeping outside violates the 8th Amendment’s protections against cruel and unusual punishments. In this case, the attorneys allege Louisiana violated unhoused residents’ 4th and 14th Amendment rights.
Another resident, Michael Garner, asserts in the suit that seven or eight LSP troopers approached his camp and told him to pack up. When he asked if he could leave, a trooper said he was being detained.
“The troopers told me that I would not be free to leave until I was brought to the Transition Center,” Garner wrote. He says he packed everything he owned into a box and got on the bus. When he later tried to fetch his belongings — including his social security card, birth certificate, and a bicycle —“officials told me that they could not find the box.”
Last week, attorneys filed a motion to dismiss the suit voluntarily. The legal team declined to comment on that request, as the motion is pending.
Sheahan, who’s set to begin her role at ICE in the coming weeks, ran the LDWF when its officers conducted the sweeps. In a March 11 Fraternal Order of Police statement celebrating her promotion, Patrick Yoes, National President of the FOP, celebrated that she’d “established a Special Operations Group within the enforcement division” for events like the Super Bowl. According to a November Facebook post, state police officers trained LDWF’s new special-ops team. Sheahan also joined Landry and DHS Secretary Noem for a briefing on Super Bowl security measures when Noem visited in February.
LDWF agents typically enforce hunting, fishing, and boating regulations. An LDWF spokesperson did not answer questions about why the agency took part in homeless sweeps.



Advocates have decried the sweeps and “transition center” as both cruel and ineffective. But at the state level, officials have celebrated their success.
“We think this is absolutely going to be looked at as a success, because we were able to get people out of harm’s way just weeks after a terror attack in that same area,” a spokesperson for the Louisiana Governor’s Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness (GOHSEP) told The Appeal. The state closed the Transition Center on March 21.

The spokesperson said that, from a peak of 183 people, 108, or about 60 percent, received permanent housing by the time the center closed.
An additional 59 people left on their own, while 15 others moved into a different shelter downtown. The center’s final costs could exceed $17.5 million.
But some housing advocates say the sweeps undermined the city-level housing efforts that have been ongoing since 2023. Those programs have housed more than 822 people at a much lower cost per person. Critics also say the warehouse sweeps disrupted contact between unhoused people and their case workers and service providers. The National Homelessness Law Center’s Rabinowitz stressed that the only real fix is affordable housing.
“There’s consensus that housing solves homelessness, and throwing people in jail and forcing homeless people into camps is not the solution,” he said. “But the people that are put in charge don’t seem to be motivated by helping people. They seem to be motivated by this desire to police and punish people for struggling in a country where a lot of people are struggling to make ends meet.”

Montana Health officials have announced five confirmed cases of measles in Gallatin County.
The Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services along with the Gallatin City-County Health Department in Bozeman confirmed its the first instance of the highly infectious disease since 1990.
The individuals are children and adults who were exposed to measles while traveling outside of Montana. The cases reside in Gallatin County and are currently isolated at home. All five individuals are unvaccinated, or vaccine status is unknown.
The Gallatin City-County Health Department continues to assess any potential exposures while the individuals were contagious and are contacting the people who may have been exposed, commonly referred to as “contact tracing.” People potentially exposed are being provided with information about the exposure date and disease symptoms to watch out for.
The Gallatin health department has determined that there are points of exposure to the general public. Potential exposures to the public can be found on the GCCHD website and will be updated as needed or as more information becomes available. The spread of measles can occur before people know they have the disease, and before any rash appears. The times listed on the website include the period when the exposure occurred and two hours after.
Individuals who are immune to measles through vaccination, laboratory evidence of immunity, laboratory confirmation of disease, or were born before 1957 are not considered at risk for infection. Individuals without prior measles infection or vaccination have a 90% likelihood of contracting the disease if exposed.
“While it is unfortunate to have cases of measles after 35 years of disease inactivity in Montana, we have been working diligently with our local partners to prepare,” said DPHHS Public Health Physician Dr. Maggie Cook-Shimanek. “We are confident that our public health and clinical partners will work together and address this situation as quickly as possible. It is important for everyone to know their vaccination status and to visit with their health department or health care provider if they are unsure.”

If you are unsure of your vaccination status, here are a few places you can review:

Call your old high school, college, or university and ask if they have vaccination records.
Contact your doctor’s office, urgent care, or pediatrician. Even if you have not been there in years, they may still have records.
Reach out to the health department where you grew up.
Check your home state immunization registries.

Measles is a highly infectious airborne disease that typically begins with a fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes, white spots in the mouth and a red rash that appears about 14 days after exposure. The rash usually starts on the face and spreads downward to the rest of the body. It is particularly dangerous for infants for whom vaccination is generally not recommended until 12 months of age. Maintaining a high level of vaccination in the community helps protect infants who are too young to be vaccinated, as well as individuals who cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons.
“Measles is highly contagious and highly preventable with vaccination, and ensuring people are immunized remains our best defense. If people are unable to find their vaccine records, there are no contraindications to receiving an additional dose,” said Dr. Peter Bulger, Gallatin City-County Health Department medical director.
Measles continues to be prevalent in many regions worldwide, resulting in an estimated 300 deaths every day. Cases in the U.S. are generally rare but have been increasing in recent years.
The best way to protect against measles is vaccination. No changes have been made to the existing measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine recommendations in the United States. Two doses of MMR, a measles-containing vaccine that protects against measles, mumps and rubella, are 97 to 99% effective in preventing measles. Measles vaccines have been available in the U.S. since 1963, and two doses have been recommended for children since 1989.
If you are in need of the MMR vaccine, please call your primary care physician as soon as possible.
“We are actively working with individuals who are experiencing symptoms,”said Lori Christenson, Gallatin City-County Health Officer. “We greatly appreciate the cooperation of those involved in helping mitigate further exposures. We encourage anyone who is not vaccinated or unsure of their vaccination history to consider vaccination and to contact your health care provider or GCCHD. By getting vaccinated we protect ourselves and others around us from infection.”
There is no cure for measles once the outbreak has started. It’s a virus and medical professionals treat the symptoms related to the infection.

Senate File 369, sent to Gov. Kim Reynolds, would require Iowa high schools to pass the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services naturalization civics test to graduate, beginning in the 2026-27 school year. Students need to earn at least a 60% to pass, and those who fail will be allowed to take the test as many times as necessary to earn a passing grade.
Similar graduation requirements have been implemented in other states, including Alabama, Arkansas, Idaho, Kentucky and Wisconsin. Reynolds has advocated for Iowa to have a USCIS civics test requirement in previous legislative sessions, but the measure had failed to make it to her desk.

Rep. Bob Henderson, R-Sioux City, floor manager for the bill, said the measure ensures that young people have a minimum standard of knowledge about the U.S. government as they become old enough to vote and participate in the country’s government system.
“Fundamental to the process of running our government is a good knowledge of the framework of our government,” Henderson said. “We require that someone who’s transferring their citizenship from another country to ours offer proof that they know a bit about that framework, after which they are given the privilege of being able to have a say in our country’s government. Why would we not have at least the same requirement of the proof of the knowledge of that framework for someone who now is poised to enter that same responsibility, simply because they have lived to a certain age?”
There were several amendments filed on the measure. Rep. Chad Ingels, R-Randalia, proposed increasing the current one-semester requirement for civics instruction to one year, in an amendment he withdrew. Rep. Elinor Levin, D-Iowa City, proposed an amendment to requiring Iowa legislators take the USCIS naturalization civics test and have results published in the daily journal, and another providing students the option to pursue a civics service project as an alternative to the test — both of which were voted down.
Levin criticized the measure for its emphasis on testing, which she said is not an effective way to make students more civically engaged. Levin, alongside other Democrats, said the bill will place both a new, unfunded mandate on schools and a new hurdle for students seeking to graduate from Iowa high schools.
“This bill is a bad idea,” Levin said. “It doesn’t meet the moment, it doesn’t engage students. Instead, it puts in front of them 100-question multiple choice test that may scare them, because it may stop them from graduating.”
Levin said at a time when Iowa has just returned to pre-pandemic graduation rates, the new requirement could be the deciding factor for whether a student graduates high school or not.
“I’m worried about the kid who’s just planning to graduate high school because their parent had told them that is the one thing they care about, or their grandparents told them that that’s the one thing they care about,” Levin said. “And now they’re going to take the test the first time — let’s say their sophomore year, right after they finished their civics class — and they don’t pass it, they get a 54%. And they say, ‘Well, I can either spend the next three years retaking this dumb thing, or next year, when I turn 17, I could drop out, and say sorry, Mom, the state made it impossible for me to graduate.'”
Henderson said the bill, passed 60-33, should “be thought of as an encouragement to knowledge, not a barrier to graduation.”
“Will the knowledge of the heritage and the history and the framework of our country alone make a good citizen?” Henderson said. “No, but a lack of that knowledge is almost certain to prevent a person from becoming a good contributing citizen. And sadly, there can be found an abundance of examples of that in our current situation.”
House approves fetal development education bill with ban on material from abortion providers
Lawmakers also passed Senate File 175 in a 60-30 vote Thursday. The legislation, passed by the Senate in a 31-13 vote in February, is this year’s version of the “Meet Baby Olivia” bill — though it does not mention the video developed by anti-abortion group Live Action by name. The bill would require students in grades 5 through 12 be shown ultrasound video and computer-generated rendering or animations depicting “the humanity of the unborn child by showing prenatal human development, starting at fertilization” in human growth and development classes. 
Rep. Helena Hayes, R-New Sharon, said the measure is not about abortion, but  “challenges us to see value, beauty and dignity in every stage of human life.”
“It’s not teaching about abortion, it brings humanity into the classroom,” Hayes said. “It allows students to witness human development through high-definition ultrasounds and authentic imagery – we have that technology. … It’s biology, it’s anatomy, it’s science.”
At subcommittee meetings on the bill, critics said it was promoting anti-abortion material in public school classrooms and could lead to the distribution of medically inaccurate information. As the bill was amended by House lawmakers to include a provision banning materials on fetal development to be shown in classrooms from an entity that performs or “promotes” abortion, or that contracts, affiliates, or makes referrals to such organizations, Democrats argued that many reputable medical organizations would be disqualified.
Hayes said this language was included to ensure information on fetal development is coming from sources in line with the requirement in the bill to depict the “humanity” of the fetus.
“Perhaps some of the entities that perform abortions, promote abortion, affiliate, refer, contract with those that do, I would propose that those are antithetical to … the humanity of the unborn child occurs in the womb,” Hayes said.
In a back and forth with Hayes, Rep. Austin Baeth, D-Des Moines, questioned what organizations would be qualify as the “leading professional organizations and agencies with relevant expertise in the field” listed in the bill, the entities identified as being able to decide if information is medically accurate and research-based — requirements for material that can be shown in classrooms.
Hayes mentioned the Mayo Clinic, a health care provider, as one of the potential organizations to be referred to as a leading professional source on this topic. Baeth said his understanding of the amendment language was that material from the Mayo Clinic could not be included in school classrooms on this subject, as the Mayo Clinic performs abortions when necessary to protect the life of the mother.
Though Hayes said the state Board of Education will adopt rules to administer and interpret the language in the bill, she agreed with Baeth that the bill’s language did not include specification on entities that perform elective versus medically necessary abortions.
Baeth said the amendment would functionally ban material from legitimate research organizations that work on issues related to human gestation.
“I find it very hard for anyone reading this amendment — if they’re going to read it by the letter of the law, should this become law, this will ban the use of information coming from our research institutions,” Baeth said. “… You’re asking for research-based information to be provided — that research is done at institutions that have some sort of association with abortions that are at least performed to protect the life of a mother.”
Planned Parenthood Advocates of Iowa criticizing the measure in a Thursday news release as a step to “further politicizing Iowa’s classrooms and youth.”
“Iowans do not want their children used as political pawns, but the people elected to represent them continue to steamroll them with deeply unpopular policies like this that undermine our youth and put their futures at risk,” Gabriela Fuentes, advocacy strategist manager for Planned Parenthood Advocates of Iowa said in a statement. “More than 1,200 Iowans have already spoken out against this bill. It’s time our lawmakers listen. And, make no mistake, Iowans will hold them accountable.”

(Jackie Llanos/Florida Phoenix)Juan Carlos Lopez-Gomez, a 20-year-old U.S. citizen, was being held in the Leon County Jail on Thursday, charged with illegally entering Florida as an “unauthorized alien” — even as a supporter waved his U.S. birth certificate in court.
A Florida Highway Patrol trooper arrested Lopez-Gomez after a traffic stop in which he was a passenger. The 20-year-old is set to remain in jail for the next 48 hours, waiting for federal immigration officials to pick him up despite his first-degree misdemeanor charge being dropped.
His mother, Sebastiana Gomez-Perez, burst into tears at the sight of her son, who appeared virtually for his first hearing at the Leon County Courthouse. She left the courtroom distraught because she could do nothing to help her son, who was born and lives in Grady County, Georgia.
“I wanted to tell them, ‘Where are you going to take him? He is from here,’” his mother told the Phoenix in Spanish moments after exiting the courtroom. “I felt immense helplessness because I couldn’t do anything, and I am desperate to get my son out of there.”
She continued through tears: “It hurts so much. I’m sorry, I can’t.”
A lieutenant working in the Leon County Jail didn’t allow the mother to see Lopez-Gomez on Thursday and told her officials were working with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement on how to proceed. A Phoenix reporter accompanied Gomez-Perez to the jail.
Leon County Judge LaShawn Riggans held Lopez-Gomez’s birth certificate up to the light after community advocate Silvia Alba silently waved the document in the courtroom.
“In looking at it, and feeling it, and holding it up to the light, the court can clearly see the watermark to show that this is indeed an authentic document,” Riggans said.
Based on her inspection of his birth certificate and Social Security card, Riggans said she found no probable cause for the charge. However, the state prosecutor insisted the court lacked jurisdiction over Lopez-Gomez’s release because U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement had formally asked the jail to hold him.
“This court does not have any jurisdiction other than what I’ve already done,” Riggans said.
Riggans said she was very sorry as Lopez-Gomez’s mother left.
 
‘I can’t do anything for their brother’
The 20-year-old’s first language is Tzotzil, a Mayan language, and he took a long pause when he was asked if he wanted to hire a private attorney or obtain a public defender. He lived in Mexico from the time he was 1-year-old until four years ago, when he returned to Georgia, his mother told the Phoenix.
The Homeland Security Investigations Office in Tampa issued the 48-hour ICE detainer on Thursday. An ICE officer whose name and phone number appear in the detainer refused to speak with the Phoenix.
“He hasn’t committed a crime for them to hold him, that’s what I don’t understand. I’m feeling bad because my daughters are asking me how their brother is. It hurts because I can’t do anything for their brother,” she said.
At issue is a recently passed law that a federal judge has temporarily barred the state from enforcing, further calling into question the validity of his arrest, the charge, and detention. Gov. Ron DeSantis signed SB 4-C into law on Feb. 14, and U.S. District Court Judge Kathleen Williams blocked its enforcement on April 4.
The law makes it a misdemeanor for undocumented immigrants over age 18 to “knowingly” enter Florida “after entering the United States by eluding or avoiding examination or inspection by immigration officers.”
Two other men who were in the car with Lopez-Gomez, the driver and another passenger, also had their first appearances on the same charges on Thursday. The driver was also charged with driving without a license.
The state trooper pulled over the car Lopez-Gomez was in because the driver was going 78 mph in a 65 mph zone, according to the arrest report. Lopez-Gomez gave his Georgia state ID to the trooper, who wrote in his report that Lopez-Gomez said he was in the country illegally.
Wednesday marked the second time Lopez-Gomez has been arrested. The Grady County Sheriff’s office took him into custody on Sunday and charged him with driving under the influence, his mother said. ICE also requested that the Georgia jail hold Lopez-Gomez, but he won release after his family showed officials his birth certificate and Social Security card, Gomez-Perez said.
Thomas Kennedy, a policy analyst for the Florida Immigrant Coalition, met Gomez-Perez at the courthouse. He said Lopez-Gomez’s case is exactly what his organization has been warning lawmakers would happen.
“It was just really sad seeing the mother distraught over her son, and the fact that she acknowledged that this is very likely a case of racial profiling against a U.S. citizen who can’t speak English,” he said in a phone interview with the Phoenix.

April 10, 2025 | ScreenshotMegan Cavanagh is now officially the chief justice of the Michigan Supreme Court.
One day after former Chief Justice Elizabeth Clement’s departure, on Tuesday, Chief Justice Cavanagh began her tenure heading up the state’s highest court.
Clement announced in February that she was leaving the court no later than April 30 to become president of the Virginia-based National Center for State Courts, a nonprofit that provides assistance and resources to courts both nationally and around the world.
Cavanagh, who was selected by her fellow jurists last month to take over the role, was first elected to the Michigan Supreme Court in 2018 after being nominated by the Democratic Party. She serves as the court’s liaison on child welfare issues, tribal courts and as chair of the Commission on Well-Being in the Law among her other administrative responsibilities. Cavanagh previously served as co-lead on the Child Protective Legal Representation Task Force.
Clement’s departure will give Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, the opportunity to appoint someone to fill the remainder of the term, which runs through 2026.
Although state Supreme Court candidates appear on the nonpartisan section of the ballot, state parties nominate candidates to run for the position. 
Clement was appointed by former Gov. Rick Snyder, a Republican, in November 2017 and ran for a full eight-year term after being nominated by Republicans in 2018. 
Her departure will shift the court from a 5-2 Democratic-nominated majority to a 6-1 majority, with Justice Brian Zahra as the lone Republican-nominated jurist on the court. His term runs through 2030, at which point he will be 70 and ineligible to run again.
It’s not known when Whitmer will announce her pick to succeed Clement, but until she does the court will operate with just six justices.

Michelle Axtman, R-Bismarck, speaks on the Senate floor on April 17, 2025. (Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)The North Dakota Senate approved a bill Thursday establishing Education Savings Accounts for private school students, but details are likely to be worked out by a conference committee.
The Senate voted 27-20 in favor of an amended version of House Bill 1540, which would provide vouchers for families to use for private school tuition or other qualifying education expenses. The accounts would not be available to public school or homeschooled students.
The amount each family could receive varies based on household income. Students from families in the lowest income category could receive about $4,000 per year, while students from the highest income category could receive a little over $1,000 per year. 
Families with high incomes would qualify for vouchers in the version of the bill senators advanced. A previous version of the bill limited the vouchers to families who fall within 400% of the federal poverty level, which is an annual income of $128,600 for a family of four.
The Education Saving Accounts would be available for students for the 2026-27 school year. 
Sen. Michelle Axtman, R-Bismarck, who introduced the amendment, estimated the program would cost about $20 million per school year. The exact cost to the state would depend on how many students use the accounts.
Bills look to expand North Dakota student opportunities through savings accounts

Sen. Mike Wobbema, R-Valley City, was among those who spoke in favor of Education Savings Accounts. 
“We need to recognize that taxpayer funds need to be prioritized for use in educating taxpayers’ children,” Wobbema said.
He argued that Education Savings Accounts could save the state money over time, if public school students switch to private schools, reducing how much the state spends on per-pupil payments to public schools.
Sen. Janne Myrdal, R-Edinburg, voted against the bill. She said there are no private schools in her district, so the bill wouldn’t be used by her constituents.
“If we’re going to do school choice, it’s got to be for all kids,” Myrdal said. “I can’t in true conscience stand here today to vote for a vehicle that doesn’t give any power to the parents in my district.”
Axtman is the chief sponsor of a competing Education Savings Account bill, Senate Bill 2400, which is still under consideration by the House Education Committee. The key difference in that bill is dollars could be used for educational expenses for public school or homeschooled students in addition to private school students.
Axtman voted in favor of the Senate version, but said she’s still hopeful for a more universal policy.
“My goal is still a very comprehensive ESA that affects, truly, all students in North Dakota,” she said.
North Dakota United, a union representing educators and public sector employees, is among those who oppose the Education Savings Account bills.
“This bill, 1540, is all about private schools, just public money given right to the private schools,” said Nick Archuleta, president of North Dakota United.
The bill is expected to head to a conference committee made up of three lawmakers from each legislative chamber.

(Mary Hennigan/Arkansas Advocate)Arkansas PBS CEO and Executive Director Courtney Pledger, whose eight-year tenure included multiple conflicts with the state Legislature, will step down in May, the agency announced Thursday in a news release.
Pledger took over the state’s educational public television network in 2017. She “leaves behind a legacy of transformative leadership and innovative growth across content, education, and community engagement,” the PBS news release states.

In a statement, Pledger said she appreciated “building a phenomenal team eager to take on new challenges and collaborating with some of the very best independent creators and community partners in Arkansas.”
“It has been my great honor to lead Arkansas PBS through a transformative time that points to the limitless potential of our statewide public media network,” said Pledger, who is also the vice chair of PBS’ 27-member national board of directors.
The “transformative time” included the COVID-19 pandemic, during which Arkansas PBS broadened its resources for K-12 students while schools were closed.
The agency also started providing live high school sports coverage and online archives of state government meetings during Pledger’s tenure, according to the news release.
“Her tenure marked a deepening of Arkansas PBS’s community relevance, with an expanded multi-platform presence, robust social media engagement, and popular in-person events,” the news release states.
West Doss, chairman of the Arkansas Educational Television Commission, said in an interview that Pledger decided months ago to leave the agency. He said Pledger has been “a big part of some incredible growth and new initiatives that we’ve done” and is “well-respected by our commission.”
The commission will meet Monday morning to discuss Pledger’s departure, and applications to succeed her will be open soon, Doss said.

 Disputes over funding and audits

In the past few years, Arkansas PBS has faced legislative obstacles to its ability to spend its money. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Jonesboro, has been the Legislature’s most vocal critic of Arkansas PBS, and he unsuccessfully tried to reduce Arkansas PBS’ spending authority in the 2022 and 2024 fiscal sessions.
Arkansas PBS’ funds include approximately $5.8 million from state general revenue, $2.5 million from the federal Corporation for Public Broadcasting and $1.7 million in private donations, agency Chief Financial Officer Jason Kunau said in February.
Arkansas PBS’ spending authority has repeatedly faced resistance in the Arkansas House. Appropriations need approval from three-fourths of lawmakers, and PBS’ fiscal year 2026 appropriation required five attempts to get 76 House members’ support.
Earlier this year, Pledger urged lawmakers not to abolish the Arkansas Educational Television Commission, which oversees Arkansas PBS’ programs and finances. A proposed law from Sullivan would have moved the commission’s powers and authorities to the state Department of Education; Arkansas PBS is already under the department’s umbrella but operates independently.
The agency would have stood to lose funding via grants and donations if it no longer had an independent board, Pledger told a Senate committee.
Sullivan disputed the claim that the agency could have lost funding for its services, which include the state’s emergency alert system.
However, the Department of Education would have faced an “expensive and time-consuming” effort to obtain Arkansas PBS’ Federal Communications Commission license if the agency’s governance changed, according to a Washington, D.C. law firm that specializes in telecommunications law.

Lawmakers OK fresh audit into Arkansas PBS’ purchases, procedures as far back as July 2021

 

The agency came under legislative scrutiny in 2023 when its regularly scheduled 2022 audit indicated that administrators might have sidestepped state laws related to contract bidding. Purchases of more than $20,000 would have triggered a bidding process, and the network made several purchases just below that threshold from the same company, according to the 2022 audit.
A specially requested audit of the network’s expenditures, purchasing procedures and “internal controls” from July 1, 2021 to Dec. 30, 2023, concluded last year, with auditors referring the findings to a prosecuting attorney.
Pledger told lawmakers the agency had no intention to break or circumvent state law and had learned from its “mistakes and errors.”
While both audits remained unresolved, a legislative subcommittee tabled a potential merit pay raise for Pledger at Sullivan’s urging in August 2023 and tabled an appropriation request from the agency later that year because Pledger had missed some scheduled appearances before committees. Lawmakers said her absence was disrespectful; the network’s then-chief financial officer said Pledger missed a meeting due to illness.
After the proposal to abolish the PBS commission passed the Senate in February, Doss and Sullivan said they reached an agreement that led Sullivan to leave the commission alone. The panel convenes four times a year and will next meet in June.
Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders appointed Sullivan’s wife, Maria Sullivan, to the Arkansas Educational Television Commission last year. Doss said Maria Sullivan is set to lead an Arkansas PBS task force aimed at better serving homeschoolers, which is a high priority for her husband.

(Photo courtesy of the Oregon Department of Transportation/Flickr)Fred Cuozzo barely made it out of the South Obenchain Fire that burned through his home, barn, pumphouse and garage in Eagle Point, north of Medford, on Sept. 8, 2020.
Three years later, PacifiCorp — owner of Oregon private utility Pacific Power — was found by a jury to have been reckless and negligent in causing that fire and three others. In January 2024, a jury ordered the utility company to pay millions in damages to Cuozzo and nine other survivors, among the first group in an ongoing class action lawsuit.
Cuozzo still has not seen that settlement money because PacifiCorp is appealing the jury’s verdict. In three months, Cuozzo turns 80. He fears he might not in his lifetime see that money — money he needs to rebuild.
“I’ve been waiting almost five years since my home, contents and four other structures burned up,” he said. “I think they’re just waiting, trying to wait people out, and they can get tired of waiting or die, right?”
The Oregon Legislature is considering a bill that would do something about that, and it’s moving through the session with bipartisan support and little fanfare.
Senate Bill 926, sponsored by state Sen. David Brock Smith, R-Port Orford, and co-sponsored by Democratic state Sens. Jeff Golden of Ashland and James Manning of Eugene, would impose some consequences on PacifiCorp, and the state’s two other investor-owned utilities, for delaying settlements and prolonging litigation if they are found to have recklessly or negligently caused a wildfire.
On April 8, the Senate Judiciary Committee’s four Democrats voted to pass it out of the committee and onto the Senate floor, recommending they also vote yes. The committee’s two Republicans opposed the bill. The larger Senate vote has not yet been scheduled.
Golden said he only recently learned about the bill and signed on as a sponsor.
“I am interested in faster settlements. I’m not interested in rate increases or favorable treatment (for utilities) until people who have been waiting for a remedy get it,” he said.
Unlike other bills this session related to private utilities and wildfire risk that have been more controversial — including bills to shield utilities from some financial liabilities, and one bill that would have prohibited utilities from raising rates if they had ongoing wildfire suits — Senate Bill 926 appears to be meeting little friction. Only one person spoke at its first public hearing in March: a father of three in Albany who supports the bill and expressed frustration over his rising electricity costs. Brock Smith, the bill’s chief sponsor, did not give testimony during the bill’s first hearing or in the run-up to the judiciary committee’s vote. He also didn’t respond to calls, emails or texts about the bill.
Utility companies oppose the bill. Portland General Electric lobbyist Greg Alderson called it “problematically broad” in a letter submitted to the committee two days after the hearing.
PacifiCorp spokesman Simon Gutierrez, said in an email to the Capital Chronicle on Tuesday that the company strongly opposes the bill, though it has not yet submitted any formal testimony against it.
The bill was amended after public comment closed, unfairly and fundamentally altering the original bill without the opportunity to weigh in on the changes, both utilities contend.
Imposing consequences
Senate Bill 926 would prohibit Oregon’s private investor-owned utilities from recovering wildfire lawsuit costs from ratepayers — including fines, fees and settlements — if the company was found by a court or jury to have acted recklessly or negligently in causing the fire. It would also prohibit companies from raising rates to pay for repairing or replacing wildfire-damaged infrastructure if the company is found by court or jury to have been at fault for the fire.
Electric utilities indebted by a wildfire judgment would not be allowed to send dividends, income, interest or profits to corporate owners and shareholders and would pay 9% interest on any damages awarded to wildfire victims starting from the date of the fire, rather than the date the damages are awarded.
The bill would apply retroactively to all powerline-ignited wildfires since Jan. 1, 2020. For a company like PacifiCorp, that could mean millions in interest on cases that have been awaiting trial for years, and limits to the utilities’ now annual requests to raise rates.
“It is astounding that Senate leadership in the Oregon legislature is seeking to insert themselves into ongoing litigation involving PacifiCorp by retroactively imposing costs in the millions under a scheme that would apply to no other business in the state,” Gutierrez said.
He added that in light of a recent report from the Oregon Department of Forestry that concluded PacifiCorp did not start fires it was previously found to have started in the Santiam Canyon, the bill should be reconsidered.
That state report refutes statements from first responders from the U.S. Forest Service and months of trial testimony about the origins of the fires, and is unlikely to be admissible in PacifiCorp’s appeal because the company in 2023 moved to exclude all government reports at trial.

He was found deceased in the Sigler House, the president’s residence, in the late morning of April 17 during a wellness check after failing to appear for morning meetings, said Simpson College Board of Trustees Chair Terry Handley during a news conference.

While Byers and his family did not live in the president’s residence full time, Handley said he used it as a “point of focus” for activities and events.
“My heart breaks for the Simpson community, the Indianola community, President Byers’s family and his many, many friends,” Sher said.
April 18 classes have been canceled and grief counselors will be made available for students and staff, Handley said. He and other university leaders will meet in the morning to begin discussing next steps for selecting an interim president and additional details will be shared next week.
A 1993 graduate of Simpson, Byers was announced as president of his alma mater in July 2023 after serving as president and CEO of the Greater Des Moines Partnership. In his tenure as president, Byers oversaw the implementation of new scholarship programs for incoming students and formed partnerships with other institutions with the goal of elevating the university.
Handley said Byers’ love and passion for the Simpson campus and community was “infectious,” and helped him rise above other candidates during the presidential search. Byers was known and loved beyond Simpson as well, he added, and was recognized locally and at the state and federal levels for his work.
“Jay has had a tremendous amount of influence and impact during his career, and this will take some time, but we will take that time to grieve, we will take our time to recover, and then we will move forward,” Handley said. “That’s exactly what Jay would expect.”

(Capital-Star photo by Peter Hall)Mack Trucks will lay off between 250 and 350 workers at its Lehigh Valley Operations center outside Allentown over the next three months, due to economic uncertainty caused by U.S. tariffs, a company spokesperson said Thursday.
“Heavy-duty truck orders continue to be negatively affected by market uncertainty about freight rates and demand, possible regulatory changes, and the impact of tariffs,” spokesperson Kimberly Pupillo said.
“Today we informed our employees that this unfortunately means we’ll have to lay off 250-350 people at LVO over the next 90 days,” Pupillo said. “We regret having to take this action, but we need to align production with reduced demand for our vehicles.”
Union leaders announced the company had confirmed layoffs Thursday afternoon. The plant in Macungie employs around 1,200 workers.
“Due to the market being in decline, there will be a rate and line reduction. I have heard all the same rumors you guys have heard. This is the first time I have an official word from the company that there will be a layoff,” United Auto Workers Local 677 shop chair Tim Hertzog said in a letter posted on the union’s Facebook page Thursday.
State Rep. Josh Siegel (D-Lehigh) said the layoffs are “a clear signal of the dangerous economic instability being fueled by the Trump administration’s chaotic tariff policies.”
“The tariffs — erratic, broad and poorly targeted — are crushing core U.S. industries like trucking and manufacturing. Supply chains are snarled, costs are soaring, and confidence among employers is collapsing,” Siegel said in a news release.
President Donald Trump said on the campaign trail last year that tariffs would return manufacturing to the United States and generate hundreds of millions of dollars for the U.S. Treasury.
At the beginning of April, Trump announced tariffs on products imported from other countries beginning a universal 10% duty and increasing with additional reciprocal tariffs as high as 50% against countries with large trade deficits or other barriers to exports.
The announcement sparked a massive stock market sell-off that erased trillions of dollars in value that was followed by the largest single-day increase when Trump announced a 90-day reprieve for most countries. He doubled down on tariffs for Chinese imports, raising the duties to 125%.
Siegel called on U.S. Rep. Ryan Mackenzie (R-7th District), whose district includes the Lehigh County Mack plant, and Senators John Fetterman (D-Pa.) and Dave McCormick (R-Pa.) to “take back Congress’s constitutional authority on trade and end this economic sabotage before more livelihoods are lost.”

House File 989 would task the Iowa Department of Natural Resources with regulating the construction, expansion, placement and operation of anaerobic digesters and associated structures that hold manure feedstocks at animal feeding operations. 
The bill describes anaerobic digestion in three steps. First the feedstock, both liquid and dry animal waste, is stored. Next, the feedstock is “digested” in a structure specifically designed for anaerobic digestion. As the material is broken in the digester, the bio gas is extracted. The final step takes the leftover material, called the digestate, and either stores it or applies it as organic material to farmland. 
Rep. Mike Sexton, R-Rockwell City, said the bill draws a “distinct line” between animal feeding operations and anaerobic digesters so the two can be enforced properly. 
Sexton said under current regulations, any compliance issues that happen with an anaerobic digester are put on the livestock operation because the digesters don’t have their own licenses with the state.

Under the bill, operators would have to apply for a construction permit from DNR before building an anaerobic digester, or any of the related storage structures. This permit would require information on things like construction, size, operators and how the digestate would be applied. 
The bill states anaerobic digesters must comply with separation distances for clean air regulations and follow the same water quality separation distances put on animal feeding operations. The bill lists civil penalties for operations that do not comply with these regulations. 
According to data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Iowa has fewer than 10 anaerobic digesters on livestock operations — most are at dairies. 
Rep. Lindsay James, D-Dubuque, spoke in support of the bill, but said she hopes for more conversation moving forward on the impacts to the environment and health. 
“There (are) remaining environmental concerns, there’s health concerns around this technology, and I believe that there should be a lot more robust conversation going forward,” James said.
An article from the Iowa Chapter of the Sierra Club called the Iowa bill a “bandaid on a bigger problem” with the agricultural industry. The environmental group, which registered against HF 989, said the bill does not provide adequate separation distances from houses and other structures and will encourage animal feeding operations to expand. 
Sexton said he does not believe the regulations will inspire more concentrated animal feeding operations, or CAFOs, to be built in Iowa because “there’s just not that much money in farming right now.”
“These anaerobic digesters are going to get built on existing animal feeding operations,” Sexton said. 
Anaerobic digestion can generate renewable energy from other feedstocks, including things like food waste. Sexton has also worked on an additional bill, House File 987, that would create regulations for “community anaerobic digester systems” that use organic material other than animal manure. 
Sexton said his amendment to HF 989, which passed, brought the language in line with the other digester bill. 
PFAS amendment 
Rep. Monica Kurth, D-Davenport, filed an amendment to the bill that would require testing the materials in the digester structure for perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl, commonly known as PFAS, substances. 
“They are everywhere, and they are aptly named forever chemicals because they don’t break down, they don’t go away,” Kurth said. 
Kurth said the amendment would prevent digestate with high levels of PFAS from being applied to the land. 
The amendment is similar to House File 723, which required water treatment plants to test sewage sludge for PFAS, and notify landowners of the results before the sludge was applied as fertilizer. HF 723 did not advance ahead of the legislative funnel deadlines. 
Sexton urged the body to reject the amendment and said DNR would have opportunities to write additional rules on such matters.
“I appreciate the amendment, but Iowa’s farmers are very concerned about what they put on their farm ground,” Sexton said. “They’re the ones that have to live there. They’re the ones that have their livestock on that ground.” 
Kurth’s amendment failed, 59-32. 
Rep. J.D. Scholten, D-Sioux City, said he had several concerns with what he perceived as loopholes in the bill, but said he appreciated the efforts on HF 989, especially in comparison to the anaerobic digestion policy in the governor’s energy bill, that he said was “very concerning.” 
The bill will advance to the Senate, and Sexton said he hopes to see the community digester bill advancing soon.

(Stock photo by Oliver Helbig/Getty Images)A proposal that would lift the anonymity of people filing complaints against a law enforcement officers advanced in a Florida House committee on Thursday, even though key players in Florida law enforcement are divided about whether the legislation is truly “Backing the Blue.”
The proposal sponsored by Miami-Dade Republican Tom Fabricio (HB 317) would require a person who initially files an anonymous complaint about a law or corrections officer in the state to have to give up his or her anonymity before any interrogation of that officer can commence.
Both the Florida Sheriffs Association and the Florida Police Chiefs Association oppose the bill.
“It will not increase accountability,” said Tampa International Airport Police Department Chief Charlie Vasquez, who is serving as president of the Florida Police Chiefs Association. “It will make it more difficult to hold officers accountable when they have serious misconduct.”
But other parts of the law enforcement community do support the measure, such as the Florida Fraternal Order of Police.
A member of that organization, Miami Police officer Felix Del Rosario, said the proposal is about fairness, integrity, “and the protection of those who dedicate their lives to public service.”
Del Rosario added that, for too long, police officers in Florida have been subjected to “prolonged and ambiguous investigations.”
“This legislation helps address those inequities,” he said, “by ensuring that officers have timely access to their complete investigative file, providing safeguards against unfounded and malicious allegations that can have long lasting affects on an officers’ reputation, career, and upholding the principals of.due process and equal treatment under the law.”
‘I also back the Black’
Orange County Democratic Rep. LaVon Bracy Davis noted how the Legislature last year effectively eliminated civilian review boards designed to oversee certain local law enforcement, which was supported by the sheriffs and police chiefs, so why wouldn’t they support those agencies on this piece of legislation?
“I feel like I’m in an alternate universe right now because I hear from this chamber, from this committee, often times that we need to ‘Back the Blue.’ And the Blue just spoke. What I wrote down from the police chief is that this bill will make it more difficult to hold officers accountable when they participate in misconduct,” she said.
And Bracy Davis, who is Black, said she was speaking as a representative of a minority-majority district with constituents who in some cases “have apprehension when it comes to dealing with police officers.”
“So, not only do I ‘Back the Blue’, but I also back the Black, and I back the Brown.”
Rep. Bruce Antone, who also is Black, said he opposed the bill which, ultimately would repeal anonymity for a complainant once law enforcement begins interrogating the accused officer. Antone listed three separate occasions when he was harassed by law enforcement.
South Florida Democratic Rep. Mike Gottlieb said he disagreed with the notion that if he opposed the bill he somehow was not ‘Backing the Blue.’
“We have many masters, and in a bill like this we have the administration, we have the rank and file, the law enforcement officers who are on the street fighting day and day out to protect the society, and we have the citizens, and each one of us represents approximately 175,000 individuals,” he said. “And to come here and tell us that if we vote no on this product we don’t ‘Back the Blue?’ That’s just not true.”
‘You put your face on it’
But Republicans on the committee said that while the administrators and lobbyists for Florida’s top law enforcement agencies oppose the bill, actual cops on the street support it, and that should be good enough.
“All we’re saying is, if you have a complaint against someone,  just like if you’re going to accuse someone in a court of law, put your face on it,” said Hillsborough County GOP Rep. Danny Alvarez, whose job outside of the Legislature is general counsel for the Tampa Police Benevolent Association. “And if you can’t put your face and name on it, then it’s not worthy of going forward and smearing this person for the rest of their career.” 
Alvarez added that the bill was “for the cop, not the sergeant, not the captain, and not the chief.”
Last week, when the bill was heard in the House Government Operations Subcommittee,  Jennifer “Cookie” Pritt, executive director of Florida Police Chiefs Association, gave highly personal testimony regarding an incident involving a herself and a high-ranking command officer as a real life example of why she opposed the bill. She chose not to comment publicly on the measure on Thursday.
Ultimately, the House Judiciary Committee voted 16-4 to advance the bill, and it now moves to the full House for consideration. But it may not end up becoming law this year, as its Senate companion (SB 516) has yet to be heard in any committee in that chamber.

HB 7, sponsored by Rep. Ernie Yarbrough, R-Trinity, would give sheriff’s deputies and police officers authority to arrest and detain individuals who are not authorized to be in the U.S. and to transfer them to the custody of federal law enforcement. 
“This bill will be key to the process of securing the safety of our communities. It’s got common sense protections in there and accountability and transparency,” Yarbrough said.

The legislation allows local and state law enforcement agencies to enter into agreements to enforce the country’s immigration laws with federal agencies such as the U.S. Department of Justice and U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Currently, the Alabama Attorney General’s Office is the only state entity with that power.
Under the bill, sheriffs’ deputies; police officers and state troopers may also arrest people based on their immigration status “when authorized by federal law.” Law enforcement must also obtain documents to verify a person’s immigration status, be that a passport or a permanent resident card.
The chamber adopted a committee substitute 77-20 that removed some of the requirements. Previously, the Attorney General’s Office was required to publicly name any agency failing to comply with provisions in the legislation and notify the governor’s office, but the amendment gives it the option.
Alabama has low rates of immigration. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, only 4% of Alabama’s population was foreign-born in 2023, compared to 14.3% nationwide. Only 6% of the population speaks a language other than English at home, compared to 22.5% of the U.S. population. 
House Democrats criticized the legislation, saying it trafficked in stereotypes about immigrants without status and that it could discourage cooperation with law enforcement in criminal investigations.  Rep. Phillip Ensler, D-Montgomery, said he was worried about his foreign-born constituents and how the legislation will impact their trust in law enforcement. 
“Bringing local law enforcement into the equation is going to create a lot of fear among people that are not doing anything wrong, that aren’t committing crimes,” Ensler said. “They’re already on edge, and a lot of people are just trying to work hard. They’re trying to better themselves, provide for their families, and I’m just concerned about how this will impact them.”
The bill states that people cannot be detained solely because of their immigration status unless authorized by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and that sheriffs’ deputies and police departments will verify that a person has an arrest warrant within 24 hours of the person getting detained.
Rep. Neil Rafferty, D-Birmingham, said it would lead to racial profiling and echoed Ensler saying it will increase local distrust in law enforcement.
“When local police are perceived as immigration agents, victims and witnesses of crimes within immigrant communities become reluctant to come forward,” Rafferty said. “That doesn’t make communities safer. It actually makes it far more dangerous.”
Rep. Mary Moore, D-Birmingham, said there are more American citizens that commit crimes than people without legal status. Studies have repeatedly proven that. 
“I think that it’s so unfair for us to just focus on one group of people and then with the immigrants that we are attacking,” she said.
Yarbrough said the bill was inspired by Laken Riley, a Georgia college student that was killed by a person without legal status in 2024. He said she would not have been killed if legislation like his existed when a colleague asked him. Rafferty said Riley’s death could have been prevented with better communication between law enforcement about the man accused of killing her. 
“The failure wasn’t in our laws, but in the implementation and coordination between agencies, if it doesn’t address the actual systemic failures and communication between local and federal authorities that actually contributed to this tragedy,” he said.
The House passed the bill 74-26. It now moves to the Senate.

Putting tariffs on lithium imported from China would seem to create more demand, and a higher price, for lithium mined in Nevada.
So why is Nevada Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo asking President Donald Trump to remove tariffs on lithium from China? 
Because Nevada also has hopes of becoming a national hub for manufacturing lithium batteries.
And, Lombardo noted in a letter to Trump Thursday, Nevada’s domestic lithium industry “is still in its early stages. At present, there is no domestic technology capable of refining lithium to the standards required for manufacturing while also meeting our country’s environmental regulations. As a result all manufacturing grade lithium is imported from China.”
“As you can imagine,” Lombardo continued in his letter, “this is damaging all United States manufacturing that is dependent on this product.”
Under the Inflation Reduction Act, which Trump has repeatedly condemned and attempted to nullify by clawing back funding, a Department of Energy loan program provided $2 billion in financing for Redwood Materials’ battery component recycling and production facility in Nevada.
“Mr. President, I respectfully urge you to reconsider and remove the tariffs on lithium,” Lombardo wrote. “Given that domestic processing is not yet a viable option, the current environment poses a serious risk to jobs in Nevada and across the country.”
Lombardo joins the ranks of several Republican officeholders in the nation who have critiqued the benefits of Trump’s tariff policies, which have continued to hammer stock markets even after Trump pulled back from most of his “Liberation Day” tariffs on nations the world over.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/lombardo-bendnarksi-close-crop.jpg,,,2025-04-17 19:06:55.076903

Contributed/Altamaha RiverkeeperClean energy advocates say that a new exemption granted by the Trump administration for dozens of power plants – including two in Georgia – is the latest example of federal policy favoring the coal industry despite pollution concerns.
Earlier this week, the Environmental Protection Agency approved a two-year exemption allowing Georgia Power’s Plant Bowen and Plant Scherer to bypass federal emission regulations for mercury and other air pollutants.
At the request of Georgia Power’s parent company, Southern Co., the two fossil fuel plants were among the more than 60 power plants granted an exemption. The federal agency said the move would bolster national energy security.
Biden’s EPA issued a rule last year tightening toxic metal emission standards by 67% and reducing mercury emissions standards by 70% from existing coal- and oil-firing power plants. The stricter regulations were set to be enforced in 2027.
“At EPA, we are committed to protecting human health and the environment; we are opposed to shutting down clean, affordable and reliable energy for American families,” EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said in a statement.
Georgia Power has cited the cost of environmental compliance in the debate over the continued operation of coal-fired plants and the cleanup of toxic coal ash left behind. The company has come under fire for reversing plans to shutter Bowen and Scherer. The company instead is asking that state regulators sign off on extending the lifeline of the two plants and allow the company to ramp up its fossil fuel energy capacity.
In its 2022 resource plan, the utility said it would retire Bowen and Scherer by 2028. Since then, Georgia Power has cited a projected industrial growth boom primarily driven by massive data centers as a reason it is now planning to retire Bowen by 2035, and Scherer Unit 3 by 2038.
Isabella Ariza, a senior attorney for the Georgia chapter of the Sierra Club, said the Trump administration’s action will undermine a rule designed to limit dangerous toxins.
“It’s definitely making it hard for environmental interveners in the Georgia Power (Integrated Resource Plan) and subsequent rate case this year to make a case that Georgia Power should get rid of aging and expensive coal,” Ariza said.





State regulators began holding hearings on Georgia Power’s long-term resource plans in March. Those hearings are set to continue in late May. 





“We’re hoping that (water pollutant guidelines), coal combustion residuals and other policies remain in place,” she said. “That’s the only way we have to protect the people that live near these plants even if companies like Georgia Power decide to keep burning coal.”
Southern Co. said in a statement that it remains in compliance with the federal guidelines for Mercury and Air Toxics Standards, which cover air emission limits for coal- and oil-fired power plants.
“Extending the current deadline will provide additional time needed both to address potential rule changes and further demonstrate compliance to the current requirements,” the company statement said.
Keri Powell, a senior attorney in the Southern Environmental Law Center’s Georgia office and air program leader, said this exemption allows polluters to place communities in Bartow and Monroe counties at risk by spewing more toxic chemicals into the air.
“Residents in and around Bartow and Monroe counties should be concerned that this reckless attempt to exempt utilities from these rules will expose them to more toxic chemicals and health risks,” Powell said in a statement. “This attempt is a slap in the face to Georgians who face disproportionate harm from the dirty fossil fuel industry.”
Ariza said there is some optimism that the economics for renewable energy will continue to improve enough to support utility companies increasing their capacity as an alternative to coal.

She was supported by her friend and another former detention employee Shari Rich. (Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)LEAVENWORTH — Around the corner from a defunct for-profit prison owned by Tennessee-based CoreCivic, Marcia Levering walked carefully across a grassy field to a podium at Ray Miller Park, aided by her cane and a friend, to speak out against the company’s desire to open an ICE detention facility.
Levering, who now lives in Nebraska, worked at the CoreCivic’s Leavenworth Detention Center for 10 months beginning in 2020 before she was stabbed four times by an inmate — once in the ear, once in the right arm, and twice in the abdomen. She shared her experience at a Thursday press conference hosted by ACLU Kansas, Cross-Border Network for Justice & Solidarity and Advocates for Immigrant Rights and Reconciliation, speaking out against CoreCivic’s desire to reopen the prison and house immigrants.
“As usual, we were understaffed,” Levering said of the attack. “There are two officers in Q building, when there should have been seven. I was in training for a new position. The day of my assault, on Feb. 6, 2021, I was coming out of my office. Unit Four accidentally buzzed open the wrong door, allowing an inmate to come out, throwing boiling water in my face and stab me four times.”
Levering said corrections officers expect to be in danger, but a pattern of understaffing and poor working conditions made the job much more dangerous than it should have been.
The CoreCivic facility closed  in 2021 when its contract with the United States Marshal’s Service ended. Reports by oversight agencies when the Leavenworth facility closed highlighted problems at the facility, including understaffing and the use of “triple bunking” in cells, a practice of adding a third bunk to a cell designed for two inmates.
Leavenworth citizens and others from across the state have stepped forward to protest CoreCivic’s plant to reopen, speaking out through public rallies and at city meetings. City officials heard and responded. The most recent step in disagreements between the city and CoreCivic officials was a lawsuit filed March 31. The city said the company had not followed a proper permitting process to reopen.

Staffing shortages critical
Shari Rich, who worked at the CoreCivic facility for 13 years, attended Thursday to put her voice to those urging the city of Leavenworth to keep the detention center closed. Her first years with the company were good, and she considered the facility well run.
But in the last six years, it steadily deteriorated, she said.
“I worked control,” she said, explaining that was the eyes and ears of the building, keeping oversight of what was happening. “And usually we had two to three officers up there at all times. At the end, when she (Levering) got hurt, there was only one person manning that whole place. There are 24 pods.”
Using her hands, Rich counted how many doors and gates that was for one person to watch, a total that came to more than 45.
“So one person was manning that whole place,” Rich said.
“This was inevitable,” Levering interjected about the attack that left her partially paralyzed and for which she underwent 16 surgeries. “A matter of when.”
 
In the public eye 
Esmie Tseng, spokeswoman for ACLU of Kansas, said the Thursday press conference was a way to keep the issue in front of the Leavenworth community. Although organizations put the event together, she said it’s important that the city be the focus.
“I definitely want it to be more of a bridge for the folks that have these stories to tell, who know firsthand the impact that the facility had on them,” she said. “I think we need to keep remembering that there are people who are at the heart of this.”
Tseng said the city’s officials have stepped up for those who shared their disagreement with CoreCivic reopening.
“It sort of took on its own momentum, right?” she said. “I think it’s such an issue that, like, really spoke to people. I really want to make sure that CoreCivic doesn’t just get to dominate the conversation.”
CoreCivic spokesman Ryan Gustin disagreed, calling the facility’s opponents “politically extreme, out-of-touch, outsider groups that want to tell the people of Leavenworth what to do.”
“The fact is the Leavenworth community wants our facility, the 300 jobs it will create, and the $2 million in annual local revenue it will generate,” Gustin said. “It’s time for the city commission to reject outside groups from hijacking this issue for their own political gain at the expense of the Leavenworth economy. Elected leaders should tell these outside groups to stop sending the message that the public safety profession is not welcome in Leavenworth.
“CoreCivic will operate a safe, transparent, and accountable facility that will be positive for the community,” he said.

Becoming an advocate
William Rogers, another former employee of CoreCivic, has become a grassroots advocate, filling out Kansas Open Records Requests and tracking down building permits and emails as he fights to stop the company from reopening a facility.
When speaking about holding an inmate, Dillon Reed, as he died, Rogers’ voice broke and he struggled to go on.
“I still see Dillon Reed at night sometimes when I go to bed,” Rogers said. “He was a good kid. He should have never died in there. He died because of staff negligence. People are humans in there. They’re inmates, but they’re humans. I think every one of us need to understand that these people have families. They have people that love them. We had a job to do, and we failed that day.”
Rogers received pointed out that CoreCivic promised in emails, which he provided to Kansas Reflector, to use local contractors to do all the upgrades the facility. But when he got a copy of a building permit for the complete removal and replacement of the roof, the contractor was a Texas company, Bass Roofing and Restoration LLC.
CoreCivic also offered, in emails from CoreCivic’s John Malloy:

“A one-time impact fee payment of $1,000,000
An annual impact fee payment of $250,000
An annual impact fee to the police department of $150,000″

The company also said it expects to employ 300 to 350 full-time employees with a total salary and benefit package between $25 million and $30.2 million per year.
 
Prioritizing ‘progress over people’ 
Sister Jean Panisko, with the Sisters of Charity of Leavenworth, was the opening speaker Thursday.
“We’re Catholic women, religious, devoted to the work of justice, peace and upholding the integrity of creation,” she said. “We applaud the city commissioners for their actions, for listening to our community and protecting the city by suing CoreCivic, asking them to apply for a special-use permit with money provided by our government.”
Panisko said CoreCivic is promising conditions won’t be the same, but she said the facility “wasn’t closed by chance.”
“It was shut down by the previous presidential administration after serious reports and ultimately finding mismanagement, abuse conditions,” she said. “The closure was and continues to be an indictment of a failed system, one that prioritizes progress over people,  efficiency over empathy and contracts over projects.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Levering-and-Rich-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-04-17 19:06:55.076903

McArthur, representing the government, argued against McFadden’s “unprecedented” preliminary injunction, saying it interferes with the president’s “autonomy” in “highly restricted spaces.”Pointing out the AP was not demanding access “when the president wants to concentrate on his writing and his work,” Judge Corenlia Pillard said “it’s a little confusing to me when you say a place of ‘autonomy.’”“You make the Oval sound like a place of silent retreat,” said Pillard, who was appointed to the appeals bench during President Barack Obama’s second term.Pillard also highlighted the expectation of privacy is different for people in “high public office.”“There’s already a dozen people in there, so he’s agreed to have a press pool,” she said during McArthur’s roughly 45-minute questioning.The administration argued in its emergency appeal to block the ruling that Trump will be “irreparably injured” if the higher court doesn’t stay the lower court order while it adjudicates the case.Officials also countered that the First Amendment protects the president’s right to choose which journalists enter the Oval Office, Air Force One or Mar-a-Lago based on the content of their coverage.Where’s the distinction?Charles Tobin, attorney for the AP, argued that the White House has “brazenly excluded” AP reporters and photographers from opportunities open to other journalists.McFadden “appropriately and very narrowly tailored” his injunction, Tobin said. The lower judge ruled that, under the First Amendment, once the White House opens doors for all journalists to spaces including the Oval Office and East Room, it cannot then exclude them based on viewpoint.McFadden explicitly wrote his ruling does not mandate journalists be given access to the president or that the president cannot choose which outlets to grant exclusive interviews.Judge Neomi Rao said, “the AP concedes he could choose journalists based on viewpoint for exclusive interviews.”“When you’re talking about 10 or 12 journalists in the Oval or on his plane or in his home at Mar-a-Lago, what is the distinction?” asked Rao, who was appointed during Trump’s first presidency.Tobin replied that the pool is a system that invites numerous journalists to participate on a rotating basis.“That’s exactly where the distinction lies,” he said.Private invitations allowableJudge Gregory Katsas presented other scenarios when the president could invite only “supportive” members of the public and press, for example in the Cabinet room for a policy rollout.Tobin argued if the event is open to all press members, the president cannot discriminate based on viewpoint.“Once you have a system of rotation, that’s when the viewpoint becomes anathema,” Tobin replied.What if the president “tapped (certain reporters) on the shoulder” and invited only them into the Oval Office, asked Katsas, who was appointed during Trump’s first term.Tobin replied the president could handpick reporters for a private interview in the Oval Office, as long as it wasn’t an event open to the wider press pool.“This seems awfully close to what’s happening here,” Katsas said.Wire position axedOn Wednesday the White House announced a new media policy placing restrictions on all wire services’ access to the Oval Office and other spaces. Other wire services include Bloomberg and AFP.Despite McFadden’s court order, the White House on Monday denied entry to an AP reporter and photographer to an Oval Office press conference between Trump and El Salvador President Nayib Bukele.The AP filed a motion in district court Wednesday requesting McFadden to enforce his preliminary injunction.McFadden has scheduled a hearing for Friday.The White House began denying the AP entry to the Oval Office, East Room and other places on Feb. 11.Trump’s press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, announced in late February that White House officials would take over pool rotation decisions from the White House Correspondents Association, a member organization that has self-governed journalist rotations and briefing seats placement since the Eisenhower administration.",,,,2025-04-17 19:06:55.076903

(Getty Images)OKLAHOMA CITY — An Oklahoma teenager who was arrested in connection with an Election Day terror plot has pleaded guilty, the U.S. Attorney’s Office announced Thursday.
Abdullah Haji Zada, 18, a U.S. lawful permanent resident, has pleaded guilty to knowingly receiving, attempting to receive and conspiring to receive a firearm and ammunition to be used to commit terrorism, prosecutors with the Western District of Oklahoma said in a press release.
Prosecutors said Zada, who was 17 when he was arrested in October, pleaded guilty as an adult and faces up to 15 years in prison, a $250,000 fine and deportation to Afghanistan upon his release.
Prosecutors allege Zada and a co-conspirator, Nasir Ahmad Tawhedi, 27, of Oklahoma City, obtained AK-47 assault rifles and ammunition and conspired to provide support to ISIS to conduct a November 2024 Election Day attack.
Federal investigators have said Tawhedi, who is also an Afghan citizen, allegedly admitted that he planned to target large gatherings of people and said the two expected “to be martyred.” Tawhedi had also taken steps to liquidate his family’s assets and resettle his relatives overseas, officials said.
The criminal complaint alleged the two men advertised the sale of personal property on Facebook. A confidential source asked if a computer was still for sale, which ultimately led Tawhedi and Zada to meet with the buyer at a rural location to test firearms.
The two met with an FBI asset at a rural property and bought and received two AK-47 assault rifles, 10 magazines and 500 rounds of ammunition, according to the criminal complaint.
Authorities then arrested the two.
Authorities said Tawhedi has been charged with conspiring and attempting to provide material support to ISIS, which is punishable by up to 20 years in prison and receiving a firearm to commit a felony or federal crime of terrorism. He faces up to 15 years in prison if convicted of the latter offense. 
Prosecutors said Tawhedi awaited trial on those charges Thursday.

(Photo by Erik Gunn /Wisconsin Examiner)The economic uncertainty that has sent the stock market and consumer confidence plummeting in the last month hasn’t yet affected employment in Wisconsin, according to the state’s chief economist.
Wisconsin’s job numbers reached another record high in March, and unemployment, although up slightly, is still close to an all-time low, the Department of Workforce Development (DWD) reported Thursday.
Uncertainty over the impact of tariffs imposed by the Trump administration has contributed to falling consumer confidence as well as business confidence, said Dennis Winters, DWD’s chief economist. So far that hasn’t affected the state’s job market, however, he said.
Based on a monthly federal survey of employers, DWD projected Wisconsin had 3.055 million nonfarm jobs in March — an increase of 10,000 from February and 15,000 from a year ago.
From a separate household survey, the department projected Wisconsin’s March unemployment rate at 3.2%. That’s even with February, but a slight increase from the 2.9% calculated for March of 2024.
The job growth was greatest in service industries, which added more than 21,000 jobs over the last 12 months.
Manufacturing jobs have fallen by 7,000 since March 2024 — all of that in durable goods. Winters said that reflects longstanding challenges in the sector more than specific recent developments.

Spencer Cox — a Republican who has called tariffs a “huge gamble” but also said that he hopes “President Trump is right” about them — said state officials are continuing to monitor their impacts on Utah businesses, and that the state’s smaller businesses are “going to be hit the hardest.” 
Cox also said he’s instructed state agencies to prepare for possible budget cuts if a recession hits the U.S. 
“We’re always planning for the worst. That’s part of what we do every year, and we’re one of the few states that does that,” Cox told reporters during his monthly PBS Utah news conference on Thursday. “But look, I look at the data just like everyone else, and the possibility of a recession has gone up significantly. Certainly the trade wars have played a role in that.” 
Regardless of “whether you think trade wars are good or bad or will lead to something better, everybody agrees that it’s going to cause pain in the short term.” 
“And we have to be ready for that,” he said.

During a separate news conference earlier this week, on Tuesday, when he and Republican legislative leaders celebrated Utah’s 18th year being ranked No. 1 in the nation for best economic outlook, Cox said he had “instructed all of my department heads to come up with recession plans, looking at three different levels of cuts … if there is a recession.” 
Cox said Thursday that state leaders “will be very cautious in our spending” heading into July 1, when the state’s fiscal year starts, and “we’ll adjust accordingly.” 
For 18th year, Utah ranks No. 1 for best economic outlook. What could threaten its top spot?

The Utah Legislature is already expected to convene in a special session in May to tackle issues the governor outlined in a veto letter he issued March 27, to make changes to at least two bills — HB263, a bill dealing with election transparency and HB356, a bill requiring some counties to elect district-based council members. During that special session, he also said he wants the Legislature to repurpose $3.5 million it had set aside as part of Utah’s bid to keep the Sundance Film Festival, which opted instead to move to Colorado.
It’s possible, depending on national developments and impacts to the economy, that state leaders could also consider budget changes during a special session, but that remains to be seen. 
Pressed on how state leaders will ensure “equity” among state agencies if there are budget cuts so that some services, like social services, aren’t overly impacted, Cox said “the Legislature ultimately controls the purse,” but he also added “we would be equitable in those types of cuts.” 
Cox also said Utah leaders did something similar during the Great Recession. 
“We took some across-the-board cuts, but then we let the experts who run those departments figure out how to implement those,” he said. “Because in recessionary times, there are some places where you would want to increase the budget and others where you would want to decrease it more.” 
He presented a hypothetical scenario of a 3% cut. “It doesn’t mean you cut 3% from every program, but every department would have to find those 3% cuts in their own ways that make sense and continue to serve the people in the state,” he said. 



Tariffs’ impact to Utah businesses, Canada
Cox — who went on a trade mission to Canada last week — said he’s “concerned about the small businesses that are going to be impacted by this.” 
However, he also said he’s “hopeful” that leaders on both sides can “figure out” solutions. 
Excluding gold exported to the United Kington for refinement, Canada, Mexico and China are among Utah’s top trade partners. 
Utah exported $1.3 billion and imported $4.9 billion in goods from Mexico in 2023, according to a recent report from the University of Utah’s Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute. Canada is the second biggest source of Utah’s imports, with $3.1 billion in imports and $1.7 billion in exports that year. China ranks No. 3, with Utah taking in $2.7 million in imports from the country and exporting $1.2 billion. 
Two industries Cox discussed Thursday as being impacted included manufacturing and housing. On the latter, he said he’s “always concerned about the price of housing and what that means for our state and our country.” 
He said World Trade Center Utah and the Governor’s Office of Economic Development are staying in touch with Utah manufacturing companies and “helping them find new suppliers and better, cheaper ways to make their product.” 
Utah GOP leaders defend Trump’s tariffs while bracing for economic ‘turbulence’

“We’ve had some incentives in the past and we’ll be increasing those to move manufacturing here, which is why we led the nation in manufacturing (job growth) last year,” he said. 
Most of all, Cox said he hopes national leaders will at some point soon provide more stability and certainty when it comes to tariffs. He said he’s “supportive of getting pieces of this right, and so I’m grateful that we have an administration that’s willing to look at this.”
“I’m hopeful for more certainty,” he said. “Businesses can be resilient. Capital is a coward, for sure, but once you know the rules, business and entrepreneurs will figure out a way to work around whatever those parameters are. It’s harder when you don’t know what the rules are going forward … so more than anything, we just need to get this nailed down as soon as possible.”
On his conversations with Canadian leaders during his trade mission last week, Cox said, “our Canadian counterparts absolutely agreed that we should be pushing back on China and some of their unfair practices and some of their own tariffs and other issues.” 
But “that being said,” Cox said, “there are still a lot of companies that manufacture out of China, especially smaller companies in Utah who are going to be hit the hardest.” 
“There are lots of companies that are just going to be hurt, there’s not much we can do about it other than trying to help them,” he said. 
Pressed on Canada leaders’ message to him about tariffs, Cox said “their message is exactly what you would expect and what you’ve heard from the premiers there and from the Prime Minister.”
“You know, they felt really disheartened, I guess would be one way to say it,” he said. “Some used the word, kind of, betrayed, that they’re our closest ally and friend. … And yet, there was also a recognition by many of them that they needed to make some changes in Canada as well, which I think is helpful.”
Cox added that Canada “has had very high tariffs on several of their products,” including dairy and lumber, and also has “trade barriers” between its own provinces. He said they also recognized “they needed to invest more in their security and defense as well.”
“So it was interesting to hear this, this recognition that they did need to make some changes, and were willing to do that,” he said. “But yeah, obviously they were very hurt. We’re their overwhelmingly large trading partner, and they’re going to try to diversify more of their trade with other places, but we want to continue that partnership.”

Senate Bill 2137 prevents the North Dakota Game and Fish Department from banning deer hunting over bait. The agency has imposed baiting bans in some areas of the state as it tries to prevent the spread of chronic wasting disease, which can be fatal in deer. 
“We can deal with wildlife management and respect private property rights,” Armstrong, who is a hunter, said in a statement. 
Many hunters testified in favor of the bill sponsored by Sen. Keith Boehm, R-Mandan, though some joined the Game and Fish Department in opposing it. 
Other outdoors related bills signed this week include House Bill 1470 that raises the price of hunting, fishing and boating licenses, Senate Bill 2216 that creates a $5 waterfowl hunting stamp to pay for habitat improvement and Senate Bill 2245 that changes rules on hunting waterfowl from a boat.

The university is suing the Federal Emergency Management Agency over what it says are unnecessary hurdles to wildfire compensation. (Photo by Patrick Lohmann / Source NM)A public university in Las Vegas, New Mexico is suing the Federal Emergency Management Agency, alleging the agency is illegally forcing it to jump through bureaucratic hoops before it can seek compensation for a wildfire in 2022 caused by the United States Forest Service.
New Mexico Highlands University, which has about 2,800 students, is seeking compensation from a $5.45 billion fund Congress created to fully compensate victims of the Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire, the biggest fire in New Mexico history, which started due to two botched prescribed burns on federal land in early 2022. 
The wildfire burned more than 530 square miles and destroyed several hundred homes. It also upended life at the university, according to a lawsuit filed Tuesday. The lawsuit does not provide a dollar figure, but it lists a variety of losses, including structural damage to university property from flooding and erosion; forced closures; increased insurance premiums; as well as emergency staffing costs for student support and operational expenses. 
Hermits Peak Fire victims say claims office head offered reassurances about Trump’s threatened cuts 

But rather than applying for compensation made available through the Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire Assistance Act, the university’s lawsuit says it is being required to first exhaust another means of covering some of those costs known as the FEMA Public Assistance program. 
That program is reserved for public entities like local governments and school districts seeking reimbursement for emergency and infrastructure costs they suffered during a disaster. 
It is also notoriously slow, requiring a seven-step approval process. 
“The Public Assistance program is a lengthy discretionary reimbursement program, not a compensation program, that is difficult to navigate, can take years to complete, and will not cover all of Plaintiff’s damages,” writes Brian Colón, a former state auditor and lawyer with Singleton Schreiber, which is suing on NMHU’s behalf. 
The City of New Orleans is still awaiting some Public Assistance funds from Hurricane Katrina funds in 2005, according to the lawsuit. Here in New Mexico, six bridges damaged in a 2008 flood in Ruidoso were still awaiting repairs by the time post-fire flooding occurred there last year, delays local officials attribute, in part, to Public Assistance challenges.
Flash floods poised to continue in disaster areas through monsoon season

And the state of New Mexico has awarded $170 million in zero-interest loans in recent years to local governments affected by various recent disasters, a measure meant to counteract delays associated with the FEMA program. 
Since President Donald Trump took office in January, approval for Public Assistance has also become less certain. This week, FEMA declined to cover 100% of the Public Assistance costs incurred from Hurricane Helene in North Carolina and denied the state of Washington’s request for disaster assistance, including Public Assistance, following a bomb cyclone there last year.
Colón, in a brief interview Thursday, said he was unaware of any additional delays or denials for public entities affected by the Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire since Trump took office. FEMA officials did not immediately respond to a comment about that or the lawsuit generally on Thursday.
The university is not the first public entity in and around the burn scar to sue FEMA for requiring the extra step. Other plaintiffs include the Mora-San Miguel Electrical Co-operative, Las Vegas City Schools, and the Mora Independent School District. Those cases are all still pending. 
As of April 15, the Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire Claims Office has paid out $2.25 billion in compensation to individuals, businesses, nonprofits and local governments, which amounts to about 41% of the $5.45 billion Congress awarded. That figure includes $137 million to local governments, most of which was a single payment of $98 million to the City of Las Vegas to replace its water treatment facilities.
The amount paid out via FEMA Public Assistance money is less clear. According to a FEMA website, the agency has obligated a little more than $170 million to local public entities that incurred costs related to the wildfire disaster in New Mexico in 2022. That money goes to public entities in the Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire burn scar but also other wildfires that erupted in the state in spring 2022, and it’s not clear how much has been actually paid, not just obligated, so far.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_9288-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-17 18:08:41.876104

According to state records, Jordan Nuno was employed by the Eighth Judicial District Department of Corrections as a full-time residential officer at the state-run Ottumwa Residential Facility from 2019 until January 2025, when he was fired.
The Ottumwa facility houses criminal offenders who have been ordered by the court to reside there as a condition of probation or parole. Nuno was tasked with supervising residents, taking periodic resident counts, and addressing any resident conduct issues.
According to the department, the final incident that triggered Nuno’s firing occurred on Dec. 18, 2024, as Nuno was making his rounds in a hallway at the Ottumwa Residential Facility. Based on video surveillance and witness statements, the department alleged that Nuno knowingly and intentionally shoulder-checked a resident of the facility, Jaden Miller, in an overt, unprovoked act of aggression.
Then, as Nuno continued down the hallway, Nuno allegedly directed a racial slur at resident Derek Winston, who is African American, and threatened to assault Winston and have him sanctioned or given jail time.
Nuno, the department alleged, then shoulder-checked Winston in another overt and unprovoked act of aggression, then shoved Winston against the wall.
According to the department, neither resident responded with violence. Immediately after the incident with Winston, Nuno allegedly informed a supervisor he had used force against a resident, and later told Resident Manager Charles Severs he was willing to “take a suspension” for doing so.
Later, when questioned by his superiors about shoulder-checking Miller, Nuno allegedly compared the residential facility to a prison and stated that Miller should have stepped aside as Nuno proceeded down the hallway. The department subsequently fired Nuno.
After he applied for unemployment benefits, Nuno participated in a fact-finding interview with Iowa Workforce Development and, according to an IWD administrative law judge, he “willfully misrepresented” the facts surrounding his dismissal.
“Essentially everything Mr. Nuno (said) was an intentionally false statement,” Administrative Law Judge James Timberland ruled. “Mr. Nuno asserted a resident suddenly approached him, called him a racial slur, and hit him,” and also asserted he was discharged because his manager is a racist, Timberland stated.
Based on the statements he had made to the IWD fact-finder in January, Nuno was awarded unemployment, and he subsequently collected $8,084 in benefits over a 12-week period.
After finding that Nuno misrepresented the facts related to his firing, Timberland recently ruled Nuno had “assaulted” residents of the Ottumwa facility and was ineligible for unemployment benefits. Nuno was ordered to repay the $8,084 in benefits already collected.
Court records show Nuno is currently facing a criminal charge of cruel treatment of a prisoner, a serious misdemeanor, as well as a simple-misdemeanor charge of assault. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges and informed the court he intends to mount an affirmative defense of justification and self-defense. A jury trial on the cruel-treatment charge is scheduled for June 23, 2025.



Police officer, school teacher fired from their jobs
Other Iowans whose unemployment cases recently went before an administrative law judge include:
— Leon Spataru, who was fired from the City of Eldridge Police Department in January after the city concluded he was unfit for duty. According to the city, Spataru began working for the department in April 2024 as a full-time police officer.
In August, October and December of 2024 he allegedly told a supervisor he was anxious, fearing for his and his family’s safety, and was stressed to the point of feeling sick. An independent, third-party medical provider later conducted a psychological evaluation and concluded that Spataru was unable to consistently perform the essential functions of the job — after which the city fired him and challenged his application for unemployment benefits.
Administrative Law Judge Daniel Zeno ruled recently that Spataru is eligible for benefits since he had not committed workplace misconduct. “Failure in job performance due to inability or incapacity is not considered misconduct” because such actions are not voluntary, Zeno stated in his ruling.
— Joseph Vannatta, who worked as a high school band instructor for the Cherokee Community School District until he was fired in the spring of 2024. Police had alleged Vannatta “inserted himself in Snapchats” with a student and “continued to get personal” by engaging the student in explicit discussions of sex.
In July 2024, Vannatta pleaded guilty to a charge of harassment. Administrative Law Judge Sean Nelson subsequently found Vannatta was entitled to unemployment benefits, finding the school district had not “met its burden to describe the specific incidents that allegedly violated (state law)” or proven that Vannatta “used his authority to sexually exploit” a student.
The school district appealed that ruling and the state’s Employment Appeal Board recently reversed Nelson’s decision, stating that Vannatta “was charged with a crime and pled to an indictable offense factually related to that crime.” Because an aggravated misdemeanor, such as harassment, constitutes “gross misconduct,” the board ruled, Vannatta is ineligible for unemployment.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/unemployment-benefits-form-with-rejected-stamp.jpg,,,2025-04-17 18:08:41.876104

(Karen Pulfer Focht for Tennessee Lookout)Fourth-generation Middle Tennessee cattle farmer Cole Liggett lined up with scientists and environmental advocates in March to urge Tennessee lawmakers not to gut the state’s historically strong protections for wetlands.
Wetlands protection has been good business for Liggett. In addition to raising cattle, he’s a manager at Headwaters Reserve, a firm that developers pay to preserve and restore wetlands and streams so they can destroy them elsewhere, called mitigation banking. If lawmakers follow through on a plan to deregulate an estimated 80% of the state’s isolated wetlands, that will upend the industry in Tennessee and drive up prices for developers still required to pay for mitigation, Liggett testified.
Liggett works in a growing industry that operates more than 2,500 mitigation banks nationwide, earning an estimated $3.5 billion in revenue in 2019, according to a 2023 study funded by the Ecological Restoration Business Association. 
The industry is built on demand spurred by the 1972 U.S. Clean Water Act, which requires developers to offset their damage to wetlands by building or restoring wetlands nearby.
But recent federal actions to shrink the scope of that law are pushing states to choose how strictly they will regulate wetlands. The consequences of those decisions not only threaten further degradation of land, water and wildlife, but also the fortunes of an industry that has made a big business out of conservation.

The 2023 U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Sackett v. EPA stripped federal protection from wetlands that don’t have a surface connection to navigable waters, which means bigger rivers and lakes. President Donald Trump’s administration has vowed to ease regulation, allowing developers to ditch and drain all but the wettest wetlands without permits or mitigation. Environmentalists fear that a recent order to speed up around 600 energy projects nationwide could limit requirements to compensate for the destruction of wetlands.
Some states, such as North Carolina and Indiana, have loosened regulations since the Sackett decision. In March, Kentucky lawmakers passed legislation to do the same, overriding Gov. Andy Beshear’s veto.
Tennessee’s wetlands regulations predate the federal Clean Water Act protections passed in the 1970s, but pending legislation could roll back much of that protection, according to the Southern Environmental Law Center.
The Tennessee Ecological Restoration Association, which represents Liggett and other mitigation bankers in Tennessee and the southeast, told the Tennessee Lookout that this will directly impact the growing mitigation industry. “We will see a decrease in demand for credits if aquatic resources are deregulated.”
Those concerns aren’t shared by everyone in mitigation banking. The national industry is more worried about the defunding of agencies that oversee banks and the prospect of a recession.

William Coleman’s California-based ecological consulting firm Eco-Asset Solutions and Innovations does much of its business in states that have active wetlands mitigation banking programs.
“My company has not seen any downturn in business,” Coleman, the firm’s founder and president, said. ‘Landowners are still very interested in the revenue opportunities mitigation banking offers.”
Protection limits risk industry investments
Just outside of Memphis, a chorus of frogs on a roughly 250-acre tract of former farmland nearly drowns out the traffic on nearby Austin Peay Highway. Environmental consulting firm EnSafe planted about 54,000 trees on the once flood-prone fields in 2018 and will be responsible for its upkeep until the wetland is mature and healthy – anywhere from seven to 10 years. After that, the land will go to a partnering land trust, where it will be conserved in perpetuity.
“Granted, there is a business piece to what we do, but restoring things to the way they were is also pretty cool … There will be a pocket here forever,” EnSafe principal Paul Stoddard said.
The West Tennessee Wetlands Mitigation Bank has sold credits to Amazon to offset a new delivery center in Fayette County. A contractor purchased credits to compensate for a 2-million-square-foot distribution facility called “Project Iron Giant,” according to records kept by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, one of the federal agencies tasked with overseeing wetlands regulations.
TERA estimates that mitigation businesses have poured more than $1 billion into around 130 mitigation bank investments across Tennessee.
“The beauty of mitigation credits is that the developer just writes a check and they’re done. All the monitoring and reporting and maintenance and stuff is up to the bank,” EnSafe Senior Ecologist Jimmy Groton said.
That process makes mitigation banking a high-risk industry, according to Liggett. Regardless of whether they sell credits, banks are required to maintain their wetlands for at least seven years. The proposed regulatory rollback on Tennessee’s wetlands would mean an 80% decrease in demand for mitigation businesses, he testified to Tennessee lawmakers on March 26.
“Such a drastic decrease in the demand after such a high investment … has potential to drive up credit prices as a necessity to avoid potential financial insolvencies,” Liggett said.
Hillary Bonham, a principal at environmental consulting firm Baetis Restoration Partners, has experience as both a residential developer and mitigation banker. She told Tennessee lawmakers that the current average price of a credit in Tennessee is around $50,000. Reducing regulations and hampering demand will likely cause the credits that remain to be “exponentially more expensive when they are needed.”
In Georgia, where isolated wetlands are not regulated, a single credit can range from $750,000 to $1.1 million according to the Georgia Alabama Land Trust In Lieu Fee Program, Bonham said.

States can protect isolated wetlands
Mitigation banks have been the preferred way to offset wetland destruction for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Corps since 2008, and the industry has ballooned rapidly since the first entrepreneurial banks were established in the early 1990s.
John Paul Woodley, Jr. helped issue the Army Corps of Engineers’ 2008 mitigation rule while serving as assistant secretary of the Army for civil works. He’s also the immediate past chair of the board of the National Environmental Banking Association, a trade association with around 100 members nationwide.
Some people expected to see the Sackett decision have a dramatic impact on mitigation banking, he said, but two limiting factors prevented a panic within the industry.
First, when the decision was made, developers already well into the permit process could either choose to move forward under the previous terms or go back to the drawing board. Most businesses didn’t want to start over, so many pending permits under review by the Corps proceeded as though nothing had happened, Woodley said.
Second, states have significant control over the regulation of state waters.
“Many states have just said, ‘We don’t care about that. We have our own jurisdiction, and we’re not limited by what the Clean Water Act says is the waters of the United States … If the U.S. doesn’t want to protect those waters, that’s fine and dandy. We will,’” Woodley said.
Some states have more isolated wetlands than others, he added, and those states will have to decide whether to protect those resources. Woodley thinks they ultimately will.
Generally, coastal wetlands will maintain federal protection because of their connection to the navigable waters of the ocean. But experts fear that some swamps and marshlands, once protected, may now face development due to human-made flood-control structures, such as levees or berms, that could be construed as legal separations between wetlands and waters of the U.S.
Trump pushes to expedite wetlands permitting
President Trump’s declaration of a “national energy emergency” led the Corps to fast-track review for more than 600 permits. 
Environmental advocates say that could come at the expense of wetlands. 
“Any damages to wetlands due to this emergency must be mitigated properly,” said Matt Rota, senior policy director for Healthy Gulf, a nonprofit advocating for communities along the Gulf Coast. “For every wetland that is destroyed, we must see at least three acres of wetlands being built, which would not happen during an emergency process.”
Those in the industry see other actions by the administration as slowing down environmental permitting, posing a different kind of threat. Trump’s first administration made funding cuts to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Corps that ultimately increased the time it took to review pending permits. Longer review periods can mean less return on investment for landowners, Coleman said.
“That meant there were just not enough bodies to review the applications that were on the table … so there was a tremendous delay,” he said. 
Coleman’s company found that an average two- to three-year review period stretched into four or five years during Trump’s first term. 
Woodley said demand for mitigation banks is driven largely by development pressure. In Virginia, where he’s based, data centers are a big contributor. Some of the mitigation banking industry’s biggest customers are state transportation departments and the oil and gas industry—roadways and pipelines often have less flexibility to build elsewhere.
“Anything that takes place that causes an economic downturn, that causes people to retrench and postpone their development plans … that’s the risk to the mitigation industry,” Woodley said. “They had a very difficult time around 2008 … the number of permits applied for declined, and at the same time, the number of the requirements for mitigation took a downturn.”
In Gulf States like Louisiana, which is home to 40% of wetlands in the continental U.S. and has sustained 80% of national wetland losses, environmental advocates warn about the consequences of filling in wetlands through emergency permitting without ensuring proper mitigation. 
“We have learned the hard way that each acre of wetlands that is destroyed and replaced with concrete worsens our flooding problems and increases our climate risks,” said Kristen Schlemmer, senior legal director of the Bayou City Waterkeeper, a nonprofit working to protect communities impacted by water pollution and flooding in Houston.
Some wetlands mitigation banking businesses have begun to diversify their offerings to include conservation-based credits for protecting the habitats of endangered species, carbon sequestration or nutrient banking to prevent excessive runoff of nitrogen and phosphorus.

(Screenshot via Bismarck Tribune)The North Dakota Supreme Court heard arguments Thursday in a case that could determine whether a state law on underground carbon dioxide storage is constitutional and fair to landowners. 
The Northwest Landowners Association and other landowners are suing the state of North Dakota and the state Industrial Commission over a state law that can force landowners to take part in an underground CO2 storage project. 
Joining the state in defending its statute are Minnkota Power, Basin Electric Power, Dakota Gasification Co. and Summit Carbon Solutions, the Iowa-based company that has a permit to store millions of tons of carbon dioxide in western North Dakota.
Initial fate of property rights lawsuit now in the hands of a judge

The North Dakota Farm Bureau has joined the landowners in their lawsuit. 
Derrick Braaten, representing the landowners, said the state law authorizing amalgamation — forcing landowners to allow carbon dioxide storage beneath their property if 60% of the landowners agree to a storage project — is unconstitutional and doesn’t allow landowners to use the court system to argue for just compensation. 
Northeast Judicial District Judge Anthony Swain Benson dismissed the lawsuit in August, ruling that a law passed in 2009 could not be challenged because a statute of limitations had expired.  Thursday’s arguments delved into the merits of the case. 
Braaten urged the Supreme Court to overrule the district court on the technicalities. He said the Supreme Court could also rule on the merits of the case or send it back to the district court for further arguments. 
The Supreme Court took the case under advisement. 
Judge dismisses landowner lawsuit against state, citing procedural issues

Summit Carbon Solutions is seeking to use property in Oliver, Mercer and Morton counties for underground CO2 storage. The underground storage area is referred to as pore space.
Phil Axt, representing the state, noted that North Dakota’s geology is exceptionally well suited to underground carbon dioxide storage. He said the state should have the authority to regulate a shared resource. 
He said the case could set a precedent. 
“As far as we’re aware, no other court has yet addressed the pooling of pore space interests and the interplay between individual rights, majority rights and regulatory authority,” Axt said. “We think courts around the country will be answering them, but this court is positioned to be the first.” 
Paul Forster, attorney for Minnkota Power, argued that allowing a small percentage of landowners to stop an underground storage project denies the majority of a right to profit from their property. 
Braaten also argued that state law takes away the right of landowners to challenge the level of compensation if a landowner is forced into a pool. 
He noted the potential revenue for Summit Carbon Solutions if it is able to take advantage of federal tax credit for storing carbon dioxide, which the company hopes to gather from ethanol plants in five Midwest states. 
“They’re making millions, if not billions, of dollars doing it by collecting government tax credits, and they’re saying we don’t get our share of that, even though it’s our property they’re using,” Braaten said. 
Carbon pipeline company seeks dismissals of North Dakota court challenges

About 92% of landowners in the 90,000-acre sequestration area for Summit were participating voluntarily at the time Summit’s storage permit was approved.
Summit Carbon Solutions, which faces a permitting challenge in South Dakota, did not make oral arguments Thursday. Among the arguments Summit made in a brief filed with the court is that the state has a law that forces property owners to participate in oil and gas development.
Braaten argued those property owners are fairly compensated. 
The Northwest Landowners Association successfully challenged a 2019 North Dakota pore space law at the state Supreme Court, with justices finding it unconstitutional. 
Landowners are also appealing the Industrial Commission’s permit decision for the Summit storage area.

,DC,2025-04-17 21:33:59+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Van Hollen: El Salvador soldiers blocked wellness check of wrongly deported man,Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/van-hollen-el-salvador-soldiers-blocked-wellness-check-wrongly-deported-man,,"U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen said Thursday that soldiers blocked him from entering a notorious mega-prison in El Salvador where the erroneously deported Maryland resident Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia has been held for more than a month.The Maryland Democrat arrived in the Central American country Wednesday in an effort to help bring Abrego Garcia, whom the Justice Department admitted in court was deported in error, back to the United States, or at least check on his wellness. He met with El Salvador Vice President Félix Ulloa that day, who denied his requests to either visit or speak on the phone with Abrego Garcia.Van Hollen told reporters Thursday afternoon that he again tried to make contact with Abrego Garcia that morning.A U.S. immigration judge issued a protective order in 2019 finding that sending Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran citizen, back to his home country would put him in grave danger.Accompanied by Chris Newman — the lawyer for Abrego Garcia’s wife and his mother — Van Hollen said they tried to enter Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo, or CECOT, but soldiers stopped them at a checkpoint about three kilometers from the prison.“We were told by the soldiers that they’d been ordered not to allow us to proceed any further than that point,” Van Hollen said.Van Hollen said that since Abrego Garcia was sent to CECOT, he has not spoken with anyone outside of the prison walls, and “this inability to communicate with his lawyers is a violation of international law.”The senator pointed out that El Salvador is a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.“That covenant says, and I quote, ‘A detained or imprisoned person shall be entitled to communicate and consult with his legal counsel,’” he said.Van Hollen also said he met with the U.S. Embassy in El Salvador and they discussed “the full range of important bilateral relations between the United States and El Salvador.”White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt and other Republicans have criticized Van Hollen for making the trip, repeating the accusation that Abrego Garcia is a gang member.Representatives for the White House and DHS did not respond to messages seeking comment Thursday.Appeals court slams administration’s inactionMeanwhile, Abrego Garcia’s case continues to work its way through U.S. courts as a flashpoint conflict between two branches of government that has led to the precipice of a constitutional crisis.On Thursday, a federal appeals court panel dismantled the administration’s latest appeal, saying the government had done “essentially nothing” to attempt to return Abrego Garcia in compliance with last week’s Supreme Court order.A three-judge panel for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit said the executive branch was due deference in conducting foreign policy, but that the administration’s inaction in seeking Abrego Garcia’s return amounted to defiance of a judicial order.The unanimous ruling was written by Fourth Circuit Chief Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III, who was nominated by Republican President Ronald Reagan. The other two judges, Robert Bruce King and Stephanie Thacker, were nominated by Democratic presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama.“The government is asserting a right to stash away residents of this country in foreign prisons without the semblance of due process that is the foundation of our constitutional order. Further, it claims in essence that because it has rid itself of custody that there is nothing that can be done,” the panel wrote. “This should be shocking not only to judges, but to the intuitive sense of liberty that Americans far removed from courthouses still hold dear.”The appeals ruling responded to the government’s appeal of U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis’ order this week for the Trump administration to offer evidence on how it has sought to help with Abrego Garcia’s release from CECOT.The U.S. Supreme Court ruled last week that the Trump administration must “facilitate” — but stopped short of requiring — his return to the United States.In unusually frank language, the Fourth Circuit panel warned Thursday the conflict between the executive and judicial branches threatened the foundation of U.S. government.“If today the Executive claims the right to deport without due process and in disregard of court orders, what assurance will there be tomorrow that it will not deport American citizens and then disclaim responsibility to bring them home?” the court asked. “And what assurance shall there be that the Executive will not train its broad discretionary powers upon its political enemies? The threat, even if not the actuality, would always be present.”Near the end of the order, the panel urged the administration to obey the judicial branch.“We yet cling to the hope that it is not naïve to believe our good brethren in the Executive Branch perceive the rule of law as vital to the American ethos,” the judges wrote. “This case presents their unique chance to vindicate that value and to summon the best that is within us while there is still time.”Neither country taking actionThe Fourth Circuit panel pointed out that the leaders of both the United States and El Salvador claimed they had no power to return Abrego Garcia.“We are told that neither government has the power to act,” they wrote. “The result will be to leave matters generally and Abrego Garcia specifically in an interminable limbo without recourse to law of any sort.”During a White House visit this week, El Salvador President Nayib Bukele said he would not bring Abrego Garcia back to the United States.The Trump administration has admitted in court that Abrego Garcia’s deportation stemmed from an “administrative error.” The administration continues to accuse him of being part of the gang MS-13, despite no charges or convictions of any criminal offenses against him, including gang-related crimes.Jacob Fischler contributed to this report.",,,,2025-04-17 18:08:41.876104

A Navy veteran who calls Myrtle Beach home is running to be the first Democrat in modern history to win South Carolina’s 7th Congressional District.
John Vincent, who retired in 2003 as command master chief petty officer — one of the Navy’s highest ranks for enlisted sailors — planned Thursday evening to launch his 2026 campaign to represent the state’s Grand Strand and much of the Pee Dee.
“Let’s shock the world. Let’s turn a seat blue,” the 64-year-old told the SC Daily Gazette in an interview ahead of his official announcement. “I know we’re going to win.”
Vincent is the first Democratic challenger to file paperwork with the Federal Election Commission for any of South Carolina’s 2026 congressional races. Three Democrats, as well as one Republican, have done so to oppose longtime U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham.
The 7th District, anchored in fast-growing Horry County, has been represented by GOP Rep. Russell Fry since 2022, when he ousted Republican Tom Rice, who angered Republicans in the ruby red district for voting to impeach President Donald Trump in 2021. Fry’s office did not immediately respond to email and phone messages from the Gazette.
“Congressman Fry is doing an awesome job and the party is proud of all he has been able to accomplish!” Abby Zilch, spokeswoman for the state Republican Party said in response to Fry’s challenger.
Vincent said he recognizes he has an uphill battle in a district dominated by Republicans. A Democrat last held the 7th District in the early 1930s, when it dissolved with the state’s loss of population at the time, and its location in the state was completely different.
The closest a Democrat has gotten to winning the seat since South Carolina gained it back with the 2010 census was in 2012, the first election with the recrafted 7th District. That year, Democrat Gloria Bromell Tinubu received 44% of the vote to Rice.
Fry won re-election in November with 65% of the vote, the most decisive win for the seat this century.
“Our turnout has not been strong. Apathy has been high,” Vincent said of Democrats.
“In order to win, about 15% of people who voted for my opponent are going to have to vote for me,” he added. “Not stay home, but vote for me.”
Vincent pointed out that the Pee Dee region struggles with poverty. Chesterfield, Marlboro, Dillon and Marion counties are among the state’s poorest, according to the most recent numbers from the state Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Office.
Vincent said he can represent those voters as someone who understands the challenges of day-to-day life.
“I’ve never been rich, and I’ve been lucky to never be poor,” he said.
Vincent says on his campaign website that he’s struggled with alcoholism (he’s more than two decades sober) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD.
He hopes transparency and a desire to be represented by an “average Joe” will carry him past Fry, who was a state legislator and lawyer before ascending to national politics.
Vincent called his ability to connect with people his “superpower.”
Vincent will hold town halls twice a month until the November 2026 election, he said.
He described himself as an advocate of abortion rights, saying those decisions should be fully up to patients and their doctor.
He also wrote a book with his wife about leadership through diversity and inclusion that draws on lessons from his time in the military. He’s in favor of a pathway to citizenship for immigrants without proper authorization — as long as they don’t have a criminal record. He says gender is each person’s own business.
He also supports a $15-an-hour federal minimum wage. South Carolina doesn’t have a state minimum wage, so the minimum is set by the federal standard, which has been $7.25 an hour since 2009.
Vincent said those views aren’t too liberal for South Carolina, where voters in November gave the Legislature their largest GOP majority since Reconstruction and no Democrat has won any statewide office since 2006. He believes the reason Democrats have failed is because they haven’t focused on the economic issues that matter most to voters.
“That’s why the middle class is going ‘ehhh, I need a job here,’” he said. “It just seems like they don’t really understand what’s going on in our life.”
He then pointed to his campaign slogan: “Warrior-advocate for the middle class and most vulnerable.”
It’s not a cliche; it genuinely represents him, he said.
He carries a concealed weapon and wants to invest in technology to make the border stronger, he told the Gazette. “Core pillars” of his campaign include protecting veterans, as well as federal programs such as Medicare and Medicaid that are intended to help the working class cover necessary costs.
While Vincent, who owns a leadership and organizational consulting firm, condemns the aggressive slashing of jobs touted by President Donald Trump and spearheaded by the Department of Government Efficiency, a balanced budget is another “core pillar” of his campaign, he says.
“You do it strategically,” Vincent said. You do it in a “way that’s responsible,” adding that his company helps other businesses operate efficiently.
During his own town hall Wednesday, Fry said he will continue being one of Trump’s biggest allies in congress, The Sun News reported.
“This district is a very conservative district, and that’s what they elected me to do. And he has not wasted any time in getting our country back on track,” the 40-year-old incumbent said.
Fry has $625,000 available in his campaign account, according to his latest Federal Election Commission filings.
Vincent officially filed his campaign paperwork on March 13 and had $7,500 at the end of the month. He said his campaign is up to $30,000 as of Thursday. He estimates he’ll need only $300,000 to win, saying he knows he won’t be able to outspend Fry and doesn’t need to.
“You don’t need a million and a half (dollars),” he said. “If you’re willing to connect with people and you’re willing to tell the truth, even though they may not like it, that’s how you do it.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/John-Vincent_headshot.jpg,,,2025-04-17 18:08:41.876104

The gift also endows and renames the Nuremberg to The Hague (N2H) Program in honor of Howard A. Kaiman, a Creighton alumnus.
Samuel and Ida Kaiman, both Omaha natives, were Donna’s parents. Howard, a lifelong Omahan and attorney, was Donna’s brother. Family members said Howard took night law classes at Creighton in the 1960s, during an antisemitic period when Jews were being denied by country clubs and colleges.
Before he died in 2023 at age 93, Howard Kaiman asked his family to distribute his estate to worthy causes.

Donna (Kaiman) Gilbert, in a media statement, said the program funding would help continue the good deeds and community work carried out by her parents and brother. She also said the new center and the N2H program would help keep the memory of the Holocaust alive for new generations. The Nazi regime and their allies killed about 6 million Jewish people in the genocide known as the Holocaust, 1933 to 1945.
“They will challenge them never to forget that this happened and that it can happen again, very easily, if we don’t remember,” said Gilbert.
Michael Kelly, Creighton law professor and director of N2H, said the endowment and center have “forever changed how we teach the Holocaust, genocide and international criminal justice at Creighton.”
Every summer for more than a decade, the N2H program has taken up to 30 students to Germany, the Netherlands and Poland to learn firsthand about the Holocaust. The news release describes the program as an immersion into historical and legal experiences that combine classroom instruction with trips to crime scenes, places of conspiracy and trials for crimes against humanity being litigated today.

The endowment ensures the perpetuity of the N2H program, Creighton officials said, and the new research hub builds upon and broadens its impact and influence.
“The center also provides us the invaluable opportunity to explore more deeply the international atrocities taking place today, and the courts tasked with litigating them,” Kelly said.
He said the center could bring in world-renowned attorneys to speak about genocide litigation, explore cases being tried in the International Criminal Court of Justice and examine the genocide of the Rohingya in Burma, the Kurds in Iraq and other repressed people worldwide.

For decades, until his retirement in 2016, Sevheen worked closely with the study team while coordinating grizzly bear recovery for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
“It’s functionally destroying the organization,” Servheen said April 3. “The study team has been in place since 1970 — over 50 years of work and experience and knowledge. It’s going to just disappear and die.”

Servheen’s perplexed about what the Trump administration has to gain.
“How could anybody be so negligent and vile that they’re trying to destroy something that has brought grizzly bears back from the edge of extinction?” he said. “Why would you do that? It’s just so destructive.”
Led by Elon Musk, the Department of Government Efficiency’s dismantling started with a hiring freeze. Longtime supervisory wildlife biologist Mark Haroldson retired, and his position is not being filled, according to Servheen. Then, the team’s longtime leader, Frank van Manen, announced an earlier-than-desired retirement.
“He didn’t want to leave,” Servheen said of van Manen, who declined to comment.

According to Servheen, van Manen’s departure was related to the federal government’s ongoing upheaval.
“They’re putting fear into people,” Servheen said. “That’s basically evil, to do that to hard-working people who have been civil servants for decades.”
 What are the responsibilities of the Interagency Grizzly Bear Study Team?

The Interagency Grizzly Bear Study Team is part of the U.S. Geological Survey, and its website lists four other employees. Three are technicians, which are often seasonal, entry-level employees. The remaining staff biologist has been in the job about three years.










“They’re putting fear into people. That’s basically evil, to do that to hard-working people who have been civil servants for decades.”

If any of the study team’s employees opt to stick it out amid a second wave of buyouts, they’re likely to be out of an office space come fall. The Northern Rocky Mountain Science Center, described by its director as “one of the nation’s key laboratories to study the ecosystems and species of the Northern Rockies,” is one of hundreds of federal facilities being shuttered by DOGE.
Although located in Bozeman, many of the federal facility’s researchers do work in Wyoming.
“They do all kinds of other stuff: brucellosis and chronic wasting disease and aquatic species,” Servheen said. “It’s a huge science center.”
The planned closure has elicited protests. According to Yellowstonian.org, 42 retired or active biologists petitioned Montana’s congressional delegation to use their influence to “protect [the science center] and its employees from these unwarranted attacks by DOGE.”
Federal offices located in Wyoming have not escaped the closures. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s tribal-focused Lander conservation office and a USGS Cheyenne water science station are among those that have been marked for the chopping block.
WyoFile could not officially confirm impacts to the Interagency Grizzly Bear Study Team. Federal agencies under the Trump administration have declined or not responded to WyoFile’s requests for more information on downsizing and office closures. An inquiry to a USGS public affairs officer on Thursday yielded no information about the matter.
The Center for Biological Diversity has been pressing the federal agency for details as well. On Thursday, the environmental advocacy organization publicized a Freedom of Information Act request to gain more insight into the future of the federal grizzly team.

 The foundation of Yellowstone grizzly bear recovery

Nevertheless, Servheen worries that the hit to the science team could trickle down to the grizzly population — estimated at 1,000 or so bears in the Greater Yellowstone — that it’s charged with studying.
Over the decades, federal researchers have played a pivotal role in improving understanding of the region’s bruins, including completing studies that have helped make the case that grizzly bears are fully recovered and no longer require Endangered Species Act protection. They’ve also amassed mortality and other demographic datasets and compiled an annual report.
“The foundation of Yellowstone grizzly bear recovery has been built on science,” Servheen said. “Removing that science eliminates our ability to maintain Yellowstone grizzly bears.”

The leadership award was created in 2015 by ICAN and Kiewit Corp. to recognize leaders who live and lead through collaboration, compassion, confidence and creativity.
Brewer over 28 years has risen from Habitat volunteer to CEO.
“Through her efforts to increase affordable housing and empower families to achieve homeownership, Amanda Brewer is setting the standard for how leaders can ideate, collaborate and break down barriers,” said Aileen Warren, CEO of ICAN.
Brewer’s nomination recognized her collaborative approach. Recent examples cited in a news release include a partnership with Metonic Real Estate Solutions and Apogee Professional Services to create apartments and affordable homes in northwest Omaha that will be in reach of workers. Habitat also hosts clinics on transferring deeds that helped 362 families secure nearly $77 million in generational wealth.
Through a donation from MacKenzie Scott’s Yield Giving fund, Brewer also is helping to establish a coalition among Habitat for Humanity affiliates across the state to address workforce and affordable housing needs.
Habitat Omaha is described as the nation’s top Habitat affiliate based on the number of people it serves. Agency goals include wealth-building, reducing the impact of out-of-state investors who buy properties in Nebraska, payday lending reform and vacant and rental property registration.
Said Brewer: “We know the need for affordable housing is great, and our commitment to making a meaningful impact is stronger than ever.”

Laura Kelly, who signed a bill in May 2022 legalizing sports betting in Kansas, placed the state's first bet in September of that year on the Kansas City Chiefs.(Submitted)TOPEKA — Approval of a last-minute addition to Kansas’ state budget took the gambling and sports betting sphere by surprise, leaving the future of the industry in the state uncertain.
The Kansas Legislature Friday passed the state budget bill, which included a provision that bans the Kansas Lottery, the agency that oversees gambling in the state, from spending state money to negotiate any renewals, extensions or new contracts with sports wagering operators until July 2026.
Jeremy Kudon, a lobbyist who had a hand in ushering in gambling’s new era of sports wagering in the United States, took to the social media platform X to assure bettors that their online sports betting operators would remain in Kansas — for now.
“Just want to clarify: None of the leading OSB operators in Kansas will go dark as a result of today’s vote,” Kudon wrote in a post.
Most contracts with the state lottery are valid until 2027, he said.
“But I wouldn’t let the Kansas legislature off so easy. They had no idea when these contracts expired and were willing to take your favorite OSB apps away from Kansans. We’re not going to let that happen,” Kudon wrote.
Kansans over 21 years old can bet on badminton, bull riding and 50 other categories of live and virtual sports. Since 2022, after the passage of Senate Bill 84, the state recruited six sports wager operators: BetMGM, Caesar’s, DraftKings, ESPNBet, FanDuel and Fanatics. Each of those contracts, which include retail and mobile betting, are set to expire at the same time in August 2027.
Historically, the Kansas Lottery negotiated the contracts and went through an approval process with the Kansas Attorney General’s Office.
The Legislature’s moratorium, which will apply to fiscal years 2025 and 2026, could open up Kansas’ sports betting market to new regulations or more influence from state lawmakers if they decide to take up the issue in the 2026 session. Among possible changes, one option is an increase in the share of money the state collects from sports wagering revenues. The state currently collects 10% of all revenue from both mobile and retail platforms. 
Sports wagering is legal in 39 states and the District of Columbia. Missouri voters narrowly approved in November a constitutional amendment to legalize sports betting online, in casinos and in certain districts near major sports arenas. The rollout was scheduled for this summer, but the state has delayed it until the fall to allow for time to straighten out licensing rules.
Legalized gambling in Kansas dates back to 1986, when more than 60% of voters approved a constitutional amendment to establish a state-run lottery. A year later, the Legislature passed the Kansas Lottery Act. 
The Legislature this year authorized a gaming compact between the governor’s office and the Sac and Fox Nation of Missouri in Kansas and Nebraska to allow sports betting at the Sac & Fox Casino in Powhattan. In 2024, the Legislature approved a sports betting compact for the Iowa Tribe of Kansas and Nebraska’s White Cloud Casino in White Cloud and did the same in 2023 for the Prairie Band Casino Resort in Mayetta, which is owned by the Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/kelly-sports-gambling.png,,,2025-04-17 18:08:41.876104

(Getty Images)Kentucky Auditor Allison Ball plans to investigate how the state’s Office of Medical Cannabis (OMC) processed license applications, she announced Thursday. 
Ball’s office will be “examining OMC’s business license application and award processes,” her office said. 
“My office has continued to receive complaints about how the Office of Medical Cannabis administered the lottery process for awarding medical cannabis business licenses,” Ball, a Republican, said in a statement. “Kentuckians should have confidence that state offices operate with transparency and integrity, and my office is committed to ensuring those standards.”
Crystal Staley, a spokeswoman for Beshear, said “no one has filed a legal claim challenging Kentucky’s medical cannabis laws or the Office of Medical Cannabis’ regulations.”
“Throughout the entire process we have been committed to transparency, which is why the lottery process was streamed live and online,” Staley said. “The individuals who have come forward to express ‘concerns’ went through the full process and did not complain until after not being selected in the lottery.” 
In 2023, the legislature legalized medical marijuana for Kentuckians suffering from chronic illnesses. Last year, the bipartisan House Bill 829 became law and moved up the medical cannabis licensing timeline from January 2025 to July 1, 2024. 
During the application period, which was July 1–Aug. 31, the state received 4,998 applications for medical cannabis business licenses, including 918 cultivator and processor applications. 
Patients who qualify for medical cannabis are those with a history of post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), cancer or other approved medical conditions. 
The Kentucky Lottery Corporation ran the license lottery. 
Beshear said Thursday during his weekly press conference that “more than 12,000 Kentuckians have received a written certification and more than 8,000 have successfully applied for and received a medical cannabis card” since January.

Raj Mukherji intends to crack down on people who threaten judges at a time when judges say attacks on them are growing. (Photo by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)A state senator wants to toughen penalties against people who threaten judges and prosecutors in New Jersey, with attacks on judges escalating as the Trump administration feuds with courts from coast to coast.
Sen. Raj Mukherji (D-Hudson) said he was driven to act after U.S. District Judge Esther Salas revealed recently that judges around the U.S. have received unsolicited pizza deliveries sent in the name of her son Daniel Anderl, who was gunned down in 2020 at the family’s home by an angry litigant.
“These are unprecedented attacks on judicial officers,” Salas told MSNBC in several weekend appearances on the news network.
Under a bill Mukherji plans to introduce, it would become a second-degree crime — with a presumption of incarceration — to threaten, harass, intimidate, or dox local, county, state and federal judges and prosecutors over their work performance.
The offense would be upgraded to a first-degree crime if it occurs at or within 500 feet of the home of a prosecutor, judge, or their immediate family members. That includes sending items or messages to a home protected under Daniel’s Law, which legislators passed after Anderl’s murder to prohibit the disclosure of public officials’ home addresses and phone numbers.
“In a democracy, disagreement is fair game, but intimidation and violence are not. They must be confronted swiftly and without hesitation with the full weight of the law,” Mukherji said in a statement. “Judges and prosecutors must be free to perform their public duties without looking over their shoulders or worrying about the safety of their families. At a time when the independence of the judiciary is under attack and violence is on the rise, we must draw a hard line to protect those who serve justice.”
President Donald Trump, administration officials, and some members of Congress have personally attacked judges they disagree with in recent weeks on social media and in personal appearances.
That has resulted in a sharp uptick in threats to judges, including pizza deliveries to jurists’ homes by people who have “weaponized” Anderl’s name, Salas said. The ominous deliveries send a clear message, she added: “Do you want to end up like Judge Salas? Do you want to end up like her son?”
She urged other states to shield judges’ personally identifiable information, as New Jersey legislators did with Daniel’s Law, and officials at all levels to condemn attacks on the judiciary.
“Whether it be attacks that come in the form of some of our members of Congress calling for our impeachment because we’re doing our jobs, members of this administration calling us rogue, calling us crazy, leftist, unconstitutional judges, or coming in the forms of these acts of intimidation, these are unprecedented times that really call for us to speak up for the judiciary, to speak up for justice,” Salas said.

Bahl has missed 10 days of the legislative session. (Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota lawmakers will be paid at least $41,500 for absences during the 2025 legislative session so far, though most legislators with more than a handful of missed days said they were due to family or medical reasons, military service or their jobs.
Rep. Lori VanWinkle, R-Minot, said earlier this week she felt singled out by criticism from the House majority leader over taking five days off to go on a vacation. Five lawmakers have missed six or more days during the legislative session, including VanWinkle, who has missed  seven days of the session.
In total, 84 lawmakers of the Legislature’s combined 141-member body were absent for at least one day since the session began in early January. They accumulated 195 missed legislative days as of Thursday, according to Legislative Council. The North Dakota Monitor excluded from the analysis the absences of Rep. Josh Christy, who died in office in February.
North Dakota lawmaker defends absence as she’s urged to go without pay for vacation

Legislators are paid for days they are absent unless they ask Legislative Council to withhold their pay, said Legislative Council Director John Bjornson. They are paid $213 per calendar day during the legislative session, with committee chairs and other leadership positions earning slightly more. That’s in addition to a monthly salary of $592.
Rep. Landon Bahl, R-Grand Forks, has missed the most with 10 days, according to Legislative Council. Bahl missed the week of March 31 to lobby for fraternities in Washington, D.C., on business not related to the state Legislature, but will receive $1,065 in legislative pay for those five days.
Bahl also has missed days for reasons related to his job. He said his situation is unique because he is the chief operating officer for 322 Hospitality Group, which oversees more than 250 employees across eight different restaurants, hotels and event centers.
“District 17 voted me in as a business operator,” Bahl said. “I always have two laptops because I’m constantly emailing … and bouncing back and forth because that’s my job and this is a part-time citizen Legislature.”

On Monday, House Majority Leader Mike Lefor, R-Dickinson, said he suggested that VanWinkle voluntarily give back the $1,065 in legislative pay she received while on a family vacation. Lefor said he didn’t have the authority to withhold a lawmaker’s pay.
House and Senate rules, however, appear to conflict with state statute. 
North Dakota Century Code states members of the Legislature are “entitled” to receive compensation. 
But House and Senate rules state legislators may not be absent during an entire day “unless unable to attend due to illness or other cause.” The rules also say “no one is entitled to draw pay while absent more than one day without leave.”
Lefor and Senate Majority Leader David Hogue, R-Minot, referred questions on the rules to Bjornson.
Bjornson said he was unsure when the absence rules were first added to the chamber rule books, but they were included in every rule book going as far back as 1957, the oldest rule book on his office shelf.
The presiding officer of the chamber, either the speaker of the House or the president of the Senate, signs payment vouchers for the lawmakers, Bjornson said. If the presiding officer and the majority leader of the chamber told the Legislative Council not to pay someone, they would follow that direction, Bjornson said.
North Dakota lawmakers serve up to 80 days every two years. Thursday was day 64 of the session.
Lefor said earlier this week he thinks it’s inappropriate for a lawmaker to take vacation during a legislative session. VanWinkle defended her absence to spend time with her family and said she thinks the criticism is unfair. She declined additional comment on Wednesday.
  Rep. Jayme Davis, D-Rolette. (Photo provided by the North Dakota Legislative Assembly)
Rep. Jayme Davis, D-Rolette, has missed nine days during the legislative session. Absences early in the session were due to the death of her father. More recently, she said she has missed days to drive her mother from Rolette to Bismarck for medical appointments.
“As much as I want a vacation, I’m here to do a job that I was elected to do,” Davis said. “Unless it’s literally life or death, it’s probably the only reason I would miss.”
Rep. Alisa Mitskog, D-Wahpeton, and Rep. Matt Ruby, R-Minot, have each missed six days.
Mitskog said her absences were related to medical reasons for herself and her family. She said her husband is battling cancer that requires appointments in Minneapolis and she attends when possible so she can ask questions. Her elderly mother also needed to be driven to appointments in Fargo that were set up months in advance.
“They weren’t vacation days,” Mitskog said.
Ruby said his absences were due to National Guard training and because his son had surgery. He said he communicated every absence to chamber leadership, which he said is important for planning which bills come to the floor for votes.
“I certainly wasn’t taking vacation,” Ruby said.
Ruby said he does not think the policy surrounding legislative absences needs to be changed because he doesn’t believe people are abusing it, for the most part.
“Sometimes you have doctor’s appointments you have to get done,” Ruby said. “Sometimes you shouldn’t be sitting shoulder to shoulder with someone if you are sick … but it’s expected to be here if you can, and we’re all adults here.”

Spencer Cox asked the Trump administration for more information on the criteria officials are using to select the students who seem to have to suddenly leave the country, some without finishing their programs. 
Since many of the students and universities didn’t receive notices on their status change, Cox also asked the federal government for a “little bit of a heads up when these things are happening,” he said during his monthly news conference broadcast by PBS Utah.

“We’d like to understand better what the criteria are for those changes. Certainly, we know that there were some that had criminal backgrounds that we were not aware of, that the universities were not aware of,” Cox said. “(With) others, that does not appear to be the case, and so we would very much like to figure that out.”
Officers from all public universities in Utah reported over 50 cases of students that had their visas revoked or their Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) records terminated. Many didn’t release much information to protect the students’ privacy. But, the University of Utah, host of 20 of the impacted students, specified that approximately half of the affected students are from China, a spokesperson said in an email. The other half are from several countries including India and some Middle Eastern countries.
Dozens of international University of Utah students had visas revoked

At Brigham Young University, a private Utah institution, a student from Japan had his visa revoked, potentially for a fishing licensing violation that happened years ago and was dismissed, according to the Deseret News. 
The wave of visa revocations has instilled confusion on campuses throughout the country. 
At the University of Utah “a few university students’ changes in status have not been connected to a clear, specific interaction with law enforcement,” leaders of the institution said in a statement. And none were flagged for participating in protests, a spokesperson said.
There are many unanswered questions still about these cases, but in the meantime, Cox said he hopes the country can keep on attracting talent from abroad, referring to past comments from President Donald Trump on his interest to bring bright minds to American institutions. 
“We know how important those visas are and how important immigrants are to building our economy,” Cox said. 
For the time being the Trump administration hasn’t gotten back to the governor, but, Cox said, there are ongoing conversations on how to keep attracting international students while checking their backgrounds.



Let us know what you think...


 


“It’s important that we vet those who come, that we make sure we understand their backgrounds, that they don’t pose any threats, that they’re supportive of our country and the work that’s being done here,” Cox said. “And then it’s important that we get them and we keep them.”
When asked on whether there’s a constitutional crisis with the Trump administration ignoring orders to return Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a man deported to a prison in El Salvador, even though he was shielded from deportation in 2019, Cox said that this is an interesting constitutional struggle.
“The problem with this is there’s just no nuance in the discussions. It’s like, either you hate the Constitution, or you want terrorists living in America, it seems like those are the two choices,” Cox said.
But, there may be a third option, he added. One in which Abrego Garcia returns to get through the process to get deported again. 
“It really does matter that we hold to these constitutional norms, but pushing the boundaries of those norms is the prerogative, and was intended (…) It’s not the worst thing to challenge those norms, see where the lines are and then work within those lines,” he said.”

Trump and his administration.
Hundreds of protestors at the University of Connecticut and Yale University gathered to oppose what they called an attack on higher education — including recent suspensions of research funding, cancellations of international student visas and what some see as a failure on the part of local officials to respond.
Chants of “Hands off our university!” rung out.

At Yale, roughly 500 faculty, students and community members gathered on the quad known as Cross Campus. Attendees held signs reading “Protect higher ed everywhere” and “Education not deportation.” About 60 miles northeast, more than 200 people at UConn’s Storrs campus participated in a similar effort, part of a national “Day of Action for Higher Ed,” organized locally by chapters of the American Association of University Professors.
According to organizers, the “day of action” included more than 175 gatherings around the country, including at Harvard University which has recently been at the center of standoffs with the Trump administration after threats to end the university’s ability to enroll international students and revoke its tax-exempt status.
“As we see universities across this nation speaking to our shared values, I know more than that ignorance is deadly, but that courage is contagious,” Phillip Atiba Solomon, chair of Yale’s department of African American studies, said while addressing the crowd in New Haven.
In Storrs, Chris Vials, an English professor and union president of UConn-AAUP, said, “We are facing a federal government that wants to do us harm, a federal government that is deporting students from this campus, a federal government that is cutting life saving research, a federal government that hates diversity … and a federal government that’s not even obeying the law.”
The rallies come as details emerge about international students at colleges and universities around the country seeing their visa status terminated by the Trump administration. In Connecticut, more than 50 students have had their visas revoked.
“The truth is students and workers across campus are scared for themselves and their friends, scared to go to class in case they get abducted by ICE, scared to be associated with anything vaguely political, scared to be here today,” said Lily Lou, a UConn political science graduate student. 
“How are any of us expected to learn, teach or work in these conditions?” Lou said.

Student visas
Earlier this week, UConn confirmed that 13 students had their visas revoked, including six undergraduates, six graduate students and one person in a post-graduate professional program. The Connecticut Conference of Independent Colleges, which represents 14 higher education institutions, said at least 40 visas had been terminated among students at its member schools — which include Yale University, Trinity College, Quinnipiac University and Wesleyan University.
The revocations are part of a government effort that has left hundreds of students across the country at risk for deportation.

U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said Thursday he’d sent a letter to the Trump administration demanding details on how many visas had been revoked and guidance on what those students should do next.
“There’s been no due process, no apparent rights of appeal, no disclosure by this administration,” Blumenthal said on Thursday morning during a press conference at New Haven City Hall before heading to UConn to share similar sentiments. “I want the facts and I want the revocations to stop until they come clean with the American people about why these revocations are taking place.”

Later in the day, faculty at Yale described what they see as a “chilling effect” the administration’s actions have had on institutions of higher learning. 
“Who is safe in this environment?” Kishwar Rizvi, a professor at the school of architecture, asked the crowd.
At UConn, Alexander Blagojevic, a biomedical engineering graduate student at UConn, echoed sentiments from Blumenthal and Rizvi. “The brightest minds in the world used to dream about coming here and calling this country home because they knew that this was a place you could come to make a difference,” he said.
“Now, all they dream about is jumping ship.”

Sen. Henri Martin, R-Bristol, ranking member of the Connecticut legislature’s Higher Education and Employment Advancement Committee, said Blumenthal “is seeking more information from DHS and the State Department about the revocations. He is right to pursue that clarity and get the facts in order to ensure fairness in the process, as our colleges continue to monitor the situation and provide guidance for students.”
Senate President Pro Tem Martin M. Looney, D-New Haven, and Senate Majority Leader Bob Duff, D-Norwalk, said in a joint statement that they “stand with the UConn and Yale communities and share their outrage at the unprecedented and ongoing Republican attacks on higher education, scientific research, freedom of speech, and human rights.”
“The students and faculty who are protesting in peaceful defiance of these senseless and often cruel actions should be commended for their conviction,” the joint statement read.

Research funding
Rally-goes and lawmakers also spoke out about the Trump administration’s cuts to scientific research funding. 
The National Institutes of Health has terminated nearly 800 research grants at academic institutions across the country. Last month, NIH announced that the funding it provides to grantees for “indirect costs” — like laboratory, utility and administrative personnel costs — would be limited to 15% of the grant award. Currently, the average indirect cost rate is between 27% and 28%, though some organizations have rates that are much higher, according to the agency.
Connecticut joined 21 other states in filing a lawsuit against the Trump administration shortly after the cuts were announced. In April, a federal judge permanently blocked implementation of the cuts, but the administration is now appealing that decision. 
Blumenthal spoke about the critical role that NIH funding has played in advancing life-saving treatments. “Many illnesses, including aids and breast cancer, kill far fewer Americans now than they did 30 years ago, due to medical advancements developed at our universities. Technological innovations made in engineering labs across the country have grown our economy year after year.” 
Jeff Wickersham, a professor of medicine who’s been at Yale for 15 years working on HIV treatment and prevention, told the crowd on the Cross Campus quad that in March of this year he’d received his first ever NIH grant termination notice. 
“There is a chokehold on funding right now,” Wickersham said. “Only 50% of the funds that should have been awarded so far this year have been awarded, and we are here today to say: No. Stop this.”

Cuts to medical research also resonated at UConn, where Blagojevic said he feared what it could mean for people like him. As a cancer survivor, he said, “every single drug in my chemo regimen was developed in full or in part by NIH research.”
“So thank God that Republicans didn’t cut NIH 20 years ago because I would be dead right now,” Blagojevic said. “We’re not just talking about numbers on a spreadsheet. We’re not just talking about numbers on a budget report. These are human lives. These are our futures.”
Adam McCready, who works within UConn’s Neag School of Education, said his department is also facing cuts. His team had been working on research regarding the connection between student technology and digital literacy, school intervention and the impact on academic outcomes for middle schoolers, but the work was cut short abruptly and without notice, he said.
“Our work and some of our team members livelihoods are in jeopardy, all because it was deemed wasteful spending,” McCready said before leading a chant. 
“No research, no knowledge, no progress,” the crowd shouted.

(File/Getty Images)COLUMBIA — Teachers are celebrating near-passage of a South Carolina bill advocates have been pushing for years as a major help in recruiting and retaining educators.
The bill, dubbed the “Educator Assistance Act,” received unanimous approval from senators Wednesday, marking the first time it’s gotten a vote in the chamber.
The legislation will not only significantly improve teachers’ lives but send the message that legislators respect teachers as professionals, supporters said.
“This is a huge win,” said Patrick Kelly, a high school teacher who lobbies for the Palmetto State Teachers Association. “I cannot overstate how big of a win this will be for teachers’ working conditions.”
If the House, which again approved the legislation earlier this year, agrees to the Senate’s changes, the bill will head to Gov. Henry McMaster’s desk.
Its main sponsor, Rep. Shannon Erickson — the Beaufort Republican who leads the House’s education committee — said she’s hopeful that’s what will happen.
The House passed a different version of the bill last session, and legislators have proposed parts of it to varying levels of success over the past several years. The Senate didn’t take up the bill last year mainly because of timing issues, not because senators didn’t support the idea, said Sen. Greg Hembree, chair of the Senate Education Committee.
“It’s good all-around for the teachers and the students,” said Hembree, R-Little River. “I’m glad we got it done.”
As teacher pay has risen in recent years, the number of teacher vacancies in the state has dropped, though it remains far above the number reported before the COVID-19 pandemic, according to the state’s Center for Educator Recruitment, Retention, and Advancement. While pay is a major issue for teachers, hiring and keeping people in teaching jobs will require more than increasing minimum salaries, Kelly said.
In talking to teachers over the years, Kelly has heard three major complaints from teachers beyond compensation: more support, more planning time and more respect. Many districts have already implemented parts of the bill, but requiring it across the board will help teachers in districts without such policies, he said.
SC bill would require schools to excuse some extracurricular absences

A major piece of the bill is requiring school districts to include a teacher’s expected minimum salary in their contract. Because those contracts are due May 10, before legislators pass their final budget and school districts have decided how much to pay teachers, most educators sign on without knowing how much they’ll get paid.
“I can’t think of any other profession where signing a contract without knowing your salary would be acceptable,” Kelly said.
The bill would also not allow district officials to reassign a teacher to another school or subject during the school year with less than five school days of notice unless the superintendent can prove it’s for a good reason. That gives teachers peace of mind knowing they’ll be teaching the class for which they signed up, advocates have said.
Teachers would also get guaranteed planning time under the bill. Current law allows districts to give teachers up to two days of planning, but it’s not required, meaning many districts eat up that time with professional development meetings, advocates have said. The proposal would set aside two days free of meetings for teachers to plan.
That change may not seem like much, but it makes a world of difference for teachers preparing for a new year, Kelly said.
“That is critically important to making sure efficient instruction can happen on day one,” Kelly said.
When teachers do have to attend professional development trainings, the bill would allow them to count those hours toward the 120 continuing education credits they’re required to obtain every five years in order to renew their teaching certificates. Requiring both has created a process advocates have said is often redundant and time-consuming.
“To stop the merry-go-round of having to deal with your certification is a huge, huge step,” Erickson said.
The biggest change senators made to the bill would allow teachers to move to a different part of the state without breaking their contract.
Currently, teachers who move after signing their contract can lose their ability to teach for up to a year. That meant teachers who needed to move for personal reasons, such as a spouse taking a job in a different part of the state, had to choose between finding a way to stay or being unable to teach that school year, teachers’ advocates have said.
One part of the bill that stood out to Hembree would allow teachers to donate their unused sick days to other colleagues. When he was solicitor in Horry and Georgetown counties, his office used a similar program. When two of his employees were diagnosed with cancer, they found the extra sick days invaluable, he said.
“That’s not going to come up a lot, but boy, when it does, it can make a difference in someone’s life,” Hembree said.
Teachers’ advocates said the bill is a major step forward, but they want to see more in future years.
Changing policies means little without good leadership, Kelly said. He encouraged legislators to continue finding ways to recruit and train principals and superintendents who can support the teachers in their schools.
Sherry East, president of the South Carolina Education Association, said she’d like to see longer windows for teachers to break their contracts and move to a different district, since job openings are often not posted until after the signing deadline, she said.
“We like it,” East said of the bill. “It could’ve gone a little further, but it’s definitely a step in the right direction.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/admin-ajax-2.jpeg,,,2025-04-17 17:12:20.968408
,DC,2025-04-17 20:54:31+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,U.S. Supreme Court to hear case on Trump’s birthright citizenship order,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-supreme-court-hear-case-trumps-birthright-citizenship-order,,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Supreme Court announced Thursday it will hear oral arguments next month over President Donald Trump’s efforts to restructure birthright citizenship, though the justices won’t decide on the merits of the case just yet. Instead, they will choose whether to leave in place nationwide injunctions from lower courts that so far have blocked the Trump administration from implementing the executive order.The oral arguments, scheduled for May 15, will likely provide the first indication of whether any of the nine justices are interested in revisiting the Court’s interpretation of the 14th Amendment, which was ratified in 1868 following the Civil War.The amendment states that “all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.”The Supreme Court ruled in 1898 in United States v. Wong Kim Ark that the 14th Amendment guarantees any child born in the United States is entitled to U.S. citizenship, even if their parents are not citizens.Trump disagrees with that ruling and signed an executive order on his first day in office seeking to change which babies born in the United States become citizens. If that order were implemented, babies whose parents were “unlawfully present in the United States” or whose parents’ presence “was lawful but temporary” would not be eligible for citizenship.Several organizations and Democratic attorneys general filed lawsuits seeking to block the executive order, leading to nationwide injunctions against its implementation.Last month, the Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to intervene in the lower court’s nationwide injunctions, limiting them to the organizations and states that filed suit.The three cases are Trump v. State of Washington, Trump v. CASA, Inc. and Trump v. State of New Jersey.LegislationNationwide injunctions by lower court judges have become an issue for Republicans in Congress as well as the Trump administration.Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley introduced a bill in Congress that would bar federal district court judges from being able to implement nationwide injunctions.“We all have to agree to give up the universal injunction as a weapon against policies we disagree with,” Grassley said during a hearing earlier this month. “The damage it causes to the judicial system and to our democracy is too great.”",,,,2025-04-17 17:12:20.968408

The […],"Wisconsin Elections Commissioner Robert Spindell arrives at Milwaukee Central Count with Sen. Ron Johnson (Photo | Isiah Holmes)Wisconsin Elections Commission (WEC) Chair Ann Jacobs said at a meeting Thursday that the body is still investigating how the City of Madison lost nearly 200 ballots during the 2024 presidential election. 
The city of Madison announced in late December that 193 unprocessed absentee ballots had been found in the weeks following the election. The discovered ballots weren’t enough to sway the results of any contests, but WEC began an investigation into the error to determine what caused it and how similar mistakes can be prevented in future elections. 
On Thursday, Jacobs said that she and Republican commissioner Don Millis had already taken depositions of former Madison city clerk Maribeth Witzel-Behl and members of her staff but that there was more work to be done and depositions to conduct with employees of Madison and Dane County. She added that those other interviews were delayed until after the April 1 election. 
Witzel-Behl, who had already been on administrative leave during the spring elections, resigned from her position as Madison city clerk earlier this week after nearly two decades in the role during which time she oversaw more than 60 elections. 
Jacobs said the investigation has already highlighted ways the state can improve its absentee ballot processes. 
“On a positive note, I do think the information we’re learning from the work we’ve done so far will help inform some best practices for tracking absentee ballots, making sure all absentee ballots are counted timely, and as we move to amend our manuals and update them … I really do think that what we’ve learned is going to help us do a better job there on some of that absentee ballot processing,” she said. 
After the update on the investigation, Republican commissioner Robert Spindell began remarks that devolved into a shouting match with Jacobs. 
Spindell began by noting how long Witzel-Behl had been the Madison clerk. 
“I think it’s fine that we’re doing this investigation of the city of Madison, or the misplacement of some [193] ballots and then not properly following through when they were found,” he said. “But I do want to commend the Madison clerk for her 20-plus years service.” 
Spindell then transitioned into what he said he believes is a “more serious problem” — some Milwaukee polling places running out of ballots during the April 1 election. On Election Day earlier this month, seven polling sites ran out of ballots, causing city officials to scramble to replenish supplies. The delay caused long lines to form at some polls. 
City election officials said they generally determine how many ballots to print and distribute to poll locations by assessing voter turnout in previous similar elections. But this year Wisconsin and Milwaukee broke turnout records for a spring election. 
A former member of the Milwaukee Elections Commission who previously sparked controversy when he celebrated and took credit for the low turnout among Black voters in the 2022 midterm elections, Spindell has often been extremely critical of the administration of Milwaukee’s elections. 
Republicans have often attacked Milwaukee’s election administration, resulting in frequent, baseless accusations that the city’s election results are fraudulent. 
Before Spindell could finish his statement, Jacobs banged her gavel, saying she was ruling his comment out of order, but Spindell just got louder and continued. 
Wisconsin open meetings law requires that if a government body such as the elections commission is going to discuss an issue at a meeting, it must have been properly listed on the meeting’s announced agenda. 
“I am not going to let you keep going,” Jacobs said. “I’m going to talk over you until you stop. You must stop. You are out of order, and I will eject you from this meeting. Do you understand the words I am saying? They are simple. You are out of order. The City of Milwaukee is not on this agenda. You do not get to hijack the agenda. You are not the chair. When you are chair you get to put things on the agenda, it’s not on the agenda.” 
Even though most of what he said was inaudible, Spindell ended by saying “I’ve said what I needed to say.” 
During the meeting, the commission also approved the design for a mailer that will be sent to voters who haven’t voted in four years to ask if they still live at the addresses listed in their voter registrations and informing them they risk having their registrations deactivated. The commissioners also  received an update on an audit to determine if any people currently serving felony sentences voted in recent elections and moved forward an administrative rule that would keep the home addresses of judicial candidates off public elections paperwork.

(Photo by Jackie Llanos/Florida Phoenix)Juan Carlos Lopez-Gomez, a 20-year-old U.S. citizen, was being held in the Leon County Jail Thursday, charged with illegally entering Florida as an “unauthorized alien” — even as a supporter waved his U.S. birth certificate in court.
The man, who was arrested Wednesday after a traffic stop in which he was a passenger on his way to his job in Tallahassee, is set to remain in jail for the next 48 hours, waiting for federal immigration officials to pick him up, even though Leon County authorities dropped his first-degree misdemeanor charge.
His mother, Sebastiana Gomez-Perez, burst into tears at the sight of her son, who appeared virtually for his first hearing at the Leon County Courthouse. She left the courtroom distraught because she could do nothing to help her son, who was born and lives in Grady County, Georgia.
“I wanted to tell them, ‘Where are you going to take him? He is from here,’” his mother told the Phoenix in Spanish moments after exiting the courtroom. “I felt immense helplessness because I couldn’t do anything, and I am desperate to get my son out of there.”
She continued through tears: “It hurts so much. I’m sorry, I can’t.”
Leon County Judge LaShawn Riggans held Lopez-Gomez’s birth certificate up to the light after community advocate Silvia Alba silently waved the document in the courtroom.
“In looking at it, and feeling it, and holding it up to the light, the court can clearly see the watermark to show that this is indeed an authentic document,” Riggans said.
Based on her inspection of his birth certificate and Social Security card, Riggans said she found no probable cause for the charge. However, the state prosecutor insisted the court lacked jurisdiction over Lopez-Gomez’s release because U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement had formally asked the jail to hold him.
“This court does not have any jurisdiction other than what I’ve already done,” Riggans said.
Riggans said she was very sorry as Lopez-Gomez’s mother left.
 ‘I can’t do anything for their brother’

The 20-year-old’s first language is Tzotzil, a Mayan language, and he took a long pause when he was asked if he wanted to hire a private attorney or obtain a public defender. He lived in Mexico from the time he was 1-year-old until four years ago, when he returned to Georgia, his mother told the Phoenix.
“He hasn’t committed a crime for them to hold him, that’s what I don’t understand. I’m feeling bad because my daughters are asking me how their brother is. It hurts because I can’t do anything for their brother,” she said.
At issue is a recently passed law that a federal judge has temporarily barred the state from enforcing, further calling into question the validity of his arrest, the charge, and detention. Gov. Ron DeSantis signed SB 4-C into law on Feb. 14, and U.S. District Court Judge Kathleen Williams blocked its enforcement on April 4.
The law makes it a misdemeanor for undocumented immigrants over age 18 to “knowingly” enter Florida “after entering the United States by eluding or avoiding examination or inspection by immigration officers.”
Two other men who were in the car with Lopez-Gomez, the driver and another passenger, also had their first appearances on the same charges on Thursday. The driver was also charged with driving without a license.
Wednesday marked the second time Lopez-Gomez has been arrested. The Grady County Sheriff’s office took him into custody on Sunday and charged him with driving under the influence, his mother said. ICE also requested that the Georgia jail hold Lopez-Gomez, but he won release after his family showed officials his birth certificate and Social Security card, Gomez-Perez said.
Thomas Kennedy, a policy analyst for the Florida Immigrant Coalition, met Gomez-Perez at the courthouse. He said Lopez-Gomez’s case is exactly what his organization has been warning lawmakers would happen.
“It was just really sad seeing the mother distraught over her son, and the fact that she acknowledged that this is very likely a case of racial profiling against a U.S. citizen who can’t speak English,” he said in a phone interview with the Phoenix.
The Georgia Recorder, a partner of Florida Phoenix, has submitted a public records request to obtain more information about his arrest Sunday.

(Photo by Jon Cherry/Getty Images)Kentucky’s economy is the nation’s most reliant on global trade, according to a new study that looks at the potential impact of President Donald Trump’s tariffs on housing prices.
The study found that imports into Kentucky equal 32.3% of the state’s gross domestic product, the highest of any state, while exports make up 16.3% of Kentucky GDP, behind only Louisiana and Texas. 
“With robust manufacturing logistics, the state has become a key player in facilitating the movement of goods across borders,” explains the report from the National Association of Realtors.  
Trump promises that his taxes on imports will move manufacturing jobs back to this country and raise revenue to pay for tax cuts. His approach has drawn the support of union president Shawn Fain of the United Auto Workers. Trump, who ran on a promise to impose tariffs, won 65% of Kentucky votes last year.
But both of Kentucky’s U.S. senators — Republicans Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul — have broken with the Republican president to oppose his new tariffs. The Kentucky Chamber of Commerce also is voicing opposition to Trump’s trade policy as the numbers suggest Kentucky could be a casualty in a brewing trade war. 
Predicting “unnecessary disruptions” to Kentucky’s  economy, the state Chamber says Trump’s plans could hurt auto manufacturers, distillers and farmers. China recently responded to Trump by increasing its tariff on U.S. soybeans from 60% to 115%. Soybeans are Kentucky’s third most valuable farm commodity, behind poultry and corn. China buys more than half of U.S. soybean exports.
Other states’ foreign trade accounts post bigger numbers, but trade is more significant to Kentucky because of its smaller economy.
Ranging from parts for manufacturing to consumer electronics, imports’ prominence in Kentucky “reflects the state’s deep integration into the global market — especially in pharmaceuticals and automotive industries. Its top import partners are Mexico, Japan, and Taiwan,” says the study by Nadia Evangelou, an economist with the Realtors trade group.
Exports are goods produced and sold to international buyers. “It might surprise some, but Kentucky exports a significant number of cars and aerospace parts. Major companies such as Toyota and GE Aviation operate there. The primary partners are Canada, the U.K., and France, with over $4.5 billion in exports to each country,” says the study 
States like Kentucky and Texas that rely on both imports and exports “are more likely to experience the ripple effects of global supply chain shifts, both positive and negative,” the study says. Indiana, Michigan, and South Carolina also rank high on both exports and imports. “A surge in global demand supports their growth, while disruptions, such as factory shutdowns overseas or sudden tariffs, can present challenges as well.” 
Jason Bailey, executive director of the Kentucky Center for Economic Policy, said the state’s manufacturing base reflects both parts imports and product exports and that “strategic tariffs have a role to play as part of a broader industrial policy aimed at key industries, of which Kentucky has several including automobiles and aircraft.”
He also predicts bad outcomes from Trump’s approach. “These across-the-board and on-again, off-again tariffs throw the economy into chaos and uncertainty and cut off the opportunity for trade relationships that are mutually beneficial and that, with good policy, can create better jobs both here and abroad.”
Invoking an emergency law, Trump has imposed, and in some cases later modified, a variety of tariffs, including a 10% tariff on most imports, an extra 25% on imports from Canada and Mexico, and a 145% tariff on China. He also imposed — but then paused for 90 days — what he calls reciprocal tariffs on more than 60 trading partners. Trump has levied import fees on iron and steel and a 25% levy on imported car parts due to begin May 3. The Associated Press reports confusion over Trump administration exemptions from the new tariffs for some electronics. The uncertainty is roiling stock and bond values.
Over the last 30 years, the study says, economic growth has been less robust in states like Kentucky that are highly reliant on trade, both in terms of job creation and housing values, probably because of their dependence on manufacturing which has been in decline. 
The study says large states where exports are a small part of GDP like New York, Florida and California have economies driven more by services in finance, tourism and entertainment.
“The states that led in home price growth were often those with rapid job growth in tech and services, high levels of domestic migration, and limited housing supply or zoning constraints,” writes Evangelou.



Kentucky tied deeply to global supply chains

“Kentucky is an automotive manufacturing powerhouse, with four major assembly plants and hundreds of auto parts facilities driving $5 billion worth of auto-related exports annually,” says a story about the economic study on realtor.com.
“Pharmaceutical manufacturing in the state drives $3.8 billion worth of exports, while aerospace exports a total of $19 billion.
“Those industries tie Kentucky deeply into global supply chains and rely on imports of components and precursors, with annual imports to the state totaling $94 billion. 
“Kentucky’s most famous product, bourbon, is also responsible for $500 million in exports each year. The state’s top import partners are Mexico, Japan, and Taiwan, while its top export recipients are Canada, the U.K., and France.”

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)Under a budget amendment filed by Gov. Dan McKee on Wednesday, the Rhode Island Department of Housing would be renamed the Executive Office of Housing in a move designed to consolidate state housing governance.
Changes stem from a 141-page report that Housing Secretary Deborah Goddard submitted to state leaders at the end of 2024. The General Assembly as part of its fiscal year 2025 budget had asked the Department of Housing to review and recommend ways to streamline housing governance across Rhode Island as part of the state’s fiscal year 2025 budget.
“By introducing this budget amendment, in collaboration with the Department of Housing, we are taking a critical step toward creating a more efficient and unified housing governance structure,” McKee said in a statement. “This is about providing real, lasting solutions for Rhode Islanders, and I am committed to making them a reality.”
Under the plan, the state would merge the Housing Resources Commission and the Advisory Council to the 20-member Interagency Council on Homelessness into a single advisory body. 
The existing Housing Resources Commission consists of 18 members from the public and private sectors. The Interagency Council on Homelessness met for the first time in seven years last December with the intention to reform its advisory council once the budget amendment is approved, said Housing Department spokesperson Emily Marshall.
State law requires at least three members of the advisory council be involved with the homeless community.
McKee’s amendment would codify the Secretary of Housing as the permanent chair of the board of commissioners for RIHousing, the quasi-state agency that finances affordable home construction. 
New year, new potential name for R.I.’s housing department

The new Executive Office of Housing would also take over administration of the state’s Housing Production Fund. Created by the General Assembly in 2021, the fund is supported by real estate transfer tax revenue and has been managed by RIHousing.
Officials at RIHousing are still reviewing McKee’s budget amendment, Chief Strategy and Innovation Officer Christine Hunsinger told Rhode Island Current.
Such changes would help state agencies work better together to clear some of the regulatory redundancies stunting Rhode Island’s housing development, according to the announcement from the governor’s office.
“The state’s housing challenges require a unified and coordinated approach,” Housing Secretary Deborah Goddard said in a statement. “By implementing these structural changes, we can ensure that the state’s resources are being used effectively, and that we are making measurable progress in addressing the housing needs of Rhode Islanders.”
Housing officials want to have 15,000 total new homes permitted by 2030, but getting new homes built has been incremental at best.
The department’s latest integrated housing report released Tuesday found that between 2021 and 2024, Rhode Island added 4,365 new units — representing a 0.9% increase to its housing stock between those three years. The state permitted 2,655 new units for 2024, according to the report.
McKee’s office said the governor believes the department’s governance recommendations are what the state needs to produce long-term benefits for Rhode Island’s housing sector, along with reducing homelessness.
At least 2,442 unhoused people across Rhode Island were counted when volunteers from the Rhode Island Coalition to End Homelessness conducted an annual survey in late January 2024 — up 35% from the 2023 count. ​The coalition conducted its annual Point-In-Time count for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development on Jan. 28, but results aren’t expected to be released until some time in the summer. 
Every three years starting around July 1, 2026, the department must create a statewide plan to address and end homelessness. 
But affordable housing advocates have concerns about the state’s ability to take on more responsibility — especially as uncertainty continues over federal funding toward housing projects. 
“Over 75% of the funding that we get for housing and homelessness programs comes from the federal government,” HousingWorks RI Director Brenda Clement, who serves on the Housing Resources Commission, said in an interview Thursday. “I don’t want to create something in state government that is not fundable.” 
Clement declined to comment on the state’s plan to create a single advisory body.
House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi has not yet reviewed the governor’s amendment, chamber spokesperson Larry Berman said in an email Thursday. The House Committee on Finance is expected to schedule a public hearing some time after lawmakers return from their April recess next week.
The State House this year is considering a dozen new proposals in a  package of bills aiming to encourage new home construction including legislation that would make it easier to subdivide oversized lots, allow vacant or unused state-owned land to be developed, and encourage municipalities to convert vacant commercial space into homes.

(Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)Arkansas became the first state in the nation to prevent healthcare conglomerates from operating drugstores here when Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders signed House Bill 1150 on Wednesday.
State law already regulates what pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) pay to reimburse independent pharmacies, but pharmacists have complained that the companies violate the law. The state has also fined four PBMs a total of $1.47 million for paying Arkansas pharmacies below the legally required amount for prescription drugs.
PBMs negotiate prescription benefits among drug manufacturers, distributors, pharmacies and health insurance providers, and the biggest ones also own pharmacies and insurers. The Federal Trade Commission released an interim report in July 2024 saying these conglomerates are eliminating competition and increasing drug prices at the expense of patients.
HB 1150 headed to Sanders’ desk April 9 after clearing the Senate with a bipartisan 26 votes, six days after it passed the House with 89 votes. The bill generated hours of discussion and public comment in the House and Senate committees on Insurance and Commerce this month.
“These massive corporations are attacking our state because we will be the first in the country to hold them accountable for their anticompetitive actions,” Sanders said in a statement Wednesday.
CVS Health issued a statement last week urging Sanders to veto HB 1150, calling it “misguided policy.” The organization, which includes the CVS Caremark PBM, issued another statement Wednesday afternoon.
“CVS Health welcomes a good faith discussion with policy makers in Arkansas and across the country on ways to make medicine more affordable and accessible,” the statement said. “Unfortunately, HB1150 is bad policy that accomplishes just the opposite: it will take away access to pharmacy care in local communities, hike prescription drug spending across the state by millions of dollars each year, and cost hundreds of Arkansans their jobs.”

Federal regulator: Pharmacy middlemen appear to be raising prices, hurting patients

 

Arkansas has 23 CVS pharmacies that CVS and other opponents of HB 1150 said will be forced to close under the new law. Arkansas Pharmacists Association CEO John Vinson said this is not true and pharmacies can still operate if they detach from PBMs.
Sanders, Vinson and other supporters of HB 1150 have said a lack of sufficient regulation of PBMs has allowed them to monopolize the pharmaceutical industry by setting their competitors’ prices.
OptumRX, Express Scripts and CVS Caremark — the three largest PBMs — are each owned by much larger corporations that each also own a top-10 health insurer. Together they control about 80% of the U.S. prescription market, according to last year’s Federal Trade Commission report.

 The legal landscape

Act 1 and Act 3 of 2018 prohibit PBMs from reimbursing their affiliated pharmacies in Arkansas at a higher rate than their competitors, locally owned independent pharmacies. PBMs routinely break these laws, said Vinson and HB 1150’s Republican sponsors, Sen. Kim Hammer of Benton and Rep. Jeremiah Moore of Clarendon.
PBMs have allegedly also violated Act 900 of 2015, which required PBMs to pay pharmacies at least as much as the national average of what drugstores pay wholesalers for drugs. Pharmacies sent the Arkansas Insurance Department (AID) thousands of complaints in 2024, claiming PBMs either illegally paid them below this national average or paid them at or just above this amount, independent pharmacists and AID’s general counsel told lawmakers last year.

Pharmacy benefit managers will have to pay Arkansas drugstores dispensing fees under new rule

 

This led the Arkansas Legislative Council to require PBMs to include dispensing fees in their reimbursements for prescription drugs. The panel approved the rule a day after its Administrative Rules subcommittee rejected it.
Hammer told the Senate Insurance committee April 8 that the Legislature should not be “rewarding” violators of state law “by letting them stay in business.”
“Congress is pursuing this issue. Why? Because states like Arkansas are not sitting on the sidelines and being quiet about it,” Hammer said. “[If you say], ‘Let’s sit back and wait for Congress,’ like sitting back and waiting for the Lord to come, it ain’t going to happen soon enough.”
After more than a century serving Hammer’s constituents in Benton, Smith-Caldwell Drug Store closed in August 2023 due to financial insolvency and transferred its clients to Walgreens, a national chain that isn’t part of a PBM.
Brad Lawson, a Little Rock-based healthcare supervisor for Walgreens, told lawmakers in December that unfair PBM reimbursements have forced the company to close several locations and plan further closures nationwide.
Walgreens declined to comment Thursday on HB 1150.
 Opposition

In an April 4 interview with the Advocate, CVS leaders said the Caremark PBM not only complies with Arkansas law but also reimburses independent pharmacies at a higher rate than its own chain pharmacies. They also said employers whose health insurance plans include CVS will face higher costs.











This is not grassroots opposition to this bill. This is astroturf.


– Sen. Mark Johnson, R-Ferndale, who supported HB 1150



“Patients are choosing us, they have a choice, and I think we’re not allowing patients to have a choice in this bill,” Chief Pharmacy Officer Lucille Accetta said.
When asked about HB 1150’s potential financial impact on CVS, Accetta and Vice President of External Relations David Whitrap said the losses of pharmacists’ jobs and patients’ access to medication are higher priorities than money.
CVS closed 244 stores between 2018 and 2020 and 900 more stores between 2021 and 2024.
CVS District Leader of Pharmacy Operations Ashley Ellis spoke against the bill at both Insurance and Commerce committee meetings, saying she and her colleagues would lose their jobs if HB 1150 becomes law.
Ellis lives in Greenbrier, represented by Sen. Missy Irvin, R-Mountain View. Irvin was in the minority of Senate committee members to vote against HB 1150, and she said she would not vote for a constituent to lose her job.
Hammer said the potential loss of CVS employees’ jobs is “a lie.”
“If they want to argue these local [corporate] pharmacies shouldn’t be going out of business because they get paid adequately, fine,” he said. “Put your money where your mouth is. Prove it. Start paying yourselves like you’re paying these others.”
Several lawmakers said this month that they supported HB 1150 partly because they received emails urging them to vote against it that appeared to be from constituents but turned out to be from lobbyists opposing the legislation. Rep. Richard McGrew, R-Hot Springs, told the House Insurance Committee that CVS clients in his district had not consented to their names being used for this purpose.

Sen. Mark Johnson, R-Ferndale, told the equivalent Senate committee that he received similar misleading emails.
“This is not grassroots opposition to this bill,” Johnson said. “This is astroturf.”
Besides CVS Health, opponents of HB 1150 included the Arkansas Chamber of Commerce, the Navitus Health Solutions PBM, and the Omnicare and Accredo pharmacies.
Omnicare is owned by CVS Health, and Accredo is a subsidiary of Express Scripts.
 Mail order concerns

Several PBMs are affiliated with interstate mail-order pharmacy operations, and House Bill 1150 includes mail-order pharmacy permits among those that PBMs would be prohibited from holding.
Opponents of HB 1150 said it would reduce patients’ access to specialty drugs, some of which might only be accessible via mail-order services — including for military members and veterans who receive pharmaceuticals via the Tricare insurance program’s partnership with Express Scripts.
HB 1150 allows the State Board of Pharmacy to issue limited permits to PBMs if they provide “drugs that are otherwise unavailable in the market to a patient or a pharmacy that would otherwise be prohibited” under the law. Hammer told the Senate this will allow Tricare beneficiaries to continue receiving medications while PBMs transition out of Arkansas.
Despite being a veteran on Tricare, Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin’s pharmacy services have been moved from one provider to another by PBM interference, he said in January at a news conference announcing HB 1150. He also said he would defend the legislation in court if it were challenged.
On Monday, Griffin was the lead signatory of a bipartisan letter to Congress from attorneys general in 39 states and territories, advocating for the policy in HB 1150 to be enacted federally.
Griffin sued Express Scripts and OptumRX last year, alleging that they used data from drug manufacturers and distributors to maximize their financial gain instead of using it to mitigate the opioid addiction epidemic.










Put your money where your mouth is... Start paying yourselves like you’re paying these others.

 ‘Winners and losers’

Irvin was one of nine senators, mostly Republicans, to vote against HB 1150 last week. She disputed the claim that PBMs have a monopoly in the pharmaceutical industry, saying this is only an opinion without a court’s declaration.
Senate Minority Whip Fred Love, D-Mabelvale, was the chamber’s only Democrat to vote against the bill. Love’s district does not have any local independent pharmacies, and his constituents will lose access to medications if corporate pharmacies like CVS close, he said.
“They’ve been talking to me saying, ‘Guess what? This will hurt us,’” Love said. “So we’re going to manufacture a pharmacy desert in southwest Little Rock? That’s not good for my people.”
Irvin also took issue with a statement April 8 from Greg Reybold, vice president of Healthcare Policy at the American Pharmacy Cooperative, that HB 1150 will “take the ball away” from PBMs in Arkansas’ pharmacy industry.
“We’re using the government to say, ‘We’re getting rid of your competition,’” Irvin said. “…It says that we’re denying a permit to be approved for you, but not for you. You’re picking winners and losers.”

GOP Sen. Justin Boyd, a Fort Smith pharmacist and the vice chairman of the Senate Insurance committee, argued that PBMs’ ability to set their competitors’ prices is actually “picking winners and losers.”
Another 2025 Arkansas law that supporters said will increase patients’ access to medication is Act 52, which removed the state’s ban on nonprofit hospitals holding pharmacy permits. The bill, co-sponsored by Irvin, initially failed in the Senate Public Health, Welfare and Labor Committee but later passed after being amended.
The Arkansas Pharmacists Association opposed Act 52 before it was amended. Vinson told the Senate Insurance committee that Act 52 will create new pharmacy jobs that could make up for any job loss brought about by HB 1150. Both laws will go into effect in August.

(Photo via Wells Police Facebook)After federal immigration authorities accepted Maine’s first police department into an official partnership earlier this month, some community members are now requesting police terminate the contract. 
The crux of the rift between the community and police: uncertainty and disagreement over how they expect the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s 287(g) program will operate in practice. 
Revived under President Donald Trump’s administration to bolster ICE’s capacity by deputizing local police officers to detain immigrants, those pushing back on Wells’ participation in the program argue it entangles their local police with a federal agency that has been accused of disregarding due process. 
Four community members asked the Wells Select Board on Tuesday night to direct the police department to dissolve the agreement, arguing the department should have first consulted the public and raising concern about the program’s history of abuse. Before Trump reinstated the program, it was discontinued in 2012 after the discovery of discriminatory practices, including racial profiling.
But Wells police leadership argue the agreement doesn’t mean their local agency will adopt ICE’s recent approach to arrests. Rather, Wells Police Chief Jo-Ann Putnam told Maine Morning Star she entered into the agreement to take advantage of a training opportunity and streamline work flow.
First Maine police department joins ICE partnership

As first reported by Maine Morning Star, the Wells Police Department was the first — and so far only — agency in Maine to sign an agreement under the 287(g) program, which permits local officers to arrest people on immigration violations, an authority otherwise reserved for federal agents. 
Wells’ agreement is specifically for 287(g)’s “task force model,” which ICE describes as a “force multiplier” to allow law enforcement agencies to enforce limited immigration authority with ICE oversight during their routine police duties. 287(g)’s other two models are focused on investigating people who have already been arrested and booked in local jails. 
As of April 16, ICE had signed 456 Memorandums of Agreement for 287(g) programs covering 38 states, with task force agreements with 190 agencies in 23 states, including Wells. 
Putnam said ICE has informed her department that the training includes 40 hours of online courses, which the department had yet to begin as of this week. The department submitted to ICE a list of officers eligible to participate in the program, who must have two years of police experience and be a U.S. citizen, which Putnam said is the majority of the department.
Regarding when arrests for immigration violations could begin after that, “We don’t know,” Putnam said. “We haven’t been told when to start.” 
Residents raise concern about ‘larger’ enforcement picture
The memorandum of understanding ICE signed with Wells Police permits its officers once trained to interrogate any “person believed to be an alien as to his right to be or remain in the United States” and “arrest without warrant any alien entering or attempting to unlawfully enter the United States in the officer’s presence or view,” among other capabilities otherwise reserved for federal authorities. 
But Putnam said when Wells officers start enforcing immigration violations through the agreements, they will only act on existing federal warrants that have had judicial review. 
Normally, she said, when local police run a license and discover an existing federal warrant for an immigration offense, they have to wait for federal authorities to make an arrest. The agreement eliminates that redundancy, Putnam said.

“We’re not rounding up undocumented people,” said Wells Police Captain Kevin Chabot. “Wells Police does not do proactive immigration enforcement.” 
Putnam said regardless of what the partnership allows, “We’re doing what I’m telling you we’re going to do, and that’s it.”
Putnam has repeatedly told Maine Morning Star that she hopes Mainers have confidence in their local law enforcement officers who’ll be carrying out the work. But a lack of trust in local authorities is not why some are objecting to the ICE agreement. 
“It’s not a matter of not trusting the chief and her force,” Cheryl Dearman Mills, one of the people who spoke at the select board meeting, told Maine Morning Star. “As I read the [memorandum of understanding], it raises concerns about control and future entanglement with ICE.”
The memorandum also states that local police have the authority to serve and execute warrants of arrest for immigration violations, issue immigration detainers and prepare charging documents.
Others who called for the select board to terminate the ICE agreement similarly said their concern was with local police formalizing a relationship with an agency that appears, at times, to be acting outside of the law.
“Chief Putnam was looking at this contract primarily with a local focus, separate from the larger picture of ICE’s current tactics of enforcement and deportation,” Wells resident Mary Marra told the select board. “And I was seeing this agreement primarily from a broader focus and how ICE’s questionable and sometimes illegitimate enforcement reflects very poorly on our town.”
For example, Marra pointed to masked immigration officers detaining Tufts University student Rümeysa Öztürk for allegedly supporting Hamas by co-authoring an op-ed calling for the school to divest from companies with ties to Israel, as well as the wrongful deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador.
This week in Florida, a U.S.-born citizen was arrested for entering the state as an “unauthorized alien.” His mother and a community advocate showed his birth certificate during a hearing, but the judge said she had no authority to release him, as reported by Maine Morning Star’s sister outlet the Florida Phoenix. 
“This is Wells Police acting as ICE agents in certain situations and I am extremely uncomfortable with what ICE is doing,” said another Wells resident, Peg Duddy, who is calling for the termination of the ICE contract. 
Duddy and others have met on-on-one with Putnam, as well as attended meetings with the chief and her leadership team, including one hosted by the Wells Democratic Town Committee Wednesday night. 










They don’t want ICE in their town. This is one way of hopefully keeping them out of town.


– Jo-Ann Putnam, Wells Police Chief


“They don’t want ICE in their town,” Putnam said of attendees after the meeting. “This is one way of hopefully keeping them out of town.” 
Duddy and Dearman Mills told Maine Morning Star that the meeting did not change their opposition and that they will continue to push for the contract to be terminated. More immediately, they’re requesting at minimum a 90-day pause, which they said would afford time to clarify the work Wells Police will engage in through the agreement. 
“Also to evaluate where the national picture is in 90 days,” Duddy said, “because this is not in isolation from that.”
Chair of the Wells Select Board John MacLeod III did not respond to a request for comment about the community members’ requests.
Putnam said she’s having meetings with various groups — places of worship, the local Chamber of Commerce, businesses who employ immigrants on work visas — to answer questions about the ICE agreement but said she’s not reconsidering it in light of pushback from some community members. Everyone is entitled to their own opinions, she said.
Immigration enforcement in Maine
Data posted on the ICE website listed the Monmouth Winthrop Police Department, a combination of departments that serve central Maine communities, with a pending application earlier this month but ICE has since removed the department from that list and also does not indicate an agreement has been signed. ICE, Monmouth Winthrop Police Chief Paul Ferland and Lieutenant Dana Wessling did not respond to requests for comment regarding whether the application was terminated and why. 
Such agreements could face legal hurdles as Democrats in the Maine Legislature proposed legislation to prohibit state and local law enforcement agencies or officers from entering into contracts with federal immigration enforcement authorities. The bill has yet to have a public hearing. 
Aside from 287(g) agreements, an uptick in immigration detentions have revealed increased federal operations in Maine. Cumberland County Jail in Portland had 122 people detained under ICE orders last month, according to data Maine Morning Star obtained through a Freedom of Access Act request. 
According to attorneys, while some of these people were arrested in the state, the majority appear to be transferred from other states and are quickly transferred out too, signaling that federal authorities are using Maine as a tool in its “mass deportation” goal.
“It’s crucial for Maine’s people to know how their public officials may be supporting federal immigration enforcement, which often violates people’s constitutional rights,” ACLU of Maine Staff Attorney Anahita Sotoohi said in a statement on Thursday, after the organization filed information requests seeking a more comprehensive picture of local law enforcement cooperation with federal immigration authorities. 
“Abuses of power and attacks on due process threaten all people, regardless of immigration status,” Sotoohi said. “When due process is undermined for some, all people are at risk as power is consolidated and our system of checks and balances is dismantled.”

The South Carolina Supreme Court will not stop efforts to remove state Loftis from office. (Photo by Mark Susko/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — The South Carolina Supreme Court will not stop efforts to remove state Treasurer Curtis Loftis from office.
“This matter is not yet ripe for the court’s consideration,” the justices wrote in a joint opinion Thursday, throwing out the treasurer’s lawsuit that sought to halt the so-called “removal on address” process.
That means senators can continue with proceedings as scheduled Monday, when they’ll weigh whether Loftis “willfully neglected his duties” for his role in a $1.8 billion accounting error that went unreported for nearly a decade.
For more than a year, Loftis has maintained he did nothing wrong and compared the Senate-led investigation to a political “witch hunt.” Loftis said he’s prepared to make his case.
“We know this process will be more political theatrics than the formal trial one would expect to overturn a statewide election,” he said in a statement. “We stand ready to show the citizens of South Carolina that the State Treasurer’s Office has faithfully fulfilled our statutory duties to provide core financial management services to state government. I certainly hope that the senators will agree with us once all the information is shared.”
South Carolina’s accounting problems, which involved almost no actual money, stem from the changeover from the state’s legacy accounting system to a new one.
During the process, a series of electronic ledger entries made it appear the state had $1.8 billion sitting untouched in a fund with no record of where it was supposed to go. The state’s financial officials never alerted the General Assembly to the issue.
A forensic accounting firm hired by the state ultimately found staff had made the entries in error and all but $200 million of the money was never real.
Facing his own “removal on address,” former Comptroller General Richard Eckstrom — the state’s chief accountant for 20 years — resigned in 2023 over a separate but related accounting blunder. And former State Auditor George Kennedy resigned in January.
But Loftis has refused to step down and re-affirmed to reporters that no matter what happens Monday, he will be running for re-election in 2026 even if he has to go deep into his own pockets to fund a campaign.
As an elected official, Loftis can’t be fired. But the Legislature can remove him using an obscure constitutional measure, which has a lower bar than impeachment and applies when an official commits willful neglect of duty rather than a serious crime.
Under the process, the governor must remove an executive officer from office if two-thirds of both chambers of the Legislature vote to remove him.
While the Senate has invoked the procedure, it’s unclear what the House will do — if anything. Only Democrat Rep. Heather Bauer of Columbia has introduced legislation calling on the House to start impeachment proceedings.
“I don’t believe the Senate thinks they can actually get me out of office,” Loftis told the SC Daily Gazette. “They just want to make my life miserable so I leave.”
In his statement, Loftis also noted his court case “was not dismissed on the merits.” Rather, the justices, citing past case law, declined to declare the process unconstitutional because Loftis had yet to go through the removal proceedings.
The court dismissed the case without prejudice, meaning the treasurer could file again at a later date.

(Getty Images)Opponents are turning to legal challenges to try to block or delay major public transit expansions — even after voters approve them.
Recent lawsuits in Arizona, Tennessee and Texas have attempted to slow voted-passed projects.
In Nashville, Tennessee, voters passed a $3.1 billion referendum in November to raise the city sales tax half a cent and fund expanded bus service, pedestrian improvements and 54 miles of “all-access” transit corridors. But a Tennessee court, while upholding most of the project, ruled last week that the city could not use the funds raised to purchase land for affordable housing or parks.
The ruling affects only 1% of the total revenue, the court said. But it was a signal that even well-funded, voter-backed transit efforts are vulnerable to some legal roadblocks.
After voters in Maricopa County, Arizona, last year approved an extension of a half-cent sales tax for transportation, the county GOP sued to try to invalidate the results, arguing the vote didn’t meet a 60% supermajority.
In Austin, Texas, a 2024 class-action lawsuit attempted to block the city from collecting property taxes unless it excludes a tax approved by voters in 2020 to fund Project Connect — a major transit expansion. But a judge dismissed the lawsuit late last year.
No fare! Free bus rides raise questions of fairness, viability.

Public support for expanded transit is surging across the United States. In 2024 alone, voters approved 46 of 53 transit-related ballot measures, unlocking over $25 billion in new funding for transit projects and improvements, according to the American Public Transportation Association.
But despite support at the ballot box, cities often face legal, zoning and political barriers.
Nashville, in particular, is becoming a case study in both momentum and resistance to transit investment and development, according to researchers at the Urban Institute.
“There’s been a sea change,” said Gabe Samuels, a research analyst in the Housing and Communities Division at the Urban Institute. “Nashville had two failed transit referenda in the past decade. This time, it passed decisively. Voters want alternatives to sprawl and traffic.”
But transit-oriented development — the strategy of clustering housing and businesses near high-quality transit — is often hindered by outdated zoning, Samuels and colleague Yonah Freemark told Stateline.
According to an Urban Institute study, more than 90% of Nashville’s residential land is zoned for single- or two-family homes, a pattern common in Southern and Midwestern cities. That zoning limits the density needed to support high transit ridership, the report said. Currently, only 13% of Nashville’s housing lies within a quarter-mile, what the report calls easy walking distance, of its planned transit corridors.
“You’re investing millions — sometimes billions — into transit systems,” said Freemark. “If you’re not thinking about land use and density alongside that, you’re wasting the opportunity.”

(Danielle Prokop / Source NM)Following years of delays, federal and New Mexico officials say starting May 7 any adult wanting to catch a flight or enter certain federal buildings will need to show a driver’s license that meets stricter standards.
REAL IDs, marked with a gold star in the card’s top right corner, require proof of identity, age and residency to the state issuing the card. That often means using original documents such as a birth certificate, social security card and two proofs of address.

Passengers must present the actual physical card, or can use their digital REAL ID at some locations, including the Albuquerque Sunport and the Lea County Regional Airport.
The temporary paper ID issued from the state will not be accepted at the gates, J. Mark Heisey, the federal security director for the Transportation Security Administration, told Source NM Thursday.
If a driver’s license doesn’t meet the requirements, then people will need to use their passports, military-issued ID or other acceptable licenses to fly or enter federal buildings, he said.
The deadline for rolling out the requirements has been repeatedly pushed back since the federal law was first enacted in 2005 — but officials say this time, it’s real.
“The Secretary of Homeland Security is committed to enforcing this law that’s been in place since 2005,” Heisey said. “So, we’re finally at a tipping point.”

People who show up to the airport without a REAL ID driver’s license will face delays at TSA checkpoints, he said.
“Even if you don’t have plans to travel now, your plans can change, so prepare now, as far as what type of photo ID you’ll plan to bring to the airport,” Heisey said.
About 80% of the driver’s licenses issued in New Mexico are REAL IDs, said Stephanie Schardin Clarke, the Secretary of New Mexico Department of Taxation and Revenue, which oversees the state’s licensing. That means about 370,000 New Mexicans don’t have a REAL ID, and only have the standard driver’s license.
“Not all of them either want or are eligible or need a real ID,” Schardin Clarke said. “Some portion of those 20% might be planning to travel with a passport or other acceptable documentation; for example, some of them might not be eligible for reasons of documentation, and then some might just not plan to travel or enter a federal building.”
More about New Mexico Real IDs
Schardin Clarke said that New Mexico state offices and private Motor Vehicle Division offices are prepared for additional appointments for REAL IDs. All state offices now require an appointment, which can be made online or scheduled over the phone at 1-888-683-3466.
The state also has a frequently asked questions page for the documentation required to get a REAL ID for the first time.
Htet Wint, the director of the Motor Vehicle Division, said the state does require anyone with a name change — from marriage, divorce, adoption, etc. — to bring in additional documents.
“We need all the linking documents,” Wint said. “Like a marriage certificate, divorce decrees, court order, that ties them to that name.”
Physical cards take about two weeks to arrive in the mail. The mobile driver’s license downloaded to a digital wallet in a phone will take 24 hours to update.

Beau Ballard of Lincoln, center right, talks with Clerk of the Legislature Brandon Metzler, Speaker John Arch of La Vista and State Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln. April 17, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Despite earlier statements that changes to annual school retirement contributions would not be used to balance Nebraska’s budget, lawmakers confirmed Thursday that the reductions will go toward that goal.
State senators gave 38-0 first-approval Thursday to Legislative Bill 645, from State Sen. Beau Ballard of Lincoln at the request of Gov. Jim Pillen, to lower employer, employee and state contributions to the statewide school retirement plan based on its funding level compared to obligations to members. The plan is currently 99.91% funded.
The state retirement plan covers all eligible school employees, notably teachers, outside Omaha Public Schools, which has a separate retirement plan and is not as highly funded.
Currently, employees contribute to the group plan 9.78% of monthly payroll and school districts give 9.88% of the payroll paid to covered district employees. The state annually gives 2% of the statewide payroll for covered members. Payroll was about $2.5 billion in the past year.
‘Built-in protections’
Under Ballard’s bill, and an amendment adopted 41-0, contribution rates would change as follows:

Less than 96% funded — 9.75% employees, 9.85% employers, 2% state.
Between 96% funded and 98% funded — 8.75% employees, 8.84% employers, 0.7% state.
Between 98% and 100% funded — 8% employees, 8.08% employers, 0.7% state.
100% funded or more — 7.25% employees, 7.32% employers, 0% state.

“Importantly, these agreed-upon reductions in contributions have built-in protections to ensure the long-term sustainability of the fund,” said Ballard, chair of the Legislature’s Nebraska Retirement Systems Committee.

The amended LB 645 could save the state at least $80 million in the next two fiscal years, which multiple senators celebrated as helping to close the state’s projected budget shortfall of $457 million for the next two years.
That is prior to ongoing work by the Appropriations Committee, which has whittled the deficit down to about $100 million with continued negotiations. The budget bills must be presented to the Legislature by the end of the month for debate.
Health of the retirement plan
Opponents of Ballard’s measure, chiefly State Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln, said “political games” should not be played with teacher retirements, especially with what she said is “incredible economic volatility and uncertainty” under President Donald Trump.
“Playing Russian roulette with their retirement is wrong,” Conrad said Thursday.
If annual contributions in any year are not enough to keep the plan adequately funded under state law, such as if investment returns come up short or stock market returns are too volatile, the state is on the hook for additional funding outside of annual contributions. That happened in the late 2000s, leading to the current funding contribution levels in 2013 negotiations.
State Sen. Rob Clements of Elmwood, chair of the Appropriations Committee and a member of the Retirement Committee, described Ballard’s LB 645 as a “reasonable compromise.”
He said opponents blasting the bill as a “serious threat” to the plan is just “not true” and that employees would see no benefit reductions. Clements said it’s “the right thing to do at this time.”
“The plan is in good shape, and the state’s contribution would go back to a full amount if it’s below 96% [funded],” Clements said.

‘We’ve done something to ourselves’
State Sens. Mike Moser of Columbus and Jana Hughes of Seward said the contribution rates should have been examined without regard to the state budget, even if there was a surplus.
“If this retirement fund is funded at 100%, we should all raise our hands and say, ‘Halleluja,’” Moser said. “Funding it beyond 100% just does not make sense.”
Throughout the 2025 session, LB 645 has faced significant changes since it was first introduced in January.
At that time, only the state government would have seen a lowered contribution rate. Then, prior to a March hearing on LB 645, Ballard offered an amendment to change employee contribution rates. Now, employers who opposed the bill would also see lowered contribution rates.
School advocates have said the freed-up funds could lead to possibly lower property taxes or increased teacher pay, and many school advocacy groups are now in favor of the bill.
Ballard shared data from the Nebraska State Education Association estimating that the average school teacher could receive $1,000 more in take-home pay when the retirement plan is more than 98% funded, under LB 645. If the plan is fully funded, the take-home pay could be $1,500 each year.
State Sens. George Dungan of Lincoln, of the Legislature’s Revenue Committee, and Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha, on the Appropriations Committee, said the budget deficit is self-inflicted.
Dungan described it as an online meme where a young child puts a stick in the spike of his bicycle and flips over, asking, “Oh my God, who did this?”
“This kind of feels like we’ve done something to ourselves and now we are operating under this structure where we feel like our hands are tied and we have to do these things,” Dungan said.

A piece of the budget ‘puzzle’
State Sen. Tony Sorrentino of the Elkhorn area, a member of the Revenue and Retirement Committees, described the situation as paying a bill twice.
“You don’t overfund pensions. You don’t overpay bills,” Sorrentino said. But you do have to have the wherewithal to make up for that when and if it gets to a certain level of funding.”
Conrad blamed “unsustainable, inequitable, reckless tax cuts,” and Cavanaugh said the Appropriations Committee “not once” discussed using the freed-up state retirement contributions to invest in education, contrary to earlier statements from the governor’s staff that the funds would not be used toward balancing the budget.
Kenny Zoeller, director of the governor’s policy research office, who made those commitments earlier this year, did not respond to a request for comment on what had changed. Ballard said he would like to balance the budget without raising taxes, such as by limiting spending.
State Sen. Myron Dorn of Adams, a seven-year member of the Appropriations Committee, said that as of Wednesday the committee still had $100 million to find to balance the budget. 
He has often described the budget as a “giant puzzle,” stating Thursday that retirement contributions is one piece. If his colleagues chose not to adopt the retirement changes, Dorn said that would lead to cuts somewhere else.
“This is just one part of that puzzle,” Dorn said.

‘We shouldn’t rush’
The Retirement Committee will have a new hearing on an amendment to LB 645 next week that could expand retirement eligibility for employees hired after July 1, 2018. Currently, retirement eligibility is when age plus years of service meets or exceeds 85 years — “Rule of 85.” Workers hired before July 2018 can retire as early as age 55. Newer employees have to wait until at least age 60.
As a trade-off, the state would not provide any annual contributions to the retirement plan in the next two years, potentially saving nearly $20 million more, before contributions are set as now outlined in LB 645.
Tim Royers, president of the NSEA, said the organization was happy that LB 645 advanced, and is looking forward to next week’s hearing on correcting a “serious wrong.”
“We have a chance to make them whole, and that’s important,” he told the Nebraska Examiner.
Ballard said he’s unsure how the amendment would be received the Legislature before the hearing.
Conrad, the dean of the Legislature who competed against Ballard for chair of the Retirement Committee in January, losing 25-24 after a tied vote, said the amended LB 645 could very well be a “good deal” for school employees, but she urged caution.
“If indeed we can find a path forward, we shouldn’t rush,” Conrad said. “We shouldn’t rush with something this important.”

He […],"Missouri House Speaker Jon Patterson speaks to reporters Thursday after being the lone Republican vote against a proposal to reinstate the abortion ban overturned by voters in November (Rudi Keller/Missouri Independent).The top Republican in the Missouri House said Thursday that a proposed constitutional amendment to ban abortion approved by his GOP colleagues doesn’t go far enough to protect victims of sexual assault. 
House Speaker Jon Patterson of Lee’s Summit was the lone Republican to vote against sending the bill to the Senate on Thursday. He didn’t express his concerns about the legislation while it was being debated for four hours on Tuesday or an hour on Thursday, instead saving his remarks for a press conference moments after the bill’s passage. 
The proposed amendment, if passed by the Senate and approved by voters, would repeal the reproductive rights amendment known as Amendment 3 but allow exceptions for medical emergencies, fatal fetal anomalies and for survivors of rape and incest in the first 12 weeks of gestation. 
In pregnancy, a woman’s first missed period marks four weeks gestation. Patterson, a physician, noted people who are younger or lower income and people who are Black and Hispanic are statistically more likely to learn they are pregnant later into the first trimester. 
On top of that, once a survivor learns they’re pregnant, Patterson said, they are dealing with not only the trauma of that attack, but also the logistics of getting in to see a doctor.
“A debate that we should have — and I hope happens in the Senate — is 12 weeks long enough,” Patterson said during the press conference. “ … If you’re going to say it’s OK to (have an abortion) after you’ve been raped, now we’re talking time limits.” 
State Rep. Yolanda Young, a Democrat from Kansas City, said during House debate on Thursday that bringing forward such an amendment “desecrated the sanctity of the majority.” 
Democrats have accused their colleagues across the aisle of attempting to subvert the will of the people by bringing to a vote a new abortion ban less than six months after Missouri became the first state to overturn a ban by guaranteeing the procedure up until fetal viability.
Patterson, who before the November election suggested the legislature should respect the will of the voters, said Thursday that “taking something to the voters another time isn’t really subverting the will of the voters.” 
“It really is something that I think should be celebrated,” he said, “that we have this process to amend the constitution, going back to the people and letting them have their say.”
But House Democrats remain critical of Republicans’ approach, saying the ballot language — the summary of the amendment that appears on the ballot — is deceptive. 
No where does the language mention the amendment would ban elective abortions.
Instead, Missourians would be asked if they want to amend the Missouri constitution to: 

“Guarantee access to care for medical emergencies, ectopic pregnancies, and miscarriages; 
Ensure women’s safety during abortions; 
Ensure parental consent for minors; 
Allow abortions for medical emergencies, fetal anomalies, rape, and incest; 
Require physicians to provide medically accurate information; and 
Protect children from gender transition?”

If approved by the Senate, it will go to a statewide vote. House Majority Floor Leader Alex Riley, a Republican from Springfield, said in a press release Thursday that voters could see the amendment on their ballots in 2026. The statement did not mention the possibility of the governor calling a special election as soon as this year.
“This is not democracy in action,” said House Minority Leader Ashley Aune, a Democrat from Kansas City. “This is authoritarianism in action.” 
  Missouri House Minority Leader Ashley Aune, center, is surrounded by members the Democratic caucus Thursday at a news conference after the House passed a proposal to reinstate the abortion ban overturned by voters in November (Rudi Keller/Missouri Independent).
As is already in place under Amendment 3, the legislation would protect women’s access to health care during miscarriages, ectopic pregnancies and other medical emergencies. It would also outlaw gender-affirming care for minors, something that is already banned in Missouri.
House Democrats took to the floor for an hour Thursday to oppose the legislation, sharing stories of pregnancy and abortion. 
“What continues to stick out to me is how different and how nuanced each person’s story is because our bodies are complicated and the health care needed to address any number of the situations that we find ourselves in is complicated,” Aune said. “So why do you keep trying to legislate this vital health care out of existence with a one-size-fits-all policy?” 
Proposed abortion ban amendment gets initial approval of Missouri House

State Rep. Brian Seitz, a Branson Republican who is carrying the legislation, said the amendment is necessary to protect women and children “by returning to safety standards.”
In addition to banning nearly all elective abortions, the amendment would reinstate several targeted regulations on abortion providers, or TRAP laws, that were recently struck down as unconstitutional by a Missouri judge.
“Voters in the past few years were given the choice between two extremes, choices with no middle ground,” Seitz said. “Zero abortions, or what we have now, a landscape that allows for unfettered access.”
Despite abortion becoming legal up to the fetal viability — generally considered to be near the end of the second trimester —  access remains precarious. Procedural abortions are currently only available in the first trimester at three Planned Parenthood clinics in Missouri. 
Medication abortions remain inaccessible. 
While a number of House Republicans compromised by supporting the inclusion of exceptions for survivors, Democrats stood firmly opposed to any ban on the table.
“How many among us could have even an inkling of what it’s like to be trapped physically, financially, emotionally, in a body and a system that does not offer mercy, only mandates,” said state Rep. Kem Smith, a Democrat from Florissant, as she asked her colleagues to imagine themselves in the shoes of a woman in an underfunded, marginalized community who just turned over a positive pregnancy test. 
She was among several Black women in the House who spoke against the proposal, citing Black maternal mortality rates in Missouri. A 2023 report from the state’s Pregnancy-Associated Mortality Review found Black mothers were three times more likely to die within a year of pregnancy than white mothers. 
“When we legislate health care decisions that only women can biologically face without guaranteeing the support systems that make parenting a viable option,” Smith said. “We’re not passing laws, we’re passing judgement.” 
The proposed amendment approved Thursday is similar to the Senate version approved by a committee earlier this year over objections from one Republican lawmaker who opposes any exception for rape or incest.

(Screenshot from Florida Channel)A top Florida Republican warned Thursday that the Hope Florida Foundation could lose its tax exempt status if two $5 million payments the foundation made to other nonprofit groups wound up with a political committee opposing legalization of marijuana.
Rep. Alex Andrade made the remarks to board members during a virtual meeting Thursday. He also said he was glad the foundation board was addressing its delinquent paperwork, including making its IRS form 990 available for the public to review.
“But going forward right now, the circumstances, 80% of all the funds you’ve received, more than that, that you’ve dispensed, were used for political purposes, and I believe that will jeopardize your 501C3 status if you as the board do not take the proper steps to recoup those funds,” the Pensacola legislator said.
Andrade’s warning came during a rancorous public comment portion of the meeting in which people on the chat broadcast Nazi symbols, racial slurs and  pornography. Unable to control the flow of images or sounds being shared, the foundation board agreed to recess. The board was scheduled to reconvene late Thursday.
The board posted a link on its website apologizing for the disruption and said the Department of Children and Families was “actively working with law enforcement on the incident.”
Following the abbreviated meeting, Florida Democratic Party Chair Nikki Fried called on the Department of Justice to investigate. She also urged Jack Campbell, the state attorney for the Tallahassee area, who is a Democrat, to do the same.
“I do think that it’s appropriate for Jack Campbell to start looking into some of these actions,” Fried said in a virtual press conference with reporters, adding that she had not personally spoken to him about it.

I believe that will jeopardize your 501C3 status if you as the board do not take the proper steps to recoup those funds.


– Rep. Alex Andrade


Hope Florida is an initiative launched by First Lady Casey DeSantis to help steer people off public assistance programs using state agency staff. Hope Florida Foundation is a not-for-profit direct support organization for the Department of Children and Families, which helps to administer the Hope Florida program.
Hope Florida Foundation’s finances have come under scrutiny following a Miami Herald/Tampa Bay Times report that it paid $5 million apiece to two organizations that then contributed to Keep Florida Clean, a political committee that worked to defeat a proposed constitutional amendment to legalize marijuana.
The $10 million payment to the two groups mirrors the amount the Hope Florida Foundation received from health care giant Centene as part of a settlement regarding overpayment of Medicaid pharmacy benefits and services.

DeSantis: $10M payment to Hope Florida Foundation is a ‘cherry on top’

 
Gov. Ron DeSantis has cried foul, accusing the House of working with the liberal media to smear the first lady’s reputation as she potentially prepares for a gubernatorial run to replace her husband, who is being forced out of office due to term limits.
Leading the financial review in the House is Andrade, who has held two meetings over the last two weeks with high ranking Hope Florida officials and agency heads.
More Hope Florida resignations
Hope Florida Foundation president Joshua Hay kicked off Thursday’s meeting by announcing that Jake Farmer, a registered lobbyist for Walgreens Co., had resigned from the board of directors. 
Hay did not disclose when Farmer resigned and the Department of Children and Families didn’t immediately respond to Florida Phoenix’s request for his resignation letter. Farmer did not return Florida Phoenix’s phone call asking about his resignation.
Hay announced that Wendy Nissan had been appointed to the board of directors.
The meeting was interrupted before the board could publicly discuss its IRS 990.
The form shows that two state-contracted Medicaid managed care plans that were vying for lucrative new contracts made contributions to the Hope Florida Foundation. The contracts are the largest of their kind for the state and, according to the House of Representatives, the managed care plans will be paid $143 billion over the next six years to provide health care to the state’s poor, elderly, and disabled who rely on Medicaid for their health care.
The tax form shows that the Hope Florida Foundation received contributions from Simply Healthcare Plans and Centene of $98,408 and $95,223, respectively.
The state Agency for Health Care Administration has announced plans to award new contracts in April and a second round of announcements in July. The decisions expanded statewide Simply Healthcare’s footprint in the Medicaid managed care marketplace. The new contracts contain a requirement for the plans to work with the Hope Florida program and report information about their members to Hope Florida.
The IRS 990 form doesn’t list the dates contributions were made, only the time frame.
Headline-grabbing week
The board meeting capped a week of headlines for the foundation, a direct service organization for the Department of Children and Families as well as the Hope Florida program.
Hope Florida executive director Erik Dellenback is stepping down from his post as well as his position as chair of the Florida Faith and Community Advisory Council. Dellenback’s resignation was submitted in March and takes effect in May.  
Dellenback, though, did not mention his resignation during a lengthy House budget committee meeting in which he testified along with Hay and Department of Children and Families Secretary Taylor Hatch. The resignation was first reported following the meeting.
Hay was accompanied by his own attorney at the House meeting. During his sworn testimony, Hay acknowledged that the Hope Florida Foundation had made mistakes by not filing its required paperwork. He also testified that he’s been working with Tallahassee attorney Mohammad Jazil on completing the paperwork.
Jazil, who frequently represents state agencies and advises Keep Florida Clean, was recommended to him by attorney Jeff Aaron, Hay told the House committee. Aaron is a Republican attorney who successfully defended the governor in the lawsuit filed by suspended Hillsborough County State Attorney Andrew Warren.
“Jeff Aaron connected you with Mohammad Jazil, the attorney for Keep Florida Clean, to help Hope Florida’s foundation in complying with the paperwork, to retroactively justify this payment. Is that what I am hearing right now? Members, I am sorry, I am a little flabbergasted at this revelation,” Andrade said at the meeting.

Gretchen Whitmer signs an executive directive instructing the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services to analyze the ways federal cuts to Medicaid would impact Michigan. | Kyle DavidsonAs Republicans in Congress continue to eye cuts to critical programs like Medicaid in an effort to extend President Donald Trump’s 2017 tax cuts, several Michigan Democrats joined Gov. Gretchen Whitmer in Royal Oak Thursday, as she signed an executive directive instructing the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services to prepare a report detailing how Medicaid cuts would impact the state. 
Gathering at Corewell Health’s William Beaumont University Hospital, U.S. Reps. Debbie Dingell (D-Ann Arbor), Haley Stevens (D-Birmingham) and Rashida Tlaib (D-Detroit) warned that cutting funding to Medicaid could threaten access to care for some of the state’s most vulnerable residents, including children, seniors and people with disabilities. 
Dan Carey, the hospital’s president, noted that nearly 50% of all Michigan children and six out of 10 elderly adults rely on Medicaid for their health care. If these cuts pass, Carey questioned what would happen to those children, Michigan communities and the workers who care for those children. 
With the U.S. House’s budget resolution directing the House Energy and Commerce Committee to reduce the federal deficit by at least $880 billion over 10 years, Dingell, who serves on the committee, said there is no way to meet that goal without drastic cuts to Medicaid. 
  At an April 17, 2025 press conference in Royal Oak, Mich., U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Ann Arbor) warned that Republicans would not be able to move forward with proposed spending cuts without harming Medicaid. | Kyle Davidson
“Medicaid is already a lean program. With few options for how to fill the budget hole left by cuts to Medicaid funding, states will be forced to consider cuts to coverage and benefits, leaving more people uninsured and under insured,” Dingell said.
During a presentation to the Michigan Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on the Department of Health and Human Services in March, DHHS officials noted Michigan Medicaid makes up 34% of the state’s total budget, with 70% of funding for the state’s Medicaid program coming from the federal government.
“Any cut will place an enormous financial burden on parents, older adults, people with disabilities and their families, and especially those who have already spent down their assets and resources to qualify for Medicaid,” Dingell said. “Americans would have to forgo much needed care entirely, or their family members would be forced to choose between covering their children’s expenses, saving for their own retirement, or even being able to help their loved one.”

However, there is some hope Dingell said, noting that several Republicans have publicly opposed cuts to Medicaid. 
Stevens reflected on Whitmer’s efforts serving as the state Senate minority leader, working to craft the Healthy Michigan program, a bipartisan expansion to Medicaid signed into law by then Gov. Rick Snyder, a Republican. 
As Michigan hosts some of the lowest rates of uninsured individuals in the nation, it’s strange and upsetting that hosting the press conference was even necessary, Stevens said, noting that these concerns come five years after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
“I think that we can recognize the seriousness of what this moment represents, that people deserve better, that they deserve stability and consistency and access to medical benefits,” Stevens said. 
  U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens (D-Birmingham) said people deserve stability, consistency and access to medical benefits at an April 17, 2025 press conference held by Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. | Kyle Davidson
Tlaib emphasized that these cuts are not just numbers, and that every percentage cut was the life of a Michigan neighbor. 

She also pointed to the ongoing crisis in Black maternal health, with the maternal mortality rate for non-Hispanic Black women being nearly 3.5 times the rate for non-Hispanic white women. She further noted that more than 40% of births in the U.S. are paid for by Medicaid.

“Seventy-two million people across every corner of our country rely on Medicaid. I don’t think one congressional district in our nation is not impacted. For families and seniors and people with disabilities, Medicaid is the difference between survival and suffering,” Tlaib said.
Prior to signing her directive, Whitmer said Medicaid has allowed breast cancer survivors to receive their annual mammogram and ensured more families can receive regular dental care, visit a primary care physician, and ensure their child receives emergency care rather than keeping them home due to concerns about the hospital bill.
“In short, Medicaid saves lives, it lowers costs and ensures that we have a health system that can meet all of our needs, no matter where we get our health care from,” she said.

Cuts to Medicaid would also hit small towns and rural communities hard, Whitmer said, with 37% of Michiganders in these areas receiving Medicaid coverage. 
The harm would also extend beyond individuals receiving Medicaid coverage Whitmer said, with Michigan hospitals set to lose out on half a billion in Medicaid funding annually.
“The equation is simple, fewer jobs equal weaker economies and a less healthy Michigan. Hospitals in local and rural communities across Michigan will close, which threatens care for everyone, raises prices for everyone. It forces people to drive further for health care, even in emergency situations,” Whitmer said.
“Everyone agrees that there’s always more that can be found in terms of rooting out waste or fraud. But this is not about that. This is massive, devastating slashes to core government service. This won’t make government more efficient, it’ll just raise your costs, eliminate local jobs and put lives in danger,” Whitmer said. 
By examining the impact of Medicaid cuts on the state, Michiganders can see the cost of what Republicans are hoping to accomplish in Washington, Whitmer said. 
“We’re going to send a clear message to anyone trying to trade your health and someone else’s tax cut. Medicaid is not for sale. I’ll keep fighting over the cost of health care and support access to our critical programs like Medicaid, because if you’re sick in Michigan, it shouldn’t mean going broke,” Whitmer said before signing the directive.
“Let’s all double down on our efforts to make sure that Congress and our Republican legislators in particular hear us loud and clear. This is an important moment. We can’t not fight for the people of Michigan and that’s what this is all about,” Whitmer said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_0752-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-17 17:12:20.968408

(Photo by Nancy Lavin/Rhode Island Current)The seats are installed, the naming rights awarded and the first match to be hosted in Pawtucket’s new riverfront soccer stadium is less than one month away.
But the financial future of the newly christened Centreville Bank Stadium rests on more than a fan following; accompanying residential and commercial development is considered crucial to ensuring taxpayers get a return on government-issued bonds helping pay for the sports venue.
On Thursday, Fortuitous Partners unveiled the first details of the necessary and long-awaited housing and commercial development that will flank the stadium on either side of the Pawtucket River.
The plans, via partnerships with two “prominent” real estate developers, will bring more than 600 new housing units to the area along with commercial space, creating a kind of mini city encircling the new home for the Rhode Island FC team. 
“We are incredibly proud to see this vision for the riverfront and Tidewater Landing continue to come to life,” Dan Kroeber, managing partner at Fortuitous Partners, said in a statement. “This next phase of the development will not only support the new Centreville Bank Stadium, but also create a vibrant, connected community where residents, visitors, and fans can live, work, and enjoy everything Pawtucket’s riverfront has to offer.”
Revitalizing the vacant land mixed-use development was the original vision of private developers and state and city officials when they awarded a competitive bid to Fortuitous in 2019. What is now being proposed represents a substantial departure from the original timeline and cost.

At what price?
The price tag of the residential and commercial development was not available, with Fortuitous spokesperson Lala Ismailova citing “commercially sensitive financial information” in response to questions Thursday.
“We can confirm that we’re working closely with our partners and stakeholders to ensure the project is financially sound, responsibly managed, and positioned to deliver long-term value,” Ismailova said in an email. wrote  This next phase represents a major investment in Rhode Island’s future, bringing much-needed housing, improved public amenities, and supporting the broader vision for a vibrant riverfront district.
The 10,500-seat stadium has already come in substantially over budget and past the deadline, with blame placed on inflation and supply chain disruptions. 
Rhode Island Commerce’s board of directors reluctantly agreed to shift all of the state bonds meant to fund public parking and infrastructure improvements to the stadium itself, with Gov. Dan McKee casting the tiebreaking vote in July 2022. 
“We really got suckered,” Mike McNally, a former Commerce board member who voted against the reallocation of state bonds for the project, said in an interview Thursday. “It’s like buying land and building the swimming pool but not the house.”
Borrowing costs subsequently soared. The $132 million borrowing issued in February 2024 is more than double the $59 estimate two years prior, with $89 million in interest accounting for the bulk of the costs over the 30-year repayment period. The cost features just $36 million in public tax-increment financing bonds, which assume revenue generated from the project to pay off the debt.
Revenue from the stadium alone is unlikely to generate the money needed. A 2023 financial analysis from a Commerce consultant, based on lower total borrowing costs, identified a $52 million shortfall in revenue generated from the stadium over the life of the bonds. It noted the need for additional commercial and residential development to help the city and state break even on borrowing costs.
No additional analysis based on final borrowing costs is in the works, Matt Touchette, a Commerce spokesperson, said in an interview Thursday. The state and city will start making payments on the debt service in fiscal 2027.
The city of Pawtucket has also chipped in $10 million from its unspent pandemic aid for the project, while the state awarded $10 million in tax credits, all for the stadium.

Asking for more
Despite his misgivings over how public money was used in the project, McNally welcomed the news that the stadium developer was following through on its commitment to build housing.
“That’s really what we wanted all along,” McNally said. “As long as they don’t ask for more public investment, I will be happy with that.”
As of Thursday, Fortuitous has not approached House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi seeking more financial help from the state for the housing and commercial components, Larry Berman, a spokesperson for Shekarchi, confirmed via email.
Pawtucket city leaders have also not discussed financing details for the housing components with Fortuitous.
“Too early in the development process,” Christopher Hunter, a city spokesperson, said in an email. 
McKee’s office did not immediately return inquiries for comment Thursday.
But Kroeber told the Providence Journal that the company is hoping for public investment on the forthcoming infrastructure upgrades, which include a riverfront connecting both banks of the river, and pedestrian walkways. He did not specify a dollar figure. 
The next phase of development begins with construction of 300 market-rate housing units on the east side of the river, directly across from the new stadium. On the west side, fronting a new stadium plaza and riverfront, will be another 250 housing units and commercial space.
Boston-based real estate development and construction company Wood Partners will lead creation of both buildings. 
Farther north, on the east side of the river, a third set of 72 mixed-income housing units will be built by a separate developer, Philadelphia-based Pennrose. Federal and state tax credits offered for low-income housing will help to pay for this component of the project, which is under review by Rhode Island Housing. The city-owned land on School Street sits directly across from the Pawtucket Portuguese Social Club. Specific income limits for the affordable and workforce housing units have not been determined.
The housing and commercial development plans are now in the design and permitting phase, Ismailova said. She did not answer when asked for an expected completion date.   
Rhode Island FC will play its first match on home turf at 4 p.m. May 3, squaring off against San Antonio FC in an already sold-out game at Centreville Bank Stadium.

She had signaled she was considering a campaign for the seat left open by incumbent Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen’s announcement that she would retire at the end of her term. Goodlander told the TV station she was “proud to support” Chris Pappas, the fourth-term 1st District representative, in the race. Pappas made his run official earlier this month.
“I feel humbled and grateful to so many people across our state who have encouraged me to take a look at the United States Senate,” Goodlander told WMUR, “and after a lot of thought and conversations with people I love and people I respect, and people who I had never met before, who I work for in this role right now, I’ve decided that I’m running for re-election in the House of Representatives.”
Granite Staters won’t pick Shaheen’s replacement until November 2026, leaving months for the field to take shape. Chris Sununu, the former Republican governor who left office earlier this year, ended speculation over his candidacy recently when he told the Pulse of New Hampshire he would not run for the seat.

(Photo by Eesha Pendharkar/Maine Morning Star)The Maine Legislature rejected a bill this week that would bring back limits on syringe services, following the recommendation of state public health experts and medical professionals.
LD 219, introduced by Rep. Anne-Marie Mastraccio (D-Sanford), would have limited the number of clean syringes that certified needle exchange programs can hand out, reverting to a one-for-one ratio that Maine required until 2022, when it adopted rules that allow participants to bring in just one used syringe to receive 100 clean ones. 
The bill sparked lengthy debate in both chambers, particularly in the light of an HIV outbreak in Penobscot County that has primarily impacted the unhoused community that uses injectable drugs. 
Several lawmakers highlighted the issue of syringe litter on roads, parks and on private property, which they blamed on the higher number of syringes people can access. 
But ultimately, the majority of legislators supported the Health and Human Services Committee’s recommendation to reject the bill, citing best practices supported by the Maine Department of Health and Human Services and other public health and harm reduction organizations.
The Senate voted 22-21 against the bill Thursday following a 76-69 House vote earlier this week.
Republican Sen. Marianne Moore, who represents Washington County and sits on the Health Committee, expressed concern about the outbreak spreading to other counties, including her district. 
Needle exchanges face municipal pushback despite state, public health backing

“Limiting access to sterile syringes now will only make it harder to prevent, protect and control spread of disease in a county already under resourced and overburdened,” she said.
“We all want cleaner streets, safer communities and less syringe litter,” she said, but if we are serious about addressing syringe waste, she encouraged her peers to increase funding for disposal kiosks and biohazard containers. “Let’s stay the course of evidence-based policy,” Moore added.
Other Republican senators disagreed. Sen. Matt Harrington of York County and Sen. Scott Cyrway of Kennebec County raised concerns about drug overdoses and “decriminalizing drug culture.” 
“This idea that these centers are somehow reducing harm to me, is ridiculous,” Harrington said, referring to certified Syringe Service Programs. “This continuous nature of enabling this behavior… is just proven to be exacerbating this issue.”
Earlier this week, several Republican representatives also criticized the bill, saying they supported the limits the bill aimed to reimpose. 
“All Mainers and their pets are at risk of a dirty needle stick,” said Rep. Ann Fredericks of Sanford.
Sanford became one of the few municipalities to bring back limits in an emergency municipal ordinance last year, which bill sponsor Mastraccio said during her testimony helped reduce syringe litter.
But according to the Maine CDC’s syringe service report from 2023, released last May, most users bring in roughly the same amount of syringes they receive. Syringe services handed out 1.16 syringes for each one they collected last year, which means that despite some concern about the state’s 100 to 1 ratio, meaning the additional needles from these programs are not driving street litter. 
Syringe service programs also provide sharps disposal containers and help reduce discarded waste in communities, according to Dr. Kinna Thakarar, a physician at Maine Medical Center and an associate professor at the Tufts University School of Medicine. 
Rep. Ambureen Rana (D-Bangor) said a rigid one-toone model doesn’t match the reality of substance use and doesn’t work.
“We have seen it in rural cities and towns alike. Public health policy must be grounded in science and best practices and lived realities of our communities,” she said. “This bill is out of step with all three.”

Erika Geiss (D-Taylor) speaks on the Senate floor in support of the ""Momnibus"" package of bills on April 17, 2025. | ScreenshotA 10-bill package to reduce racial inequities in maternal mortality in Michigan passed through the Michigan Senate Thursday, with supporters hoping that the second time will be the charm to getting the so-called “momnibus” signed into law.
The legislation, which passed with bipartisan support, had received a similar reception when it was originally introduced in April 2024, but then failed to make it across the finish line after Republican lawmakers boycotted the lame duck session in December in protest to minimum and tipped wage reforms not being placed for a vote.
The main sponsor of the package is Sen. Erika Geiss (D-Taylor), who said the legislation incorporates a variety of approaches to improve prenatal and perinatal health outcomes in Michigan.
“By dismantling systemic barriers that disproportionately impact Black and brown birthing people, the Michigan Momnibus brings us one step closer to achieving equity and justice and reproductive and obstetric care,” Geiss told her colleagues prior to the vote. “It is a multifaceted bill package that works to improve integrity and accountability in Michigan’s maternal health care system, ensuring that every family has an equitable opportunity to have a healthy, joyful pregnancy, birthing, and postpartum experience that truly centers their needs.”



The Momnibus legislative package includes;
Senate Bill 29 mandates the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services to compile annual data on racial and ethnic disparities in health care, as well as review statewide maternal deaths in order to complete a report to the legislature starting in 2026 and then continuing every three years. The department would also have to come up with a statewide plan to reduce such ethnic and racial disparities in health care.
Senate Bill 30 would enact the “Biased and Unjust Care Reporting Act” which requires the state health department to take and analyze reports of unfair treatment by pregnant or postpartum individuals who say they received improper medical care that was not culturally informed or treatment that caused them harm. The department would have to create a reporting tool to accept such complaints while also maintaining the patients’ privacy.
Senate Bill 31 bars hospital leadership from discriminating against a patient on the basis of their pregnancy or lactating status and would require a health facility to stabilize a patient or resident going through labor before ceasing care for the patient upon the patient’s refusal or denial of care. The facility would have to author a policy on patient rights and adhere to the policy.
Senate Bill 32 requires insurance companies offering medical malpractice insurance policies to provide the Department of Insurance and Financial Services with a review of the policies related to perinatal care on an annual basis.
Senate Bill 33 clarifies that a patient’s pregnancy would not preclude a designated patient advocate from making life-sustaining treatment decisions for the patient.
Senate Bill 34 clarifies Michigan’s Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act to bar discrimination on the basis of sex, including pregnancy and lactation status. 
Senate Bill 36 amends the public health code to include eligible midwives who attended midwifery programs to participate in the state health department’s Michigan Essential Health Provider Repayment program.
Senate Bill 37 requires insurance companies that cover gynecological and pregnancy services to cover such services whether they be in a hospital or a patient’s home, by a qualified physician or nurse midwife or midwife.
Senate Bill 38 and Senate Bill 39 amends the Social Welfare Act to require the Healthy Michigan Plan to cover ultrasound procedures and fetal nonstress tests in offsite locations and permit Medicaid eligible individuals to be able to receive perinatal and gynecologic care under the Healthy Michigan Plan under certain circumstances.
 



Statistics have long corroborated disparities in maternal outcomes for women of color, with maternal mortality rates for Black women in the U.S. nearly 3.5 times the rate for non-Hispanic white women, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Additionally, the CDC says the rate of preterm birth among Black women is 12.34%, or about 1.5 times higher than the rate of preterm birth among white or Hispanic women, which stands at 7.64% and 8.72% respectively.
A lack of access to quality health care and educational resources are some of the reasons for the inequity, and are among the nonmedical factors that influence health outcomes. Known as the social determinants of health, the CDC says those factors include the conditions in which people are born, grow, work, live, worship, and age.
“Social determinants of health prevent many people from racial and ethnic minority groups from having fair opportunities for economic, physical, and emotional health,” said the CDC.
Geiss noted that the passage of the bills through the Senate came on the final day of Black Maternal Health Week.
“This has been a long road for the Michigan Momnibus, but by keeping the Momnibus moving, we can affirm a commitment to ensuring that healthy pregnancies and equitable care must transcend partisan racial, class, and economic divides, as every family deserves access to the care they need to thrive,” said Geiss.
The legislation was immediately referred to the Michigan House for consideration, where it was assigned to the Health Policy Committee.

(Photo by Jackie Llanos/Florida Phoenix)Juan Carlos Lopez-Gomez, a 20-year-old U.S. citizen, was being held in the Leon County Jail Thursday, charged with illegally entering Florida as an “unauthorized alien” — even as a supporter waved his U.S. birth certificate in court.
The man, who was arrested Wednesday after a traffic stop in which he was a passenger on his way to his job in Tallahassee, is set to remain in jail for the next 48 hours, waiting for federal immigration officials to pick him up, even though Leon County authorities dropped his first-degree misdemeanor charge.
His mother, Sebastiana Gomez-Perez, burst into tears at the sight of her son, who appeared virtually for his first hearing at the Leon County Courthouse. She left the courtroom distraught because she could do nothing to help her son, who was born and lives in Grady County, Georgia.
“I wanted to tell them, ‘Where are you going to take him? He is from here,’” his mother told the Phoenix in Spanish moments after exiting the courtroom. “I felt immense helplessness because I couldn’t do anything, and I am desperate to get my son out of there.”
She continued through tears: “It hurts so much. I’m sorry, I can’t.”
Leon County Judge LaShawn Riggans held Lopez-Gomez’s birth certificate up to the light after community advocate Silvia Alba silently waved the document in the courtroom.
“In looking at it, and feeling it, and holding it up to the light, the court can clearly see the watermark to show that this is indeed an authentic document,” Riggans said.
Based on her inspection of his birth certificate and Social Security card, Riggans said she found no probable cause for the charge. However, the state prosecutor insisted the court lacked jurisdiction over Lopez-Gomez’s release because U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement had formally asked the jail to hold him.
“This court does not have any jurisdiction other than what I’ve already done,” Riggans said.
Riggans said she was very sorry as Lopez-Gomez’s mother left.
‘I can’t do anything for their brother’
The 20-year-old’s first language is Tzotzil, a Mayan language, and he took a long pause when he was asked if he wanted to hire a private attorney or obtain a public defender. He lived in Mexico from the time he was 1-year-old until four years ago, when he returned to Georgia, his mother told the Phoenix.
“He hasn’t committed a crime for them to hold him, that’s what I don’t understand. I’m feeling bad because my daughters are asking me how their brother is. It hurts because I can’t do anything for their brother,” she said.
At issue is a recently passed law that a federal judge has temporarily barred the state from enforcing, further calling into question the validity of his arrest, the charge, and detention. Gov. Ron DeSantis signed SB 4-C into law on Feb. 14, and U.S. District Court Judge Kathleen Williams blocked its enforcement on April 4.
The law makes it a misdemeanor for undocumented immigrants over age 18 to “knowingly” enter Florida “after entering the United States by eluding or avoiding examination or inspection by immigration officers.”
Two other men who were in the car with Lopez-Gomez, the driver and another passenger, also had their first appearances on the same charges on Thursday. The driver was also charged with driving without a license.
Wednesday marked the second time Lopez-Gomez has been arrested. The Grady County Sheriff’s office took him into custody on Sunday and charged him with driving under the influence, his mother said. ICE also requested that the Georgia jail hold Lopez-Gomez, but he won release after his family showed officials his birth certificate and Social Security card, Gomez-Perez said.
Thomas Kennedy, a policy analyst for the Florida Immigrant Coalition, met Gomez-Perez at the courthouse. He said Lopez-Gomez’s case is exactly what his organization has been warning lawmakers would happen.
“It was just really sad seeing the mother distraught over her son, and the fact that she acknowledged that this is very likely a case of racial profiling against a U.S. citizen who can’t speak English,” he said in a phone interview with the Phoenix.
The Georgia Recorder, a partner of Florida Phoenix, has submitted a public records request to obtain more information about his arrest Sunday. This is a developing story and will be updated.

(Stock photo by Imaginima/Getty Images)A bill moving through the state Legislature to establish tax breaks for energy-hogging data centers could pose serious risks to Colorado’s climate goals, utility rates and state budget, environmental groups say.
Senate Bill 25-280 was given initial approval by the Senate Transportation and Energy Committee on a 6-3 vote, after a lengthy hearing on Wednesday. Democrats, who hold commanding majorities at the statehouse, were split on the bill, with three joining the committee’s Republicans in favor, and three opposed.
Sponsored by state Sens. Nick Hinrichsen, a Pueblo Democrat, and Paul Lundeen, a Colorado Springs Republican, the measure would create a “Data Center Development and Grid Modernization Program” in the state’s economic development office. Beginning in 2026, it would offer sales and income tax credits to incentivize investments in data centers and upgrades to electric transmission infrastructure. A nonpartisan fiscal analysis estimates the tax breaks would initially cost the state about $17 million a year.

Hinrichsen pitched data centers — sprawling server farms that power artificial intelligence models, cloud computing services and other technology — as an economic lifeline for communities like Pueblo, which faces a looming drop-off in tax revenue because of the early closure of Xcel Energy’s coal-fired Comanche Generating Station. To help the state meet its greenhouse gas emissions targets, Comanche’s final remaining 750-megawatt generating unit is now scheduled to be closed 40 years ahead of schedule in 2031, with a local tax revenue loss estimated at $25 million a year.
“We’re heading towards this cliff, and we have some significant challenges, but with data centers, we have a really, really unique opportunity,” Hinrichsen said. “We have a prime geographic location. We have the energy capacity and development capabilities to support a data center.”
States rethink data centers as ‘electricity hogs’ strain the grid

But a nationwide boom in data center construction, largely driven by investment in AI, has stoked concerns about the electricity- and water-intensive facilities’ impact on the environment, and what the surging demand for energy could do to utility rates paid by consumers. Data centers made up about 4.4% of all U.S. electricity demand in 2023, and that figure could rise to 12% by 2028, the Department of Energy estimated last year. In addition to large amounts of electricity, operators use millions of gallons of water a year to cool their equipment.
Megan Kemp, a policy advocate with environmental group EarthJustice, called SB-280 “rushed legislation” that doesn’t balance generous incentives for data center operators with protections for Colorado communities.
“(The bill) fails to provide critical safeguards for utility customers, neglects to consider impacts on communities and undermines our progress toward meeting critical climate goals,” Kemp told lawmakers.
Budget and climate impacts
The bill’s sponsors and its critics disagreed sharply during Wednesday’s hearing on the outlook for the data center industry in Colorado in the absence of new incentives.
Hinrichsen said that while he was reluctant to pass legislation that would reduce state tax revenues in the face of a serious budget crunch, he had been convinced by “hundreds of conversations over the summer and fall” that Colorado isn’t competing effectively with other states for data center investments.
“What I have heard talking to folks in my economic development community, folks at the chamber of commerce, and those in the data center development world, is, ‘It’s not going to happen in our current framework,’” he said. “This is an opportunity that we’re uniquely poised to capitalize on, that we will not capitalize on, and 100% of nothing is precisely nothing.”
But Justin Brant, utility program director at the Southwest Energy Efficiency Project, a Boulder-based environmental group, pointed to requests for over two gigawatts of new electricity load received by Xcel Energy, Colorado’s largest electric utility.
“Data centers are coming to our state no matter what,” Brant said.
Climate advocates are especially concerned that surging data center demand could lead electricity providers to prolong the use of fossil-fuel-powered generating assets, a trend already seen in the southeastern U.S., where utilities are expanding natural gas infrastructure to meet the anticipated demand increase.
Sara Axelrod, head of public affairs at Denver-based Crusoe Energy, told lawmakers of the “cocktail of energy solutions needed to power campuses like this.” Crusoe began in 2018 as a bitcoin mining operation powered by the waste methane from oil and gas extraction — excess natural gas that’s typically vented or flared by drillers — and now uses the same power source to power AI infrastructure.
“There is no perfect, one-size-fits-all energy solution when it comes to powering these data centers, particularly as we talk about AI and the increasing scale of these data centers,” Axelrod said.
Committee members adopted five amendments to the bill on Wednesday, including a major rewrite known as “strike below” amendment, which Hinrichsen said was intended to address concerns from labor groups.
But Brant said that while the amendment did “address some of our concerns, it raises a whole host of additional ones,” including questions about geographic preferences for data center sites and the applicability of the state’s renewable energy standard.
“This bill was written by the data centers with little or no stakeholder involvement,” he said. “We’d be happy to work with them and the sponsors in the interim to get something right, but this one doesn’t do it.”
“There’s so many big things that still need to be ironed out, that I’m really concerned,” said state Sen. Lisa Cutter, an Evergreen Democrat who voted against the bill. “I think you’re trying to address some of these things. But it just seems like there’s still a lot to be discussed.”

(Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Indiana legislation to study the absorption of secessionist Illinois counties heads to Gov. Mike Braun after a successful concurrence vote Thursday, along with measures to examine “noncompliant” prosecutors and expand local funding options for transportation infrastructure.
“I think it’s been a great opportunity to talk about all the great things going on in Indiana, and to say … we’d love to have that conversation,” Indiana House Speaker Todd Huston, R-Fishers, told reporters.

His House Enrolled Act 1008 would create an Indiana-Illinois Boundary Adjustment Commission tasked with exploring the absorption of Prairie State counties that have already voted to secede. Since 2020, 33 counties have passed such “advisory referenda,” with seven of those votes occurring in the most recent general election.
Originally, Illinois would’ve had to appoint members for the commission to convene. Now, it must meet by September — with or without Prairie State representation.
“That’s their choice whether they want to participate or not,” Huston said, shortly after the 64-23 concurrence vote.
House Minority Leader Phil GiaQuinta, D-Fort Wayne criticized the measure as a “publicity ploy,” and argued the secessionist counties would sink Indiana finances instead of contributing revenue.
Local prosecutors, roads
A proposal punishing public prosecutors who “categorically refuse to prosecute” criminal laws also crossed the finish line Thursday, on a 60-20 concurrence vote in the House.
House Enrolled Act 1006 initially would’ve also boosted the number of qualified special prosecutors available for appointment and offered partial reimbursement for prosecutors, defenders and more.

But those came with price tags, so the Senate stripped them out.
Now, it mainly creates a prosecutor review board that will scrutinize prosecutors and issue reports to the Indiana Prosecuting Attorneys Council on those labeled “noncompliant.” But it no longer requires that funding be withheld.
And a complex transportation funding measure avoided negotiations — contrary to Senate expectations — when it earned a 69-19 concurrence vote in the House.
House Bill 1461 would change up the popular Community Crossings Matching Grant Program, raise the speed limit on Interstate 465, let communities tap into excess township funds and ease barriers to tolling, among numerous other provisions.
Opponents largely cited the tolling provisions as problematic, complaining about the impact to residents and local streets.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)  The Iowa Senate amended an open meetings and records bill Thursday to list security camera footage from the Iowa Capitol building as “confidential records.”
House File 706 is this year’s attempt to implement higher penalties and training requirements for Iowa’s open meetings and records laws. Fines for violating open meetings laws would increase to between $500 and $2,500 from the current range of between $100 and $500.
Knowing violations of these laws would rise to between $5,000 and $12,500; the current fine is between $1,000 and $2,500. The bill also would require that a member of a government body be removed from office if they engaged in a prior violation of open meetings laws. Additionally, newly elected and appointed public officials would have to complete a training on open records laws when they take office.
The bill passed the House unanimously in March. The measure is largely a response to alleged violations of open records laws by the city of Davenport following a six-story apartment building collapse in 2023 and alleged open meetings law violations regarding the city of Davenport reaching settlement agreements with three city employees without the city council’s approval in a public meeting.
Lawmakers also approved similar legislation in 2024, but the bill was vetoed by Gov. Kim Reynolds over language added as a Senate amendment introduced by Sen. Scott Webster, R-Bettendorf, that changed the definition of a “meeting” of a government body.
Though this language is not present in the 2025 bill, Webster introduced an amendment Thursday that would add two types of information to the list of approved confidential records in Iowa Code — information obtained from security cameras operated by the legislative branch on property owned or leased by the state, and information “obtained from state employee identification card access systems” for buildings and rooms owned or leased by the state — specifically referring to the Iowa State Capitol.
Webster said this language, approved as an amendment in a 32-15 vote, would prevent people from using open records requests to find “blind spots” in Capitol security and prevent stalking or harassment of elected officials and government employees.
“If people wanted to cause this harm to the Capital building — to the people’s building — wanted to find out and go through all the camera footage to figure out where the blind spots might be in this Capitol, they could do it through an open records (request),” Webster said. “We’re eliminating that availability right now, which makes everybody in this building safer.”
Legislative staff said they are not aware of security camera footage being used to stalk or harass any lawmakers at the Statehouse.
Webster said an agreement was reached with groups like the Freedom of Information Council, the Iowa Newspaper Association and House lawmakers removing restrictions on the Iowa Department of Public Safety footage in an earlier version of the amendment, to ensure access to body camera footage would not be impacted.
But Democrats said the measure would prevent Iowans from accessing public information. Sen. Janet Petersen, D-Des Moines, said that Iowans, as taxpayers, are paying for lawmakers’ and public workers’ time at the Iowa State Capitol, and should be able to access footage as requested.
“They’re paying the bill to run the camera,” Petersen said. “They’re paying the bill for this beautiful building. Why would we take public access away from them — in an open meetings bill no less? You want to take away public access and say it’s because of security — no it’s not.”
Webster said security camera footage could still be accessed through subpoenas — court orders to provide information or records — in cases where a person commits a crime in the Capitol building.
Sen. Herman Quirmbach, D-Ames, said the potential use of subpoenas to access these records was an “excuse” to obscure the limit being put on public access to what happens at the Capitol.
“The average citizen doesn’t have access to getting a subpoena, and shouldn’t need that access in that manner,” Quirmbach said. “The bill, as it has been amended, restricts the public access. It is not something that this Legislature should endorse.”
The measure returns to the House for approval of the amendment.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/cap-from-north-side-4.1.jpg,,,2025-04-17 16:12:10.677330

(Ellen Schmidt/Minnesota Reformer)Federal education dollars are now at risk thanks to President Donald Trump’s dismantling of the U.S. Department of Education, which could significantly hurt Minnesota public school districts — the majority of which receive at least 10% of their budgets from the feds, according to the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank.
Tribal nations within Minnesota’s borders would be even more impacted, as a larger share of their budgets comes from the feds. The Red Lake Public School District received nearly 40% of its revenue from federal funding in fiscal year 2022, according to EPI.
The Trump administration promised that closing the department won’t result in cutting federal funds, but the people who are responsible for determining whether schools qualify for a grant could soon be let go, risking the reliability of the funds.
Republicans in Congress are also desperate to find cuts to pay for more border defense, Pentagon spending and tax cuts and proposed significant cuts to federal education spending as recently as 2023. 
School districts receive the majority of their funding from the state and local governments, but the federal government plays a large role in assisting K-12 schools in low-income communities through Title 1 funding. The EPI study found that in most cases, federal funds make up less than 20% of a district’s budget. But, many districts rely far more heavily on the federal government, particularly in southern states, where some districts receive 70% of their revenue from the feds.

Many northern Minnesota school districts in and around tribal nations receive significant federal funds, as they are low-income areas. Cass Lake-Bena Public Schools, Mahnomen Public School District and Waubun-Ogema-White Earth Schools received about 30% of their district revenue from the feds in fiscal year 2022, according to the EPI analysis.
St. Paul Public School District received $176 million from the federal government in the same year, which accounts for 21% of its total revenue. Minneapolis Public Schools received $145 million, about 19% of its total revenue.
School districts across Minnesota and in the Twin Cities metro are facing severe budget shortfalls and have drawn down reserves to fill the gaps. The end of one-time pandemic aid, inflation and declining enrollment are major contributors to school districts’ tight budgets.
A cut to federal funding, even those schools that receive about 10% of federal funds, would require districts to lay off teachers and staff and make other difficult budget decisions. Or, they will go to voters in their districts and ask them to approve a property tax hike.
In addition to Title 1, the feds provide money for the IDEA program for special education students.
The Trump administration has threatened to withhold billions of these federal dollars to states that don’t capitulate to its demand that they end the use of diversity programs in public schools. 
Title 1 funds have been withheld from school districts at least once in recent history — to incentivize districts to desegregate.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Minnesota-Reformer-File-05-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-17 16:12:10.677330

(Photo by Jackie Llanos/Florida Phoenix)Juan Carlos Lopez-Gomez, a 20-year-old U.S. citizen, was being held in the Leon County Jail Thursday, charged with illegally entering Florida as an “unauthorized alien” — even as a supporter waved his U.S. birth certificate in court.
The man, who was arrested Wednesday after a traffic stop in which he was a passenger on his way to his job in Tallahassee, is set to remain in jail for the next 48 hours, waiting for federal immigration officials to pick him up, even though Leon County authorities dropped his first-degree misdemeanor charge.
His mother, Sebastiana Gomez-Perez, burst into tears at the sight of her son, who appeared virtually for his first hearing at the Leon County Courthouse. She left the courtroom distraught because she could do nothing to help her son, who was born and lives in Grady County, Georgia.
“I wanted to tell them, ‘Where are you going to take him? He is from here,’” his mother told the Phoenix in Spanish moments after exiting the courtroom. “I felt immense helplessness because I couldn’t do anything, and I am desperate to get my son out of there.”
She continued through tears: “It hurts so much. I’m sorry, I can’t.”
Leon County Judge LaShawn Riggans held Lopez-Gomez’s birth certificate up to the light after community advocate Silvia Alba silently waved the document in the courtroom.
“In looking at it, and feeling it, and holding it up to the light, the court can clearly see the watermark to show that this is indeed an authentic document,” Riggans said.
Based on her inspection of his birth certificate and Social Security card, Riggans said she found no probable cause for the charge. However, the state prosecutor insisted the court lacked jurisdiction over Lopez-Gomez’s release because U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement had formally asked the jail to hold him.
“This court does not have any jurisdiction other than what I’ve already done,” Riggans said.
Riggans said she was very sorry as Lopez-Gomez’s mother left.
 ‘I can’t do anything for their brother’

The 20-year-old’s first language is Tzotzil, a Mayan language, and he took a long pause when he was asked if he wanted to hire a private attorney or obtain a public defender. He lived in Mexico from the time he was 1-year-old until four years ago, when he returned to Georgia, his mother told the Phoenix.
“He hasn’t committed a crime for them to hold him, that’s what I don’t understand. I’m feeling bad because my daughters are asking me how their brother is. It hurts because I can’t do anything for their brother,” she said.
At issue is a recently passed law that a federal judge has temporarily barred the state from enforcing, further calling into question the validity of his arrest, the charge, and detention. Gov. Ron DeSantis signed SB 4-C into law on Feb. 14, and U.S. District Court Judge Kathleen Williams blocked its enforcement on April 4.
The law makes it a misdemeanor for undocumented immigrants over age 18 to “knowingly” enter Florida “after entering the United States by eluding or avoiding examination or inspection by immigration officers.”
Two other men who were in the car with Lopez-Gomez, the driver and another passenger, also had their first appearances on the same charges on Thursday. The driver was also charged with driving without a license.
Wednesday marked the second time Lopez-Gomez has been arrested. The Grady County Sheriff’s office took him into custody on Sunday and charged him with driving under the influence, his mother said. ICE also requested that the Georgia jail hold Lopez-Gomez, but he won release after his family showed officials his birth certificate and Social Security card, Gomez-Perez said.
Thomas Kennedy, a policy analyst for the Florida Immigrant Coalition, met Gomez-Perez at the courthouse. He said Lopez-Gomez’s case is exactly what his organization has been warning lawmakers would happen.
“It was just really sad seeing the mother distraught over her son, and the fact that she acknowledged that this is very likely a case of racial profiling against a U.S. citizen who can’t speak English,” he said in a phone interview with the Phoenix.

(Courtesy of Ewing campaign)OMAHA — Douglas County Treasurer John Ewing spent Omaha’s first general election debate Thursday framing his pitch for voters to retire three-term Omaha Mayor Jean Stothert and hire him.
His core argument: Omaha and its dynamic business community and neighborhoods are growing in spite of stale city leadership but would grow faster under his collaborative approach.
“I will get things done for the people of this community … and if you like what I’ve done as Douglas County Treasurer, you’re going to love what I’m going to do as your next mayor,” he said.
Stothert, seeking a modern-record fourth term, spent most of the Omaha Press Club and League of Women Voters debate touting the city’s performance in her nearly dozen years as mayor. The debate was moderated by WOWT anchor Brian Mastre.
Parks and urban core
She said the city, with help from private donors and developers, is purposefully rebuilding the urban core’s parks and public spaces to make the city more interesting and appealing.

“We need steady leadership,” she said. “We need initiative. We need commitment to continue this great momentum. We have to build a stronger city for tomorrow.”
Both candidates agreed that Omaha has grown as a destination for young professionals but disagreed over whether City Hall has been a help or a hindrance in that progress.
Ewing said the local private donors and developers he speaks with say they are working around a lack of trust with the city to build and maintain new parks and event facilities.
“We have that new park for a reason, and that is because the city neglected the former Gene Leahy Mall and did not take care of that facility properly,” Ewing said.
Stothert disagreed, saying no donors would invest millions of dollars in downtown Omaha without trusting the leadership of the city. She said business leaders like the track the city is on.
“What my opponent just said is absolutely false,” Stothert said. “It’s not a lack of trust that the private sector and the philanthropists would put in $400 million for a park.”
Public safety and streetcar
Ewing, a former deputy chief at the Omaha Police Department, said his former co-workers were performing well despite being short more than 100 people. He said he would help them recruit.
“I have the skill set to help them be able to recruit police officers and get to full staffing so that they can really focus on community policing and building relationships,” he said.

Stothert said Ewing and critics of the pace of police hiring don’t understand the negative impact that protests after George Floyd’s death in Minneapolis had on interest in police careers.
She dismissed Ewing’s criticism of the city’s public safety approach, pointing to crime stats she said show improvement. She credited police for working with community leaders.
“We will always be 5% higher [in pay] than any law enforcement agency in the state of Nebraska, and I feel like that will stop this cycle of everybody trying to catch up,” she said.
The two candidates largely agreed on the best path forward for the streetcar, saying they would like to eventually see plans that expand the route north and south to more of the city.
Ewing took a jab at Stothert for not letting the people vote on the project but has said the project is too far along to stop. He said Omaha needed to maximize development along the route.
“We have to ensure that it’s going to be the best possible use of our resources in this community as possible,” he said.
Stothert defended not going to a vote because the project did not raise taxes on Omaha residents and instead relies on a state-created incentive known as tax-increment financing.
She said it would spur more than $4 billion in private investment along the route from midtown Omaha’s University of Nebraska Medical Center to Mutual of Omaha’s downtown campus.
“It is a catalyst for economic development,” she said.
Traffic cameras, immigration and DEI
Both candidates also agreed on the positive impact of diversity and immigration on Omaha. Stothert and Ewing defended the city having a diversity, equity and inclusion officer.

One brief but interesting disagreement: traffic cameras. Ewing said he supported them for traffic infraction enforcement, while Stothert questioned their reliability and effectiveness.
Stothert won the five-way April primary with 27,245 votes. Ewing finished second with 24,605. The remaining candidates, including former State Sen. Mike McDonnell, earned 23,358 votes.
She said she would continue to focus her message on the priorities she said the people have prioritized: public safety, lower taxes and economic development.
“We work really, really hard, and we don’t take anything for granted,” she said, adding that she earned a higher percentage of the primary vote than she had in her first race.
Ewing said he saw something different in the numbers from April: voter fatigue with the mayor. Repeating his stump speech, he said the people of Omaha are ready for a change.
“What I learned from the primary is that 65% of the voters wanted a new mayor,” Ewing said. He later added: “The most important thing an elected leader can do is be responsive.”
Said Stothert: “Cities never stand still. They are either moving forward and growing or they are declining and falling behind. I want to keep Omaha moving forward.”

Jackie Llanos/Florida PhoenixJuan Carlos Lopez-Gomez, a 20-year-old U.S. citizen, was being held in the Leon County Jail Thursday, charged with illegally entering Florida as an “unauthorized alien” — even as a supporter waved his U.S. birth certificate in court.
The man, who was arrested Wednesday after a traffic stop in which he was a passenger on his way to his job in Tallahassee, is set to remain in jail for the next 48 hours, waiting for federal immigration officials to pick him up, even though Leon County authorities dropped his first-degree misdemeanor charge.
His mother, Sebastiana Gomez-Perez, burst into tears at the sight of her son, who appeared virtually for his first hearing at the Leon County Courthouse. She left the courtroom distraught because she could do nothing to help her son, who was born and lives in Grady County, Georgia.
“I wanted to tell them, ‘Where are you going to take him? He is from here,’” his mother told the Phoenix in Spanish moments after exiting the courtroom. “I felt immense helplessness because I couldn’t do anything, and I am desperate to get my son out of there.”
She continued through tears: “It hurts so much. I’m sorry, I can’t.”
Leon County Judge LaShawn Riggans held Lopez-Gomez’s birth certificate up to the light after community advocate Silvia Alba silently waved the document in the courtroom.
“In looking at it, and feeling it, and holding it up to the light, the court can clearly see the watermark to show that this is indeed an authentic document,” Riggans said.
Based on her inspection of his birth certificate and Social Security card, Riggans said she found no probable cause for the charge. However, the state prosecutor insisted the court lacked jurisdiction over Lopez-Gomez’s release because U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement had formally asked the jail to hold him.
“This court does not have any jurisdiction other than what I’ve already done,” Riggans said.
Riggans said she was very sorry as Lopez-Gomez’s mother left.
‘I can’t do anything for their brother’

	
The 20-year-old’s first language is Tzotzil, a Mayan language, and he took a long pause when he was asked if he wanted to hire a private attorney or obtain a public defender. He lived in Mexico from the time he was 1-year-old until four years ago, when he returned to Georgia, his mother told the Phoenix.
“He hasn’t committed a crime for them to hold him, that’s what I don’t understand. I’m feeling bad because my daughters are asking me how their brother is. It hurts because I can’t do anything for their brother,” she said.
At issue is a recently passed law that a federal judge has temporarily barred the state from enforcing, further calling into question the validity of his arrest, the charge, and detention. Gov. Ron DeSantis signed SB 4-C into law on Feb. 14, and U.S. District Court Judge Kathleen Williams blocked its enforcement on April 4.
The law makes it a misdemeanor for undocumented immigrants over age 18 to “knowingly” enter Florida “after entering the United States by eluding or avoiding examination or inspection by immigration officers.”
Two other men who were in the car with Lopez-Gomez, the driver and another passenger, also had their first appearances on the same charges on Thursday. The driver was also charged with driving without a license.
Wednesday marked the second time Lopez-Gomez has been arrested. The Grady County Sheriff’s office took him into custody on Sunday and charged him with driving under the influence, his mother said. ICE also requested that the Georgia jail hold Lopez-Gomez, but he won release after his family showed officials his birth certificate and Social Security card, Gomez-Perez said.
Thomas Kennedy, a policy analyst for the Florida Immigrant Coalition, met Gomez-Perez at the courthouse. He said Lopez-Gomez’s case is exactly what his organization has been warning lawmakers would happen.
“It was just really sad seeing the mother distraught over her son, and the fact that she acknowledged that this is very likely a case of racial profiling against a U.S. citizen who can’t speak English,” he said in a phone interview with the Phoenix.

Josh Shapiro’s official residence early Sunday morning. (Ian Karbal/Capital-Star)Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called on the U.S. Department of Justice and the FBI to open a full investigation into the firebombing of Gov. Josh Shapiro’s official residence and whether it constitutes a federal hate crime.
Shapiro, his family and guests were awakened and evacuated safely from the Harrisburg residence early Sunday morning after a fire broke out in a public part of the building. Hours earlier, Shapiro, who is Jewish, hosted Passover Seder in the state dining room, which was heavily damaged in the attack.
“Given the deeply troubling allegations that the suspect targeted Governor Shapiro based in part on his religious identity, the April 13 incident warrants immediate and serious federal scrutiny,” Schumer said in a letter to U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi.
At an event in Harrisburg thanking firefighters Thursday, Shapiro reiterated that he would not weigh in on what the charges should be.
“Let me be very clear, I have total and complete confidence in (Dauphin County) District Attorney Fran Chardo to charge this case as he sees fit, to analyze the evidence, to apply the law and to see the case through,” Shapiro said.
Shapiro said he placed his trust in Chardo’s judgment and that he would respect the Department of Justice’s decision whether to bring federal charges.
“As to Senator Schumer or anybody else, I don’t think it’s helpful for people on the outside who haven’t seen the evidence, who don’t know what occurred, who are applying their own viewpoints to the situation to weigh in, in that manner,” he said.
Authorities quickly concluded the fire was intentionally set. A Harrisburg man who turned himself in to state police later in the day confessed to using Molotov cocktails to start the blaze. He also said he planned to beat Shapiro with a hammer he carried if he encountered the governor  inside the residence.

Cody Balmer, 38, has been charged with attempted murder, aggravated arson, terrorism, aggravated assault, burglary and related offenses. He was held without bail in Dauphin County Jail after a hearing Monday.
In an interview with investigators, Balmer said that he felt hatred toward Shapiro. Search warrants for Balmer’s electronic devices and writings released Wednesday revealed he made references to Shapiro and Palestine in a 911 call shortly after the fire when he also made a confession.
“The suspect told 911 operators that Governor Shapiro needs to know the suspect ‘will not take part in [Shapiro’s] plans for what he wants to do to the Palestinian people’ and referenced ‘our people’ being harmed by ‘that monster,’ Schumer’s letter says.
“These statements — in conjunction with the timing of the attack during Passover, Governor Shapiro’s visible embrace of his Jewish faith, and the context of rising antisemitism globally and across the country — raise serious concerns about antisemitic motivation,” the letter says.

Shapiro said Bondi was among dozens of officials, former governors and others who offered support and prayers on Sunday. Bondi said in a press briefing Wednesday that she and FBI director Kash Patel spoke with Shapiro after the attack.
She said Wednesday that she firmly believed the attack was intended to kill Shapiro and pledged to work with state authorities to do “anything we can to help convict the person that did this and keep them behind bars as long as possible.”
Pennsylvania law provides prosecutors the option of adding an “ethnic intimidation” charge when a person commits an underlying offense such as assault, harassment, stalking and other crimes motivated by hatred toward the race, color, religion or national origin of a person or group.
The charge enhances the severity of the offense, which can lead to tougher penalties. If an offense such as assault is graded as a second-degree felony, the ethnic intimidation charge becomes a first-degree felony with a maximum prison sentence of 20 years.
The Justice Department enforces a number of laws covering crimes based on race, color, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity or disability. These include damage to religious property and violent interference with federal protected activities.
The Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act covers attempted homicide and carries a maximum sentence of life in prison.

Americans are watching as the new presidential administration dangerously hacks away at institutions of our federal government at the expense of the people, with a slew of executive orders that violate the Constitution and aim to strip Americans of cherished civil liberties they have known for generations.
We can no longer rely on Congress as a backstop. The Trump administration has ordered the Department of Justice to cease all involvement in civil rights cases, including enforcement of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (VRA), which has protected Americans’ right to vote since the civil rights era.
Congress has refused to pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and is responsible for continuing to renew the VRA, and federal courts have been slowly eroding federal voting rights protections for years. The Supreme Court has notoriously ruled against landmark provisions of the VRA, like the 2013 Shelby v. Holder decision and the 2021 Brnovich v. Democratic National Committee decision.
Yet, in this time of uncertainty and national instability, Colorado can act on its own to strengthen the right to vote for Coloradans.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Senate Bill 25-1, the Colorado Voting Rights Act, will protect the access to the ballot Colorado voters currently have while protecting the state from the dismantling of the federal Voting Rights Act, any federal or state administration changes, and future attempts to undermine fair and accessible elections, regardless of who controls Congress or the White House.
And it’s not just democracy advocates who support this move — two-thirds of Coloradans agree. A new poll from the State Innovation Exchange found that voters support a Colorado Voting Rights Act by a wide margin of 61%, with 46% supporting it strongly, more than all of those who oppose it combined.
Coloradans from all walks of life support the Colorado Voting Rights Act and see it as a policy that protects all communities, not just some, garnering an additional stamp of approval from 64% of centrist voters, and 62% of independent voters.
Despite all the strides Colorado has made in breaking down barriers to voter participation, we still have one of the widest racial turnout gaps in the nation. The COVRA addresses this while codifying anti-discrimination protections into state law.
Specifically, the COVRA will help build a more equitable democracy by setting clear and fair standards to ensure election administrators employ practices that do not create systemic disparities in participation between communities. The COVRA also prohibits election methods that dilute the vote of communities of color, targeting classic cases of gerrymandering that result in communities being underrepresented.
All local jurisdictions in Colorado are already subject to anti-discrimination standards under the federal VRA. Unlike the federal VRA, the COVRA is designed to help resolve disagreements over election rules outside of court whenever possible. Local governments would remain free to continue running their elections independently and according to their own rules and practices; the new bill simply sets standards in state law to prevent and address discriminatory practices.
Additionally, the bill creates explicit protections for LGBTQ+ voters, voters with disabilities, and eligible voters who are confined in jail during an election so that every Coloradan with the right to vote is protected under state law.
Colorado must take decisive action to protect our civil rights and liberties before it is too late. Our attorney general currently lacks the authority to enforce the VRA, and we need to equip our state to defend voting rights if federal protections fall.
Democracy includes everyone — no matter their race, background, ZIP code, or income — and every single eligible Coloradan deserves to fairly cast a ballot.
The Colorado Voting Rights Act will ensure that every voter’s voice is protected in future elections, no matter who is in charge.

Free.,Federal appeals court temporarily freezes multibillion-dollar Biden climate fund,Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/federal-appeals-court-temporarily-freezes-multibillion-dollar-biden-climate-fund,,"WASHINGTON — The legal battle over a Biden-era climate program ramped up late Wednesday when an appeals court halted a federal judge’s ruling requiring the disbursement of those funds.The ruling by a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit will keep funds frozen in Citibank accounts while a federal suit over the program is ongoing.The appeals court order reversed a preliminary injunction that U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan of the District of Columbia issued Tuesday that temporarily barred the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency from “unlawfully suspending or terminating” grant awards.The appeals panel said it had not had access to Chutkan’s opinion explaining her order granting an injunction — which came a day after the order itself — and the trial judge had therefore not met the high bar needed to issue a preliminary injunction. The panel’s order “should not be construed in any way as a ruling on the merits,” the judges said.“The purpose of this order is to give the court sufficient opportunity to consider the district court’s forthcoming opinion in support of its order granting a preliminary injunction together with” the government’s appeal, the judges wrote.Chutkan issued her opinion the day after granting the preliminary injunction, pointing out that “for weeks, despite repeated inquiries to Citibank and EPA, Plaintiffs received little to no communication from EPA or Citibank regarding their inability to access their funds.”“Overnight, billions of dollars appropriated by Congress were frozen. As a result, nationwide projects were halted, workplans were disrupted, and millions of dollars in approved transactions with committed partners could not be disbursed,” she wrote.Fight over fundingClimate United Fund and other organizations sued President Donald Trump’s administration and Citibank in March over money frozen in the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund.The $27 billion initiative, which provides funding to organizations building for energy-efficient projects and other measures to tackle climate change, was authorized by Congress as part of the Inflation Reduction Act that Democrats passed along party lines and President Joe Biden signed into law in 2022.Chutkan’s order blocked the administration from “directly or indirectly impeding” Citibank or causing the bank to “deny, obstruct, delay, or otherwise limit access to funds in accounts established in connection with” the organizations’ grants.The Trump administration quickly challenged that ruling Wednesday in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.The higher court temporarily blocked Chutkan’s decision “pending further order.”The appeals court’s ruling halts Chutkan’s preliminary injunction to the extent that it “enables or requires Citibank to release, disburse, transfer, otherwise move, or allow access to funds.”The higher court also prevented the Trump administration from having to file a status report with the district court within 24 hours of the preliminary injunction’s entry that confirmed their compliance, as outlined in Chutkan’s ruling.The appeals court also ordered that “no party take any action, directly or indirectly, with regard to the disputed contracts, grants, awards or funds.”The EPA said in March it would be terminating $20 billion in grants under the program, and the agency’s administrator Lee Zeldin described the climate initiative as a “gold bar” scheme.Climate United Fund did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday, and the EPA declined to comment.",,,,2025-04-17 15:10:45.240723

(Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries)This story was originally published by The Appeal.
As U.S. homelessness rates reach record highs, President Donald Trump has pledged to ban street camping, relocate unhoused people to privately-managed “tent cities,” and arrest anyone caught violating the new laws.
But while Trump’s threats certainly sound draconian, they’re not exactly novel. In recent years, several states have organized increasingly harsh homeless sweeps — perhaps most typified by Louisiana, where the governor recently oversaw a possible model for the sort of mass relocation that Trump has promised.
Federal officials seem to be taking note. According to a local official who spoke to The Appeal, in early February, Homeland Security Director Kristi Noem quietly visited a warehouse where Gov. Jeff Landry had relocated nearly 200 homeless people, sometimes under threat of arrest. And in March, Trump appointed Madison Sheahan, a state official whose agency enforced Landry’s crackdown, to become deputy director for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) did not respond to a request for comment.
Sheahan, who is 28, was appointed secretary of the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries (LDWF) by Landry in 2023, though she had no background in conservation or ecology. She previously worked on Noem’s campaign for South Dakota governor and was executive director of the Republican Party there, where she worked on banning trans athletes from college sports. Otherwise, her qualifications are questionable: besides issuing rules for sawfish harvesting and letting military veterans hunt bears, Sheahan’s most relevant experience over the last year seems to be lending her officers to Landry to round up homeless residents.

 
Attorneys for the unhoused have now filed a class action suit against the state — including Sheahan’s LDWF — to block Landry’s crackdown. As the case unfolds in New Orleans’ civil district court, Louisiana’s situation could serve as a bellwether for how Trump 2.0 will address unsheltered homelessness—and even the detention of migrants.
Jesse Rabinowitz, communications director for the National Homelessness Law Center, called Sheahan’s promotion “really concerning.” He added that what’s happening in New Orleans is “a real-life example of what could happen on a larger scale.”
The sweeps by Louisiana state agencies are part of “how conservative electives can punish people living in more progressive parts of the state,” warned Rabinowitz. “They did it with migrants, and they’ve said they’re going to do it with homeless folks. And we have to believe them.”

Louisiana’s crackdown began during singer Taylor Swift’s October tour dates in New Orleans. In the days leading up to the concerts, Landry directed Louisiana State Police (LSP) and LDWF officers to “sweep” downtown encampments of hundreds of unhoused people, pushing them all into one designated area a few blocks away. The sweeps drew national attention.
City council members and Mayor LaToya Cantrell condemned Landry’s actions. One council member’s chief of staff later said in an affidavit that, when she visited the government-run encampment, “one gentleman asked me where he could get a tent,” because state officers had thrown his away.
As a result, she said, “he got bitten by rats the night before because he did not have a tent to go inside.”
Lawyers representing unhoused people swiftly sued. But the ensuing court battle took a worrying turn in January, when the Louisiana Supreme Court ruled that cities cannot abridge the state’s police power. LSP can now conduct sweeps without following city ordinances, meaning they don’t have to provide sufficient warning beforehand. That ruling could signal to other red states that courts will let them send state agencies into blue cities, such as Austin or Nashville, and ignore any municipal-level protections in place.
A week after that ruling, LSP and DWF officers again descended on downtown New Orleans’ encampments. This time, they sent more than 100 people to a warehouse seven miles away called the “Transition Center.” Attorneys for the unhoused demanded another restraining order, but courts denied the request.
“Governor Landry’s interest in moving the encampments was to provide warm shelter and a place for the unhoused to be secure from potential harm during the Super Bowl and Mardi Gras,” a judge wrote.


The Transition Center sat in a former packaging warehouse alongside New Orleans’ industrial canal. While the press was not allowed in, photos shared from within the Center show rows of cots separated by black cloths, and some couches facing a television, in a warehouse with no eye-level windows. Residents reportedly received three meals daily and could leave freely, though neither a bus stop nor sidewalk sits near the site. Access was restricted to those with authorization.
Several service organizations worked in the warehouse. After initial difficulties, some employees say the remaining residents were satisfied with conditions. A medical worker told The Appeal he appreciated seeing patients consistently, and “we were able to get people healthier than when they arrived.”
Now that those events have finished, the warehouse has closed.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
After the initial October sweeps, a judge ordered LSP and LDWF to “not destroy or dispose of the property of unhoused people without judicial process” and to provide notice of sweeps as set out in New Orleans’ municipal ordinances.
But the New Year’s Day truck attack that killed 14 people in New Orleans, including a sleeping unhoused person, seems to have changed the calculus. Within hours, Landry issued an executive ordergiving him emergency powers to “direct and compel the evacuation of all or part of the population, from any stricken or threatened area.” The following week, the Louisiana Supreme Court dissolved the preliminary injunction. One justice wrote that, in the wake of the Jan. 1 attack, the sweeps were “about public safety.”
Court affidavits show how the case has already emboldened police to criminalize people experiencing homelessness.
According to the lawsuit, 12 LDWF officers and “five or six” LSP troopers approached 32-year-old plaintiff Raymond Scott when the major sweeps began in January. Scott is unhoused and has already lost valuables during sweeps. Last summer, a city worker reached into his tent and took a treasured owl figurine Scott inherited from his great-grandmother, then disposed of it even as Scott “begged them not to take it,” according to a court affidavit he later filed.
“You have two choices,” a trooper said. “Come willingly, or we cuff you, detain you, and bring you to the Transition Center.”
Scott said he didn’t want to go.
“You know you can be arrested for being homeless now?” a trooper allegedly replied. Scott then said he wanted to call his lawyer.
Scott’s attorneys argue that the US Supreme Court’s 2024 ruling in Grants Pass v. Johnson does not permit Landry’s sweeps, since Grants Pass concerned whether arresting people for sleeping outside violates the 8th Amendment’s protections against cruel and unusual punishments. In this case, the attorneys allege Louisiana violated unhoused residents’ 4th and 14th Amendment rights.
Another resident, Michael Garner, asserts in the suit that seven or eight LSP troopers approached his camp and told him to pack up. When he asked if he could leave, a trooper said he was being detained.
“The troopers told me that I would not be free to leave until I was brought to the Transition Center,” Garner wrote. He says he packed everything he owned into a box and got on the bus. When he later tried to fetch his belongings — including his social security card, birth certificate, and a bicycle —“officials told me that they could not find the box.”
Last week, attorneys filed a motion to dismiss the suit voluntarily. The legal team declined to comment on that request, as the motion is pending.
Sheahan, who’s set to begin her role at ICE in the coming weeks, ran the LDWF when its officers conducted the sweeps. In a March 11 Fraternal Order of Police statement celebrating her promotion, Patrick Yoes, National President of the FOP, celebrated that she’d “established a Special Operations Group within the enforcement division” for events like the Super Bowl. According to a November Facebook post, state police officers trained LDWF’s new special-ops team. Sheahan also joined Landry and DHS Secretary Noem for a briefing on Super Bowl security measures when Noem visited in February.
LDWF agents typically enforce hunting, fishing, and boating regulations. An LDWF spokesperson did not answer questions about why the agency took part in homeless sweeps.

 
Advocates have decried the sweeps and “transition center” as both cruel and ineffective. But at the state level, officials have celebrated their success.
“We think this is absolutely going to be looked at as a success, because we were able to get people out of harm’s way just weeks after a terror attack in that same area,” a spokesperson for the Louisiana Governor’s Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness (GOHSEP) told The Appeal. The state closed the Transition Center on March 21.


The spokesperson said that, from a peak of 183 people, 108, or about 60 percent, received permanent housing by the time the center closed.
An additional 59 people left on their own, while 15 others moved into a different shelter downtown. The center’s final costs could exceed $17.5 million.
But some housing advocates say the sweeps undermined the city-level housing efforts that have been ongoing since 2023. Those programs have housed more than 822 people at a much lower cost per person. Critics also say the warehouse sweeps disrupted contact between unhoused people and their case workers and service providers. The National Homelessness Law Center’s Rabinowitz stressed that the only real fix is affordable housing.
“There’s consensus that housing solves homelessness, and throwing people in jail and forcing homeless people into camps is not the solution,” he said. “But the people that are put in charge don’t seem to be motivated by helping people. They seem to be motivated by this desire to police and punish people for struggling in a country where a lot of people are struggling to make ends meet.”

A philosopher with more than two decades in academic leadership roles is the next provost and vice president of academic affairs for Rhode Island College (RIC)
Manyul Im will leave his current position as provost and vice president at the University of Bridgeport in Connecticut for his new role starting July 1. He will be RIC’s first permanent provost in roughly three years.
Im will replace Sheila Flemming, who has served as RIC’s interim provost since September 2024. Flemming, who did not apply for the permanent position, came on board after the departure of Carolynn Masters, who served since 2022 as interim provost. Masters was appointed after the departure of Helen Tate, who was named provost in 2020. 
In higher education, provosts typically typically serve as chief academic officers and oversee the entirety of a school’s academic affairs, faculty, curriculum development and approval, and academic support for students.
The Council on Postsecondary Education, which oversees public higher ed in Rhode Island, approved Im’s appointment Wednesday night. RIC announced the appointment in an email to the campus community Thursday.
“I entered academia because of the opportunity it gave me as a first-generation college student to go beyond the dreams of professional, economic success that my immigrant parents had for me,” Im said in a statement. “I wanted to discover the foundations for a meaningful life and try to contribute something to the lives of others.” 
“I have sought out institutions of higher education where there were strong commitments to academic quality and mission-driven efforts to provide diversity and inclusivity support, professional curricular content, as well as an intellectual life of the mind in a global context,” Im continued.
Im has a bachelor’s degree in philosophy from the University of California, Berkeley. His master’s and doctorate degrees in philosophy come from the University of Michigan. Im’s research focus lies in the wide and storied range of Chinese philosophy, plus the ancient Greeks, the history of western philosophy and ethics. Since 2009, Im co-publishes a blog called Warp Weft and Way, which looks at Chinese philosophy in a comparative light. 
Im graduated from the Harvard Graduate School of Education’s professional development program in 2016, according to his LinkedIn.
Im has worked in different roles at Bridgeport since 2014, including dean of arts and sciences and associate provost. During his tenure, Im led academic efforts to bolster the schools’ health sciences, human services, and nursing offerings, and he helped launch a professional development initiative for faculty, the Universal Design for Learning. Additionally, he helped tailor a recruitment strategy for international students, and oversaw the creation of the Heckman Center for student support and career development. 
Prior to Bridgeport, Im worked in leadership and as faculty at Fairfield University, California State University, Los Angeles, and the University of Oklahoma. As a professor at these schools, Im taught a range of courses from intro-level philosophy to Confucianism, Daosim, and seminars on broader topics like ethics, free will and human destiny.

Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/17/ct-income-tax-hikes-on-rich/,"Boosting the two highest marginal rates on the CT income tax would affect couples earning more than $500,000 and singles over $250,000.","The state Senate’s leaders unveiled a new proposal Thursday to boost taxes on Connecticut’s high earners, seeking to raise hundreds of millions of dollars to mitigate anticipated deep cuts in federal aid to health care, education and other core programs here.
Senate President Pro Tem Martin M. Looney, D-New Haven, in a joint statement with Majority Leader Bob Duff, D-Norwalk, recommended boosting the two highest marginal rates on the state income tax, which would generate revenue from single filers earning more than $250,000 per year and couples topping $500,000. 
The state income tax has seven different rates, taxing various portions of household income between 2% to 6.99%. Most middle-class income is taxed between 4.5% and 6%.
Looney and Duff’s plan would boost the tax rate from:

6.9% to 7.5% for all earnings between $250,000 and $500,000 by single filers, and between $500,000 and $1 million by married couples.
6.99% to 7.99% for all earnings greater than $500,000 by single filers and above $1 million by married couples.

Though the state Senate Democratic leadership office hadn’t completed projections on the full revenue impact early Thursday afternoon, it estimated boosting the 6.99% rate to 7.99% would generate more than $420 million per year.
The Democratic leaders say these higher rates would be offered if the Republican-controlled Congress and President Donald J. Trump follow through on plans to extend 2017 federal income tax cuts set to expire after this year, a move that would chiefly benefit households making more than $320,000 annually. 
To pay for that tax relief, Congress is eyeing $880 billion in federal budget cuts, a move that likely would cost state and municipal government here more than $1 billion in federal aid for Medicaid, special education, food stamps, higher education research grants, and other programs.
“In. the wake of yet another federal tax cut that overwhelmingly benefits the wealthiest Americans, Connecticut cannot afford to fail to take action at a time of crisis,” Looney said. “If Washington insists on handing billionaires another tax break, we will ensure some of that windfall comes back to the people of Connecticut to help deal with the massive federal cuts we anticipate.”
Duff added “this is a proactive, conditional measure that protects core services, invests in education and infrastructure, and maintains a level playing field.”
Looney and Duff’s comments come a few days after dozens of progressives in the General Assembly appealed for state tax hikes on the wealthy to help offset likely deeper cuts in federal aid to Connecticut.
But despite those sentiments, it remained unclear Thursday whether Connecticut would break from a recent trend and consider any tax hikes aimed solely at high-earners.
Gov. Ned Lamont has consistently blocked any effort to raise taxes on the wealthy since he took office in 2019, backed by other fiscally moderate Democrats and minority Republicans in the state House and Senate.
And Lamont, who says boosting state taxes on the rich would prompt them to flee Connecticut, has said it’s premature to discuss raising levies on them now before the federal budget picture has been resolved.
This marks the fifth consecutive year that Looney has introduced bills to boost income tax rates on the capital gains earnings of rich households, and to create a so-called “mansion tax” — a statewide property levy on high-value homes. But legislative leaders have never included these proposals once in the final budget package negotiated with Lamont.
“Despite the unpredictability coming out of Washington, the [Lamont] administration is having ongoing discussions with legislative leadership about a path forward, after we see a final federal budget and know its impact on Connecticut,” Chris Collibee, the governor’s budget spokesman, said Thursday. “Especially in light of recent economic concerns, his preference is increasing the number of taxpayers in our state, rather than increasing taxes.”
Republicans in the General Assembly also are pressing Lamont to avoid raising state taxes. The first step toward responding to any cuts from Washington, they say, is to look for options to trim spending at the state level.
“Democrats worship at the altar of government spending,” said House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, who said neither Democratic legislators nor Lamont have responded seriously to recent instances of inefficiency or malfeasance.
Candelora noted that public colleges and universities here entered the fiscal year holding more than $1 billion in reserves, even as they appealed to legislators for more state funding. The Connecticut State Colleges and Universities system, which includes community colleges and regional state universities, held more than $610 million of those stockpiled funds.
The GOP leader also cited a recent report from the state auditors showing state officials mismanaged audits for Connecticut’s school construction program in recent years and failed to enforce price caps that are meant to hold down costs for local school building projects.
“Not only do they [Democrats] not care about the stockpiling and hoarding of money, they also don’t care about the criminal misuse of money,” Candelora added.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2020-01-07-at-6.25.58-PM.png,,,2025-04-17 15:10:45.240723

The Milford Museum will continue its American History Series on Saturday, May 10, with a deep dive into one of the region’s most important agricultural legacies: the canning industry.
The presentation, led by agricultural historian and former Delaware Secretary of Agriculture Ed Kee, will take place at 1:00 p.m. at the Milford Public Library.
For more than a century, the Delmarva Peninsula and Baltimore were at the heart of the nation’s canned food industry. From the 1840s through the 1940s, canneries dotted the landscape, transforming the area into a major hub of food processing.

By the end of the 19th century, Maryland boasted more than 387 canneries, while Delaware had 49—growing to 111 by 1919. At its peak, Delaware’s canning industry employed over 1,800 workers.
Locally, Milford was home to as many as eight canneries operating well into the 1960s.
Other towns like Frederica, Harrington, Bridgeville, Lincoln City, and Milton also played a role, with most canneries specializing in tomatoes. Nearly every town in Kent and Sussex Counties hosted a facility.
However, as competition from states like California increased, the industry began to decline.
Today, four vegetable processing firms still operate in the region—two in Delaware, one in New Jersey, and one in Maryland—processing crops like peas, lima beans, and sweet corn. Of the four, three are now freezing operations, and just one continues canning.
Ed Kee
Ed Kee brings a wealth of experience and scholarship to the discussion.
With a career that includes three decades at the University of Delaware Cooperative Extension and two terms as Delaware’s Secretary of Agriculture, Kee has authored more than 30 scholarly articles and five books on agricultural history.
He was instrumental in founding LEAD Delaware and helped create the Delaware Young Farmers Program, which offers 0% interest loans to beginning farmers.
The event is free and open to the public. It is part of a monthly series sponsored by the Milford Museum and funded by the Delaware Heritage Commission. Each program focuses on topics in local, state, or national history and is held on the second Saturday of the month at the Milford Public Library, located at 11 S.E.

In naming Driskell Thursday, Gov. Andy Beshear said she has “made a real impact on the commonwealth’s rich literary community through her poetry and passion for teaching.” 
Driskell, the author of multiple books of poetry, has been honored with  the Appalachian Review’s Denny C. Plattner Award in Creative Nonfiction. She has received grants from the Kentucky Arts Council and the Kentucky Foundation for Women among other honors. 
Her published books include “Goat-Footed Gods,” “Blue Etiquette: Poems,” “Next Door to the Dead” and “Seed Across Snow.” 
She also serves as the chair of Spalding University’s Naslund-Mann Graduate School of Writing in Louisville. Driskell will serve as the poet laureate from 2025-2026. 
A conversation with Silas House, Kentucky’s new poet laureate 

“All genres of art are important, but there’s something particularly humane about the work writers bring us,” Driskell said in the Capitol rotunda Thursday. 
“Language and creativity at the end are largely qualities that make us human. And so it’s not surprising that for so many of us, when we find our writing lives, we find our authentic lives,” she said. “We deepen our own ability to practice compassion, and we make lasting connections with our loved ones, our communities, and we carry our history forward.” 
House, who was appointed in 2023 and was the state’s first openly gay poet laureate, held writing workshops throughout the state and created an oral history project, among other initiatives during his tenure. 
“It has been such an honor to serve as poet laureate for the Commonwealth of Kentucky for the past two years,” House said. “In that time, this work has made my love for the state only deepen. I’ve had the opportunity to meet so many who are doing their best to be great neighbors and to make our world a better place.” 
House, who was a rural mail carrier in his native Eastern Kentucky, is author of many articles and novels, including “Clay’s Quilt,” “A Parchment of Leaves,” “Eli the Good” and “Lark Ascending.”
“My number one goal has always been to make more people aware how rich our literature is here in Kentucky, and to make writing instruction more accessible,” House said.  
Driskell will be inducted into House’s current role on April 24 in the rotunda. Both she and House will hold readings during that event. 
“We are fortunate to have her as a guiding voice,” Beshear said of Driskell, thanking her for “encouraging future writers and supporting Kentuckians in pursuing their dreams right here in their new Kentucky home.”

House Bil 432 directs the Revenue Law Study Committee to study options to enhance such programs and to consider other tax reforms to reduce property tax burdens for low-income elderly and disabled residents and disabled veterans.
  Rep. Brian Echevarria (Photo: NC General Assembly)
“This is a study bill and the reason we need this study bill is because other states have done things to protect their homeowners that I think we can follow,” said Rep. Brian Echevarria (R-Cabarrus), a bill cosponsor. “We have some states that have 100% property tax exclusions for veterans. They have better exclusions for the elderly and disabled.”
Big concerns, Echevarria said, are rising taxes and property tax revaluations, which are making it difficult for residents on fixed incomes to remain in their homes. Cabarrus County has been “decimated” by property revaluations and tax increases, he said.
“I’m sure that I’m not the only one who has received phone calls from the elderly, from the disabled, those on fixed incomes who simply don’t know how they’re going to keep up with increasing property taxes,” Echevarria said.
Several Democrats spoke in support of HB 432, including Rep. Abe Jones (D-Wake) who said he 100% backs the tax relief study.
“I’ve been worried about older people in my communities … [who] might eventually lose their homes because the property taxes are going up and up and up and their income is fixed,” Jones said. “I’m sure there’s nobody in here doesn’t know anybody like that.”
  Rep. Carla Cunningham (Photo: NC General Assembly)
Rep. Carla Cunningham (D-Mecklenburg) noted that several bills have been introduced to provide tax relief for veterans and elderly and disabled North Carolinians. More must be done to keep veterans in the state and to encourage those from the state to return home after separating from the military, she said.
“I do know that we want to move forward to assist the veterans in the State of North Carolina not to leave North Carolina but to come home to North Carolina after they have served and that we should be assisting in any way that we can for them to come back home,” Cunningham said.
She noted that in South Carolina, veterans who are totally or permanently disabled from wartime may receive a property tax exemption on their home.
Rep. Marcia Morey (D-Durham) said the bill is vastly improved compared to previous versions but reminded colleagues that property taxes pay for essential services such as public schools.
  Rep. Marcia Morey (Photo: NC General Assembly)
“They [property taxes] are not a regressive tax like a sales tax and I don’t want to see a study go into a shift of tax consequences that are more regressive on the poor that they are on the rich,” Morey said.
She asked if bill sponsors had sought input from the NC Association of County Commissioners and the NC League of Municipalities and whether the groups support the bill.
Echevarria said he hadn’t received input from either organization.
North Carolina currently offers three property tax relief programs for qualified homeowners that are administered by counties:

The Elderly/Disabled Homestead Exemption is for residents 65 years or older or those who are totally and permanently disabled. The program excludes from taxes the greater of $25,000 or 50% of the assessed value of the owner’s permanent residence.
The Circuit Breaker limits the amount of annual property taxes the owner pays on their permanent residence. Eligibility is limited to homeowners who are 65 and older or who are totally and permanently disabled. The tax bill is limited to a fixed percentage of income, and any taxes owed above that limit is deferred until a “disqualifying event” such as the owner’s death. This program requires a new application to be filed every year.
The Disabled Veteran Exclusion program excludes up to the first $45,000 of the appraised value of the permanent residence of a disabled veteran who has a total and permanent service-connected disability or who received benefits for specially adapted housing. There is no age or income limitation for this program.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/development-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-17 15:10:45.240723

(Photo from the CDC)Most Americans learned what an N95 mask was during the COVID-19 pandemic. But what many still don’t know is that every one of them was certified by a single, government-run lab in Bruceton, Pennsylvania. It’s called the National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory. The name N95 actually comes from their certification standards.
The lab, near Pittsburgh, is operated by the National Institute of Occupational Health and Safety and is the only facility in the country that is capable of offering the agency’s stamp of approval. The same lab certifies a host of other protective masks and respirators used by firefighters, doctors, painters, factory workers, coal miners, pharmaceutical manufacturers, welders, chemical plant employees, construction crews and others. Many American employers are statutorily required to provide them to workers.
An estimated 5 million Americans workers are required to use respirators at their place of employment.
But according to a dozen current and former NIOSH employees and union representatives who have worked at or with their personal protective equipment division, that lab has halted almost all of its regular work and is preparing to shut down in June.
That’s because of the most recent announcement of layoffs at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The agency, run by Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has announced plans to lay off 10,000 employees across its various divisions. Hundreds of those cuts are in NIOSH, the division that studies and recommends ways to prevent workplace health and safety hazards.
“It’s kind of the sabotage of guide rails that have been set up for industry to help keep workers safe,” said Jonathan Szalajda, a lab employee and former deputy director of the National Personal Protective Technology Lab. “It’s a situation where we’re leaving workers defenseless, and I think it’s certainly a step back from what we’ve done to protect workers over the last half century.”
Since the beginning of mass layoffs at federal agencies overseen by the Trump administration and Department of Government Efficiency, virtually every employee at the National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory has taken a buyout or early retirement offer, been put on administrative leave, or received a notice that their job is subject to what’s called a “reduction in force” and that their last day will come in June. 
It’s not clear if the impending layoffs will hit every remaining employee because, according to workers and union officials, leaders at the Department of Health and Human Services and the Centers for Disease Control have not been answering questions. Moreover, almost all of the lab’s supervisors have been placed on administrative leave, along with their HR contact.
The reduction in force notices are confusing as well. Some sent out to individual employees note that layoffs will happen in their division, and they may or may not be subject to them. But another sent to the union that oversees the bargaining unit employees at the National Personal Protective Technology Lab said all of their jobs would be eliminated. Virtually every lab employee that isn’t part of that union has already been placed on leave or told their position will be terminated in June.
Given the lack of communication, and the sweeping layoffs that have hit other parts of the federal government, including NIOSH itself, employees at the personal protective equipment division are expecting the worst.
Already, the lab’s workforce has shrunk from 120 to 70 this year, and the remaining employees are facing layoffs that the Department of Health and Human Services says will come in June.
A spokesperson for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention referred questions to the Department of Health and Human Services, which did not respond to multiple inquiries from the Capital-Star. NIOSH is a research agency within the CDC, which is a part of the Department of Health and Human Services.
“We have no idea what we’re supposed to do,” said one remaining lab employee who spoke under condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation. “We have no idea what to tell the manufacturers. This is so important, we just feel there’s no way this can be real.”
Szalajda said the lab has stopped accepting requests from manufacturers to certify new respirators. The remaining lab employees who weren’t laid off have shifted their focus to preparing for the lab to be shut down.
New research has also stopped because of time constraints and a freeze on federal employee credit cards that has made it impossible to buy necessary materials.
Instead, workers are finalizing research projects that are near completion, and preparing them for publication.
  ‘Someone will have to own the travesty’ 

Szalajda and others have said they expect the lab’s closure to result in the market being flooded with substandard masks.
Along with certifying new products, lab employees regularly inspect respirator manufacturing plants and test masks that have already been approved to ensure they’re still being manufactured to NIOSH standards. That work, however, has stopped, largely because of a freeze on approval of employee travel reimbursement. According to Szalajda, the lab has also stopped sending out contractors because they’re not certain they’ll ever be paid given the rapid changes.
Szalajda worries about “a Wild West scenario” where respirator manufacturers are free to cut corners in production, and no one will be there to catch them.
“The American public, if you’re buying a respirator or a mask to do home improvements or hobbies or anything, you’re going to be at the mercy of those companies to not become lax,” said Linda Chasko, a NIOSH employee who was speaking in her capacity as vice president of the federal employees union that includes the Allegheny County NIOSH campus employees.
The potential closure has also alarmed industry members, who have spent significant time and money ensuring their respirators meet NIOSH standards, and rely on the certification for new products.
The closure of the lab could also cede the respirator market to foreign companies whose products are tested according to their own government’s standards. NIOSH certification, however, had often been referred to as a “gold standard,” Szalajda said.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, for example, KN95 masks were often billed as an alternative to N95s, which were at times difficult to find. The primary difference is that KN95s were certified in China. However, issues were found with a number of certified KN95s, which led to numerous recalls.
There is also a fear that counterfeit masks will spread. Part of the Personal Protective Technology Lab’s mission was to find and study respirators with fake NIOSH-approval stamps, and work with distributors to stop their spread.
One of the last research projects that lab employees are working to finalize is a comprehensive study on the efficacy of counterfeit masks. They found that virtually all of them failed to consistently meet NIOSH standards for filtering air particulates. Between an HHS communications freeze and uncertainty that the report can be finalized before the lab closes, it’s unclear if the report will ever be released to the public.
“We’re expecting there could potentially be an influx of counterfeit equipment,” said Chasko. “What’s at stake is the respiratory health and overall health of all the workers in industries that use equipment reliant on NIOSH standards.”
The lab’s closure could also cause problems for certain industries, like coal, where companies are statutorily required to provide NIOSH-certified respirators for miners. It’s unclear what will happen if NIOSH is no longer able to provide that certification.
For example, every underground coal mine is required by law to provide specialized respirators called closed-circuit escape respirators. They’re for the worst case scenario: Escaping a deadly and low-oxygen environment where something has likely gone very wrong.
Those respirators are not just approved by NIOSH, but regularly audited by the lab to ensure they still work after being stored in harsh underground conditions with heavy dust exposure. The same masks are also required in certain Navy ships.
“We have found failures,” one employee said about their regular audits.
Personal protective equipment researchers in Morgantown, West Virginia, the other NIOSH office where research on respirators and protective gear is done, were also hit with layoffs.
One Morgantown NIOSH employee who worked with the personal protective equipment team on firefighter safety recommendations was notified on April 1 that they would immediately be placed on administrative leave. That will end with their termination on June 1.
Still, they’re hoping the decision will be reversed, and requested anonymity for fear of being targeted in the event that some employees are brought back.
“We were told it was just going to be a consolidation … that the scientists would not be let go,” the employee said about the layoffs, which have affected almost everyone at the Morgantown NIOSH campus. “But the scientists went in the first round.”
Cathy Tinney-Zara, president of the federal employee union that represents the Morgantown NIOSH employees, said almost all work at the division has stopped, with almost everyone put on administrative leave ahead of terminations in June.
“You wouldn’t believe how confusing it’s been,” Tinney-Zara said. She said leaders at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services have not been communicating with union officials. She can’t even provide an exact number of workers who have been told they’re being laid off.
Mostly, she gets updates through the news like everyone else. Most recently, U.S. Rep. Riley Moore, a West Virginia Republican, said some of the layoffs at the Morgantown facility, which does extensive work on coal miner safety, were made in error. But Tinney-Zara hasn’t been able to confirm that or find out where he got that information.
“It’s a real tragedy,” Szalajda said about the lab’s closure and cuts at NIOSH. “For people who work in this business, it’s not just the paycheck. It’s a lifestyle. People who have been involved within our division, they work there because of a mission, the attractiveness of doing something that makes a difference in people’s lives.”
But Szalajda is hopeful that HHS may still reverse course. He and other employees are waging something of a pressure campaign by reaching out to lawmakers, industry partners and media.
Moreover, he believes that even if the lab, or most of NIOSH, is shut down now, one day it will be replaced. But it may be a hard learning curve for whoever’s brought in to get it running. He expects many of the most experienced people on staff now, would not return.
“It’s just kind of a recipe for disaster,” Szalajda said. “It may not be something that happens right away, but there will be some sort of incident that will show the void of what’s been left from stepping away, and someone will have to own the travesty that comes after that.”

Mike Dunleavy discusses his new proposed omnibus education legislation at a news conference on Jan. 31, 2025. (Photo by Corinne Smith/Alaska Beacon)For the second year running, Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy vetoed an education funding bill on Thursday, citing a lack of policy changes he supported.
House Bill 69 would have increased the base student allocation — the core of the state’s per-student funding — by $1,000 in the funding formula. The BSA has not been substantially increased for more than a decade, and public school advocates testified that inflation-driven cost increases have resulted in cuts to programs, school closures, and larger class sizes. 
The governor’s veto is subject to a vote of the Alaska Legislature. Under the Alaska Constitution, a vote to confirm or override the vote must be held “immediately,” but multiple lawmakers have said that the bill lacks enough support for a veto override. Votes from 40 of 60 state legislators, meeting in joint session, are needed for an override. 
Last year, the education funding bill included a $680 per-student increase. That bill had broad bipartisan support, with only three Republican legislators voting against it. But after Dunleavy vetoed it, 20 Republicans voted to uphold the veto. This year, all 25 members of the two Republican minority caucuses voted against the bill, as did the three co-chairs of the Senate Finance Committee.

Abou[...]","Carlos Duarte/Getty ImagesThe National Institutes of Health’s sweeping cuts of grants that fund scientific research are inflicting pain almost universally across the U.S., including in most states that backed President Donald Trump in the 2024 election.
A KFF Health News analysis underscores that the terminations are sparing no part of the country, politically or geographically. About 40% of organizations whose grants the NIH cut in its first month of slashing, which started Feb. 28, are in states Trump won in November.
The Trump administration has singled out Ivy League universities including Columbia and Harvard for broad federal funding cuts. But the spending reductions at the NIH, the nation’s foremost source of funding for biomedical research, go much further: Of about 220 organizations that had grants terminated, at least 94 were public universities, including flagship state schools in places such as Florida, Georgia, Ohio, Nebraska, and Texas.
The Trump administration has canceled hundreds of grants supporting research on topics such as vaccination; diversity, equity, and inclusion; and the health of LGBTQ+ populations. Some of the terminations are a result of Trump’s executive orders to abandon federal work on diversity and equity issues. Others followed the Senate confirmation of anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the NIH. Many mirror the ambitions laid out in Project 2025’s “Mandate for Leadership,” the conservative playbook for Trump’s second term.
Affected researchers say Trump administration officials are taking a cudgel to efforts to improve the lives of people who often experience worse health outcomes — ignoring a scientific reality that diseases and other conditions do not affect all Americans equally.
KFF Health News found that the NIH terminated about 780 grants or parts of grants between Feb. 28 and March 28, based on documents published by the Department of Health and Human Services and a list maintained by academic researchers. Some grants were canceled in full, while in other cases, only supplements — extra funding related to the main grant, usually for a shorter-term, related project — were terminated.
Among U.S. recipients, 96 of the institutions that lost grants in the first month are in politically conservative states including Florida, Ohio, and Indiana, where Republicans control the state government or voters reliably support the GOP in presidential campaigns, or in purple states such as North Carolina, Michigan, and Pennsylvania that were presidential battleground states. An additional 124 institutions are in blue states.
Sybil Hosek, a research professor at the University of Illinois-Chicago, helps run a network that focuses on improving care for people 13 to 24 years old who are living with or at risk for HIV. The NIH awarded Florida State University $73 million to lead the HIV project.
“We never thought they would destroy an entire network dedicated to young Americans,” said Hosek, one of the principal investigators of the Adolescent Medicine Trials Network for HIV/AIDS Interventions. The termination “doesn’t make sense to us.”
NIH official Michelle Bulls is director of the Office of Policy for Extramural Research Administration, which oversees grants policy and compliance across NIH institutes. In terminating the grant March 21, Bulls wrote that research “based primarily on artificial and nonscientific categories, including amorphous equity objectives, are antithetical to the scientific inquiry, do nothing to expand our knowledge of living systems, provide low returns on investment, and ultimately do not enhance health, lengthen life, or reduce illness.”
Adolescents and young adults ages 13 to 24 accounted for 1 in 5 new HIV infections in the U.S. in 2022, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
“It’s science in its highest form,” said Lisa Hightow-Weidman, a professor at Florida State University who co-leads the network. “I don’t think we can make America healthy again if we leave youth behind.”
HHS spokesperson Emily Hilliard said in an emailed statement that “NIH is taking action to terminate research funding that is not aligned with NIH and HHS priorities.” The NIH and the White House didn’t respond to requests for comment.
“As we begin to Make America Healthy Again, it’s important to prioritize research that directly affects the health of Americans. We will leave no stone unturned in identifying the root causes of the chronic disease epidemic as part of our mission to Make America Healthy Again,” Hilliard said.
Harm to HIV, Vaccine Studies
The NIH, with its nearly $48 billion annual budget, is the largest public funder of biomedical research in the world, awarding nearly 59,000 grants in the 2023 fiscal year. The Trump administration has upended funding for projects that were already underway, stymied money for new applications, and sought to reduce how much recipients can spend on overhead expenses.
Those changes — plus the firing of 1,200 agency employees as part of mass layoffs across the government — are alarming scientists and NIH workers, who warn that they will undermine progress in combating diseases and other threats to the nation’s public health. On April 2, the American Public Health Association, Ibis Reproductive Health, and affected researchers, among others, filed a lawsuit in federal court against the NIH and HHS to halt the grant cancellations.
Two National Cancer Institute employees, who were granted anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press and feared retaliation, said its staff receives batches of grants to terminate almost daily. On Feb. 27, the cancer institute had more than 10,800 active projects, the highest share of the NIH’s roughly two dozen institutes and centers, according to the NIH’s website. At least 47 grants that NCI awarded were terminated in the first month.
Kennedy has said the NIH should take a years-long pause from funding infectious disease research. In November 2023, he told an anti-vaccine group, “I’m gonna say to NIH scientists, ‘God bless you all. Thank you for public service. We’re going to give infectious disease a break for about eight years,’” according to NBC News.
For years, Kennedy has peddled falsehoods about vaccines — including that “no vaccine” is “safe and effective,” and that “there are other studies out there” showing a connection between vaccines and autism, a link that has repeatedly been debunked — and claimed falsely that HIV is not the only cause of AIDS.
KFF Health News found that grants in blue states were disproportionately affected, making up roughly two-thirds of terminated grants, many of them at Columbia University. The university had more grants terminated than all organizations in politically red states combined. On April 4, Democratic attorneys general in 16 states sued HHS and the NIH to block the agency from canceling funds.
Researchers whose funding was stripped said they stopped clinical trials and other work on improving care for people with HIV, reducing vaping and smoking rates among LGBTQ+ teens and young adults, and increasing vaccination rates for young children. NIH grants routinely span several years.
For example, Hosek said that when the youth HIV/AIDS network’s funding was terminated, she and her colleagues were preparing to launch a clinical trial examining whether a particular antibiotic that is effective for men to prevent sexually transmitted infections would also work for women.
“This is a critically important health initiative focused on young women in the United States,” she said. “Without that study, women don’t have access to something that men have.”
Other scientists said they were testing how to improve health outcomes among newborns in rural areas with genetic abnormalities, or researching how to improve flu vaccination rates among Black children, who are more likely to be hospitalized and die from the virus than non-Hispanic white children.
“It’s important for people to know that — if, you know, they are wondering if this is just a waste of time and money. No, no. It was a beautiful and rare thing that we did,” said Joshua Williams, a pediatric primary care doctor at Denver Health in Colorado who was researching whether sharing stories about harm experienced due to vaccine-preventable diseases — from missed birthdays to hospitalizations and job loss — might inspire caregivers to get their children vaccinated against the flu.
He and his colleagues had recruited 200 families, assembled a community advisory board to understand which vaccinations were top priorities, created short videos with people who had experienced vaccine-preventable illness, and texted those videos to half of the caregivers participating in the study.
They were just about to crack open the medical records and see if it had worked: Were the group who received the videos more likely to follow through on vaccinations for their children? That’s when he got the notice from the NIH.
“It is the policy of NIH not to prioritize research activities that focuses gaining scientific knowledge on why individuals are hesitant to be vaccinated and/or explore ways to improve vaccine interest and commitment,” the notice read.
Williams said the work was already having an impact as other institutions were using the idea to start projects related to cancer and dialysis.
A Hit to Rural Health
Congress previously tried to ensure that NIH grants also went to states that historically have had less success obtaining biomedical research funding from the government. Now those places aren’t immune to the NIH’s terminations.
Sophia Newcomer, an associate professor of public health at the University of Montana, said she had 18 months of work left on a study examining undervaccination among infants, which means they were late in receiving recommended childhood vaccines or didn’t receive the vaccines at all. Newcomer had been analyzing 10 years of CDC data about children’s vaccinations and had already found that most U.S. infants from 0 to 19 months old were not adequately vaccinated.
Her grant was terminated March 10, with the NIH letter stating the project “no longer effectuates agency priorities,” a phrase replicated in other termination letters KFF Health News has reviewed.
“States like Montana don’t get a lot of funding for health research, and health researchers in rural areas of the country are working on solutions to improve rural health care,” Newcomer said. “And so cuts like this really have an impact on the work we’re able to do.”
Montana is one of 23 states, along with Puerto Rico, that are eligible for the NIH’s Institutional Development Award program, meant to bolster NIH funding in states that historically have received less investment. Congress established the program in 1993.
The NIH’s grant terminations hit institutions in 15 of those states, more than half that qualify, plus Puerto Rico.
Researchers Can’t ‘Just Do It Again Later’
The NIH’s research funds are deeply entrenched in the U.S. health care system and academia. Rarely does an awarded grant stay within the four walls of a university that received it. One grant’s money is divvied up among other universities, hospitals, community nonprofits, and other government agencies, researchers said.
Erin Kahle, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the University of Michigan, said she was working with Emory University in Georgia and the CDC as part of her study. She was researching the impact of intimate partner violence on HIV treatment among men living with the virus. “They are relying on our funds, too,” she said.
Kahle said her top priority was to ethically and safely wind down her nationwide study, which included 418 people, half of whom were still participating when her grant was terminated in late March. Kahle said that includes providing resources to participants for whom sharing experiences of intimate partner violence may cause trauma or mental health distress.
Rachel Hess, the co-director of the Clinical & Translational Science Institute at the University of Utah, said the University of Nevada-Reno and Intermountain Health, one of the largest hospital systems in the West, had received funds from a $38 million grant that was awarded to the University of Utah and was terminated March 12.
The institute, which aims to make scientific research more efficient to speed up the availability of treatments for patients, supported over 5,000 projects last year, including 550 clinical trials with 7,000 participants. Hess said that, for example, the institute was helping design a multisite study involving people who have had heart attacks to figure out the ideal mix of medications “to keep them alive” before they get to the hospital, a challenge that’s more acute in rural communities.
After pushback from the university — the institute’s projects included work to reduce health care disparities between rural and urban areas — the NIH restored its grant March 29.
Among the people the Utah center thanked in its announcement about the reversal were the state’s congressional delegation, which consists entirely of Republican lawmakers. “We are grateful to University of Utah leadership, the University of Utah Board of Trustees, our legislative delegation, and the Utah community for their support,” it said.
Hilliard, of HHS, said that “some grants have been reinstated following the appeals process, and the agency will continue to carry out the remaining appeals as planned to determine their alignment.” She declined to say how many had been reinstated, or why the University of Utah grant was among them.
Other researchers haven’t had the same luck. Kahle, in Michigan, said projects like hers can take a dozen years from start to finish — applying for and receiving NIH funds, conducting the research, and completing follow-up work.
“Even if there are changes in the next administration, we’re looking at at least a decade of setting back the research,” Kahle said. “It’s not as easy as like, ‘OK, we’ll just do it again later.’ It doesn’t really work that way.”
 Methodology

KFF Health News analyzed National Institutes of Health grant data to determine the states and organizations most affected by the Trump administration’s cuts.
We tallied the number of terminated NIH grants using two sources: a Department of Health and Human Services list of terminated grants published April 4; and a crowdsourced list maintained by Noam Ross of rOpenSci and Scott Delaney of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, as of April 8. We focused on the first month of terminations: from Feb. 28 to March 28. We found that 780 awards were terminated in total, with 770 of them going to recipients based in U.S. states and two to recipients in Puerto Rico.
The analysis does not account for potential grant reinstatements, which we know happened in at least one instance.
Additional information on the recipients, such as location and business type, came from the USAspending.gov Award Data Archive.
There were 222 U.S. recipients in total. At least 94 of them were public higher education institutions. Forty-one percent of organizations that had NIH grants cut in the first month were in states that President Donald Trump won in the 2024 election.
Some recipients, including the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and Vanderbilt University Medical Center, are medical facilities associated with higher education institutions. We classified these as hospitals/medical centers.
We also wanted to see whether the grant cuts affected states across the political spectrum. We generally classified states as blue if Democrats control the state government or Democratic candidates won them in the last three presidential elections, and red if they followed this pattern but for Republicans. Purple states are generally presidential battleground states or those where voters regularly split their support between the two parties: Arizona, Michigan, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Wisconsin. The result was 25 red states, 17 blue states, and eight purple states. The District of Columbia was also blue.
We found that, of affected U.S. institutions, 96 were in red or purple states and 124 were in blue states.

(Courtesy photo)The state’s biggest electrical utility said it shut off power to about 2,300 customers in Las Vegas Thursday in a pre-emptive move to prevent wildfires. 
PNM says it initiated the “public safety power shutoff” at 11:30 a.m. in the Northern New Mexico town. The outage could last up to 48 hours depending on conditions, officials said.
The area is experiencing extreme fire conditions, thanks to prolonged drought, large buildup of fuel, high temperatures, low humidity and increased winds, according to PNM. A National Weather Service high wind warning says gusts could reach 65 mph. 
“The decision to shut off power will be made only as a last resort to protect lives and property from the threat of wildfire,” PNM officials said in a news release earlier Thursday.
All of New Mexico is under either a high wind or Red Flag warning imposed by the National Weather Service, which indicates high wildfire risk. The high wind warning is in effect through most of northwestern New Mexico, including Las Vegas, and the Red Flag warning is in effect everywhere else. 
PNM has warned repeatedly this year that it could impose  pre-emptive power shutoffs, including in East Mountains of Albuquerque, Las Vegas and elsewhere, though it had not yet done so until Thursday. 
The utility has never done a pre-emptive shutoff before, officials said at a recent news conference, but said it is increasingly necessary due to extreme wildfire conditions.
The utility has also been sued for wildfires in recent years, including the McBride Fire in Ruidoso. A law firm accused it of negligence for allowing a tree to be blown onto a powerline it controls, but the utility has denied any liability.

Jill Carter, a Republican from Granby, sits at her desk on the Senate floor. Carter has filed a bill for three consecutive years on school accreditation and accountability (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).The Missouri Senate sent a bill to the House Thursday that would overhaul the state’s accreditation and accountability system in order to give local school districts more control.
State Sen. Jill Carter, a Republican from Granby, has filed the bill for three consecutive years and garnered approval for public-school advocates in committee. But each year it has been passed over for other priorities when it reached the full Senate.
Skepticism from state Sen. Curtis Trent, a Republican from Springfield, slowed the bill’s passage this year and inspired a lengthy debate about accountability earlier this month. 
But Monday, he applauded Carter for “helping work through the concerns that I had.”
Carter tweaked the legislation Monday to clarify sections and add an expiration date to a provision limiting the State Board of Education’s authority to classify districts.
It was approved by the Senate Thursday on a 32 to one vote, with Republican state Sen. Mary Elizabeth Coleman as the only opponent. 
If the bill passes the House, school districts will be able to seek accreditation from national accreditation agencies in addition to the State Board of Education. The board can classify districts without outside accreditation as provisionally accredited or unaccredited only for the purpose of determining whether a charter school can open within a district’s boundaries. State law allows charters to open the area of unaccredited districts and those that have been provisionally accredited for at least three years.
Carter’s legislation also requires schools to post performance data on their websites. Previous versions of the bill specified the data would be sent to “media outlets serving the district.”
It also changes a requirement for “interim assessments” at the beginning and end of the school year to “local assessments” without specified times.
Carter believes the legislation would give school boards and parents more power over curriculum and personalize learning to a district’s needs.
“I think this is a first step in trying to mitigate a lot of the concerns that we’ve had and educators have had in our public schools,” she said Monday.
There is just under a month remaining in the current legislative session. If Carter’s bill doesn’t pass the House in coming weeks, she will have to start over in the process next year.

(Photo by Kathie Obradovich/Iowa Capital Dispatch)The Iowa Senate has sent a bill to Gov. Kim Reynolds’s desk that would bar penalization from accreditors to universities for following state law, despite concerns from some lawmakers that it would not prevent universities from potentially losing accreditation.
House File 295 would bar higher education accrediting bodies from taking negative action against state universities that follow or refuse to be noncompliant with state law, like legislation passed in the state prohibiting universities from funding or maintaining diversity, equity and inclusion offices.
The bill also removes mention of the Higher Learning Commission and replaces it with “any federally recognized accreditor of postsecondary educational institutions,” a move Sen. Cindy Winckler, D-Davenport, said could lead to universities choosing lower-quality accreditors and “call into question” students’ degrees.
“I think that we are heading down a path that is creating political cover for laws that are being passed that conflict with gold standards of higher education,” Winckler said.

Sens. Janice Weiner of Iowa City and Herman Quirmbach of Ames agreed with Winckler, saying if Iowa universities stop using the “gold standard” Higher Learning Commission, students may choose to take their tuition dollars somewhere else and education in Iowa could deteriorate as a result.
Weiner reiterated that legislation to create a center for intellectual freedom at the University of Iowa could endanger the university’s accreditation, and said the introduction of House File 295 told her “the majority party knowingly is putting the university’s accreditation at risk.”
“We could be voting, and we could be focusing on helping UIHC find a cure for the cancer plague in this state. Instead, we’re dealing with a bill that knowingly risks the school’s accreditation,” Weiner said. “It’s like we’ve stepped through the looking glass.”
Sen. Kerry Gruenhagen, R-Walcott, said there was “a little bit of exaggeration” in the comments from his colleagues about the dangers of Iowa universities losing accreditation or using lower-quality accreditors. He doesn’t expect any problems to arise with current or proposed legislation, including the bill to establish the UI intellectual freedom center.
The bill passed with a 32-15 vote.
“You know, these past couple weeks, we have heard a lot of concern about intellectual freedom, diversity, allowing both sides to speak,” Gruenhagen said. “Instituting this in a college should have been an easy ‘yes’ vote for both sides of this chamber, according to floor arguments that I’ve been hearing. Unfortunately, we did not hear those. We did not receive a yes. Here’s another chance to say ‘yes’ to provide opportunities.”

(Photo by Parker Michels-Boyce for the Virginia Mercury)The Virginia Department of Health (VDH) on Wednesday issued a blistering final report on the January water crisis that left Richmond residents and businesses without clean drinking water for days — and delivered a second formal notice of violation against the city, demanding a full corrective action plan.
The 314-page VDH report, based on a 60-day independent investigation by the engineering firm Short Elliott Hendrickson (SEH), found a long chain of preventable failures at the city’s 100-year-old Water Treatment Plant. 
These included neglected maintenance, faulty backup systems, poor emergency planning, and risky decisions that left the plant vulnerable during a winter storm. A single power outage on the morning of Jan. 6 led to catastrophic flooding of underground equipment rooms, halting water production and triggering a system-wide drop in pressure that forced boil water advisories across the city and surrounding counties for nearly a week.
“This crisis could have been prevented with better operational decisions,” said State Health Commissioner Dr. Karen Shelton, who described the findings in stark terms. “Our goal now is to ensure corrective actions are taken swiftly and effectively, so Richmond-area families can trust their water supply.”
The report revealed that city officials were operating the plant in “winter mode,” relying solely on overhead power lines despite known flood risks and vulnerabilities. When those lines failed, the backup systems didn’t work — largely because of neglected maintenance. Critical batteries weren’t tested. Key valves didn’t shut, and manual procedures meant to kick in during emergencies proved ineffective.
In her letter to Gov. Glenn Youngkin and Richmond Mayor Danny Avula, Shelton didn’t mince words. As reported by The Richmonder this week, she contrasted VDH’s investigation with the city’s own internal review, asserting that “the water crisis was completely avoidable and should not have happened.”
Youngkin echoed that sentiment in a statement Wednesday, calling the disruption of a safe and reliable water supply “unacceptable.” He said, “It should never happen again, and I’ve directed the Department of Health to ensure Richmond takes all corrective actions necessary to achieve that objective.” 
The governor praised Richmond-area residents for their resilience, saying they “persevered through this preventable crisis,” and now city leaders must “step up for their citizens.”
The report outlines a cascade of failures triggered by a relatively minor snow and ice event. 
Around 5:45 a.m. on Jan. 6, the Water Treatment Plant lost power. A bus tie switch designed to transfer power from a backup source failed, and for over an hour, the facility operated in the dark. Water continued to flow through the plant by gravity — into a subsurface clearwell — but without power, key valves stayed open. 
Water inundated the underground equipment rooms, flooding critical pumps and electrical systems. Backup batteries, which were supposed to shut valves and prevent flooding, had not been maintained and failed.
By the time the city issued a Boil Water Advisory that afternoon, it was already too late. Pressure had dropped below safe levels, and the city struggled for days to restore full water service. Water production was partially restored on Jan. 8, and fully restored the next day. The boil order wasn’t lifted until Jan. 11.
The VDH and SEH review paints a broader picture of systemic dysfunction at the Department of Public Utilities (DPU). Investigators described a “culture of complacency,” where staff had normalized working around broken or substandard systems instead of fixing them. Manual operation was routine. Training was limited. And serious risks — like flooding from the clearwell — were well known but never resolved.
Despite this, officials say there are signs of progress. 
Mayor Danny Avula said he was “incredibly proud” of the work DPU Director Scott Morris and his team have done since the crisis, noting that much of the VDH’s report aligns with an independent investigation the city commissioned from the firm HNTB. 
“We’ll of course review it and think through the best ways to integrate its recommendations into our work moving forward,” Avula said in a statement.
The city has already spent $5 million on emergency repairs and is proposing more than $60 million in upgrades as part of its five-year capital improvement plan. The plan includes electrical upgrades, automation improvements, and a redesigned overflow system for the clearwell to prevent future flooding. 
Still, the city will now be required to implement a formal Corrective Action Plan under the second notice of violation issued by VDH this week.
Janet Kelly, Virginia’s Secretary of Health and Human Resources, said the water crisis exposed both long-standing infrastructure problems and serious day-of operational failures. 
“An entire region including businesses, restaurants, schools, and the most vulnerable citizens in Richmond lost a basic human need,” she said. “We hope that the city of Richmond continues to address both the long-term and immediate components of this crisis.”
The SEH report also includes a sweeping “needs assessment” of Richmond’s water infrastructure, identifying over $63 million in additional improvements needed across the treatment plant and distribution system. These include relocating vulnerable electrical equipment, installing automated transfer switches, and updating decades-old design elements that are still allowed under legacy exemptions to state water regulations.
In all, the SEH team spent nearly 1,500 hours combing through records, touring facilities, interviewing staff, and analyzing system data. They concluded that while DPU staff showed commitment and technical know-how, the broader system failed to prioritize its most important goal: delivering safe, reliable water to the people of Richmond.
To help local businesses and nonprofits recover from the storm’s economic toll, Youngkin also announced Wednesday that the U.S. Small Business Administration has made Economic Injury Disaster Loans available. These loans aim to help organizations hurt by January’s power and water outages to cover ongoing operational costs.
Looking ahead, the state says it will work closely with city officials to ensure every recommendation is taken seriously. 
“We can’t afford another crisis like this,” said Shelton. “And we won’t accept another excuse.”

(Photo by Aristide Economopoulos / NJ Monitor)The New Mexico Court of Appeals this week rejected a challenge to state law prohibiting people convicted of felonies in the past decade from possessing firearms.
A jury convicted Jeremy Romero, of Las Vegas, of unlawfully possessing a firearm and evading Albuquerque police in August 2022, and a judge sentenced him to eight years in prison.
A few days later, he challenged the felon-in-posession statute’s constitutionality, arguing that it violates his Second Amendment right to possess a gun.
In a unanimous opinion published on Wednesday, a three-judge panel at the New Mexico Court of Appeals ruled that the law stands because there’s a long history of Congress and state legislatures disarming people who are a danger to others, so the law itself is constitutional.
In court briefings and at oral arguments in February, Romero’s attorney argued that his prior convictions were for nonviolent offenses, so it was unconstitutional to apply the felon-in-possession statute against him.
Mary Barket, Romero’s public defender, also argued that the country’s historical prohibitions on gun possession weren’t similar enough to New Mexico’s law because they targeted groups during times of war and conflict “that posed an existential threat to the ruling government.”
“I do not think that that is similar to why we’re trying to justify disarming felons, both violent and nonviolent,” Barket told the judges.
The judges weren’t convinced, and ruled that Romero did not challenge the trial court’s findings that he is dangerous based on his criminal history of possessing and selling drugs and escape from house arrest, so the law is also constitutional as it was applied to him.
While the ruling does not create any new rule about what’s needed to prove that someone is dangerous, it does require that for the government to constitutionally apply the felon-in-possession statute to someone, prosecutors “must demonstrate that the defendant presents a threat to others,” the judges wrote.
Romero based his challenge on the legal standard established by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2022 for analyzing the constitutionality of firearms regulations, in a case called Bruen.
Nonprofit news organization The Trace reviewed more than 2,000 court cases that cited Bruen and found that people whose felony records bar them from possessing guns used the decision more often than any other group.

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)New Jersey Attorney General Matt Platkin sued the messaging app Discord Thursday under the state Consumer Fraud Act, saying the tech giant has failed to protect underage users from sexual predators, harassment, and violent content.
Platkin, who also has sued TikTok and Meta, alleges Discord misleads parents and users about the efficacy of its “porous security features that Discord knows do not work as promised.” The decade-old platform, which caters to teens and gamers, has 200 million users.
“Too often, parents feel helpless as rich and powerful corporations find new ways to put harmful content literally directly into our kids’ hands, callously placing their own profits ahead of the safety and well-being of our children,” Platkin said at a news conference in Newark. 
Platkin pointed to violent incidents involving white supremacists who used the platform to plan or publicize their crimes, including a deadly 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, and a 2022 mass shooting at a Buffalo, New York, supermarket that left 10 dead.
Platkin said his office launched its investigation after the Buffalo massacre and found that Discord, even as it publicly promotes its safety measures, fails to enforce them, making it “alarmingly easy for predators and other malicious actors to target children on the app.”
“There’s very little to prevent kids from connecting with and receiving messages from complete strangers on their platform. This includes strangers who are adults pretending to be kids, something that should be a red flag for every parent,” Platkin said.
Discord prohibits children under 13 on its platform, he added, “but it barely enforces its own rule.”
“All a child has to do to access the app is just say they’re 13. Discord will take any 8-year-old’s word for it,” he said.
He added: “There are very few roadblocks between a child under the age of 10 accessing Discord and being groomed in a private chat or coerced to engage in self-harm. It’s horrifying, sickening, and it’s especially horrifying and sickening given that Discord users in New Jersey exchange billions of direct messages on the app every year.”

Officials from Discord, which is based in San Francisco, did not respond to a request for comment.

A proposal that would prohibit local governments from suspending the sale of guns and ammunition during a declared state of emergency was approved in the Florida House on Wednesday.
The measure (HB 6025) sponsored by Brevard County Republicans Monique Miller and Debbie Mayfield, repeals current state law that prohibits the sale of firearms and ammunition during a local state of emergency. The bill would also repeal the prohibition banning anyone intentionally possessing a firearm in a public place during a local emergency.
South Florida Democratic Rep. Mike Gottlieb said that he had voted for the bill in an earlier committee meeting, but that upon reading the actual state statute that it would repeal (section 870.044) was now opposing it.
“What we’re saying is that if there’s a riot or public disturbance we’re just going to let everybody sort of willy-nilly, without the controls that we have in place, get their firearms, and that’s adding fuel to that riot,” he said. “That’s adding fuel to that fire.”
Gottlieb added that he believed it had “wide-ranging implications that could endanger us in society.”
But Republicans said it was more than an appropriate change.
“When our communities are ripped by unrest or emergency, when the lights go out and the sirens grow louder and the sense of order is fading, that is precisely the moment when Floridians deserve the freedom to defend themselves, their children, their homes and their livelihoods,” said Seminole County Republican Rachel Plakon.
“When I came up here I promised my constituents that one of the most important things that I would do is I would fine laws that violate their constitutional rights, and I would get rid of them,” said Miller. “This is one of the most egregious that I found.”
The measure passed 86-28, mostly along party lines.

(Photo via Getty Images)A University of Iowa student who feels his online security and that of all UI students who use Zoom to access classes has been compromised has brought a lawsuit against the university, alleging negligence and seeking relief and an order for the university to secure its online instruction.
Marc Muklewicz, a 46-year-old criminology student close to finishing his degree, said an unauthorized video taken of him in an online class and posted online led to his learning that anyone with the link to a Zoom course at UI could access it without needing to log in with university credentials or any other form of verification.
The UI has refused to remedy the situation and ensure his and other students’ data is private, Muklewicz said, and he is currently refusing to attend classes until he knows that when he logs into a course, he is safe in doing so.
“I can’t share anything academically, honestly, freely, in any sense of the word, if I can’t assure that my information is being private,” Muklewicz said.

Muklewicz first learned of the video taken of him smoking an e-cigarette during an online course through his wife, who started receiving messages from friends and acquaintances about a post made by an affiliate of Barstool on Instagram featuring the video.
How the video was cut, leaving out the e-cigarette and only showing Muklewicz blowing out smoke, implied to some that he was using drugs during class, Muklewicz said. After realizing the video was taken during class, Muklewicz said he emailed his professor, who reached out to the Office of Student Accountability and reiterated to students that taking recordings like this one is unacceptable.
UI Public Relations Manager Steve Schmadeke said in an email the university employs “standard security protocols” for online courses, including restricting access to “authenticated students who must sign in using their unique UI credentials.”
“Students are expected to follow course policies and the code of student life. That code would apply if an individual were identified secretly recording a classmate using a personal device,” Schmadeke said in his email. “The university also offers support services for any student who may experience a privacy violation.”
Muklewicz said what he heard from the Office of Student Accountability was that identifying whoever took the video would be “difficult,” and the office suggested reaching out to university police and changing his name on Zoom to better protect his privacy.

Using his experience from working for Microsoft and GoDaddy in the past, Muklewicz said he found out about the Zoom security issues while trying to work out for himself who could have taken the video.
“I was like, ‘This is so easy, I’ll identify it in five minutes and throw it back at them,’ but then what I came to quickly find out is, wait a minute, I accidentally was able to log in with no credentials,” Muklewicz said.
According to the UI’s posted information on Zoom security, all meetings have a passcode attached for access, but all invitation links automatically include it so no one needs to enter it themselves.
If Zoom classes are accessible to anyone with the link, Muklewicz said information like students’ names, email addresses, images and other information are vulnerable. Those with more “nefarious” intentions and the know-how could use the data they get from a Zoom class to trace a student’s IP address to their location, if they’re using university wi-fi.
While his professors have understood his concerns and the decision to stop attending classes, Muklewicz said the UI administration’s response is what led him to both file a Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, or FERPA, complaint and a lawsuit. FERPA serves to protect student education records in all levels of learning, from elementary to post-secondary.
“If we take this serious, great. We can mitigate anything, any harm that’s been done,” Muklewicz said. “And literally, I think all they have to do is take the default permissions off of Zoom and take that and leave it to admin control.”
He was told by Mike Mueller, associate director of the Office of Student Accountability, that after review of the incident by legal counsel, this incident does not qualify as a FERPA violation as the UI does not maintain Zoom videos.
Counts listed against the university in the lawsuit include negligence, breach of contract, public disclosure of private facts and intentional infliction of emotional distress, and Muklewicz is seeking damages and a requirement that the UI secure its Zoom classes.
Muklewicz was able to attend the UI with financial support from Veterans’ Affairs as a veteran himself, and he is not currently working. He said he is working with his VA counselor on next steps and figuring out his benefits while not attending classes.
“I’m probably not going to graduate this term, it’s just compounding into a huge problem for me now,” Muklewicz said.

Photograph by John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout ©2025Tennessee’s legislature recently overwhelmingly passed the Success Sequence Act, requiring public schools to teach about the positive outcomes of a life path that goes, in order: graduation from high school, moving on to jobs or further education, marriage and then having children.  It’s not bad advice, but one wonders about the merits of our state legislature offering it.  After all, we do not have required don’t-run-with-scissors instructional modules, or charity-is-a-good-thing week, and we are still waiting for success to come from decades of harangue-kids-about-drugs modules.
So, what’s really going on here? On one level it’s as simple as our legislators effectively yelling, “Hey, you kids are having sex way too casually and way too early!” One wonders if they ever thought about how the message would have been received decades ago by their teenage selves. Further, it is likely to be as ineffective as abstinence-only sex education. A November 2024 research article in the Journal of School Health put it succinctly, “Multiple studies indicate comprehensive sexuality programs are more effective than abstinence-only programs at reducing risky sexual behavior, and improving knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to sexual activity,” the researchers wrote.
On another level, however, this holds true to a political reality described in the books “Moral Politics” and “Don’t Think of an Elephant!,” both by George Lakoff. Self-described conservatives, and they dominate our state legislature, think of successful and wealthy people as having obtained this status because of moral clarity and good life choices. The impoverished are in that position by laziness, promiscuity, and bad choices. Liberals look more to social conditions; wealth often comes from inheritance, and poverty from things like low wages and poor health care.
‘Success sequence’ bill passes House, heads to governor’s desk for signature

Our legislature’s Success Sequence Act is virtue signaling to voters and not virtue referencing to students. It’s cut-and-paste legislation from the right-wing Heritage Foundation, already adopted by Utah and under consideration in Mississippi, Kentucky, Texas, and Ohio.
Tennessee’s sponsor, Rep. Gino Bulso of Brentwood, thinks such posturing in favor of nuclear families is the best remedy to poverty. Not exactly, at least not from him. He is in a public policy position so he should approach this from a public policy perspective — increasing the minimum wage, making even more opportunities available for post-secondary education, restricting child labor. Sadly, Bulso — and other lawmakers — are woefully deficient on these policy angles.
Members of the Tennessee legislature also might not be the best ones for giving such success in life advice. Former Sen. Brian Kelsey reported to prison after pleading guilty to campaign finance violations, only to be pardoned by President Trump. A jury found former Sen. Katrina Robinson guilty of wire fraud  Sen. Ken Yager faces Driving Under the Influence charges in Georgia. In January 2021, former House Speaker Glen Casada and several other Tennessee legislators had their homes and offices raided in a Federal Bureau of Investigation inquiry into laundered campaign money. 
Casada and his former chief of staff were indicted by a federal grand jury, charged with theft, bribery, and kickbacks, and the pair will go on trial April 22. Even if all those charged are not convicted, “life success” could be a stretch for their expertise. It’s fine that our legislature wants to pontificate on success in life, as long as they remember they are not the pontiff. We can seek our moral clarity from our pastors, parents, successful relatives, and other positive forces in young lives. As for our legislators, some legislation opening doors for young people would be a better use of their time.

Thom Tillis to help stop planned cuts to Medicaid on April 17, 2025 (Photo: Progress NC Action YouTube video)A coalition of progressive advocacy groups joined with local health care providers at a Raleigh press conference Thursday to encourage Republican U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis to protect Medicaid amid proposed federal cuts.
The event, which was organized by the Coalition Against Right-Wing Extremism (CARE), was intended to draw attention to a plan developed by congressional Republicans to squeeze $880 billion in cuts from Medicaid, a program that provides access to health care for about 3.1 million North Carolinians. Of that number, about 20% (650,000 people) are covered by Medicaid as a result of the program expansion state lawmakers enacted in 2023, according to the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services.
Beverly Edwards lives in Ahoskie in northeastern North Carolina. A pediatrician serving families in rural areas of the state, she said she sees every day how essential Medicaid is to keeping children and families safe.
“In rural areas, access to health care is already hard to come by,” Edwards said. “There are fewer jobs that offer employee-sponsored health care than in some other areas. That means if people lose their health care through Medicaid, they don’t have any alternatives.”
In Edwards’ community, hospitals rely heavily on Medicaid payments in order to keep their doors open. If there are cuts, the effects would be felt across the area.
“Everyone in our community would be forced to travel even further for emergency care, prenatal care, or surgery, if they can get the care at all,” she said.
Alexandra Sirota, executive director of the North Carolina Budget and Tax Center, has been at her organization for 15 years.
During that time, she’s documented the way budget and tax policy choices impact opportunity for the state.
“North Carolinians want an economy that works for us all,” Sirota said. “Our elected leaders, through their policy choices, have the power to do just that.”
She called out Tillis for prioritizing wealthy and profitable corporations over North Carolinians and their families.
“We know that Senator Tillis has the power to stop these cuts now, before they ripple through our state and our daily lives, affecting whether North Carolinians can receive medical care, whether the nearest hospital can serve all our families, whether people in our community can afford healthy meals, and whether we can keep our jobs,” she said.
Research released recently by the Robert Woods Johnson Foundation and the Urban Institute found that imposing work requirements on Medicaid enrollees — a cost-cutting idea under consideration in Congress and recently endorsed by North Carolina Republican legislators — would result in as many as 30% of the state’s Medicaid expansion population losing coverage.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Dr.-Beverly-Edwards.png,,,2025-04-17 13:14:17.555699

Bettison and police chiefs from Dearborn, Taylor, Livonia and other municipalities came to the Michigan House Government Operations Committee to offer support for a $115 million Public Safety and Violence Prevention Fund being considered by lawmakers with the goal of distributing funds to local law enforcement to curb violent crime.
Community violence intervention, or CVI, programs such as ShotStoppers, Detroit Friends & Family and FORCE Detroit were able to reduce violent crime by up to 70%  in some service areas between November 2023 and January 2024, a report from the city found. The three programs in the report engage trusted community members in Detroit neighbors to implement tailored approaches to reduce gun violence in the city.

And though the fund will help to save lives in cities with higher crime rates like Detroit and Flint, Bettison said, many municipalities in Michigan will dramatically benefit from being able to form or strengthen their own CVI programs to curb violence.

Mike Harris (R-Waterford) went through a list off estimated distributions for communities the members on the committee represent: $176,000 for Owosso, $1.9 million for Flint, $261,000 for Waterford Township, $50,000 for Ludington, nearly $500,000 for Muskegon, $3.2 million for Grand Rapids and $1.1 million for Warren.
In Dearborn, one of Michigan’s most populous cities and neighbor to Detroit, City Police Chief Issa Shahin said in addition to investing in CVIs, his department plans on using funds to hire more staff and officers to respond faster to calls and engage more proactively with neighborhoods before crime can occur.
“This is more than just funding. It’s a commitment to public safety and smart, targeted and responsive to needs on the ground. I’ll just be honest, policing is expensive. Communities want well-staffed, well-trained and well-resourced departments and that costs money,” Shahin said. “This investment allows us to do that on behalf of our officers, our city and our residents.”
The Public Safety and Violence Prevention Fund, which was proposed for $75 million last legislative session with bipartisan support has since been increased to $115 million in order to dedicate $40 million to county sheriffs. 
The fund still has bipartisan support in the Republican-majority state House, but GOP leadership has raised concern that the Democratic-led state Senate won’t take up the fund without trying to add other measures to it.

The Government Operations Committee, which has three Republicans and two Democrats, passed the bills that create the fund, HB 4260 and 4261, out of committee unanimously Thursday, urging their colleagues in both chambers of the Legislature to work towards the common goal of safer communities.
Funding public safety “isn’t about politics,” Harris said, “it’s about people.” 
“It’s about real families. It’s about real neighborhoods, and it’s about real law enforcement officers who need backup, and not just in the field, but here in Lansing from us.”

“The children of Delaware have the right to a happy and safe childhood, and it’s our responsibility as adults and organizations to stand up to protect that right,” said Georganne Buccine, YMCA of Delaware Vice President of Youth Development. “By joining in the Five Days of Action campaign, we hope to inspire other organizations and members of our community to create safe spaces that protect children from sexual abuse.”
Pledge and Pinwheels
Throughout the week, YMCA members are encouraged to sign a pledge committing to protect children from abuse. Those who participate will receive a blue pinwheel, the official symbol of child abuse prevention, as a visual show of support. Pinwheels and pledge forms will be available at the front desks of all YMCA of Delaware locations.
Know. See. Respond.
This year’s campaign brings back the “Know. See. Respond.” initiative, supported by child protection organizations including Praesidium, Saprea, and Lauren’s Kids.
The goal is to educate parents, caregivers, and community members on how to recognize warning signs of abuse and take action.
– Know: Learn what questions to ask when enrolling children in camps or activities to ensure abuse prevention policies are in place.
– See: Understand the subtle warning signs of grooming behavior and how to spot them.
– Respond: Use tools like the Trusted Triangle and the Safety NETwork to support children in speaking up and staying safe.
Resources and educational materials can be accessed through the YMCA’s partners and directly on their websites.

Whenever I travel outside the state, I don’t need a sign on the border to know I am home, because as soon as I hit that first pothole, I know I am home. Roads are critical for economic development and growth, and because of this, we understand that not only should they remain well-kept, but also publicly provided. This is a given, but it should not be done in a way that risks doing harm to public programs that millions of Michiganders rely on, such as schools, access to health care and putting food on our table.
Policymakers in Lansing all seem to agree that our roads are a priority. Both in her “Road Ahead Address” and her State of the State Address, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer vowed to see her “fix the damn roads” promise to its end. Last month, the Michigan House of Representatives passed a road funding package to fund the fiscal cliff the state is facing, totaling more than $3 billion. The road funding package received bipartisan support, but will likely face revisions in this divided government, all a part of tense budget negotiations that will define the year ahead. 
The problem with this road funding package is not its end goal, but its method. It is full of uncertainty and tepid promises that “critical” programs will not face cuts or funding risks. Apart from a proposed tax increase on motor fuel, offsetting a reduction in the sales tax and a tax hike to pressure corporations to forgo subsidies under a former tax plan, proponents claim no new money is needed to fix the roads. Instead, existing state general fund dollars are shifted to roads and to fill the hole in the school aid fund and in community revenue sharing. Ultimately, the proposal passed by the House last month is estimated to reduce overall general fund revenues from 2026-2031 to the tune of about $17 billion.

However, this is like saying no new money is needed for a brand new car because I can just dip into our child’s college savings account. We have the money, but where we take it from matters a great deal. In fact, this is a worse scenario because, without a corresponding budget, we don’t know what existing programs could be impacted by this road proposal. Risking key programs to fund the roads will only result in a road that goes nowhere. If investments in libraries, child care centers, food banks or local schools are cut to make room for road funding, we’re neglecting what communities need most. Roads are meant to connect us to opportunities and resources, not come at their expense.
Underlying all of this, too, is an assumption that Michigan’s method in determining road funding is accurate. A recent report from the Citizens Research Council of Michigan shows that the way Michigan goes about fixing its roads is deeply flawed and antiquated, warranting investigation into policies that improve efficiency and quality of our road systems as well as how we allocate the dollars. Additionally, our existing formula and budget continue to underfund our public transit system, leading to limited service access all across the state. Michigan lawmakers should reassess how funds are allocated, putting dollars where they matter most. 
Roads connect people and allow Michiganders to take their kids to child care or school, get to the doctor’s office, go grocery shopping and enjoy all of the beauty that Michigan’s parks, lakes and forests provide. We need to know not only where this money is going, but where it is going to be taken from. We cannot risk the ends for its means — the school down the road for the road itself.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_5758-1024x757.jpg,,,2025-04-17 12:22:33.420917

Traducción por Jorge Alatrista, Identidad Latina Multimedia.

Desde los primeros días del segundo mandato del presidente Donald Trump, los líderes educativos de Connecticut han observado cómo la administración presidencial implementaba una serie de órdenes ejecutivas, recortes de fondos y cambios en la política federal, muchos de los cuales representan cambios drásticos para los estudiantes, las escuelas y los distritos que supervisan.
Los legisladores de Connecticut han expresado abiertamente su temor al peor escenario posible: una reducción o eliminación total de los 550 millones de dólares en fondos federales de los que depende el estado para apoyar la educación pública K-12.
Por ahora, los fondos se mantienen prácticamente intactos. Sin embargo, varias de las acciones de Trump hasta la fecha — en temas como la DEI (diversidad, equidad e inclusión), estudiantes transgénero y protestas en campus — amenazan con recortes en los fondos federales si las escuelas y universidades no cumplen.
Esto es lo que sabemos hasta ahora.
Diversidad, equidad e inclusión
Durante la primera semana del mandato del presidente Trump, emitió una orden que prohíbe la DEI en todas las agencias federales. La semana siguiente, el presidente emitió una orden ejecutiva para eliminar el trato discriminatorio y el adoctrinamiento, incluyendo los basados ​​en la ideología de género y la ideología discriminatoria de equidad, en las escuelas primarias y secundarias, solicitando reducciones en la financiación federal para las escuelas que no cumplan.
A principios de este mes, el problema se agravó cuando el Departamento de Educación envió una carta instando a los funcionarios educativos estatales de todo el país, a que certificaran su cumplimiento de sus obligaciones antidiscriminatorias para continuar recibiendo asistencia financiera federal. 
Esta semana, Connecticut anunció que no cumplirá con las demandas de terminar con las prácticas de diversidad, equidad e inclusión en sus escuelas K-12, una decisión que probablemente pondrá al estado en un enfrentamiento con la administración Trump.
El Departamento de Defensa también ha suspendido las admisiones con enfoque racial en las academias militares, incluyendo la Academia de la Guardia Costera en New London. En febrero, el Departamento de Educación emitió una carta amenazando con retener la financiación a las instituciones educativas que consideran la raza en sus admisiones y programas. A mediados de marzo, la Universidad de Yale se encontraba entre las docenas de universidades incluidas en un comunicado del Departamento de Educación, que alegaba prácticas excluyentes en las admisiones de posgrado.
Desmantelamiento del Departamento
A principios de marzo, el Departamento de Educación anunció que reduciría su plantilla aproximadamente a la mitad. El Fiscal General de Connecticut, William Tong, se unió a un grupo de estados para demandar a la administración por los recortes de personal, y el caso está pendiente.
El 20 de marzo, el presidente Trump firmó una orden ejecutiva que exigía el desmantelamiento del Departamento de Educación. Los sindicatos de docentes presentaron rápidamente una demanda para bloquear la orden, y los miembros de la delegación del Congreso de Connecticut se han comprometido a tomar medidas. Trump ha declarado que la administración de los préstamos estudiantiles se transferiría a la Administración de Pequeñas Empresas (SBA) y que los programas de necesidades especiales se transferirían al Departamento de Salud y Servicios Humanos (HHS).
Financiación en la era del COVID-19
El año pasado, los distritos escolares de todo el país solicitaron prórrogas para gastar los últimos dólares restantes de la ayuda federal para el COVID-19 antes de marzo de 2026, en lugar de la fecha límite original de enero de 2025. Sin embargo, a finales de marzo, la administración Trump congeló dicha financiación.
Los últimos 14 millones de dólares de Connecticut se destinaron principalmente a programas del Departamento de Educación Estatal, y poco más de 6 millones de dólares de los fondos ya se habían otorgado a aproximadamente dos docenas de distritos escolares de primaria y secundaria. Se esperaba que New London y Waterbury recibieran la mayor parte de esos fondos.
El gobierno también ha declarado su intención de recortar la financiación de las escuelas y universidades que exigen la vacunación contra el COVID-19.
Estudiantes transgénero
Durante su primera semana en el cargo, el presidente Trump emitió una orden que ponía fin a las protecciones del Título IX para estudiantes transgénero. La semana siguiente, el Departamento de Educación acató la orden, derogando las normas establecidas durante el gobierno de Biden. Posteriormente, el gobierno de Trump emitió una orden ejecutiva que prohíbe a las mujeres y niñas transgénero competir en deportes femeninos. Las instituciones que no cumplan con la prohibición podrían ver recortada su financiación, según ha declarado el gobierno.
A finales de marzo, el departamento envió una carta a los estados amenazando con retener la financiación federal si no se permitía a los padres revisar los expedientes estudiantiles, en particular los relacionados con la identidad de género del estudiante. En Connecticut, defensores de la educación buscan mayor protección para los estudiantes transgénero tras las medidas de la administración Trump.
Control migratorio
En enero, el presidente anunció que los agentes del Servicio de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas (ICE) y la Oficina de Aduanas y Protección Fronteriza (CBP) podrían realizar arrestos en escuelas, iglesias y hospitales, lugares que durante mucho tiempo se habían considerado “sitios sensibles” y a los que se les había prohibido el acceso a las autoridades migratorias.
Las autoridades educativas de Connecticut publicaron una guía para las escuelas públicas, desde Preescolar hasta el último año del Secundario, sobre cómo los líderes de los distritos locales deben responder a las “actividades migratorias”, incluyendo los casos en que los funcionarios federales de inmigración soliciten información estudiantil o ingresen a las instalaciones escolares.
Comidas escolares
Se cancelaron millones de dólares en fondos previstos que las escuelas y los bancos de alimentos de Connecticut planeaban utilizar para comprar alimentos frescos a agricultores locales. El Departamento de Agricultura de EE.UU. informó a las agencias estatales que dejaría de operar los dos programas que gastan mil millones de dólares anuales a nivel nacional: el Programa de Acuerdo Cooperativo de Asistencia para la Compra de Alimentos Locales y el programa de Alimentos Locales para las Escuelas.
Protestas en los campus universitarios
A finales de enero, el presidente se comprometió a cancelar las visas de estudiante de “todos los simpatizantes de Hamas en los campus universitarios”. Semanas después, el Departamento de Educación advirtió a 60 universidades que podrían enfrentar repercusiones si no “protegen a los estudiantes judíos en sus campus”. La Universidad de Yale se encontraba entre las instituciones mencionadas en el anuncio del Departamento. Varios estudiantes internacionales que participaron en las protestas han sido detenidos.

TUSCALOOSA — When Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum visited two Warrior Met coal mines in central Alabama last week, he said he was emphasizing the administration’s commitment to “clean, beautiful coal” and its plans to roll back regulation.
The department’s press office swiftly posted on social media after the trip his ultimate goal: “Mine, Baby, Mine!”
What Burgum didn’t mention on Friday was Warrior Met Coal’s checkered safety and environmental record, which includes thousands of federal safety violations issued under both Republican and Democratic administrations. He also didn’t mention the death of Aaron Haley, a 34-year-old miner killed on the job in 2023 because, according to an investigative report by federal safety officials, Warrior Met did not keep equipment in safe operating condition.

Missing, too, from Burgum’s comments was any recognition that the coal produced by Warrior Met, metallurgical coal, is not used to power American homes or businesses. Instead, it is shipped abroad through the Port of Mobile, largely to countries in South America and Asia for steelmaking.
“Through these tours, Secretary Burgum is displaying the importance of President Trump’s executive orders which are Unleashing American Energy and putting hardworking Americans first,” a press release from Burgum’s office said after the trip. “Friday’s visit highlights the Department of the Interior’s continued focus on bolstering domestic coal production to create more jobs, lower the cost of living for Americans, and unlock more of our nation’s critical resources.”
Neither Inside Climate News nor other local news outlets contacted by ICN were notified of Burgum’s visit ahead of time. A national reporter for Fox Business was on site for the trip with access to the cabinet secretary.
The Department of the Interior has not responded to questions about the trip or why local reporters were not included. It did not address Warrior Met’s safety or environmental record. Warrior Met has not responded to questions about Burgum’s visit or its own environmental and safety record.

According to the department, Burgum’s first stop was Warrior Met Mine No. 4. The mine utilizes the longwall method of extraction where coal is sheared by large high-powered machinery, leaving behind vast open expanses underground that can lead to the permanent sinking of the land above. The method is faster and can be riskier than other forms of mining and has been blamed for methane leaks.
In March 2024, an Alabama grandfather was killed by an explosion in his home above Oak Grove mine, a longwall operation in nearby Jefferson County, after methane gas likely leaked into the home,
This month, just days before President Donald Trump boasted from the White House about “unleashing…clean, beautiful coal,” a West Virginia woman was severely injured from a blast at her home above a longwall mine.
On April 5, she lit a cigarette, setting off an explosion that first responders suspect was caused by a methane leak from the mine, owned by Core Natural Resources, a Pennsylvania company created by the merger in January of CONSOL Energy and Arch Resources. An investigation is continuing by state inspectors who have ordered the company to submit a revised permit for monitoring methane emissions.
Coal helped turn the United States into a global economic and military power, but coal-fired power plants emit toxic air pollution and heat-trapping gases that are changing the world’s climate in dangerous ways. Moreover, the methane that coal mining releases is a super-pollutant 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide at warming the planet over a 20-year period. Inside mines, methane also presents deadly explosion risks to miners if safety measures are not followed.
Contrary to Trump and Burgum’s clean coal assertions, coal is the dirtiest of fossil fuels.
Warrior Met’s No. 4 mine has had a history of safety violations, according to records maintained by the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA), the federal regulator charged with ensuring miner wellbeing.
Since 2019, the mine has been cited by federal regulators nearly 3,000 times with safety violations. About 25 percent—731 of those violations—were labelled by MSHA as “significant and substantial,” meaning the violations were “reasonably likely to result in a serious injury or illness.” More than 100 citations have been issued since Trump took office.
﻿
Records show that the No. 4 Mine is currently undergoing two spot inspections and a “regular safety and health inspection,” investigations that have resulted so far in 25 citations. The mine’s previous complete safety and health inspection, conducted in January, February and March, resulted in 78 citations, according to regulatory records.
Less than two years ago, Aaron Haley, a West Virginia native and father of three, was killed while working inside the No. 4 Mine. An MSHA investigation into the incident faulted the mine for his death and injuries suffered by two other miners.
“On August 30, 2023, at approximately 6:50 a.m., Aaron Haley, a 34-year-old belt foreman with over 13 years of mining experience, died when a longwall belt conveyor take-up unit (take-up) component, the bridle, broke and struck him,” the report said. “The accident occurred because the mine operator did not maintain components of the take-up in safe operating condition.”
Haley’s obituary offers a more expansive sense of what was lost that day: “Aaron was kind, loving, generous, funny and would give the shirt off his back to anyone. He loved teaching [his son] baseball, football, fishing, and just ‘guy’ stuff. His two baby girls…had him wrapped around their fingers. He loved playing kitchen, restaurant and pushing them on their swings. Aaron loved his wife…dearly and took the best care of her. He was the absolute best husband, father, son, and an all-around wonderful man.”
MSHA cited Warrior Met with a violation of 30 CFR 75.1725(a), a regulation requiring that equipment “be maintained in safe operating condition.” If machinery is deemed unsafe, the regulation requires it be removed from service immediately. Since Haley’s death, the No. 4 Mine has been cited nearly 39 times for violating the same safety requirement.
Burgum’s visit to the No. 4 mine was followed, according to his department’s press release, by a “windshield tour” of Warrior Met’s planned Blue Creek facility, which is slated to be one of the largest coal mining expansions in the state’s history.

If approved by state and federal regulators, the project is expected to increase Warrior Met’s coal production by up to 60 percent. Taxpayer-funded support for the facility may top $400 million.
Warrior Met’s planned expansion at Blue Creek may also include the extraction of publicly-owned coal managed by the Bureau of Land Management, according to federal documents.
In Alabama, as in many other states, so-called “mineral rights”—including the right to mine for coal under property—have been separated from surface ownership over time. One person or entity can own a surface property under Alabama law while another person or entity can own the rights to all of the resources below that same piece of land, a situation known as a “split estate.” In significant areas of Alabama, the federal government retains mineral rights despite private land ownership on the surface.
The federal Bureau of Land Management announced in April that it would conduct an environmental assessment related to Warrior Met’s Blue Creek project and, specifically, its proposal to mine 14,040 acres of federal minerals underlying privately owned land in Tuscaloosa County. Warrior Met’s applications to lease the coal rights propose the extraction of approximately 57.5 million tons of recoverable public coal reserves.
Taxpayers will help to pay for some critical needs related to the expansion of the Blue Creek project, according to state and county officials who touted the expansion as leading to job creation. In March 2024, Gov. Kay Ivey announced that, with the support of the Alabama Department of Economic and Community Affairs, the Appalachian Regional Commission would provide $500,000 in taxpayer funding to install public water service to the Blue Creek mine site. “Access to dependable local water service is essential to attract and grow new business and jobs,” Ivey said.
  Gov. Kay Ivey’s administration facilitated the spending of $500,000 of taxpayer money to expand public water service to Warrior Met’s new facilities. (Lee Hedgepeth/Inside Climate News)
Warrior Met also secured a $26.5 million tax abatement from the Tuscaloosa County Industrial Development Authority. A breakdown of the tax incentive deal in 2020 estimated that Warrior Met would receive $18 million in tax breaks during the project’s construction and $8.5 million over the next decade.
“This project represents a significant investment in our community by Warrior Met Coal,” said Mark Crews, chairman of the Tuscaloosa County Industrial Development Authority, “but also represents valuable job opportunities for our citizens for several decades to come.”
Exports from Warrior Met and other Alabama coal producers are also a driving force behind continued expansion at the Port of Mobile, including the publicly-funded dredging of Mobile Bay, which is slated to cost taxpayers more than $350 million.
Warrior Met has been the target of litigation over its environmental record. In September 2024, Black Warrior Riverkeeper, an environmental group founded to protect and restore the Black Warrior River and its tributaries, settled a lawsuit with the company over a leaking coal slurry impoundment at Warrior Met’s No. 7 Mine in Brookwood. Black Warrior Riverkeeper had documented nearly two dozen leaks from the coal waste pond in the year before the suit was filed, the organization said in a court filing earlier this year.
The settlement, approved by a federal judge in September of last year, requires Warrior Met to limit and monitor leaks from the site, pay $250,000 to the Freshwater Land Trust for a conservation project and reimburse the nonprofit for its legal fees.
Burgum said last week that metallurgical coal like that extracted by Warrior Met is “essential for us for steelmaking,” though the company itself has acknowledged its coal is not used for steelmaking in the United States. “Substantially all of our steelmaking coal sales are exported,” the company wrote in its 2024 annual report to shareholders.
In the same report, Warrior Met outlined various risks and uncertainties that could impact their bottom line. Among them: “Challenges associated with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations” and “climate change concerns and our operations’ impact on the environment.”

(Allison Kite/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — A Wyandotte County District Court judge pointed to flaws in Kansas’ capital punishment law in an opinion that didn’t lead to findings relative to a constitutional challenge because the death penalty was taken off the table in both cases creating legal standing for the case.
Judge Bill Klapper’s opinion delved into economic, fairness and psychological elements of capital punishment and examined claims the death penalty statute was biased against defendants of color, fostered trauma among families of victims who dealt with years of proceedings and promoted expenditure of millions of dollars by prosecutors pursuing a sentence the state hadn’t enforced in 60 years.
The constitutional challenge brought by the American Civil Liberties Union and other organizations came to an end once their clients accused of capital crimes no longer faced the ultimate punishment.
“The impossibility of either defendant being subjected to the death penalty causes them to lose their legal standing to challenge the constitutionality of the Kansas death penalty as applied to them,” Klapper’s order said.
The ACLU, ACLU of Kansas, the Kansas Death Penalty Defense Unit, Democracy Forward and lawyers from Washington, D.C., law firms filed motions challenging the death penalty on behalf of Antoine Fielder, who was accused of shooting to death Wyandotte County Deputies Theresa King and Patrick Rohrer in June 2018 while being escorted to a court hearing. In exchange for prosecutors withdrawing a request for the death penalty, Fielder entered in December a plea of guilty to two counts of capital murder. He was sentenced to life in prison without possibility of parole.
The second participant in the constitutional challenge was Hugo Villaneuva-Morales, who was accused of killing four people in October 2019 at a bar in Kansas City, Kansas. In February, prosecutors agreed not to seek the death penalty against Villaneuva-Morales in exchange for his waiver of the right to a jury trial. He was found guilty of murder on Wednesday.
Because both men no longer faced the potential of execution, the district court judge didn’t rule on broad constitutional claims relative to the case. With addition of Fielder and Villaneuva-Morales, the ACLU has represented four clients in legal challenges to the state’s death penalty.
“The evidentiary hearings have consistently exposed uncomfortable truths to state prosecutors, the courts and the public about the deep flaws and injustices embedded in the death penalty system,” said Cassandra Stubbs, director of the ACLU’s Capital Punishment Project.
On Thursday, Stubbs said judicial issues brought to light in the series of legal challenges should be recognized by lawmakers in Kansas.
“We remain committed to challenging the death penalty on behalf of people facing capital charges in Kansas with the hope that state legislators will end the death penalty and make future legal challenges unnecessary,” she said.
 
The evidence
In Wyandotte County District Court, testimony portrayed capital punishment as unconstitutional in terms of the right to be free of cruel and unusual punishment and a violation of equal protection rights associated with race and gender. The legal coalition challenging Kansas’ death penalty law additionally asserted jury selection in capital cases, in which all jurors must be willing to impose a death sentence, was unconstitutional.
Witnesses called on behalf of Fielder and Villaneuva-Morales argued the automatic striking of prospective jurors who didn’t believe execution to be a valid form of punishment was discriminatory against Black people, women and individuals with firmly held religious beliefs.
Klapper’s 15-page opinion summarized evidence offered by half the 13 expert witnesses called by attorneys for the two men accused of murder. The state cross-examined most of those witnesses, but didn’t present testimony. The judge said evidence presented on behalf of the two defendants “was decidedly persuasive and well-reasoned.”
He portrayed race and gender as key elements in how prosecutors decided to pursue the death penalty and how those cases were handled by juries. In Kansas, none of 15 men sentenced to death killed a Black person despite Black males making up more than 30% of homicide victims. White females comprised 20% of homicide victims in Kansas, but cases with white female victims were most likely to lead to a death sentence.
“The factors which distinguish death sentence cases from non-death sentence cases are the race and gender of the victim, and the race and gender of the defendant,” the judge’s opinion said.
Klapper drew from an expert witness for the two men who argued the legal framework for selecting jurors was “so flawed that it does not protect racial biases in jury selection and must be reformed, a fact known to Kansans for years.”
The judge wrote that testimony indicated the “scientific community has found no reliable evidence of the death penalty being a deterrent to homicides.”
 
‘Painful wounds’
Hearings in the case, which began in October, showed Kansas prosecutors had filed 129 capital murder cases in response to more than 4,000 homicides committed in the state since the state restored the death penalty in 1994. Prosecutors took the next step to provide formal notice the death penalty would be sought in 76 of those cases.
Of 15 men sentenced to death in Kansas, nine remained under sentences of death. Four of them were resentenced to long prison terms, while two died in prison.
“Much more difficult to measure, but most concerning is the impact continual court hearings have on the victims’ families,” Klapper wrote. “The verdict in a capital case resulting in a death sentence is not the end but only the beginning of the appellate process. Most of the Kansas death penalty cases have been pending for more than 15 years and no (inmate) has exhausted their appellate rights.
“How will families of the victims ever begin to heal and attempt the process of recovery, if that is even possible, when the legal system continues to reopen those painful wounds with each new motion?”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_9082-scaled-e1730240913469-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-04-17 12:22:33.420917

That’s because of the most recent announcement of layoffs at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.,"Aerial shot of the NIOSH campus in Bruceton, Allegheny County. (Photo from the CDC)Most Americans learned what an N95 mask was during the COVID-19 pandemic. But what many still don’t know is that every one of them was certified by a single, government-run lab in Bruceton, Allegheny County. It’s called the National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory. The name N95 actually comes from their certification standards.
The lab, near Pittsburgh, is operated by the National Institute of Occupational Health and Safety (NIOSH) and is the only facility in the country that is capable of offering the agency’s stamp of approval. The same lab certifies a host of other protective masks and respirators used by firefighters, doctors, painters, factory workers, coal miners, pharmaceutical manufacturers, welders, chemical plant employees, construction crews and others. Many American employers are statutorily required to provide them to workers.
An estimated 5 million Americans workers are required to use respirators at their place of employment.
But according to a dozen current and former NIOSH employees and union representatives who have worked at or with their personal protective equipment division, that lab has halted almost all of its regular work and is preparing to shut down in June.
That’s because of the most recent announcement of layoffs at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The agency, run by Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has announced plans to lay off 10,000 employees across its various divisions. Hundreds of those cuts are in NIOSH, the division that studies and recommends ways to prevent workplace health and safety hazards.
“It’s kind of the sabotage of guide rails that have been set up for industry to help keep workers safe,” said Jonathan Szalajda, a lab employee and former deputy director of the National Personal Protective Technology Lab. “It’s a situation where we’re leaving workers defenseless, and I think it’s certainly a step back from what we’ve done to protect workers over the last half century.”

Since the beginning of mass layoffs at federal agencies overseen by the Trump administration and Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), virtually every employee at the National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory has taken a buyout or early retirement offer, been put on administrative leave, or received a notice that their job is subject to what’s called a “reduction in force” and that their last day will come in June. 
It’s not clear if the impending layoffs will hit every remaining employee because, according to workers and union officials, leaders at the Department of Health and Human Services and the Centers for Disease Control have not been answering questions. Moreover, almost all of the lab’s supervisors have been placed on administrative leave, along with their HR contact.
The reduction in force notices are confusing as well. Some sent out to individual employees note that layoffs will happen in their division, and they may or may not be subject to them. But another sent to the union that oversees the bargaining unit employees at the National Personal Protective Technology Lab said all of their jobs would be eliminated. Virtually every lab employee that isn’t part of that union has already been placed on leave or told their position will be terminated in June.
Given the lack of communication, and the sweeping layoffs that have hit other parts of the federal government, including NIOSH itself, employees at the personal protective equipment division are expecting the worst.
Already, the lab’s workforce has shrunk from 120 to 70 this year, and the remaining employees are facing layoffs that the Department of Health and Human Services says will come in June.
A spokesperson for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention referred questions to the Department of Health and Human Services, which did not respond to multiple inquiries from the Capital-Star. NIOSH is a research agency within the CDC, which is a part of the Department of Health and Human Services.
“We have no idea what we’re supposed to do,” said one remaining lab employee who spoke under condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation. “We have no idea what to tell the manufacturers. This is so important, we just feel there’s no way this can be real.”
Szalajda said the lab has stopped accepting requests from manufacturers to certify new respirators. The remaining lab employees who weren’t laid off have shifted their focus to preparing for the lab to be shut down.
New research has also stopped because of time constraints and a freeze on federal employee credit cards that has made it impossible to buy necessary materials.
Instead, workers are finalizing research projects that are near completion, and preparing them for publication.
‘Someone will have to own the travesty’
Szalajda and others have said they expect the lab’s closure to result in the market being flooded with substandard masks.
Along with certifying new products, lab employees regularly inspect respirator manufacturing plants and test masks that have already been approved to ensure they’re still being manufactured to NIOSH standards. That work, however, has stopped, largely because of a freeze on approval of employee travel reimbursement. According to Szalajda, the lab has also stopped sending out contractors because they’re not certain they’ll ever be paid given the rapid changes.
Szalajda worries about “a Wild West scenario” where respirator manufacturers are free to cut corners in production, and no one will be there to catch them.










One of the last research projects that lab employees are working to finalize is a comprehensive study on the efficacy of counterfeit masks. It’s unclear if the report will ever be released to the public. 


“The American public, if you’re buying a respirator or a mask to do home improvements or hobbies or anything, you’re going to be at the mercy of those companies to not become lax,” said Linda Chasko, a NIOSH employee who was speaking in her capacity as vice president of the federal employees union that includes the Allegheny County NIOSH campus employees.
The potential closure has also alarmed industry members, who have spent significant time and money ensuring their respirators meet NIOSH standards, and rely on the certification for new products.
The closure of the lab could also cede the respirator market to foreign companies whose products are tested according to their own government’s standards. NIOSH certification, however, had often been referred to as a “gold standard,” Szalajda said.  
During the COVID-19 pandemic, for example, KN95 masks were often billed as an alternative to N95s, which were at times difficult to find. The primary difference is that KN95s were certified in China. However, issues were found with a number of certified KN95s, which led to numerous recalls.
There is also a fear that counterfeit masks will spread. Part of the Personal Protective Technology Lab’s mission was to find and study respirators with fake NIOSH-approval stamps, and work with distributors to stop their spread.
One of the last research projects that lab employees are working to finalize is a comprehensive study on the efficacy of counterfeit masks. They found that virtually all of them failed to consistently meet NIOSH standards for filtering air particulates. Between an HHS communications freeze and uncertainty that the report can be finalized before the lab closes, it’s unclear if the report will ever be released to the public.
“We’re expecting there could potentially be an influx of counterfeit equipment,” said Chasko. “What’s at stake is the respiratory health and overall health of all the workers in industries that use equipment reliant on NIOSH standards.”
The lab’s closure could also cause problems for certain industries, like coal, where companies are statutorily required to provide NIOSH-certified respirators for miners. It’s unclear what will happen if NIOSH is no longer able to provide that certification.

For example, every underground coal mine is required by law to provide specialized respirators called closed-circuit escape respirators. They’re for the worst case scenario: escaping a deadly and low-oxygen environment where something has likely gone very wrong.
Those respirators are not just approved by NIOSH, but regularly audited by the lab to ensure they still work after being stored in harsh underground conditions with heavy dust exposure. The same masks are also required in certain Navy ships.
“We have found failures,” one employee said about their regular audits.
Personal protective equipment researchers in Morgantown, West Virginia, the other NIOSH office where research on respirators and protective gear is done, were also hit with layoffs.
One Morgantown NIOSH employee who worked with the personal protective equipment team on firefighter safety recommendations was notified on April 1 that they would immediately be placed on administrative leave. That will end with their termination on June 1. 
Still, they’re hoping the decision will be reversed, and requested anonymity for fear of being targeted in the event that some employees are brought back.
“We were told it was just going to be a consolidation … that the scientists would not be let go,” the employee said about the layoffs, which have affected almost everyone at the Morgantown NIOSH campus. “But the scientists went in the first round.”
Cathy Tinney-Zara, president of the federal employee union that represents the Morgantown NIOSH employees, said almost all work at the division has stopped, with almost everyone put on administrative leave ahead of terminations in June. 
“You wouldn’t believe how confusing it’s been,” Tinney-Zara said. She said leaders at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services have not been communicating with union officials. She can’t even provide an exact number of workers who have been told they’re being laid off.
Mostly, she gets updates through the news like everyone else. Most recently, U.S. Rep. Riley Moore, a West Virginia Republican, said some of the layoffs at the Morgantown facility, which does extensive work on coal miner safety, were made in error. But Tinney-Zara hasn’t been able to confirm that or find out where he got that information.
“It’s a real tragedy,” Szalajda said about the lab’s closure and cuts at NIOSH. “For people who work in this business, it’s not just the paycheck. It’s a lifestyle. People who have been involved within our division, they work there because of a mission, the attractiveness of doing something that makes a difference in people’s lives.”
But Szalajda is hopeful that HHS may still reverse course. He and other employees are waging something of a pressure campaign by reaching out to lawmakers, industry partners and media.
Moreover, he believes that even if the lab, or most of NIOSH, is shut down now, one day it will be replaced. But it may be a hard learning curve for whoever’s brought in to get it running. He expects many of the most experienced people on staff now, would not return. 
“It’s just kind of a recipe for disaster,” Szalajda said. “It may not be something that happens right away, but there will be some sort of incident that will show the void of what’s been left from stepping away, and someone will have to own the travesty that comes after that.”

Jaydun was the second of five brothers and had a baby sister. He was very close to his siblings, those who knew him said, and a close friend to many kids in foster care.
“He was always building us up, like helping us all,” said Jacie, a friend of Jaydun’s who lived with him for months in the Albuquerque office building of the New Mexico Children, Youth and Families Department, where case workers have often housed kids who don’t have foster homes available to them.

“Hearing that he’s gone, it just like broke us, and it took a piece out of us,” she said. Jaydun and Jacie both belonged to a tight-knit group of foster youth — teens who had spent much of their lives in foster care and had spent years held in group facilities. Jaydun loved to draw and was an athletic kid who loved basketball, especially the Los Angeles Lakers — a person whom friends would seek out when they needed someone to talk to.
For this story, Searchlight spoke to six people with direct knowledge of the circumstances of Jaydun’s death. Most of them asked not to be named because they were not authorized to speak with the media, or because of sensitivities related to the case.

“He was always building us up, like helping us all,” said Jacie, a friend of Jaydun’s. “Hearing that he’s gone, it just like broke us, and it took a piece out of us.”

In an email, CYFD communications director Andrew Skobinsky wrote that the department could not comment because of confidentiality laws. “We are only authorized to release information when it is determined that abuse or neglect caused a child’s death,” he wrote. “Accordingly, no further information can be provided.”
Jaydun’s death comes after years of promises by CYFD to stop housing its foster youth in group settings and to provide them adequate mental health care — promises that were made as part of the 2020 settlement of a class action lawsuit that claimed the state’s child welfare system was “locking New Mexico’s foster children into a vicious cycle of declining physical, mental and behavioral health.”
Now, half a decade later, CYFD has failed year after year to meet its commitments to those promises, according to independent monitors.
Instead, it has housed children with serious mental and behavioral health needs in youth homeless shelters and its office buildings, where they have been sexually assaulted, injured by armed guards and exposed to fentanyl and other drugs.
“When I go visit a client who is living in these settings, I see their mental health declining sharply,” said Sara Crecca, an Albuquerque-based youth attorney who was co-counsel for the plaintiffs of the class action suit.
Amid mounting criticism from attorneys, legislators and advocates, CYFD in June 2024 began moving youth from its office complex to a new building: a former Albuquerque halfway house built for girls transitioning out of juvenile detention.
It was in that building that Jaydun died last weekend, discovered in the bathroom by his roommate, another teenage boy.
The death in itself is beyond tragic, friends and attorneys say — a loss made all the more painful by the fact that CYFD had continued to house Jaydun and other youth in congregate care despite barrages of warnings that such housing was a “clear and urgent safety risk for children,” particularly those who were suffering mental crises, with staffing shortages sometimes leaving kids with nowhere to turn.
“They’re supposed to be the one people that we trust, the ones that we go to when we have problems,” Jacie said of CYFD. In the wake of Jaydun’s death, nobody from the department had reached out to Jacie to offer therapy or counseling, she said.
“If they really cared, they would be on top of getting us therapy. They would be on top of us having a home — a forever home, an actual home with parents’ love — not removing us, not putting us in shelters, not putting us in the office. We’re not getting that.”
Still, the events of last weekend felt unexpected to those close to Jaydun.
“CYFD had promised him a lot of support” during the last year, a close acquaintance of his told Searchlight, asking that they not be named because of the sensitive nature of the case. “He seemed to be optimistic about his future.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/CYFD2-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-04-17 12:22:33.420917

(Photo by Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser told a crowd gathered in a Denver high school auditorium Wednesday night that opponents of President Donald Trump’s administration are fighting “to keep America, America.”
Weiser welcomed three of his counterparts from other states — Attorneys General Nick Brown of Washington, Anne Lopez of Hawaii and Aaron Ford of Nevada — for the latest in a series of “community impact hearings” on Trump’s agenda at George Washington High School.
The four are among the 23 elected Democratic attorneys general nationwide who have led the fight against the second Trump administration’s agenda in the courts. Weiser has sued Trump at least a dozen times so far, including challenges to the administration’s attempt to end the 14th Amendment’s protections for birthright citizenship; its sweeping freeze of many federal grant and aid programs; its mass layoffs of federal employees; and its defunding of medical research through the National Institutes of Health.
Weiser said the legal challenges have borne some fruit in the form of preliminary injunctions and other procedural victories, but acknowledged growing alarm over whether “this democratic republic (will) hold.”
“These court victories are important, but more important is everyone’s voice,” Weiser said, encouraging the crowd to join protests like the one that drew 8,000 people to the Colorado Capitol on April 5. “We need to use our voice.”
Wednesday’s event came amid an outcry this week over the fates of more than 200 immigrants deported by the Trump administration to a brutal maximum-security prison in El Salvador, and promises by Trump to send American citizens there next. At least one of the deportees, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, was removed as a result of an “administrative error,” while advocates, attorneys and family members of many others say that they were falsely identified as members of a transnational gang because of tattoos honoring family members or their favorite soccer team.
The administration has also moved to target hundreds of lawful permanent residents and student visa holders for deportation, including Mahmoud Khalil, a graduate student who led pro-Palestinian campus demonstrations at Columbia University, and Rümeysa Öztürk, a Tufts University doctoral student who was detained after writing an op-ed in her student newspaper. Lawyers for Jeanette Vizguerra, a Colorado woman without legal status who was detained by federal authorities last month, have also alleged in court that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement retaliated against Vizguerra for her immigration advocacy work.
“We won’t tolerate people being picked up without any process and shipped to some other country with no recourse,” Weiser told the crowd to applause. “The First Amendment matters, because when you speak, and you speak your truth, you cannot be — in this country — retaliated against for speaking your truth.”
Weiser, serving his second term as attorney general after winning reelection in 2022, is running for Colorado governor in 2026. He faces a tough primary contest against U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet, who entered the race last week.
 Constitutional crisis?

Weiser and his fellow attorneys general heard stories from Coloradans personally impacted by the Trump administration’s actions, including federal workers, homelessness service providers and refugee support organizations.
Marya Washburn, a U.S. Forest Service employee, was part of a firefighting team that responded to the Alexander Mountain Fire in Colorado last summer. In February, she was among the 3,400 probationary employees at the agency to receive termination notices from the Trump administration, and although she was reinstated thanks to a court order, that order is set to end on Saturday.
“I’m shaking,” Washburn said as she read from her notes, citing concerns about cuts to firefighting personnel ahead of the 2025 fire season. “I’m angry.”
Trump’s mass layoffs, funding freezes and attempted shutdowns of congressionally-established agencies amount to an unprecedented expansion of executive power that runs contrary to longstanding separation-of-powers principles in the U.S. Constitution. Fears that his administration will defy adverse court rulings have also reached new heights in recent days, especially following its apparent inaction in the face of a 9-0 Supreme Court ruling last week stating the administration must “facilitate” the return of Abrego Garcia from El Salvador.
Brown, elected as Washington attorney general last year, said that the outcomes of some legal challenges to the administration — like the restoration of grant funding that Trump had attempted to freeze — had “for the most part” given him “confidence in our system.” But that confidence is now being tested.
“This is the first time — this week, in the days past — where I think we’re really getting to the precipice of a constitutional crisis,” he said. “And I don’t say that lightly.”
“I don’t have all the answers. I do not know what it means for a president to blatantly disregard what a court says. I don’t think we’re quite there yet,” Brown continued. “But we might be there tomorrow, or next week.”

On a positive note, North Carolina recently expanded Medicaid to provide health insurance coverage to over 600,000 working people within our state. These individuals would otherwise fall short of the income threshold for “regular” Medicaid but surpass the affordability of private health insurance.
However, the situation is dire as Congress has placed the health care of these families and numerous others in North Carolina at risk of being cut. The U.S. House of Representatives has set a target of reducing $880 billion from Medicaid, potentially leading to catastrophic consequences for the healthcare system and jeopardizing the well-being of patients and communities in North Carolina.
As obstetricians and gynecologists, we are deeply concerned about the potentially devastating impact these cuts would have on our patients. Many of them rely on Medicaid for their healthcare needs. These are the individuals and families who have only recently gained access to health insurance through North Carolina’s Medicaid expansion. For many, it marks their first time having health insurance in years.
Medicaid provides more than just appointments; it covers essential medications, vaccinations, prenatal ultrasounds, hospital stays, and surgeries. Without Medicaid, these patients would be unable to receive the necessary care to maintain their health, work, and care for their families.
It is undeniable that losing health insurance does not guarantee immunity from illness. It simply means that individuals without coverage cannot access the assistance they require when they are unwell. For individuals with diabetes, high-risk pregnancies, high blood pressure, or other health conditions, delaying care often results in more severe health complications. This can lead to emergency room visits, hospital admissions, and more costly medical treatments.











No one should have to fear losing their job, home, or even a loved one due to a single illness, all because they lack health insurance.



The patients we encounter who are covered under Medicaid expansion are working diligently to maintain their health, care for their children, and advance their lives. However, they cannot achieve these goals without access to health insurance. Therefore, Medicaid expansion holds immense significance.
No one should have to fear losing their job, home, or even a loved one due to a single illness, all because they lack health insurance. Regrettably, this scenario would unfold if we reverse our progress in Medicaid expansion at the state level.
Cutting Medicaid would have a particularly severe impact on women of childbearing age, many of whom rely on Medicaid coverage to meet their health needs. In fact, nearly half of all births in our state are now covered by Medicaid. North Carolina’s recent Medicaid expansion legislation provided healthcare for many women of childbearing age before they became pregnant. Healthy mothers give birth to healthy babies, so eliminating or reducing Medicaid coverage for these women before they conceive will result in an increase in high-risk births, babies with serious health complications, and subsequently higher medical costs.
Instead of resorting to emergency rooms, we want our patients to have consistent access to healthcare. Removing this coverage from the thousands of women will lead to a perilous rise in preventable health complications and deaths not only in North Carolina but also across the nation.
While Congress deliberates on these cuts, one thing is certain: if Medicaid is cut, not only will women and their families bear the brunt of the consequences, but so will North Carolina. It is not too late for us to collectively raise our voices in support of Medicaid and oppose these steep cuts. We urge our elected officials to push back against these proposed cuts. The lives of our fellow North Carolinians, including many mothers and babies, depend on it.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Pregnant-with-IV-Getty-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-17 12:22:33.420917
