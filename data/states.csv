Hot-tub-sized hole is the result of several hydrothermal explosions, scientists believe.
The post Yellowstone’s newest known thermal pool is small, ice blue and not yet named appeared first on WyoFile .","It appeared sometime during the frozen months of winter when snow blanketed Yellowstone National Park. With public access sharply limited, there were no witnesses to what were likely several explosions in the Norris Geyser Basin. But the eruptions left behind a new thermal pool.
Ice-blue in color, warm in temperature and a little larger than a backyard hot tub, the pool is the newest known feature to bubble up in Yellowstone’s simmering hydrothermal landscape. It has yet to be named. 
The U.S. Geological Survey unveiled the feature in a playful and lyrical press release last week. It was when park geologists first ventured back into Norris Basin in April following the winter that they detected a change, the press release states. 
They were conducting routine maintenance of temperature logging stations in Norris, according to the release, “when what to their wondering eyes did appear, but a blue water spring that was new since last year!” 
The pool sits in the Porcelain Basin area of Norris, just west of a patch of vegetation informally known as “Tree Island.” The crater-shaped pool is about 13 feet across, with temperatures around 109 degrees Fahrenheit. For comparison, the water that spews from Old Faithful is 170 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the National Park Service. 
The how
Yellowstone sits atop a massive caldera complex, and the geysers, mudpots, vents and other thermal features that draw millions of annual visitors are the surface expressions of the dynamic hydrothermal system underground.
Because it’s so dynamic, new events and features like the Norris pool are routine. Just last summer, a more dramatic incident occurred when an explosion in Biscuit Basin blew up a portion of the boardwalk as it sent a plume of boiling water and boulders into the air. Yellowstone National Park closed Biscuit Basin following the event, which sent terrified tourists running but didn’t injure anyone. The area remains closed.

When geologists identified the Norris pool as a new feature, they began sleuthing into how and when it emerged. 
Rocks coated in a light-gray sandy mud and measuring up to about 1 foot across surrounded the pool, according to the USGS. Those hints pointed to a dramatic origin. 
“With all of this evidence of quite a commotion, they knew they had found a hydrothermal explosion!” the press release gushes. 
Next, scientists sifted through high-resolution satellite imagery. These images indicated that no feature was present prior to Dec. 19, 2024. But by Jan. 6, a small depression had formed, and by Feb. 14, the pool could be seen fully developed. 
In addition, infrasound monitoring devices detected several low-level acoustic signals from the direction of the new feature during that time span. The most obvious was recorded on Christmas Day of 2024, with others on Jan. 15 and Feb. 11.
Because monitors did not detect associated seismic signals, however, scientists ruled out a significant explosion such as the one that rocked Biscuit Basin. 
“Rather, it appears that the feature formed via multiple small events that initially threw rocks and later threw silica mud a short distance, creating a small pit that became filled with silica-rich water,” the USGS concluded. 
Names, explosions
Anemone Geyser. Mushroom Pool. River Styx. Yellowstone’s many thermal features come in all kinds of names. So what and how will the new pool be named?

The United States Board of Geographic Names officially designates names of natural features within Yellowstone National Park using several guidelines. Thermal features are by convention not named after people — a tradition that dates to the 1870 Washburn Expedition. Generally, names that “capture the appearance, activity, location, or notable description of a place and that are unique, succinct, noncontroversial, and acceptable to local citizens are the gold standard,” according to USGS. 
Hydrothermal explosions and new features in the ever-changing thermal landscape of Yellowstone have long captured public curiosity.
In Norris Geyser Basin, that includes the 1989 eruption of Porkchop Geyser, which threw a mixture of heated water and rocks into the air. Porkchop Geyser erupted again in 2003, for the first time in many years. That event was believed to be related to several changes in Norris that year, including the appearance of fumaroles several-hundred feet in length and an uptick in geyser activity. 
More recently, an April 2024 explosion in the Porcelain Terrace area left a crater several feet across.

Nicole Mitchell, a Woodbury Democrat who was found guilty of first-degree burglary and possession of burglary tools Friday, will resign from the Minnesota Senate by Aug. 4, her attorney said in a statement Monday
The first-term senator will resign no later than Aug. 4 at 5 p.m., once she finishes four tasks: completes outstanding legislative projects, wraps up ongoing constituent services, transitions legislative staff and obtains health insurance for her son, according to the statement from Dane DeKrey, who helped defend Mitchell during the recent five-day trial.
The unusual resignation announcement means Mitchell will continue to represent her constituents for up to two weeks as a convicted felon. It also means that Democrats will lose their one-seat majority in the 34-33 Minnesota Senate until Gov. Tim Walz calls a special election to replace her.
Minnesota state Sen. Nicole Mitchell found guilty of felony burglary

Senate Minority Leader Mark Johnson, R-East Grand Forks, criticized Mitchell’s decision to remain in the Senate for up to two weeks.
“Sen. Mitchell was convicted of two felonies; she doesn’t get to give the Senate two weeks’ notice,” Johnson said in a statement.
A jury convicted Mitchell of felony burglary and possession of burglary tools Friday after a grueling trial that played out like a family drama.
The prosecution successfully argued that Mitchell intended to steal her late father’s possessions from her stepmother when she broke into her Detroit Lakes home on April 22, 2024. The state’s main evidence was that she told police as much during her arrest, and the jury saw the footage of her admissions from police officers’ body-worn cameras.
Mitchell unsuccessfully tried to convince the jury of nine men and three women that she was in the Detroit Lakes home to conduct a welfare check on her stepmother. Mitchell testified in her own defense, and told the jury that her stepmother was struggling with paranoia due to Alzheimer’s disease.
DeKrey on Friday told reporters that Mitchell will likely appeal the verdict.
Mitchell’s sentencing has not been scheduled, but because she has no criminal history her sentence will likely be far less than the maximum sentence of 20 years in prison for burglary and three years for burglary tools.
Senate Majority Leader Erin Murphy, DFL-St. Paul, called on Mitchell to resign for the first time immediately following the announcement of the jury’s verdict.
Mitchell in 2022 won her race by about 17 percentage points, and the district leans heavily  Democratic. Whether residents in the district — which includes Woodbury and Maplewood — want to elect another Democrat remains to be seen, given Mitchell’s crimes. Democrats have performed well in special elections during the first and now second terms of President Donald Trump.

(Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota Republican governor candidate Toby Doeden spent about $187,000 on broadcast television ads in the first month after his campaign announcement, one year before the state’s Republican primary election.
Candidates for statewide offices in South Dakota don’t face a state campaign finance disclosure deadline until January. But Federal Communications Commission rules require stations that use public airwaves to disclose details of political ad buys.
Those reports show Doeden purchased $186,925 of airtime across the state from May 28 through July 1 — the most recent reports available.

Doeden, an Aberdeen businessman, launched his campaign on May 28. His television ads highlight his business background and his support for President Donald Trump.
“While Congressman Johnson is busy coddling lobbyists and special interest groups in an effort to finance his campaign, my family and I are traveling to all four corners of our state listening to the concerns of the hardworking people who make South Dakota great,” Doeden told South Dakota Searchlight in a written statement. “Our campaign is citizen-led, focused forward, and ready to unite conservatives around a better and brighter future for South Dakota residents.”
Doeden is the owner of Aberdeen Chrysler Center, Redfield Ford and other retail businesses and real estate.
Other Republicans who have declared a candidacy for governor are U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson, of Mitchell, and state House Speaker Jon Hansen, of Dell Rapids. Another Republican frequently mentioned as a potential candidate is former lieutenant governor and current Gov. Larry Rhoden, who is serving the remainder of former Gov. Kristi Noem’s second term after she resigned to join the Trump Cabinet. The only declared Democratic candidate is Robert Arnold, a college student.
Johnson sent a written statement to Searchlight.
“While Toby has been busy spending a tremendous amount of money, I’ve focused my efforts on federal spending — cutting wasteful spending and securing the border,” Johnson said.
Johnson had spent $27,895 on broadcast television advertising through June 30, which his campaign ordered prior to his campaign announcement that day, according to FCC files.
Johnson doesn’t have to file a new state campaign finance report until January, but existing reports from his federal committee and affiliated political action committees show he’s accumulated over $6 million that could be used to aid his campaign.
Hansen has not yet spent any money on broadcast television advertising. He told Searchlight his campaign is being funded “the way it was meant to be: by grassroots conservative Republicans who care about their state and want a proven conservative fighter in the governor’s office.”
“The people of our state do not want big money or D.C. special interests ruling our state. Our state motto is ‘under God, the people rule,’ and I’m fighting to keep it that way,” Hansen said in a statement.

The early start to the governor’s race has the attention of political observers. Drey Samuelson worked as Democratic former U.S. Sen. Tim Johnson’s chief of staff for many years. He said Rhoden and Rep. Johnson will run in the “moderately conservative lane,” and Doeden and Hansen will “swim in the MAGA lane,” referencing the acronym for President Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan.
That means Doeden and Hansen are likely to split their supporters, said Samuelson, who added that Doeden’s early spending could pressure Hansen to drop out of the race.
“If I’m Toby Doeden, I’d offer to make Jon Hansen my lieutenant governor in exchange for him dropping out — if he took it, it’s a totally new race,” Samuelson said.
Hansen said he isn’t going anywhere.
“No amount of big money spending will change our campaign — we’ve never backed down from doing what’s right, and we’re not going to start now,” he said. “We’re all in.”
Brad “Murdoc” Jurgensen has decades of experience in broadcast media and advertising, working as president of HomeSlice Media in Rapid City. He also co-hosts a South Dakota politics podcast, “Dakota Town Hall.” He said Doeden’s TV ad spending is notable not for its amount, “but for its timing.”
“He’s trying to capitalize on being the only active candidate this far out from the 2026 primary,” Jurgensen said. “The goal appears to be boosting name recognition, fundraising and organizing at the grassroots level before competitors ramp up.”
Jurgensen said Doeden’s effort stands out in South Dakota, “where races have historically been shorter and cheaper. But this was already happening in other states.”",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/EM8A2790-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-21 15:45:12.025264

County election boards haven’t had any sworn members since late June, so some decisions that in previous years would have been made by now must wait until the next wave of board members officially takes office. 
Under the law Republicans passed last year giving the state Auditor the power to make election board appointments, terms for existing board members ended on June 24. The same law says the appointed members take the oath of office the Tuesday following the third Monday in July. That’s July 22. 
That left a gap during which there was no one empowered to make local policy decisions. 
In a brief interview before Monday’s board meeting, Chairman Francis DeLuca said there had been extensive behind-the-scenes discussions about the situation. 
He said it wasn’t a problem.
“If nobody complains about it, it’s not a problem,” he said. 
“Does anyone suffer? Is anyone harmed? It’s kind of like ’no harm, no foul.’”
The candidate filing deadline for municipal elections was last Friday. State law gives county boards the option of extending the candidate filling period as the deadline nears if not enough people sign up to run in nonpartisan races — if there are two candidates for three seats, for example. This year, there were no active local boards to make those decisions. 
The state Board on Monday unanimously approved a resolution allowing the new boards to add five more days for candidate filing where appropriate.
Counties with municipalities holding September elections have a July 29 deadline, one week after members are sworn in, to submit their early voting plans to that state Board. 
Counties with municipal elections in October or November have an Aug. 8 deadline for submitting their early voting plans. 
“As soon as our new county board members are sworn in, and when they take the oath, we will need them to hit the ground running both on the issue of whether there needs to be an extension for this five-day period, but also on the submission of their early voting plans for any September contest,” said Republican board member Stacy “Four” Eggers.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_4651-1024x516.jpg,,,2025-07-21 15:45:12.025264

(Photo courtesy of Save the Bay)A dispute between state coastal regulators and Quidnessett Country Club has finally landed in court, with the North Kingstown country club filing an appeal in Rhode Island Superior Court on July 9 — one day before it was due to turn in a restoration plan for its coastline.
The lawsuit against the Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management Council (CRMC) challenges the panel’s June 10 decision requiring Quidnessett to submit a plan to demolish a rock wall built during the winter of 2023 without permission along its shoreline and restore the coastal habitat back to its original state.
The country club was supposed to turn in a new restoration plan to coastal regulators by July 10 — the sixth iteration after five previous proposals were dubbed insufficient by agency staff. No plan was ever submitted. Quidnessett’s attorney, Jennifer Cervenka, who formerly chaired the CRMC, filed the appeal.
The CRMC is scheduled to discuss, and potentially take further enforcement action, against the country club, at its next meeting Tuesday night.
Debate over the 600-foot-long barrier, built in violation of state coastal restrictions for environmentally sensitive waters, has stretched out for nearly two years. In January, the CRMC denied an initial request by the country club to seek retroactive permission for the rock wall. But agreement over how to restore the shoreline, including the location and slope of the natural “toe of berm” barrier between the water’s edge and the adjacent golf course, continues to prove elusive.
The CRMC wants the toe of berm situated closer to land, following plans approved in 2013 for similar natural barrier protections. But Quidnessett has pushed for a barrier closer to the shoreline in order to avoid infringing on the 14th hole of its signature golf course.
Quidnessett’s seven-page complaint contends that the CRMC flouted its own rules by refusing to refer the case to its hearing officer, who by law is required to review “all contested enforcement proceedings and all contested administrative fines,” in a quasi-judicial hearing process.
“It was abundantly clear that Plaintiff and CRMC had a material contested issue with respect to the manner in which Plaintiff should cease the alleged activity outlined in the Cease and Desist Order and restore the Property,” the lawsuit states.
Jeffrey Willis, CRMC executive director, who is named in the lawsuit, told council members at the agency’s June 10 meeting that the case did not require a hearing officer’s review, since it was uncontested. 
The CRMC also denied Quidnessett’s request at the same meeting to let two expert witnesses speak about difficulties with the proposed restoration plan, according to the complaint.
Jed Thorp, policy director with Save the Bay, who has been watching the case closely, sided with Quidnessett on procedural matters.
“We agree with the Quidnessett that this case should have gone to a hearing officer,” Thorp said. “It’s again yet another example of the council not following their own rules and the end result is going to be the public ultimately is harmed because resolution on this matter is going to get further delayed.”
Precedents exist to overrule CRMC
The coastal regulatory agency has been forced to revisit several of its prior, controversial decisions after a state court ruled it ran afoul of its own rules. 
Among the most high-profile incidents previously: the proposed expansion of Champlin’s Marina on Block Island, which the council approved in 2020 following a series of closed-door negotiations between attorneys for the marina and the agency. The Rhode Island Supreme Court struck down the decision in 2022, siding with a state Superior Court judge who declared the council failed to meet requirements around public input and transparency in its decision making.
Also in 2022, a Providence County Superior Court judge tossed a four-year-old council decision rejecting a proposed oyster farm in Barrington on the grounds that the council failed to allow the applicant to cross-examine project opponents. Forced to revisit the application anew in 2023, the council approved the oyster farm proposed in upper Narragansett Bay.
Earlier this year, a state judge ordered the council to take a fresh look at a 2020 decision authorizing the expansion of a Jamestown boat yard. The CRMC has not to reconsider the case.  
Quidnessett’s complaint states that it has “exhausted all administrative remedies available to it,” and asks a state Superior Court judge to toss the June 10 enforcement order, or refer the case back to a hearing officer.
Robin Main, another attorney representing Quidnessett, declined to comment when reached by email Monday. Laura Dwyer, a CRMC spokesperson, also declined to comment.

(Alixel Cabrera/Utah News Dispatch)A Utah lawmaker was recently tapped to lead a national task force to help guide state-level artificial intelligence policies. 
State Rep. Doug Fiefia, R-Herriman, will co-chair the newly announced National Task Force on State AI Policy, according to an announcement Monday from the Future Caucus, a national, bipartisan nonprofit that supports young policymakers. 
The task force will push back on what the Future Caucus called “partisan gridlock” that can impact AI policy, and make sure state lawmakers have resources and tools before pushing through legislation. It will serve as a “national brain trust for responsible AI governance at the state level,” the nonprofit said in a news release. 
Utah’s latest data and social media laws could ‘change the world,’ Gov. Cox says

The task force will host public hearings and confidential briefings related to AI, and produce a policy memo that the caucus said will help guide AI policymaking around the country.
“This is a defining moment,” said Fiefia in a statement on Monday. “We can’t afford to let AI policy be divided by party or decided by default. As younger lawmakers, we have a unique opportunity to lead with balance and foresight.”
The announcement of the task force comes just weeks after the U.S. Senate stripped a proposed moratorium on state-based artificial intelligence laws from Republicans’ “big, beautiful bill,” following seven weeks of dwindling support for the idea.
GOP senators had initially pitched the 10-year ban on states’ AI laws under the argument that the federal government should be the only legislative body to regulate the technology. 
Fiefia, who previously worked for Google and is an outspoken proponent of policies related to data and AI, is fresh off his first legislative session in the Utah House. He passed HB418, which would direct tech and social media companies to embrace interoperability — it’s a first-of-its-kind bill that allows social media users to have greater control over their own data, while forcing companies to allow for increased data-sharing across different platforms. 
The bill, in a way, directs tech companies to view your personal data similar to how telecommunication companies view your phone number.
Fiefia will co-chair the task force with Monique Priestley, a Democrat state representative from Vermont who has also worked on AI legislation.

Gretchen Whitmer to call a special election for the vacant state 35th Senate District, Michigan Board of Education President Pamela Pugh made her bid for the seat official last week.
Pugh filed paperwork in May to form a campaign committee and on Thursday officially jumpstarted her presence in the race.
The seat remains vacant after current U.S. Rep. Kristen McDonald Rivet (D-Bay City) was elected to replace former longtime Congressman Dan Kildee in 2024. McDonald Rivet assumed office in Congress this year, leaving the state 35th Senate seat vacant for many months, much to the ire of several Republicans and some Democrats who have pleaded with Whitmer to call a special election for the seat.
In a campaign announcement, Pugh hinted at the vacancy by noting that the tri-cities of Saginaw, Midland and Bay City have gone “long enough without a voice in the state Senate, while our urgent issues continue to pile up.”
“We’re struggling just to put food on the table and to keep roofs over our heads,” Pugh said in a campaign video shared on social media. “Familes having to compete against big corporations and political donors. … I’ve fought for clean water in Flint, I’ve defended public education across this state.”

Pugh touted her background in chemical engineering and her doctorate in public health as strengths, and said she would continue to stand up for communities in the role of state senator with her motto of people-centered leadership.
“I’ve stood up to anyone and any policy that has written us off, and I haven’t backed down,” Pugh said.
At present, Pugh is the only Democrat to declare her candidacy for the district. On the Republican side, Chadwick Twillman is the lone Republican to file for the race. State Rep. Timmy Beson (R-Bay City) has said he intends to run for the seat, and state Rep. Bill Schuette (R-Midland) is said to be considering the race, as well.
Schuette would undoubtedly be a frontrunner in the race if he decides to jump in, and the Midland Daily News reported in March that Schuette had been playing double duty, of sorts, by working with constituents in the 35th Senate District from his post in the 95th House District. 
That work potentially gives him a degree of advantage in a race that has yet to be called.
Pressure is mounting, however, not just from Democratic and Republican officials, but some media outlets have chimed in and said it’s time to call the race – including the Detroit Free Press in an editorial published last week.

Campaign finance records show Landry also used his campaign in 2018 and 2019 to pay for his congressional fitness center membership, though the ethics board didn’t address those charges. 
His PAC didn’t heed the recent board’s February directive either. Just two months after receiving the letter, it paid for the gym dues again in April, according to a PAC campaign finance report. 
Landry might have anticipated a law change would soon make such expenses legal. State lawmakers approved legislation pushed by the governor a few weeks later in June that allowed his PAC to cover gym dues, regardless of the ethics board’s recent decision. 
The fitness center allowance is one of five recent changes to anti-corruption laws that undo ethics board decisions which may have blocked Landry from getting what he wanted. 
Stephen Gelé is the attorney who represented Landry’s PAC before the ethics board on the gym membership issue and received the letter from Reeves. At the time, Gelé was also helping to draft two bills that made dozens of changes to Louisiana ethics and campaign finance laws this year. 
One new statute permits elected officials to spend their campaign or PAC funds on membership dues at a “recreational facility” as long as going to it “facilitates interactions with constituents, colleagues, or former colleagues in an elective or deliberative body.”

Landry served in Congress from 2011-13 and would presumably run into former U.S. House colleagues at the fitness center. His gym membership, which cost the PAC $190 this year, easily meets the new legal requirement.

 Who benefits from the changes

Other alterations in the ethics legislation allow a few Landry’s appointees to stay in their jobs despite personal financial interests that would have been considered conflicts of interest under the old laws. 
Legislators enacted privacy protections for the governor’s staff and lifted restrictions on people who work on inaugurations for governors headed into their second term, as Landry will be if he runs for governor again. 
The governor declined to answer questions about the ethics and campaign finance overhaul sent to his spokesperson last month. Gelé agreed to an interview and said the changes were done for more than just the governor’s benefit. 
They reflect input from a number of people, including legislators, government workers, public policy watchdog groups and the ethics board staff, Gelé said. He pointed to state lawmakers who have complained about what they consider overly aggressive ethics board enforcement in recent years. 
“The bill addresses a broad range of campaign finance issues, including respecting the constitutional rights of freedom of speech and due process and inscribing well-established rules and practices into statute,” Gelé said. “The bill was not drafted to respond to criticisms of the current governor.” 
Yet the longest-serving ethics board member suggested changes in state law were made in direct response to board decisions unpopular with the governor and elected officials.  

“They’ve done exactly what I thought they were going to do. They were going to carve out a law that was going to accommodate and satisfy certain people,” La Koshia Roberts, a Lake Charles attorney who has served on the board since 2018, said at an ethics board meeting earlier this month. 

“It’s our job to apply the law which we’ve done for years now,” she said. “But apparently, until just recently, certain people felt like they didn’t have to follow it and we should not apply it.”

 Easier appointments for the governor

Two Landry appointees would have faced a difficult time taking their government jobs if an ethics overhaul, sponsored by Rep. Beau Beaullieu, R-New Iberia, hadn’t altered the state’s conflict of interest laws last month. 
Last year, the ethics board told Landry’s appointee to run the Louisiana Racing Commission he would not be able to renew the state licenses of racehorses he owns while serving in the job. 
The commission director, Stephen Landry, partially owns horses with licenses the commission must issue again in 2026. 
But Stephen Landry, who is not related to the governor, no longer has to be concerned with having to choose between owning a racehorse and his government position, which pays almost $100,000 annually. Beaullieu’s bill rewrote the ethics laws such that the executive director of the racing commission is not prohibited from being racehorse owner. 
Stephen Landry declined to comment on the matter when contacted by a reporter. 

Beallieu’s legislation also cleared that way for Sheraton New Orleans general manager Jim Cook to become the new CEO of the public Morial Convention Center in New Orleans, a position with a $357,000 salary in 2023, according to The Times-Picayune. 

Cook was barred from taking the job until late June because he was one of the governor’s appointees to the board that manages the convention center. Public employees are generally prohibited from accepting executive positions with state entities where they also serve on the oversight board. 
The latest exception to this rule seems specifically tailored to Cook. It allows a former Morial Convention Center commissioner to serve as the facility’s CEO, but only if they have “30 years of work experience in hotel and hospitality management” and have served as a board commissioner on Jan. 1, 2025. The exception also expires at the end of the year, so it likely can’t be used for anyone else. 

Cook did not respond to a request for comment left at his Sheraton office, but the convention center’s spokesman, Tim Hemphill, said the board is excited to see Cook in the role.

A third change was also made to codify an ethics board advisory opinion issued last year to Louisiana Economic Development Secretary Susan Bourgeois’ husband. 
At the time, Mace Bourgeois was co-owner and president of Fire & Safety Commodities, which had two state contracts to provide fire extinguishers and suppression services to public entities across Louisiana. Bourgeois wanted to know if his company could accept a one-year contract extension in 2024 after his wife became part of the Landry administration. 
His agreements with the state were open-ended, meaning there was no maximum or minimum amount the state had to spend with his company, according to a review of the contracts. The items it supplied were mostly fire extinguishers and ranged in price from $20 to nearly $670. 
The ethics board told him last year the contract extension did not violate ethics laws because Mace Bourgeois’ agreement wasn’t with his wife’s agency, and his financial terms hadn’t changed from the contract his company received before she took the job.

Beaullieu’s bill essentially placed language from the board’s advisory opinion directly into state law. Susan Bourgeois said the new statute also no longer applies to her family because her husband sold his interest in the business earlier this year. 

“While Secretary Bourgeois and her husband were completely unaware of this bill, these provisions no longer impact them, as of April 4, 2025, Mr. Bourgeois no longer owns the company,” said Kevin Litten, spokesman for the economic development agency. 
 New inauguration rules

A campaign finance overhaul sponsored by Rep. Mark Wright, R-Covington, also loosened restrictions on paid workers and people who volunteer for inaugurations and transition teams for governors headed into their second term in office. 

The new law states these people will not be considered “public servants” who face restrictions outlined in the Government Code of Ethics. Under the old law, people who volunteered for a sitting governor’s inauguration may have faced limits placed on public employees, such as what type of private compensation they receive. 
Concern from the Landry camp appears to stem, in part, from an ethics board advisory opinion issued in 1987. At the time, the board indicated that anyone who was part of a transition or inauguration committee for a sitting governor who wins a second term would be subjected to public employee restrictions.

 New privacy protections

The Beaullieu bill also removed requirements that statewide elected officials, higher education leaders, governor’s cabinet members and a handful of the governor’s executive staff provide their home addresses and spouse’s business address on financial disclosure forms available to the public online. 

The changes brought an end to a year-long debate over whether the ethics board could black out the home addresses of Landry staff members that are legally required on disclosure forms. 
The disclosures were initially written into state law as part of a larger anti-corruption effort during former Gov. Bobby Jindal’s administration. They were supposed to help hold public officials accountable and guard against public leaders making government decisions that enrich themselves or their families. 
The governor’s team had pressed the ethics board for months to obscure their home addresses, saying it was a security concern that put their families at risk. But two ethics board members were adamant that they couldn’t do so without breaking government transparency laws.
The new statute, backed by Landry, applies to far more people than what had been discussed over the past year. It removes the requirement to list home addresses and spouses’ business addresses for 33 state officials, beyond the original five in the governor’s office with concerns. 

 Public charges rare in ethics investigations

The Beaullieu and Wright bills make dozens of other changes, but it is not clear whether they also relate to decisions the ethics board made about Landry or other elected officials. 

Most ethics investigations are kept confidential, and the board only discloses its decisions in a few cases each year, such as when its members vote to bring public charges against someone. 
Of the 900 complaints the board received from 2020-23, the board investigated 244 and brought charges in just 14 cases. By contrast, the board issued 53 “warning letters” as a result of investigations during the same time period, according to a report from the ethics board late last year. 
As charges linger over Landry, Louisiana Legislature passes dramatic changes to ethics law

These “warning letters” can convey that the board believes the person being investigated committed wrongdoing, even if it has decided not to bring charges. They are kept confidential and allow the board and the accused to keep the matter from going public. 

The Illuminator has verified that Landry has received at least two such letters from the ethics board. 
The board’s guidance surrounding the congressional gym membership came in the form of a warning letter. The PAC staff and the ethics board are legally prohibited from talking about the matter publicly.
“There have been no public charges made for spending on a gym,” Gelé said in response to a question about the board’s decision on the health club.

Back in 2022, the ethics board sent one of Landry’s attorneys a “warning letter” concerning his use of campaign money to cover thousands of dollars on his car loan payment. The letter, which was also intended to be confidential, was first reported on by The Times-Picayune nearly three years ago and independently confirmed by the Illuminator earlier this year. 
Landry also faces public charges from the board over his failure to disclose flights he took on a campaign donor’s private plane to and from Hawaii for a professional conference while he was attorney general. 

First brought in 2023, the case is still lingering because the governor and ethics board haven’t reached an agreement on what Landry’s punishment should be.

John Coffman, a lawyer for the Consumers Council of Missouri, said rate increases are outpacing both inflation and wage growth.
“We believe that these increases are fueling inflation generally in the state because almost every other sector of the economy and virtually every household … has to pay these utility bills,” he said.
However, Ameren Missouri Director of Regulatory Affairs Steven Wills said the rate hike is vital for Ameren to recover lost profits.
“In order to have a financially sound utility that’s going to be there to provide service to our customers and be able to make the investments to keep that system reliable for customers, we have to … recover some of those higher costs,” Wills said.
Ameren officials said the new rates will help maintain system reliability, but advocates such as the Consumers Council, AARP, and Missouri Industrial Energy Consumers warn that added costs could be a strain on households. Residents should see the price hike starting Sept. 1.

(Eric Vryn/Getty Images)With hurricane and wildfire season well underway across much of the country, state and local emergency managers say they have little idea how much support the federal government will provide if disaster strikes. And the recent deadly floods in Texas have shown just how dire the need can be.
President Donald Trump has imposed severe cuts on the Federal Emergency Management Agency and denied some states’ requests for disaster recovery funds. FEMA also has failed to issue grants that many emergency managers rely on to fund their agencies — or to communicate its plans.
Wyoming’s Office of Homeland Security, which responds to disasters, relies on the feds for 92% of its money, said Director Lynn Budd. With that federal support in question, the state could face a precarious situation when the current grants expire at the end of September.
“If we don’t get this funding, what are we going to do?” Budd said. “You’re taking our capability away.”
Budd serves as president of the National Emergency Management Association, a nonprofit focused on public safety. She said state officials have been told by Trump that they’ve become too dependent on federal support.
Trump and officials in his administration have repeatedly talked of scaling back FEMA and pushing states to take the lead in disaster response. But in the wake of this month’s devastating flooding in Texas, administration officials have backed off Trump’s claims that he would eliminate the agency altogether.
Trump denies disaster aid, tells states to do more

White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson did not grant an interview request, but issued a statement calling on states to play a larger role in disaster response.
State and local officials say Trump has provided no clarity about which disasters will qualify for federal recovery funds. He has denied support for disasters that met the existing criteria. At the same time, FEMA has yet to issue federal grants that provide much of the funding for local emergency management agencies.
As local leaders in rural Saluda County, South Carolina, work to rebuild from last year’s Hurricane Helene, they say the recovery process has been slowed by Trump administration policies making it more difficult to access disaster aid. Worse, the county’s Emergency Management Division has no idea whether the feds will release the grant funding that makes up most of its budget.
“Are we going to see the help we need arriving?” said Josh Morton, director of Saluda County’s Emergency Management Division. “I don’t know. When we pick up the phone, is there gonna be anybody there to answer?”
Aside from the cuts to state funding, FEMA under Trump’s administration has lost about a quarter of its full-time staff, according to The New York Times. The agency also cut hundreds of contractors at call centers, The Times reported, resulting in thousands of missed calls in the days following the Texas flood.
Meanwhile, emergency managers say that Trump’s cuts to the National Weather Service could further impair their ability to respond to fast-moving disasters.
 The feds pull back

Trump and his administration have frequently said states should take on more responsibility for responding to disasters.
Brian Hughes, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said in an April statement to Stateline that the federal government would provide support only for “truly catastrophic disasters,” adding that states should have “an appetite to own the problem.”
Emergency management experts say it would be inefficient for all 50 states to stockpile the resources, staff and recovery funding to handle disasters on their own. Having a national agency that can deploy where it’s needed is far less wasteful.
“There’s no reason for every state to have all the resources that FEMA has,” said Michael Coen, who served as chief of staff at FEMA during the Obama and Biden administrations.
He noted that FEMA also plays a key coordinating role with other federal agencies during disasters.

– Michael Coen, chief of staff at FEMA during the Obama and Biden administrations


Morton, the Saluda County official, echoed that concern. He also serves as first vice president with the International Association of Emergency Managers, a nonprofit representing professionals in the field.
“It would be impossible for every county in the U.S. to maintain an adequate disaster recovery fund on their own,” he said. “Right now, we have a disaster fund at the federal level, and that money is able to be moved around to where it’s needed in the moment. That really is the best bang for the buck for the American people.”
But that federal support is no longer a sure thing. Morton said recovery funds for Hurricane Helene — which walloped states from Florida to North Carolina — have been slower to materialize than for previous disasters. FEMA officials have required more paperwork, he said, and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s insistence that she personally approve any expenditure over $100,000 has also slowed the process.
 Disaster declarations

In other parts of the country, state officials have petitioned Trump for disaster declarations, only to be rejected altogether. Washington state’s request for disaster aid following storms last November that caused at least $34 million in damages met all the “very clear criteria to qualify,” said Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson, but was denied by FEMA.
While Trump administration officials have proposed limiting the events that qualify for federal relief, they have yet to issue new criteria. State leaders say they have gotten no clarity from the feds about whether they can count on support.
“We really need some communication on what to expect,” said Budd, the Wyoming official. “If we know there’s no federal funding coming, that would be an awful situation, but at least we can plan for that.”
St. Louis waits for aid as FEMA response to Missouri disasters is slowest in 15 years

Some experts say states should prepare for disaster relief to be approved along partisan lines.
“We just have to be honest that this White House is going to spend more resources, time and effort on people who live in red states than in blue states,” said Juliette Kayyem, faculty chair of the Homeland Security Project at Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government and a former Obama administration official.
“It’s a hard thing for me to admit, and I don’t know how to solve it, but if you look at his reaction to [the Los Angeles wildfires in] California as compared to Texas, it’s very clear.”
Since February, Trump has denied six of the 10 major-disaster requests he has received from Democratic governors, according to an analysis from Seattle National Public Radio affiliate KUOW. He has approved 14 of 15 requests he has received from Republican governors during that same period.
Missouri has requested four disaster declarations this year and Trump approved all, but not with out extensive delays. The declaration for the May 16 St. Louis tornado came 15 days after Kehoe made the request. The declaration for April 29 storms in Scott County took 20 days from the day of the request. That makes the St. Louis request the fastest of four for Missouri this year, but it took longer than 10 of 20 disasters declared from 2010 to 2024.
Meanwhile, FEMA has yet to release the preparedness grants that many state and local governments depend on to fund their emergency management agencies and conduct projects to prepare for disasters. Those grants were set to be issued in May under a spending bill passed by Congress.
Trump wants states to handle disasters without FEMA. They say they can’t

Coen, the former FEMA official, noted that the Texas Division of Emergency Management received nearly $20 million in federal funding last year to support day-to-day operations.
“Texas hasn’t been able to apply for that grant this year,” he said. “If they never get that grant, are they going to have to lay off staff or cancel contracts?”
FEMA has also revoked another set of grants, totaling $3.6 billion, that was intended to help communities prepare their infrastructure to withstand disasters.
 Weather agency cuts

Amid the uncertainty at FEMA, emergency managers are also alarmed by Trump’s cuts to the National Weather Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. NOAA has lost nearly 2,000 employees, The New York Times reported, 600 of whom worked for the weather service.
The cuts have left many forecasting offices understaffed, with some no longer able to operate overnight.
“The National Weather Service plays as big of a role in protecting lives as anyone else in government,” said Morton, the Saluda County official. “It would be very hard for emergency managers to do our jobs effectively without the National Weather Service. But if these cuts keep coming, you’re going to start to see deficiencies.”
Budd, the Wyoming official, said the weather agency is crucial during wildfires.
“That’s how we know when it’s time to alert our communities or evacuate an area,” she said. “You can put firefighters’ lives on the line very quickly if they don’t have notification that those winds are changing.”
She added that Trump’s cuts to the U.S. Forest Service and other land management agencies have added another layer of concern as wildfires begin cropping up throughout the West. With the loss of federal support, Budd said officials are likely to become increasingly reliant on state-to-state resource-sharing compacts that allow them to call on one another during emergency situations.

Across the country, state and local crime labs are drowning in evidence.
From rape kits to drug samples to vials of blood, delays in forensic testing are stalling prosecutions, stretching court calendars and forcing impossible choices about what gets tested — and what doesn’t.
Now, as the need for forensic testing grows, state and local crime labs may face steep federal funding cuts that could further delay justice for victims, derail criminal investigations and overwhelm already backlogged systems.

Two key federal grant programs that support state and local forensic labs are at risk: One faces a major cut, while the other is funded below its authorized cap despite growing demand.
The proposed cuts have alarmed forensic experts and crime lab directors who say some labs rely heavily on these federal grants to keep up with mounting caseloads.
“That would have dire consequences on a lot of crime laboratories who depend on those funds for maintaining operations,” said Scott Hummel, the president of the American Society of Crime Laboratory Directors, a national nonprofit professional organization.
“If you limit those resources even further, there will be backlogs,” said Hummel, who also works as a quality assurance manager at the Kansas City Police Crime Laboratory in Missouri. “Those backlogs just keep growing and growing, and labs are forced to make difficult decisions on how they prioritize their casework.”

When labs fall behind

Crime labs are often invisible to the public but essential to criminal investigations. They test DNA, analyze drug samples, match ballistics and verify evidence in everything from rape cases to gun homicides. The evidence may lead to arrests, but it’s also critical in court, shaping outcomes for victims, defendants, prosecutors and defense attorneys alike.
But years of underinvestment have left many labs without enough scientists, equipment and funding to keep up. As forensic technology has advanced — particularly in digital evidence and DNA testing — demand also has risen sharply.

“As technology gets better, there’s an expectation, I think, that labs can do more than they have the capacity for,” Hummel said.
At the same time, new state laws and testing mandates are increasing pressure on already strained labs. In some states, changes in drug laws — such as renewed crackdowns on marijuana or stricter DUI thresholds — have led to a surge in requests for toxicology and drug analysis. Other states have expanded mandatory evidence testing requirements, often without providing additional funding.
Some lab directors who spoke with Stateline said that even well-intentioned policies can create bottlenecks when resources don’t keep pace with demand.
“It’s important for policymakers to realize that the criminal justice system is demanding more from us, and so we need the resources to keep up with the increased demand,” said James Carroll, the crime laboratory director with the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department.
Low pay is also a challenge, with some analysts opting for private-sector jobs that offer higher salaries and better benefits. Training new analysts can take months or even years, making it difficult to quickly fill critical positions and retain experienced staff.
“We have to be absolutely perfect, and if you have something that isn’t perfect, that can be a career ruiner,” said Mike Lyttle, the assistant director of the forensic services division at the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation. “That is a lot of pressure.”
But that pressure can come at a cost — especially when analysts bear the brunt of it.
Lab directors and managers who spoke with Stateline said that overworking staff is not only inappropriate, but also risky. It can lead to quality issues, including “dry labbing,” or fabricated results, which could call hundreds or even thousands of cases into question.
As delays mount across the country, some state and local governments are rethinking how their crime labs are structured and funded.

In Colorado, officials are dealing with the aftermath of a major DNA testing scandal involving state-run labs, and several new laws have been enacted to establish a review board and address backlogs. Lawmakers in Rhode Island considered a bill earlier this year that would have shifted oversight of its state crime lab to the state attorney general’s office, but the bill was tabled for further study.
In Shelby County, Tennessee, a new $1.5 million investment will go toward the region’s first local lab focused on rapid DNA analysis, digital forensics and weapons ballistics. Memphis City Council officials also are working on funding at least two new positions at a state laboratory to prioritize cases from the Memphis area.

Hard choices

The national push to test sexual assault kits has helped bring attention to forensic evidence backlogs. But in some labs, it has also forced tough choices about what gets tested first.
In Oregon, for example, Brian Medlock, the director of the state police forensic science division, announced in January that the state lab had halted DNA analysis for all property crime evidence. Testing won’t resume until the sexual assault kit backlog is cleared — a goal the agency doesn’t expect to meet until the end of the year. As of June, 474 sexual assault kits were still awaiting testing, according to the state’s dashboard.
Like Oregon, the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation also is deprioritizing nonviolent cases as it works through its rape kit backlog. The agency currently has six forensic biology analysts in training across the state, limiting how many cases it can process, according to Lyttle.
The goal is to eventually process lower-priority cases, he said, but the current focus remains on sexual assault kits. Still, Lyttle acknowledged that delaying the analysis of evidence in nonviolent cases can be a missed opportunity. Uploading DNA profiles from those cases to the national database, CODIS, could help identify offenders earlier — potentially before they go on to commit more serious crimes.
“You may be losing people early because you’re deprioritizing those nonviolent cases and not getting them identified as quickly as you could,” he said. “Every case is important.”

Looming cuts

Trump has proposed slashing one major forensic science grant program and holding funding flat for another — a combination that some officials fear could worsen evidence backlogs amid rising demand.

The Paul Coverdell Forensic Science Improvement Grants Program, which aims to help labs replace aging equipment, train staff and reduce case backlogs, would be cut by 71% under President Donald Trump’s proposed fiscal year 2026 budget — from $35 million to $10 million.
Another, the Debbie Smith DNA Backlog Grant Program, would receive $120 million under the proposal — below the $151 million cap authorized by Congress in 2023. While Congress can approve up to that amount, it often allocates less: $130 million in fiscal year 2023, and $120 million in both fiscal years 2024 and 2025.
The program helps labs process backlogged evidence, including sexual assault kits, and supports the expansion of the national DNA database, CODIS.
These proposals are part of the administration’s annual discretionary budget request; Congress must finalize federal agency yearly spending by Sept. 30. Presidential budget proposals are often reshaped by Congress, but Trump’s spending plans have found strong backing among Republicans on Capitol Hill. With the GOP holding majorities in both chambers, proposals to cut or limit funding for forensic science programs may be more likely to advance.

A state in crisis and a model for change

The Colorado Bureau of Investigation’s crime labs are under intense scrutiny following a major DNA testing scandal and widespread staffing shortages that have slowed down forensic work across the board. The bureau is facing backlogs in every discipline or type of case, according to Lance Allen, a deputy director who oversees forensic services.
Much of the current crisis stems from the case of Yvonne “Missy” Woods, a former DNA scientist now facing more than 100 criminal charges for allegedly manipulating DNA results over her 30-year career. Her alleged misconduct, combined with long-standing understaffing issues, has led to severe delays.
As of June, the average turnaround time for processing sexual assault kits in Colorado was 570 days, or about 1 1/2 years, with more than 1,200 kits still awaiting testing, according to the state’s dashboard. The agency’s goal is to reduce that timeline to 90 days.
“We are not satisfied with this turnaround time either, and this backlog is also unacceptable to us, and we know we have to do better,” Allen told Stateline.

But the backlog isn’t limited to sexual assault cases. Blood alcohol testing has also slowed dramatically, according to defense attorney Matthew Haltzman, who said he has handled cases in which results took five to six months to come back.
In that time, he said, even clients who were ultimately found not to be intoxicated were forced to navigate the court system — attending hearings, undergoing weekly drug and alcohol testing and complying with pretrial supervision.
“It’s just a lose-lose for everybody in the legal process, but more so for the accused than anyone else,” Haltzman said. “It’s a massive deprivation of liberty.”
The current turnaround time for all toxicology tests is 99 days, or just over three months, according to Vanessa Beall, the Colorado bureau’s toxicology program manager. About 80% of cases are completed within that time frame or less, and all toxicology tests include blood alcohol and drug analysis.
With additional toxicologists, the bureau is already meeting its 2025 goal and aims to reduce that turnaround time to 70 days by the end of 2026.
This year, the bureau and state lawmakers have rolled out measures aimed at restoring trust in the system. Those efforts include sending more than 1,000 rape kits to private labs to reduce turnaround times, expanding staff training programs and establishing a review board within the state attorney general’s office to improve oversight.
Lawmakers also approved $3 million to support outsourcing and lab operations, along with a separate law requiring the reporting of misconduct within Colorado’s state-run forensic laboratories.
Meanwhile, Connecticut is drawing national attention for its consistent performance and growing capabilities.
Once plagued by serious issues — including a suspended accreditation in 2011 that disrupted criminal proceedings — Connecticut’s forensic lab has steadily strengthened its operations. This year, it earned a perfect accreditation score for the third year in a row.
Following its accreditation loss, the lab faced a backlog of 12,000 cases, and by 2013, turnaround times stretched up to 2 1/2 years. Today, the average turnaround is just 20 days across all disciplines.
DNA cases, including those involving sexual assault evidence, are typically processed in about 27 days. Firearms cases take about 35 days, and computer crimes about 60, according to Guy Vallaro, the director of the Connecticut Division of Scientific Services.
He credits much of the lab’s progress to its team of scientists and staff, who he says are deeply committed to both accuracy and improvement.
“When you have a good staff, you can do incredible things,” Vallaro said.

(Getty Images) (This image cannot be republished without a Getty subscription.)OKLAHOMA CITY — Fertility rates in Oklahoma and around the nation are on a “decades long downward trend” which has the potential to create state budget shortfalls, according to a report from Pew Charitable Trusts. 
The average fertility rate per 1,000 women in Oklahoma dropped by 12.2% since 2011 and is at 59.1 births in 2023, the report found. The national average fell by 10.6% in the same time frame and is at a record low of 54.5 births per 1,000 women. 
In a 17-state region, that also includes Washington D.C., Oklahoma had the second largest drop in its fertility rate. 
Factors contributing to the decline include fewer teen pregnancies, women having children later in life and less births following economic recessions, according to the report.
No states saw growth in fertility rates. 
“Historically, fertility rates have dipped during economic downturns but tended to recover as conditions improved,” according to the report. “… That pattern broke after the 2007-09 Great Recession when fertility rates fell and never bounced back. The downward trend instead intensified in 2020 as the start of the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to a record annual drop nationwide.” 
Lower fertility rates may lead to short-term economic benefits in areas like health care and education, but could create broader, long-term issues as states generate less revenue through tax collection because of fewer births, according to the report. 
David Hamby, spokesperson for the Oklahoma Policy Institute, a nonpartisan Tulsa-based think tank, said the overall environment for raising children in Oklahoma could be a factor in these declines. 
Oklahoma ranked 46th in the nation for overall child well-being in the annual Kids Count report from the Annie E. Casey Foundation which ranks all 50 states in four categories. The state ranked in the bottom 10 for children’s health, economic well-being, education and family and community. 
“I think anyone who is looking at having children or raising children in Oklahoma will see that environment and cause them to second guess that decision to either delay or not have children at all,” Hamby said. 
The Pew report found that teen pregnancy rates have been falling since the 1990s, which was attributed to greater education and use of contraceptives as well as more abstinent teens. 
Oklahoma’s teen pregnancy rate has fallen, according to this year’s Kids Count report, but is still higher than the national average. 
An average of 21 Oklahoma teens, aged 15 to 19, per 1,000 gave birth in 2023, down from 27 in 2019. Nationally that rate was at an average of 13 teen births in 2023. 
People are also choosing to start families later in life, the Pew analysis found. 
Births to Oklahoma mothers younger than 24 have all fallen since 2007, but the share of births from mothers ages 25 and up have grown. 
“We have folks getting older, but we’re having folks who are not having children,” Hamby said. “So the population is, as a whole, getting older.”
This means there will be a greater demand on state dollars for elder services, without continued investments in those services from the Legislature, he said. 
The strain on the Oklahoma state budget could be exacerbated by a lack of federal investments in shared programs and services, Hamby said, and states will eventually have to step in to fill the gaps in services. 
“If state lawmakers continue to keep revenue flat we’re going to have more demands on the same amount of dollars just to keep at the level that we are at,” he said. “And that math doesn’t math very well for the long term.”
There will be significant changes to Oklahoma’s funding landscape, Hamby said, and the population change is “only a precursor” to what’s coming.

Michael Guest of Mississippi is campaigning to lead the House Homeland Security Committee, according to the congressional news website Punchbowl News. 
Guest, a Republican who has represented the state’s 3rd Congressional District since 2019, is one of four GOP members competing to lead the influential committee, according to the news outlet. 
The House Republican Steering Committee will meet on Monday night to pick the next Homeland Security Committee. 
The committee chairmanship opened up because the committee’s previous chairman, U.S. Rep. Mark Green of Tennessee, announced he would resign from Congress as soon as the House passed President Donald Trump’s latest spending bill, which he signed into law on July 4. 
“I look forward to the possible opportunity to work alongside President Trump as Chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security,” Guest told Mississippi Today in a statement. “As the former Vice Chairman of the Committee and the current Chairman of the Subcommittee on Border Security and Enforcement, I have unique leadership experience to bring to this role.”
The Mississippi Republican currently leads the House Ethics Committee. During his time chairing the bipartisan committee, he has successfully authored and pushed for a resolution to expel former New York Congressman George Santos from the House chamber. 
He also led the Ethics Committee during its investigation and subsequent report into the alleged misconduct of former U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida. Gaetz resigned from Congress before the committee’s work concluded on Gaetz, which meant the committee no longer had jurisdiction to investigate the Florida Republican.  
President Donald Trump in 2024 nominated Gaetz to become attorney general, which prompted bipartisan pressure for the committee to release its report on the Florida congressman, even though Gaetz was no longer a member of Congress. Trump eventually withdrew Gaetz’s nomination. 
The committee eventually voted to release the report, but Guest objected to the decision and wrote that it deviated from the committee’s longstanding traditions.  
Should Guest become the new House Homeland Security Chairman, it would mean two Mississippians would become the top party leaders on the committee. U.S. Rep. Bennie Thompson is currently the top Democrat on the committee. 
Thompson served as chairman of the committee from 2007 to 2011, and from 2019 to 2023.
Before Guest became a member of Congress, he was a district attorney in Madison and Rankin counties.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/07030824/Guest2.jpg,,,2025-07-21 14:56:18.279567

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)Congress set aside $50 billion for rural hospitals and medical providers to allay fears over the billions more in historic cuts to federal health care spending that President Donald Trump signed into law on Independence Day.
But is that bandage big enough to save struggling rural hospitals?
“I have more questions than I have answers,” said Alan Morgan, CEO of the National Rural Health Association, a nonprofit policy group. “No one has those answers yet.”
Morgan noted that the new money for rural health, to be spent over five years, is far less than the $155 billion in rural Medicaid spending cuts over 10 years, as estimated by KFF, a nonprofit health policy and research group.
Experts, hospital leaders and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle fear that Trump’s signature legislation will particularly gut rural hospitals and clinics, which see an outsize share of patients who are insured through Medicaid, the federal-state public health insurance for people with low incomes. The new law slashes more than $1 trillion from Medicaid over the next 10 years to help pay for tax cuts that disproportionately benefit the wealthy.
The $50 billion addition was an effort by Republican leaders in Congress to win the votes of colleagues within their party who initially balked at supporting such steep cuts to Medicaid and other health services.
In the U.S. Senate, the rural program helped secure the vote of Alaska moderate Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who expressed concern about the law’s impact on health care in her state. About 1 in 3 Alaskans are insured through Medicaid.
Jared Kosin, the president and CEO of the Alaska Hospital & Healthcare Association, said he’s deeply frustrated with the new law’s gutting of Medicaid funding, which he thinks will wreak lasting damage on Alaskans. And Republicans sidestepped potential solutions by just throwing money into a program, he said.
“It’s frustrating in the public realm when decisions like this are made fast and, frankly, carelessly,” he said.
“The consequences are going to fall on us, not them.”
More than half of the law’s cuts to funding in rural areas are concentrated in 12 states with large rural populations that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act to cover more people, according to KFF: Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania and Virginia.
Some GOP lawmakers in Congress have heralded the $50 billion rural program as a health care victory. But it’s still unclear which hospitals, clinics and other providers would receive money and how much.
 How it works

The Rural Health Transformation Program will dole out $10 billion annually from fiscal years 2026 through 2030.
States must apply for their funding by the end of this year, submitting a detailed plan on how it would be used.
The law outlines some ways that states can use the money, according to an analysis of the legislation from the Bipartisan Policy Center:

Making payments to rural hospitals to help them maintain essential services such as emergency room care or labor and delivery.
Recruiting and training rural doctors, nurses and other health workers.
Bolstering emergency medical services such as ambulances and EMTs.
Using new technologies, including telehealth.
Providing opioid use disorder treatment and mental health services.
Improving preventive care and chronic disease management.

Half of the $10 billion each year will be distributed evenly across states that have applied for it. The other half can be distributed by the administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services — currently Dr. Mehmet Oz — at his discretion, based on a state’s rural population and rural health facilities.
Although the program doesn’t replace the amount states are likely to lose, Morgan said it’s still an opportunity to rethink how rural health care is funded. He’d like to see states given flexibility in how they’re able to use the funds, and he hopes they focus on keeping rural communities healthy through preventive care while still helping hospitals keep their doors open.
“If done correctly, it could really change the future course for rural America,” Morgan said. “That is such a tough ask, though.”
 Hardest hit

Kentucky could take the biggest hit from the new law’s reduction in rural Medicaid funding, losing an estimated $12 billion over 10 years, according to a KFF analysis.
The state’s Medicaid department is still waiting for additional federal guidance to understand how the state’s program will be affected, Kendra Steele, spokesperson with the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services, told Stateline in a statement.
“Over 1.4 million Kentuckians rely on Medicaid — including half of all children in our state, seniors and more vulnerable populations — and the passage of legislation on the federal level will have serious impacts for those individuals, rural health care and hospitals and local economies,” she wrote.
Even with the new program, states across the country will have to reevaluate their budgets in light of the cuts, said Hemi Tewarson, executive director at the National Academy for State Health Policy, a nonpartisan group that supports states in developing health care policies.
“Every region is slightly different and there’s not a one-size-fits-all approach,” she said. “Hospital ownership varies [as well as] the types of services that are critical for the community where they’re located. They have to think about new ways to provide those services in a context with fewer resources.”
About 44% of rural hospitals are operating in the red, according to a KFF analysis of Rand Hospital Data, a higher share than the 35% of hospitals in urban areas.
 ‘Rural at heart’

Prior to the bill’s passage, Oz attempted to reassure U.S. House Republicans that their districts could get money from the program even if they weren’t specifically rural, Politico reported earlier this month.
Pennsylvania Republican U.S. Rep. Rob Bresnahan said money would begin flowing to his district as early as the beginning of next year, telling the Wilkes-Barre Times Leader earlier this month that he met with Trump, Oz and others to secure pledges that hospitals in his district could access the fund. He represents the northeastern corner of Pennsylvania, which includes suburban and rural areas, as well as the cities of Scranton and Wilkes-Barre.

Though the legislation includes guidelines on which facilities or areas qualify as “rural,” Morgan, of the National Rural Health Association, expects a mad dash from lawmakers and providers to claim rural status in order to get a piece of the funding.

“That’s going to be a huge issue — defining who’s rural,” Morgan said. “We’re all rural at heart when it comes to money.”

U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley told KMOV-TV on Friday that President Donald Trump’s administration should “release everything they can.”
“Whatever is not under court order and sealed,” he said. “And personally, I think they ought to go to court and ask the court to unseal everything possible. That’s the right course here. Let’s have transparency and get everything out in the public.”
Republican U.S. Rep. Eric Burlison said last week that the American people are “sick and tired of being lied to by their government or the government holding these secrets that they deserve to know the truth on.”
He noted that Trump promised a release of files pertaining to Epstein during his successful campaign last year. He told Missourinet he would support a special prosecutor or congressional investigation into the Epstein files. 
In a statement released on social media, Republican U.S. Rep. Mark Alford called the ordeal an “unfortunate sideshow” that should not be allowed to “tarnish the legacy of the greatest president of my lifetime.” 
He urged U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi to release any files in the Department of Justice’s possession, “including the underlying evidence that led to the memo stating that a so-called ‘client list’ does not exist.”
Not everyone is so eager to push Trump to release more information about Epstein. 
U.S. Sen. Eric Schmitt said in January that the DOJ should open up all its files, saying at the time: “Hell yeah. Open it up. Release the Epstein files… Let’s get some answers.”
But in an interview with Politico last week, Schmitt was more reserved when asked if the administration should release more information about Epstein. 
“I don’t know what they have,” Schmitt said. “I don’t know what they don’t have. When you’re making a charging decision, obviously you’re basing it on the information that’s in front of you. It’s just hard for me to opine on it.”
Schmitt’s change of tone matches the president, who over the years has stoked conspiracies about Epstein and told Fox News during the 2024 campaign that he would declassify files related to the investigation. 
Epstein was known for socializing with politicians and celebrities. That includes Trump, who was close to Epstein throughout the 1990s but reportedly had a falling out with him over a real estate deal in 2004. 
“I’ve known Jeff for 15 years. Terrific guy,” Mr. Trump told New York magazine in 2002. “He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it — Jeffrey enjoys his social life.”
Trump has never been accused of wrongdoing in connection with the Epstein case, and has said he had “no idea” that Epstein was abusing young women. 
Epstein pleaded guilty to a felony prostitution charge in 2008 after federal prosecutors agreed not to charge him with sex trafficking of minors. He served 13 months in jail and was required to register as a sex offender. 
In 2019, the Justice Department charged Epstein with sex trafficking minors, including sexually exploiting and abusing dozens of girls in New York and Florida between 2002 and 2005. He died by hanging himself in a Manhattan jail cell, an autopsy concluded. 
Earlier this year, Bondi told Fox News that Epstein’s client list was “sitting on my desk right now to review.” But months later, the Trump administration reversed course, releasing a memo that concluded there was “no incriminating client list” or evidence that Epstein blackmailed prominent people.
The memo sparked a huge backlash among Trump’s MAGA base, who saw the move as a betrayal. It also inspired a bipartisan push to force the administration to act, most notably a non-binding resolution sponsored by Republican U.S. Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Democratic U.S. Rep. Ro Khanna of California.
In response to the criticism, Trump recently called for a federal court to unseal grand jury transcripts in Epstein’s sex trafficking case — far short of the demands from his MAGA supporters to release all investigative records.
On Friday, Trump filed a $10 billion lawsuit against The Wall Street Journal and media mogul Rupert Murdoch after the newspaper published a story reporting on his alleged ties to Epstein.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2225550781.jpg,,,2025-07-21 14:56:18.279567

(Joe Cook/Georgia Rivers)Environmentalists are still celebrating a conservation group’s announcement last month that it plans to purchase thousands of acres of land targeted for mining near the Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge.
But they read the win, they say, not as a moment to pop the champagne, but a call to action.
Mining interests are still eyeing property near the refuge, they say, and to preserve additional acreage, they need to build on their advocacy efforts, including persuading environmental groups to buy mineral rights in other areas attractive to mining businesses and highlighting easements for purchase along mineral-rich Trail Ridge.
And they say they need to continue to press Georgia leaders to enact the legal protections for the Okefenokee that have eluded them for years at the state Capitol. Lawmakers will return to Atlanta for a new legislative session in January.
“We can’t rest on our laurels,” said Brian Foster, a spokesman for Georgia Conservancy, one of the environmental groups leading the charge. “There is still a lot of work to be done.”
There’s a reason for their urgency, Georgia environmentalists said.
In the late 1990s, the environmental community thought the Okefenokee was safe from mining after chemical giant DuPont was persuaded to donate thousands of acres to The Conservation Fund because of public opposition to DuPont’s mining plans.
Three decades later, Alabama-based Twin Pines Minerals, which has owned land along Trial Ridge since 2019, appeared close this year to realizing its plans to mine the area for titanium dioxide, a whitening agent in toothpaste, paint, sunscreen, and other products.
But The Conservation Fund, a nonprofit based in Arlington, Virginia, stepped in again, announcing late last month that it would spend almost $60 million to purchase close to 8,000 acres owned by Twin Pines.
Environmentalists were elated, but quickly turned their attention to protecting land that could still be purchased for mining.
“If there is one thing that is abundantly clear to us is that the past is prologue when it comes to the Okefenokee,” said Christian Hunt, chairman of the Okefenokee Protection Alliance.
“Roughly 25 years ago we were pretty much in the same position we’re in today,” said Hunt, who also is director of national wildlife refuges and parks program for Defenders of Wildlife. “It’s very clear to everybody involved at this stage that goodwill alone is not going to save the swamp and we need to secure durable protections.”
Petition campaign
Environment Georgia launched a campaign to collect 10,000 signatures calling on Gov. Brian Kemp to pursue permanent protections for the Okefenokee just days after The Conservation Fund’s announcement. The organization hopes to meet its goal by the end of the summer.
“We know that there are mineral rights that are still in the hands of people who could and would like to use them, so we would like to make sure that we find a permanent protection that ensures that there is not another mine proposed,” Environment Georgia Director Jennette Gayer said.
“Our hope is that we do not find ourselves in the same position a couple of decades from now,” she said.
Kim Bednarek, executive director of Okefenokee Swamp Park and Adventures, said environmentalists are not the only ones concerned about the refuge. It has a direct impact on the economies of Charlton, Ware, and Clinch counties in Georgia, which are home to the majority of the Okefenokee’s shallow, 438,000-acre, peat-filled wetland along the Georgia-Florida border.
A healthy Okefenokee promotes agritourism in the three small south Georgia counties, which have a combined population of about 54,000 people, as well as creating jobs and encouraging workforce development, she said.
In addition, the Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge has been nominated to be a UNESCO World Heritage Site, which could further boost its visitation numbers, Bednarek said. A decision on the nomination is expected next year.
More than 800,000 people visit the Okefenokee annually, according to Okefenokee Swamp Park and Adventures. Visitors spend about $91.5 million in Ware, Charlton, and Clinch counties.
‘Huge opportunity’
“It’s really a huge opportunity for the region and the gateway communities around the Okefenokee to benefit from increased tourism and educational and research activities,” Bednarek said. “We want to see more sustained attention and investment in the communities and the people around the Okefenokee. If the people are benefitting from a conserved landscape, then they’ll want to make sure the landscape stays preserved.”
Megan Huynh, senior attorney and wetlands and coasts program leader for the Southern Environmental Law Center, echoed Bednarek.
“Now that the mine is gone, there’s a responsibility to support opportunities for those communities that aren’t at odds with the health of the Okefenokee,” she said.
Mike Worley, president and CEO of the Georgia Wildlife Federation, said the goal is to use every available tool to ensure the future of the Okefenokee.
“The main thing right now is to celebrate the victory that we’ve had and be prepared to finish the job,” he said.

So she pounced on the opportunity to get him vaccinated after learning that a mobile clinic would be visiting her neighborhood.

(Arielle Zionts/KFF Health News)
“I was definitely concerned about the epidemic and the measles,” Palmier, a member of the Oglala Sioux Tribe, said at the June event. “I wanted to do my part.”
So did her son, Makaito Cuny.
“I’m not going to be scared,” the 5-year-old announced as he walked onto the bus containing the clinic and hopped into an exam chair.
Makaito sat still as a nurse gave him the shot in his arm. “I did it!” he said while smiling at his mother. The vaccine clinic was hosted by the Great Plains Tribal Leaders’ Health Board, which serves tribes across Iowa, Nebraska, and the Dakotas.
It’s one way Native American tribes and organizations are responding to low measles vaccination rates and patients’ difficulties accessing health care as the disease spreads nationally.
Meghan O’Connell, the board’s chief public health officer, said it is also working with tribes that want to host vaccine clinics.
Elsewhere, tribal health organizations have launched social media campaigns, are making sure health providers are vaccinated and are reaching out to the parents of unvaccinated children.
This spring, Project ECHO at the University of New Mexico hosted an online video series about measles aimed at health care professionals and organizations that serve Native American communities. The presenters outlined the basics of measles diagnosis and treatment, discussed culturally relevant communication strategies and shared how tribes are responding to the outbreak.
Participants also strategized about ways to improve vaccination rates, said Harry Brown, a physician and an epidemiologist for the United South and Eastern Tribes, a nonprofit that works with 33 tribes in the Atlantic Coast and Southeast regions.
“It’s a pretty hot topic right now in Indian Country, and I think a lot of people are being proactive,” he said.
Measles can survive for up to two hours in the air in a space where an infected person has been, sickening up to 90% of people who aren’t vaccinated, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The U.S. this year had 1,309 confirmed cases of measles as of July 16, per the CDC. It’s the largest U.S. outbreak since 1992. Ninety-two percent of the 2025 cases involve unvaccinated patients or people with an unknown vaccination status. Three people had died in the U.S. and 164 had been hospitalized.
O’Connell said data on Native Americans’ vaccination rates is imperfect but that it suggests a lower percentage have received measles shots than the overall U.S. population.
The limited national data on measles vaccination rates for Native Americans is based on small surveys of people who self-identify as Native American. Some indicate that Native Americans have slightly lower measles vaccination rates, while others show gaps.
Statistics from some states, including South Dakota and Montana, show that Native Americans are less likely than white children to be vaccinated on schedule.
The national measles vaccination rate is significantly lower for Native Americans who use the mostly rural Indian Health Service. About 76% of children 16 to 27 months old had gotten the first shot, according to data collected by the agency during recent patient visits at 156 clinics. That’s a 10- percentage-point drop from a decade earlier.
But the IHS data shows its patients are at least as likely as other children to have received both recommended measles shots by the time they’re 17 years old. O’Connell said it’s unclear if currently unvaccinated patients will continue the trend of eventually getting up to date on their shots or if they will remain unvaccinated.

The immunization rate is probably higher for older children since schools require students to get vaccinated unless they have an exemption, Brown said. He said it’s important that parents get their children vaccinated on time, when they’re young and more at risk of being hospitalized or dying from the disease.
Native Americans may have lower vaccination rates due to the challenges they face in accessing shots and other health care, O’Connell said. Those on rural reservations may be an hour or more from a clinic. Or, like Palmier, some lack reliable transportation.
Another reason, O’Connell said, is that some Native Americans distrust the Indian Health Service, which is chronically underfunded and understaffed. If the only nearby health care facility is run by the agency, patients may delay or skip care.
O’Connell and Brown said vaccine skepticism and mistrust of the entire health care system is growing in Native American communities, as has occurred elsewhere nationwide.
“Prior to social media, I think our population was pretty trustful of childhood vaccination. And American Indians have a long history of being severely impacted by infectious disease,” he said.
The arrival of Europeans in the late 1400s brought new diseases, including measles, that killed tens of millions of Indigenous people in North and South America by the early 1600s. Native Americans have also had high mortality rates in modern pandemics, including the 1918-20 Spanish flu and covid-19.
The Great Plains Tribal Leaders’ Health Board reacted quickly when measles cases began showing up near its headquarters in South Dakota this year. Nebraska health officials announced in late May that a child had measles in a rural part of the state, close to the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. Then, four people from the Rapid City area got sick later that month and into the middle of June.
“Our phones really rang off the hook” once that news came out, said Darren Crowe, a vice president at the board’s Oyate Health Center in Rapid City. He said parents wanted to know if their children were up to date on their measles vaccines.
Crowe said the health board ordered extra masks, created a measles command team that meets daily and called parents when its online database showed their children needed a shot. Brown praised that approach.

“It takes a concerted outreach effort that goes individual to individual,” he said, adding that his organization helped the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians and the Alabama-Coushatta Tribe of Texas with similar efforts.
Brown said reaching specific families can be a challenge in some low-income Native American communities, where many people’s phone numbers frequently change from using prepaid plans.
Once a health worker reaches a parent, Brown said, they should listen and ask questions before sharing the importance of the vaccine against measles, mumps and rubella.
“Rather than trying to preach to somebody and beat them over the head with data or whatever to convince them that this is what they need to do, you start out by finding out where they are,” he said.
“So, ‘Tell me about your experience with vaccination. Tell me what you know about vaccination.’”
Most people agree to immunize their children when presented with helpful information in a nonjudgmental way, Brown said.

The four-term senator is running for the seat currently held by U.S. Rep. Angie Craig, who is running for U.S. Senate.
“This campaign is about putting families first,” Pratt said in a press release. “President (Donald) Trump is making strides and bringing energy back to our economy, but families in CD2 still need someone who can win in November to keep that momentum going.”
Pratt’s fellow senator Matt Klein, DFL-Mendota Heights, is also running for the seat, as is former DFL Sen. Matt Little. Tyler Kistner, the 2020 and 2022 GOP nominee, is also running for Craig’s seat.
The 2nd Congressional District is Minnesota’s most competitive. Craig’s centrist politics, prodigious fundraising and district work have helped her win four consecutive elections in the purple south metro district.
Pratt, who was first elected in 2012, is the minority lead on the influential Senate Finance Committee. Pratt played football for the University of Colorado and works in banking.
Prior to serving in the Senate, Pratt served on the Prior Lake-Savage School Board from 2000 to 2013.

Nicole Mitchell, a Woodbury Democrat who was found guilty of first-degree burglary and possession of burglary tools Friday, will resign from the Minnesota Senate by Aug. 4, her attorney said in a statement Monday
The first-term senator will resign no later than Aug. 4 at 5 p.m., once she finishes four tasks: completes outstanding legislative projects, wraps up ongoing constituent services, transitions legislative staff and obtains health insurance for her son, according to the statement from Dane DeKrey, who helped defend Mitchell during the recent five-day trial.
The unusual resignation announcement means Mitchell will continue to represent her constituents for up to two weeks as a convicted felon. It also means that Democrats will lose their one-seat majority in the 34-33 Minnesota Senate until Gov. Tim Walz calls a special election to replace her.
Senate Minority Leader Mark Johnson, R-East Grand Forks, criticized Mitchell’s decision to remain in the Senate for up to two weeks.
“Sen. Mitchell was convicted of two felonies; she doesn’t get to give the Senate two weeks’ notice,” Johnson said in a statement.
A jury convicted Mitchell of felony burglary and possession of burglary tools Friday after a grueling trial that played out like a family drama.
The prosecution successfully argued that Mitchell intended to steal her late father’s possessions from her stepmother when she broke into her Detroit Lakes home on April 22, 2024. The state’s main evidence was that she told police as much during her arrest, and the jury saw the footage of her admissions from police officers’ body-worn cameras.
Mitchell unsuccessfully tried to convince the jury of nine men and three women that she was in the Detroit Lakes home to conduct a welfare check on her stepmother. Mitchell testified in her own defense, and told the jury that her stepmother was struggling with paranoia due to Alzheimer’s disease.
DeKrey on Friday told reporters that Mitchell will likely appeal the verdict.
Mitchell’s sentencing has not been scheduled, but because she has no criminal history her sentence will likely be far less than the maximum sentence of 20 years in prison for burglary and three years for burglary tools.
Senate Majority Leader Erin Murphy, DFL-St. Paul, called on Mitchell to resign for the first time immediately following the announcement of the jury’s verdict.
Mitchell in 2022 won her race by about 17 percentage points, and the district leans heavily  Democratic. Whether residents in the district — which includes Woodbury and Maplewood — want to elect another Democrat remains to be seen, given Mitchell’s crimes.

(Photo courtesy of the Connecticut Division of Scientific Services)Across the country, state and local crime labs are drowning in evidence.
From rape kits to drug samples to vials of blood, delays in forensic testing are stalling prosecutions, stretching court calendars and forcing impossible choices about what gets tested — and what doesn’t.
Now, as the need for forensic testing grows, state and local crime labs may face steep federal funding cuts that could further delay justice for victims, derail criminal investigations and overwhelm already backlogged systems.
Prosecutors warn New Mexico lawmakers about ‘new backlog’ in rape kits

Two key federal grant programs that support state and local forensic labs are at risk: One faces a major cut, while the other is funded below its authorized cap despite growing demand.
The proposed cuts have alarmed forensic experts and crime lab directors who say some labs rely heavily on these federal grants to keep up with mounting caseloads.
“That would have dire consequences on a lot of crime laboratories who depend on those funds for maintaining operations,” said Scott Hummel, the president of the American Society of Crime Laboratory Directors, a national nonprofit professional organization.
“If you limit those resources even further, there will be backlogs,” said Hummel, who also works as a quality assurance manager at the Kansas City Police Crime Laboratory in Missouri. “Those backlogs just keep growing and growing, and labs are forced to make difficult decisions on how they prioritize their casework.”
When labs fall behind
Crime labs are often invisible to the public but essential to criminal investigations. They test DNA, analyze drug samples, match ballistics and verify evidence in everything from rape cases to gun homicides. The evidence may lead to arrests, but it’s also critical in court, shaping outcomes for victims, defendants, prosecutors and defense attorneys alike.
But years of underinvestment have left many labs without enough scientists, equipment and funding to keep up. As forensic technology has advanced — particularly in digital evidence and DNA testing — demand also has risen sharply.
More states are tracking rape kits. But key support for survivors may be slipping away.

“As technology gets better, there’s an expectation, I think, that labs can do more than they have the capacity for,” Hummel said.
At the same time, new state laws and testing mandates are increasing pressure on already strained labs. In some states, changes in drug laws — such as renewed crackdowns on marijuana or stricter DUI thresholds — have led to a surge in requests for toxicology and drug analysis. Other states have expanded mandatory evidence testing requirements, often without providing additional funding.
Some lab directors who spoke with Stateline said that even well-intentioned policies can create bottlenecks when resources don’t keep pace with demand.
“It’s important for policymakers to realize that the criminal justice system is demanding more from us, and so we need the resources to keep up with the increased demand,” said James Carroll, the crime laboratory director with the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department.
Low pay is also a challenge, with some analysts opting for private-sector jobs that offer higher salaries and better benefits. Training new analysts can take months or even years, making it difficult to quickly fill critical positions and retain experienced staff.
“We have to be absolutely perfect, and if you have something that isn’t perfect, that can be a career ruiner,” said Mike Lyttle, the assistant director of the forensic services division at the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation. “That is a lot of pressure.”
But that pressure can come at a cost — especially when analysts bear the brunt of it.
Lab directors and managers who spoke with Stateline said that overworking staff is not only inappropriate, but also risky. It can lead to quality issues, including “dry labbing,” or fabricated results, which could call hundreds or even thousands of cases into question.
As delays mount across the country, some state and local governments are rethinking how their crime labs are structured and funded.












 It’s important for policymakers to realize that the criminal justice system is demanding more from us, and so we need the resources to keep up with the increased demand. 


– James Carroll, crime laboratory director with the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department




In Colorado, officials are dealing with the aftermath of a major DNA testing scandal involving state-run labs, and several new laws have been enacted to establish a review board and address backlogs. Lawmakers in Rhode Island considered a bill earlier this year that would have shifted oversight of its state crime lab to the state attorney general’s office, but the bill was tabled for further study.
In Shelby County, Tennessee, a new $1.5 million investment will go toward the region’s first local lab focused on rapid DNA analysis, digital forensics and weapons ballistics. Memphis City Council officials also are working on funding at least two new positions at a state laboratory to prioritize cases from the Memphis area.
 Hard choices

The national push to test sexual assault kits has helped bring attention to forensic evidence backlogs. But in some labs, it has also forced tough choices about what gets tested first.
In Oregon, for example, Brian Medlock, the director of the state police forensic science division, announced in January that the state lab had halted DNA analysis for all property crime evidence. Testing won’t resume until the sexual assault kit backlog is cleared — a goal the agency doesn’t expect to meet until the end of the year. As of June, 474 sexual assault kits were still awaiting testing, according to the state’s dashboard.
Like Oregon, the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation also is deprioritizing nonviolent cases as it works through its rape kit backlog. The agency currently has six forensic biology analysts in training across the state, limiting how many cases it can process, according to Lyttle.
The goal is to eventually process lower-priority cases, he said, but the current focus remains on sexual assault kits. Still, Lyttle acknowledged that delaying the analysis of evidence in nonviolent cases can be a missed opportunity. Uploading DNA profiles from those cases to the national database, CODIS, could help identify offenders earlier — potentially before they go on to commit more serious crimes.
“You may be losing people early because you’re deprioritizing those nonviolent cases and not getting them identified as quickly as you could,” he said. “Every case is important.”
 Looming cuts

Trump has proposed slashing one major forensic science grant program and holding funding flat for another — a combination that some officials fear could worsen evidence backlogs amid rising demand.

The Paul Coverdell Forensic Science Improvement Grants Program, which aims to help labs replace aging equipment, train staff and reduce case backlogs, would be cut by 71% under President Donald Trump’s proposed fiscal year 2026 budget — from $35 million to $10 million.
Another, the Debbie Smith DNA Backlog Grant Program, would receive $120 million under the proposal — below the $151 million cap authorized by Congress in 2023. While Congress can approve up to that amount, it often allocates less: $130 million in fiscal year 2023, and $120 million in both fiscal years 2024 and 2025.
The program helps labs process backlogged evidence, including sexual assault kits, and supports the expansion of the national DNA database, CODIS.
These proposals are part of the administration’s annual discretionary budget request; Congress must finalize federal agency yearly spending by Sept. 30. Presidential budget proposals are often reshaped by Congress, but Trump’s spending plans have found strong backing among Republicans on Capitol Hill. With the GOP holding majorities in both chambers, proposals to cut or limit funding for forensic science programs may be more likely to advance.
 A state in crisis and a model for change

The Colorado Bureau of Investigation’s crime labs are under intense scrutiny following a major DNA testing scandal and widespread staffing shortages that have slowed down forensic work across the board. The bureau is facing backlogs in every discipline or type of case, according to Lance Allen, a deputy director who oversees forensic services.
Much of the current crisis stems from the case of Yvonne “Missy” Woods, a former DNA scientist now facing more than 100 criminal charges for allegedly manipulating DNA results over her 30-year career. Her alleged misconduct, combined with long-standing understaffing issues, has led to severe delays.
As of June, the average turnaround time for processing sexual assault kits in Colorado was 570 days, or about 1 1/2 years, with more than 1,200 kits still awaiting testing, according to the state’s dashboard. The agency’s goal is to reduce that timeline to 90 days.
“We are not satisfied with this turnaround time either, and this backlog is also unacceptable to us, and we know we have to do better,” Allen told Stateline.

But the backlog isn’t limited to sexual assault cases. Blood alcohol testing has also slowed dramatically, according to defense attorney Matthew Haltzman, who said he has handled cases in which results took five to six months to come back.
In that time, he said, even clients who were ultimately found not to be intoxicated were forced to navigate the court system — attending hearings, undergoing weekly drug and alcohol testing and complying with pretrial supervision.
“It’s just a lose-lose for everybody in the legal process, but more so for the accused than anyone else,” Haltzman said. “It’s a massive deprivation of liberty.”
The current turnaround time for all toxicology tests is 99 days, or just over three months, according to Vanessa Beall, the Colorado bureau’s toxicology program manager. About 80% of cases are completed within that time frame or less, and all toxicology tests include blood alcohol and drug analysis.
With additional toxicologists, the bureau is already meeting its 2025 goal and aims to reduce that turnaround time to 70 days by the end of 2026.
This year, the bureau and state lawmakers have rolled out measures aimed at restoring trust in the system. Those efforts include sending more than 1,000 rape kits to private labs to reduce turnaround times, expanding staff training programs and establishing a review board within the state attorney general’s office to improve oversight.
Lawmakers also approved $3 million to support outsourcing and lab operations, along with a separate law requiring the reporting of misconduct within Colorado’s state-run forensic laboratories.
Meanwhile, Connecticut is drawing national attention for its consistent performance and growing capabilities.
Once plagued by serious issues — including a suspended accreditation in 2011 that disrupted criminal proceedings — Connecticut’s forensic lab has steadily strengthened its operations. This year, it earned a perfect accreditation score for the third year in a row.
Following its accreditation loss, the lab faced a backlog of 12,000 cases, and by 2013, turnaround times stretched up to 2 1/2 years. Today, the average turnaround is just 20 days across all disciplines.
DNA cases, including those involving sexual assault evidence, are typically processed in about 27 days. Firearms cases take about 35 days, and computer crimes about 60, according to Guy Vallaro, the director of the Connecticut Division of Scientific Services.
He credits much of the lab’s progress to its team of scientists and staff, who he says are deeply committed to both accuracy and improvement.
“When you have a good staff, you can do incredible things,” Vallaro said.

The former Rutland Herald reporter and editor tapped his first-person insight to write definitive books on the state’s first Democratic governor, Philip Hoff, and its Vietnam War-questioning U.S. senator, George Aiken.

Steve Terry was a University of Vermont student on Nov. 6, 1962, when he stood in a Winooski election night crowd and saw Philip Hoff crowned — literally, with a tin-foil coronet tossed by a spectator — the first modern Democratic governor of the Green Mountain State after more than a century of Republican rule.
“I was an eyewitness, just a young, awestruck college student,” Terry recalled to this reporter 30 years later. “It was one of the defining moments of the 20th century history of Vermont.”
Terry didn’t know he’d go on to chronicle six decades of equally headline-grabbing events as a Vermont journalist and historian. Even with his recent diagnosis of pancreatic cancer, the Middlebury retiree stayed on top of the news — right up to his death Saturday at his home at age 82, his family announced in an email to friends.
“Nowadays, if it’s not on social media, it doesn’t exist,” Terry, a former Rutland Herald reporter and editor, said in a 2023 interview. “There seems to be an absence of memory of events that happened a week earlier, let alone years earlier. Maybe this is just my age, but we don’t seem to have deep introspection as to the roots of what’s happening today. History doesn’t seem to be in our culture anymore.”
Putting current events into context was an essential part of Terry’s life. Born in Windsor on Oct. 2, 1942, he was a high schooler when he began reporting on local sports for the weekly Vermont Journal and a University of Vermont student when he interviewed his peers for articles the school distributed to their hometown newspapers.
Terry had just started college in 1960 when he saw John F. Kennedy campaign in Burlington the day before the politician became the youngest person ever elected U.S. president.
“Like all students, I suppose, I was certainly enamored by JFK,” he recalled.
But Terry didn’t realize he was on the edge of a seismic shift. When Kennedy spoke at Burlington’s airport on Nov. 7, 1960, Vermont was anything but a Democratic stronghold. Instead, it was the only state in the nation to have supported the top of every Republican ticket since the GOP’s founding in 1854. 
Attracting a tarmac crowd of 10,000 people, Kennedy nonetheless lost Vermont to Richard Nixon. But two years later, Terry saw Hoff claim a historic Democratic victory, sowing the seeds of the Republicans’ eventual loss of their legislative majority when Democrats won the state Senate in 1984 and the House in 1986.
“It was the tangible beginning of the new Vermont,” Terry recalled. “A lot of what we know about Vermont now had its beginnings there.”

The transition would prove to be turbulent. Terry was a University of Vermont senior when Kennedy was assassinated on Nov. 22, 1963.
“I remember, like almost all people, exactly what I was doing when I heard the news that the president had been shot,” Terry recalled on the 60th anniversary. “I was at the library interviewing a student leader, then rushed back to my fraternity house. Minutes later, I saw that famous TV picture of Walter Cronkite announcing to the world that JFK was dead.”
Decades before cellphones, personal computers and cable, Vermonters relied on radios, television antennas and newspapers. Graduating college in 1964, Terry interned for six months at the Providence Journal in Rhode Island before covering Hoff’s second and third terms as a capitol reporter for the Rutland Herald and Barre-Montpelier Times Argus, two of the state’s then-largest and most respected news outlets.
Terry joined the sister papers’ shared Vermont Press Bureau on the eve of the 1965 reapportionment of the state Legislature — ending the practice of giving every municipality its own House representative, regardless of population — and headed the office when it sent reporters to the 1968 presidential conventions.
“I drew the straw to cover the Republicans in Miami,” Terry recalled in a 2024 interview.
Terry reported on the GOP’s nomination of Nixon. A colleague traveled to Chicago to follow Democratic challenger Hubert Humphrey amid explosive protests against the Vietnam War, only to drop his press duties and demonstrate himself.
That created a challenge for Terry who, in Montpelier, suddenly had to cover what was happening inside the Democratic convention hall nearly 1,000 miles away. Turning to a television and landline telephone, he soon was investigating the fact that Hoff was being floated as an anti-war alternative for vice president.
“I certainly did wish I was on the scene in Chicago,” Terry recalled. “It had to be, from a journalistic perspective, one of the most amazing historic events.”
Terry wrote a retrospective on Hoff upon the governor’s exit in 1969, leading Terry’s college history professor, Samuel Hand, to assign it as required reading. The former student and teacher later teamed with friend and Newsday managing editor Anthony Marro to turn the retrospective into the 2011 book, “Philip Hoff: How Red Turned Blue in the Green Mountain State.”
“In the years before Hoff, Vermont had been seen as a small and sleepy rural state where change came about only slowly and grudgingly,” Terry wrote in the book. “In the years during and after Hoff’s time as governor, Vermont became known for social ferment and rapid change.”

As a fledgling reporter, Terry dialed up another legendary Vermont figure — Republican U.S. Sen. George Aiken, who served from the beginning of World War II to the end of Nixon’s Watergate scandal — and discovered the politician who chose green for the color of the state’s license plates and coined the term “Northeast Kingdom” was willing to talk any time from early morning to late at night.
“I was learning on the job,” Terry recalled, “but he was never in a hurry to get off the phone.”
Terry made the first of several career transitions to join Aiken’s Washington, D.C., staff in 1969. He worked as a lead aide for the Senate Foreign Relations and Agriculture Committees until his boss’ retirement in 1975.
“I often took notes on the events I witnessed,” Terry recalled. “I had always aspired to do a book.”
Terry compiled the senator’s most important speeches in 2004’s “The Essential Aiken: A Life in Public Service.” He later wrote 2019’s “Say We Won and Get Out: George D. Aiken and the Vietnam War,” a biography centered on the senator’s oft-misquoted 1966 thoughts on U.S. involvement in Asia.
Terry filled the latter book with personal memories. He started by confirming other historians’ assertions that Kennedy was secretly planning to pull out of Vietnam after his anticipated reelection campaign in 1964.
“Aiken told me when I was on his staff that it was told to him in confidence,” Terry said in a 2019 interview. “Was Aiken right about Kennedy’s resolve to get out of Vietnam after the 1964 elections? We will never emphatically know the answer.”
Terry also remembered the time an 80-year-old Aiken was contemplating retirement in 1973 when a 31-year-old freelance writer convinced the elder statesman to sit for an interview.
The aspiring scribe’s name: Bernie Sanders.
“My job as Aiken’s aide,” Terry recalled, “was to take the very long-haired Bernie to lunch in the ornate U.S. Senate dining room.”
Terry said the contrast between Sanders and Aiken was striking: A young Brooklyn-born revolutionary conversing with a lifelong Republican tagged by his congressional colleagues as “the wise old owl.” But the resulting story in Vermont Life magazine’s spring 1973 issue showed a surprising degree of consensus between two men now considered among the state’s most legendary U.S. senators.

Terry returned to journalism upon Aiken’s retirement to work as founding editor of the Sunday Herald and Times Argus in 1975 and managing editor of the daily Herald from 1977 to 1985. He then moved to a corporate career as a communications executive at Green Mountain Power from 1985 to 2014. At the same time, he helped found the nonprofit Vermont Journalism Trust that oversees VTDigger.
Growing up milking cows by hand at his grandfather and uncle’s dairy farm, Terry retired to raise a small herd of Belted Galloway beef cattle. He left full-time work after receiving the Vermont Chamber of Commerce’s 2014 Citizen of the Year award at a ceremony that featured written testimonials from prominent peers.
“Steve is, in the true sense of the word, a public citizen,” former Gov. Madeleine Kunin said in her statement. “While he has been employed full-time in the private sector, he has had an impact on public life in Vermont.”
Friends ranging from former Gov. Howard Dean to The New Yorker staff writer Jane Mayer (who got her start as Terry’s first Herald hire) recently contacted Terry to express their own appreciation after learning of his declining health. Many were encouraged by Terry’s wife Faith, who noted “his mind is ever active and engaged.”
Christopher Graff, former head of the Associated Press’ Vermont bureau, said Terry was the rare person who could juggle jobs in the press, politics and power industry.
“They said of Aiken he was neither hawk nor dove but a wise owl,” Graff said. “That’s the role Steve played for decades, helping reporters, governors and CEOs work through tough times and decisions. Steve really was one of the last links to those huge personalities and to those history-making times.”

Supporters of the sale, including the South Central Connecticut Regional Water Authority (RWA), tout long-term benefits and local control. The AWA would essentially merge Aquarion and the RWA into a single nonprofit utility.
Opponents of the sale warn the sale could lead to higher water bills and less state oversight. Former Aquarion CEO Charles Firlotte represents 25 towns in the Fairfield County area opposing the sale to the Aquarion Water Authority.
“Post sale, rates are going to rise,” Firlotte said, “because this organization is not efficient.”
Both sides expect rising rates
Both sides agree that water rates are going up. The questions are how much and for what reason?
Firlotte pointed to statements from the RWA that suggest rates could increase by 65% over the next decade. He blamed the RWA’s operational inefficiencies and Aquarion’s purchase price.

“There’s a walloping $2.4 to $2.6 billion that’s going to be put on the backs of Aquarion customers,” Firlotte said.
RWA Chief Financial Officer Rochelle Kowalski acknowledged that 65% is the projected rate increase, but said that has nothing to do with Aquarion’s acquisition price.
“Rates will not go up due to the acquisition itself. Rates will go up regardless of ownership due to required infrastructure investment,” Kowalski said. She said the rate increases will largely go toward planned capital investments in systems and facilities totaling about $2 billion over that 10-year span.
Efficiency claims and savings debate
Firlotte also questioned RWA’s claim that the sale would save $350 million over 10 years, citing the RWA’s current rates as evidence against efficiency.
“If they’re so efficient, why are their rates 30% higher today?” he asked. “I have no idea what their assumptions are into that $350 million savings they’re projecting.”
Kowalski said the savings estimate came from a third-party M&A advisor using the previously authorized weighted average cost of capital. She added that the analysis was formally submitted to state regulators.
“It wasn’t wild assumptions,” she said. “We’ve responded to an interrogatory in that regard.”
Ownership and local control
On the question of ownership, Kowalski said local control would bring long-term stability and accountability.
“Aquarion has been sold either three or four times in approximately the last 20 to 25 years,” she said. “This provides for long-term stability.”
But Firlotte said the deal was set in motion without public input, pushed through via legislation crafted in a special session.
“It was not illegal,” Firlotte said, “but it’s unfair and it’s inappropriate.”
He also criticized the sale’s origins, linking it to financial losses at Aquarion’s parent company, Eversource Energy.
“Eversource is selling Aquarion because they got into a bad business investment in offshore wind … Aquarion is a sacrificial lamb.”
Rate structure concerns
While critics like Firlotte point to RWA’s higher rates as a red flag, Kowalski said there are no plans to blend rate structures between customers currently served by Aquarion or RWA.
“Multiple reasons cause rates to vary by utility,” she said, including differences in population density, commercial versus residential customer mix, and infrastructure design.
In explaining Aquarion’s lower water rates, she noted Aquarion’s size allows it to spread fixed costs across more customers, which lowers the per-user cost.
Regulatory oversight
Firlotte expressed concern that state regulators at the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority would lose dominion over Aquarion the moment the deal is approved.
[RELATED: CT Supreme Court upholds most of PURA decision in Aquarion rate case]
“The day PURA approves the deal is the day they no longer have any jurisdiction whatsoever over Aquarion,” he said.
What’s next
Kowalski said the process is still moving through regulatory review in Connecticut, as well as in Massachusetts and New Hampshire. If approved, she expects the sale to close by the end of the year.
“This provides for local ownership, stable infrastructure investment, and long-term benefits for customers,” she said.

(Provided)A documentary featuring the work of environmental educators in Kentucky and the positive impacts such education can have on youth and families will premiere Thursday in Lexington. 
The film “In Our Nature” by production company Synchronous Pictures highlights in part the work of the nonprofit Red Oaks Forest School in Powell County. The nonprofit offers activities for children, teenagers and adults to learn about nature while taking hikes, creating art and cleaning up the environment.
A press release about the premiere describes the film as exploring “how environmental education – and the passionate educators behind it – can bridge divides, nurture healthy minds and bodies, and ignite meaningful change.” 
The documentary also features the research of Centre College professor Ellen Prusinski, who interviewed dozens of Kentucky environmental educators to better understand how environmental education can find common ground with people beyond personal politics.
“I think the overarching message of the film — that we all deserve opportunities to connect with the natural world, regardless of where we live, our politics or our income — feels extremely urgent right now,” Prusinski said in a statement about the film.
The film will premiere at Lexington’s Lyric Theatre and Cultural Arts Center at 6:30 p.m. Eastern Standard Time with an initial reception at 5:30 p.m. A discussion with Prusinski is planned for after the showing.
Tickets can be purchased online. All ticket proceeds for the premiere will benefit the Red Oaks Forest School and the Kentucky Association for Environmental Education, an organization that seeks to promote environmental education in classrooms.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/In-Our-Nature-Kentucky-Establihsing-Drone-3-1024x576.png,,,2025-07-21 14:56:18.279567

Credit Keith SchubertThe Montana State Hospital, the cornerstone of the state’s mental healthcare system, will have a new leader next month — its sixth since 2022.
Department of Public Health and Human Services Director Charlie Brereton on Friday announced Dr. Daniel Bemporad will serve as new interim CEO of the Montana State Hospital.
Bemporad replaces Dr. Kevin Flanigan, who was appointed CEO in July 2024, and resigned for reasons not made clear by DPHHS officials. A press release by the department stated Flanigan “decided to conclude his service” on August 8.
“I am profoundly grateful to Dr. Flanigan for his unwavering commitment to Montana’s most vulnerable patients and the positive impact he has had on MSH,” Brereton said in a press statement. “During his tenure, Dr. Flanigan transformed the hospital’s culture and moved the facility closer to federal certification, allowing Dr. Bemporad to seamlessly carry the ball forward. I welcome Dan back to DPHHS as an employee and believe he is the right psychiatric leader for MSH at this crucial time.”
Flanigan had worked in California hospitals for the decade prior to moving to Montana, most recently as chief administrator for Ridgecrest Regional Hospital.
Representatives from DPHHS could not be reached by phone or email as of Monday.
Bemporad previously worked at the Warm Springs facility as a forensic psychiatrist from 2021 to 2024, before resigning his post last summer, “due to family and personal reasons,” according to reporting by the Montana Free Press, but continued working for the department on a contract basis.
The announcement of the leadership transition said Bemporad had ” recently been supporting DPHHS with its efforts to reduce the backlog of court-ordered evaluations at the hospital.”
Bemporad said in a statement that he is “thrilled” to continue his service with DPHHS, and “build upon the great work of Dr. Flanigan and the outstanding MSH team.”
“I believe that MSH is on the right track, and I’m honored to take the helm during this period of positive momentum,” Bemporad said. “Together, we’ll ensure patients continue to receive the high-quality care they deserve as we move towards federal recertification.”
The Montana State Hospital lost its federal certification in 2022 following federal investigations that found the facility had no COVID-19 protection plan, which led to the deaths of several patients. The lack of certification has meant the hospital has been unable to receive federal funding to the tune of around $7 million annually.
Brereton told state lawmakers earlier this month that the department is on track to apply for federal recertification by Jan. 1, 2026.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/IMG_1879-1024x724.jpg,,,2025-07-21 13:56:53.940841

The state Board of Professional Responsibility notified Nashville attorney Cynthia Sherwood in early July that it dismissed a complaint against her filed by the Tennessee Registry of Election Finance, the state body in charge of regulating campaign finance disclosures. 
Sherwood provided a copy of the confidential letter to the Lookout.
“The decision speaks for itself,” Sherwood said in an email statement. “The frivolous complaint was dismissed outright. I cannot speculate about why the Registry and AG’s Office don’t want to admit the complaint against me was dismissed outright.” 
Sherwood represents Cade Cothren, the former chief of staff to Tennessee House Speaker Glen Casada. Cothren and Casada were convicted on multiple counts of federal bribery and kickback charges involving state-funded constituent mailers run by a secretive vendor called Phoenix Solutions. 
Cothren and Casada are seeking new trials after being convicted in May.
Former Tennessee House Speaker Glen Casada, ex-aide, guilty in federal corruption case

Registry board members voted unanimously in September 2024 to notify the disciplinary board that a private investigator for Sherwood went to the home of registry executive director Bill Young last August and tried to talk to him about a case. Young said last year he declined to speak to the private investigator because the Registry has pending litigation involving Cothren in Chancery Court. Young is represented by a staff attorney and the state Attorney General’s Office in the case. 
The Registry’s members were upset about the incident and sought disciplinary action, saying it is unethical for an attorney to try to talk to a person known to be represented by a lawyer in a pending case.
After the Board of Professional Responsibility rendered its decision this July, the board two weeks ago asked the Attorney General’s Office for a legal opinion on whether the disciplinary board’s letter should be a public record.
Registry officials declined to release the letter until receiving clarification from the Attorney General’s Office. The Attorney General’s Office refused to release it, citing attorney-client privilege.
Registry board members also declined to divulge the Board of Professional Responsibility’s decision.
Three years ago, the Registry board subpoenaed Cothren to question him about the Faith Family Freedom Fund political action committee as part of a fraud probe. Cothren refused to comply, but Casada showed up at a later meeting and denied any connection to the PAC or knowledge of its actions. 
Yet Sydney Friedopfer, a former girlfriend of Cothren, testified to the board that Cothren had her register the political action in her name and then turn operations over to him during the 2020 election year.
The PAC used a $7,500 campaign donation from a North Carolina restaurant owner named Brandon Crawford, who was never found, to run attack ads against now-former state Republican Rep. Rick Tillis in his campaign with Republican Rep. Todd Warner of Chapel Hill. 
Tillis was critical of Casada during his short stint as House speaker, using an anonymous Twitter account to highlight the Republican leader’s excesses. Tillis resigned his seat in August 2019 amid a sexist and racist texting scandal involving Cothren.
Registry board members turned the case over to the Williamson County District Attorney’s Office, and once the trial for Casada and Cothren wrapped up, Registry Chairman Tom Lawless urged Young to have the investigation renewed.",https://tennesseelookout.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Casada-5-1-25-003-1024x638.jpg,,,2025-07-21 13:56:53.940841

Josh Stein’s veto of a bill allowing so-called “constitutional carry.”
Senate Bill 50 would allow North Carolinians above the age of 18 to carry concealed, loaded handguns without a permit, a change from the current system that requires background checks, safety training, and live-fire training.
In his veto message on June 20, Stein said the measure would make the state less safe and undermine responsible gun ownership.
“We can and should protect the right to bear arms without recklessly endangering law enforcement officers and our people,” he wrote.
States that removed concealed carry permit requirements saw on average, between 1999 and 2021, a 27% increase in gun homicides within three years of the change, according to Everytown for Gun Safety.
Weyling White, mayor of Ahoskie, is a board member of North Carolinians Against Gun Violence.
He said the group gathered Monday because the safety of its communities is on the line across the state.
“The last thing North Carolina needs right now is a step backward on public safety,” White said. “As a mayor, I think about the people in my town, here in the hospital, and I know that they are the ones who will bear the consequences o this bill.”
Students Demand Action volunteer Daelyn Edge attends Duke University. A lifelong North Carolinian, she grew up in rural, agriculture-based Sampson County.
Over the past year, she’s grown to call Durham home. While it’s very different from her hometown, she’s found similarities in the consequences of the legislation.
“Owning firearms is a way of life in rural areas, and I support the right to responsible gun ownership,” Edge said. “However, Senate Bill 50 is destructive.”
Sheriff Charles Blackwood of Orange County said he has always been an advocate for the Second Amendment.
He said the permitting process enhances that constitutional right.
“This bill is counterproductive to public safety, it places North Carolinians in danger, and leaders from both parties have recognized this,” Blackwood said.
Lawmakers are expected to return to Raleigh the week of July 28 to consider some of the vetoes Stein has issued this year. A three-fifths vote is necessary in both houses of the legislature to override a veto. Republicans have a 30-20 majority in the Senate and a 71-49 majority in the House — one shy of three-fifths. Senate Bill 50 was approved 26-18 in the Senate and 59-48 in the House. Several members were excused from voting in both bodies and two Republicans voted ‘no’ in the House.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Veto-1024x565.jpeg,,,2025-07-21 13:56:53.940841

“I want to thank President Trump, Secretary Brooke Rollins, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture for recognizing the need for critical financial relief for our farmers, ranchers and growers,” Florida Agriculture Commissioner Wilton Simpson said in a written statement.
“Florida producers have endured back-to-back devastating hurricane seasons, and this funding is a major victory that will help them rebuild, recover, and continue feeding our state and nation.”
The funding will be available to producers in counties designated as primary or contiguous disaster areas in 2023 and 2024, to help with infrastructure damage, market loss compensation, and citrus-specific damage, including projected economic losses and timber losses.
Florida producers have suffered more than $3 billion in losses from Hurricanes Idalia in 2023 plus Debby, Helene, and Milton in 2024, Simpson said.
In January, a University of Florida report estimated that agriculture production losses from the 2024 hurricane season amounted to nearly $976 million. That report noted that more than 6 million acres of agricultural lands that annually produce more than $8 billion in agricultural products were damaged by Hurricane Helene last September.
And it said that Hurricane Milton in October 2024 damaged more than 5.7 million acres of agricultural lands that annually produce more than $8.6 billion in agriculture products.
The state of Florida has previously provided approximately $150 million through the Department of Agriculture’s Agricultural and Aquaculture Producers Natural Disaster Recovery Loan Program and timber recovery program to support producers with emergency capital as they recover and rebuild from recent storms.

(Courtesy of Jackie Lee Onsuarez)Jackie Lee Onsuarez, a self-described “outsider to Santa Fe,” is pursuing an office on the fourth floor of the Roundhouse in his bid to be New Mexico’s next Democratic lieutenant governor.
Onsuarez, 58, currently works as a senior staff specialist at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant outside of Carlsbad, and is nearing the end of his first elected term as mayor pro tem on the Loving Village Council. He has a master’s degree in electrical engineering from the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology.
In 2021, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham appointed Onsuarez to a four-year term on the New Mexico Emergency Response Commission, which coordinates state and local emergency planning efforts.
Onsurez has not held higher office beyond the Village council, which oversees operations for the approximately 1,200 residents. He lost a two-way 1996 Democratic primary for an Albuquerque seat in the state House of Representatives.
Onsurez described his impetus to run for the state’s second-highest office as “embedded Democrats and Republicans” who aren’t listening to rural New Mexico.
“I’m an advocate for the people, and I’ve been very blessed to have a skill set, the opportunities and the experience that I have,” Onsuarez told Source NM. “I’m gonna throw my hat in for lieutenant governor because I bring to the executive branch a set of diversified skills that nobody has there.”
Onsurarez also cited his international experience building chemical plants abroad in Saudi Arabia, along with working internationally in London, China and India, as experience that would help him solve the state’s issues of: public infrastructure, health care and crime.
Onsuarez’s entrance in the race makes him the third candidate in the June 2, 2026 Democratic primary for lieutenant governor, along with current State Land Commissioner Stephanie Garcia Richard — who is term limited in that office — and state Sen. Harold Pope (D-Albuquerque).
According to the most recent campaign finance documents, Osurez has neither received nor spent any funds on the campaign.
The lieutenant governor holds dual executive and legislative roles. The position is second in succession and stands in for governors during absences. The lieutenant governor also oversees the New Mexico Senate during the legislative session and determines issues of decorum or rules. The state’s Constitution grants the lieutenant governor tie-breaker vote power in the Senate.
When asked how he would address his lack of experience in the Legislature, Onsuarez said his term in the village has taught him the roles and responsibilities “on a small level.”
“I’ve written laws that I tried to introduce, but they didn’t get very far. I’ve written a lot of ordinances, and I’ve worked closely with our legal department,” he said. “I certainly have the expertise to be able to learn something — and with respect to presiding over the Senate, I have the skill set to do it.”
Following the primary, the winning governor and lieutenant governor appear as a slate on the general election ballot.
Onsuarez, like the other candidates, is not endorsing any of the three contenders vying for the Democratic nomination for governor: Deb Haaland, the former U.S. Secretary of the interior and congresswomen; Sam Bregman, the 2nd Judicial District District attorney; and Ken Miyagashima, the former mayor of Las Cruces. Lujan Grisham is term-limited from running again.
So far, only Manuel Lardizabal, a former candidate for the New Mexico Senate, has declared for the Republican nomination for lieutenant governor, according to state candidate filings.
Rio Rancho Mayor Gregg Hull is the only declared Republican candidate for governor. Several others have filed paperwork while weighing campaigns, including: Duke Rodriguez, CEO of Ultra Heath Cannabis and a former cabinet secretary for former Republican Gov. Gary Johnson; Brian Cillessen, a 53-year-old Farmington resident, veteran and hunting show host; and Las Cruces-based fitness instructor, Belinda Robertson.
There’s one decline-to-state gubernatorial candidate: Gene Pettit, a nondenominational pastor in Radium Springs.
Onsuarez said his perspective from oil and gas country would be invaluable on the ticket.
“I’m the Democrat that lives in New Mexico where at least 35% of the revenues are generated for New Mexico’s general fund, and we rural New Mexicans need a seat at that table,” he said.

At issue is Herzberg’s March 18 vote against a Republican-led effort in the state House of Representatives to lower the state’s income tax rate from 4.25% to 4.05%.
House Bill 4170, which passed the House with bipartisan support, was put forth by Rep. Kathy Schmaltz (R-Jackson). In a statement Schmaltz said the effort was aimed at giving Michiganders a tax break, returning the rate to that of the 2023 tax year. The bill currently sits in the Democratic-led Senate Committee on Finance, Insurance and Consumer Protection.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The 2023 tax cut was triggered by a surplus in state funds, with a 2015 law signed by then-Gov. Rick Snyder, a Republican, which ties the income tax to the state’s general fund.
While Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel issued a legal opinion explaining that the cut would only apply to the 2023 tax year, Snyder later told the Michigan Advance the cut was intended to be permanent.

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)Congress set aside $50 billion for rural hospitals and medical providers to allay fears over the billions more in historic cuts to federal health care spending that President Donald Trump signed into law on Independence Day.
But is that bandage big enough to save struggling rural hospitals?
“I have more questions than I have answers,” said Alan Morgan, CEO of the National Rural Health Association, a nonprofit policy group. “No one has those answers yet.”
Morgan noted that the new money for rural health, to be spent over five years, is far less than the $155 billion in rural Medicaid spending cuts over 10 years, as estimated by KFF, a nonprofit health policy and research group.
Experts, hospital leaders and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle fear that Trump’s signature legislation will particularly gut rural hospitals and clinics, which see an outsize share of patients who are insured through Medicaid, the federal-state public health insurance for people with low incomes. The new law slashes more than $1 trillion from Medicaid over the next 10 years to help pay for tax cuts that disproportionately benefit the wealthy.
Fedorchak emphasizes need for new Medicaid requirements

The $50 billion addition was an effort by Republican leaders in Congress to win the votes of colleagues within their party who initially balked at supporting such steep cuts to Medicaid and other health services.
In the U.S. Senate, the rural program helped secure the vote of Alaska moderate Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who expressed concern about the law’s impact on health care in her state. About 1 in 3 Alaskans are insured through Medicaid.
Jared Kosin, the president and CEO of the Alaska Hospital & Healthcare Association, said he’s deeply frustrated with the new law’s gutting of Medicaid funding, which he thinks will wreak lasting damage on Alaskans. And Republicans sidestepped potential solutions by just throwing money into a program, he said.
“It’s frustrating in the public realm when decisions like this are made fast and, frankly, carelessly,” he said.
“The consequences are going to fall on us, not them.”
More than half of the law’s cuts to funding in rural areas are concentrated in 12 states with large rural populations that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act to cover more people, according to KFF: Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania and Virginia.
Some GOP lawmakers in Congress have heralded the $50 billion rural program as a health care victory. But it’s still unclear which hospitals, clinics and other providers would receive money and how much.
How it works
The Rural Health Transformation Program will dole out $10 billion annually from fiscal years 2026 through 2030.
States must apply for their funding by the end of this year, submitting a detailed plan on how it would be used.
The law outlines some ways that states can use the money, according to an analysis of the legislation from the Bipartisan Policy Center:

Making payments to rural hospitals to help them maintain essential services such as emergency room care or labor and delivery.
Recruiting and training rural doctors, nurses and other health workers.
Bolstering emergency medical services such as ambulances and EMTs.
Using new technologies, including telehealth.
Providing opioid use disorder treatment and mental health services.
Improving preventive care and chronic disease management.

Half of the $10 billion each year will be distributed evenly across states that have applied for it. The other half can be distributed by the administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services — currently Dr. Mehmet Oz — at his discretion, based on a state’s rural population and rural health facilities.
Although the program doesn’t replace the amount states are likely to lose, Morgan said it’s still an opportunity to rethink how rural health care is funded. He’d like to see states given flexibility in how they’re able to use the funds, and he hopes they focus on keeping rural communities healthy through preventive care while still helping hospitals keep their doors open.
“If done correctly, it could really change the future course for rural America,” Morgan said. “That is such a tough ask, though.”
Hardest hit
Kentucky could take the biggest hit from the new law’s reduction in rural Medicaid funding, losing an estimated $12 billion over 10 years, according to a KFF analysis.
The state’s Medicaid department is still waiting for additional federal guidance to understand how the state’s program will be affected, Kendra Steele, spokesperson with the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services, told Stateline in a statement.
“Over 1.4 million Kentuckians rely on Medicaid — including half of all children in our state, seniors and more vulnerable populations — and the passage of legislation on the federal level will have serious impacts for those individuals, rural health care and hospitals and local economies,” she wrote.
Even with the new program, states across the country will have to reevaluate their budgets in light of the cuts, said Hemi Tewarson, executive director at the National Academy for State Health Policy, a nonpartisan group that supports states in developing health care policies.
“Every region is slightly different and there’s not a one-size-fits-all approach,” she said. “Hospital ownership varies [as well as] the types of services that are critical for the community where they’re located. They have to think about new ways to provide those services in a context with fewer resources.”
About 44% of rural hospitals are operating in the red, according to a KFF analysis of Rand Hospital Data, a higher share than the 35% of hospitals in urban areas.
‘Rural at heart’
Prior to the bill’s passage, Oz attempted to reassure U.S. House Republicans that their districts could get money from the program even if they weren’t specifically rural, Politico reported earlier this month.













We’re all rural at heart when it comes to money.


– Allan Morgan, CEO of the National Rural Health Association





Pennsylvania Republican U.S. Rep. Rob Bresnahan said money would begin flowing to his district as early as the beginning of next year, telling the Wilkes-Barre Times Leader earlier this month that he met with Trump, Oz and others to secure pledges that hospitals in his district could access the fund. He represents the northeastern corner of Pennsylvania, which includes suburban and rural areas, as well as the cities of Scranton and Wilkes-Barre.
Though the legislation includes guidelines on which facilities or areas qualify as “rural,” Morgan, of the National Rural Health Association, expects a mad dash from lawmakers and providers to claim rural status in order to get a piece of the funding.
“That’s going to be a huge issue — defining who’s rural,” Morgan said. “We’re all rural at heart when it comes to money.”

Stand-your-ground or shoot first laws remove the legal duty to retreat before using deadly force in a self-defense situation. These laws evolved from the centuries-old castle doctrine, which permitted individuals to use force to defend themselves in their own homes.
Modern stand-your-ground statutes expanded this principle to apply in public spaces. Florida enacted the first such law in 2005, and the policy drew national attention in 2012 after the fatal shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin by George Zimmerman, a private citizen.
Over the years, these laws have gained traction in state legislatures with strong backing from gun rights organizations. At least 35 states have stand-your-ground statutes or laws that expand the castle doctrine to apply beyond the home, according to a separate analysis by the RAND Corporation.
A standalone 2022 study published in the peer-reviewed medical journal JAMA Network found that stand-your-ground laws were associated with an 8% to 11% increase in monthly homicide and firearm homicide rates nationwide. Several Southern states –– Alabama, Florida, Georgia and Louisiana –– saw increases of 10% or more.
States that have adopted stand-your-ground laws have seen gun homicides rise by up to 11% annually from 1999 to 2017, according to the JAMA report. That equates to more than 700 additional gun deaths each year, according to estimates in the Everytown report.
Nick Suplina, the senior vice president of law and policy at Everytown, said in a written statement that stand-your-ground legislation gives “free license to shoot and kill” and ought to be rejected. “Shoot First laws do nothing to protect our communities from violence,” Suplina wrote.
The new Everytown report comes as legislatures in at least a handful of states have recently debated whether to expand or roll back self-defense protections.
At the same time, the national conversation around firearm policy continues to grow, with ongoing discussions about red flag laws, safe storage, rapid-fire attachments and other gun-related measures.
A 2023 national NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll found that 58% of Americans support stand-your-ground laws. Support was highest among Republicans at 81% and independents at 57%, while 60% of Democrats said they opposed such laws.
People are more likely to carry guns in public in states with stand-your-ground laws, which also increases the risk of gun theft and violent confrontations, according to research cited in the Everytown report. These laws also are linked to higher rates of gun homicide among adolescents and more unintentional shootings involving children and young adults.
Researchers at Everytown analyzed FBI data from 2019 to 2023 and found that in stand-your-ground states, homicides involving white shooters and Black victims were ruled justifiable four times more often than when the roles were reversed. In Michigan, that disparity was more than twelvefold.
The report also cited research suggesting that in domestic violence cases, women who claimed self-defense were more likely to be convicted and received longer sentences compared to others.
Beyond the legal outcomes, gun homicides linked to stand-your-ground laws cost an estimated $11 billion annually, according to Everytown. That includes $500 million in direct taxpayer expenses tied to law enforcement, courts and medical care, the report says.

(Photo by Alex Kent for Tennessee Lookout)A former Capitol Police officer who stood the ground between hundreds of members of Congress and insurrectionists during the Jan. 6 attack is scheduled to be the keynote speaker at a Council Bluffs, Iowa political event Sunday, July 27.
Harry Dunn, a now-departed United States Capitol Police officer who testified before Congress on the Jan. 6, 2021 siege at the capitol, became a high-profile representative of the experience for other peace officers — many who were injured, some who died.

Dunn said the prospect of a full-scale slaughter of elected officials Jan. 6, some of the nation’s top leaders in both parties, was within literal feet, an instant here or there, in the run of events, from happening.
“Members of Congress were being told to take their pins off because they didn’t know if people would recognize that,” Dunn said in a phone interview with The Iowa Mercury. “We were a couple of right turns, and wrong turns by the insurrectionists, away from it being a bloodbath.”
Dunn will speak at an event hosted by the Pottawattamie County Democratic Party from 1-3:30 p.m. Sunday, July 27 at The Grass Wagon, 110 S. 29th St., Council Bluffs. Tickets can be purchased in advance here or at the door. The event is a fundraiser for the Pottawattamie County Democratic Party.
“There’s so much to do and it’s not one person or two people that’s going to save the country,” Dunn said. “We need everybody. The message that I give is more a message of resilience. And I end it usually when I talk to people with ‘I haven’t quit yet. And I’ve been though hell.’ I get death threats weekly. It used to be daily, but it’s kind of gone down a little bit.”
For his part, Dunn is the author of the book “Standing My Ground: A Capitol Police Officer’s Fight for Accountability and Good Trouble After January 6th.”
Dunn ran for Congress as a Democrat in Maryland in 2024, but fell short in a primary before starting a political action committee, Democracy Defenders, which supports candidates who take on what the PAC calls “MAGA extremists and the massive Super PACs that undermine our democracy.”
“After Jan. 6 my whole life changed, everything changed, as everybody saw on TV,” Dunn said in the interview.
Dunn lays the uprising at the Capitol squarely at the feet of President Donald Trump, whom he sees as a threat to democracy. On the the first day of his second term in the Oval Office, Trump granted clemency to those involved in the Jan. 6 siege of the Capitol.
“The reason why I continue to speak out is to seek accountability, to make sure that something like that never happens, that it didn’t get whitewashed,” Dunn said.








Dunn, a James Madison University graduate who played briefly in the Canadian Football League with the Montreal Alouettes, had nearly two decades on the Capitol Police force. He left that organization four years short of being able to collect a full pension so he could pursue advocacy for democracy.
“I did everything I could to make sure we could get Donald Trump held accountable and we could stop him since the courts didn’t do it,” Dunn said.
Like others who have worked at the U.S. Capitol, Dunn, said the grounds and history-around-every-corner atmosphere never grew old, such is the reverence he holds for the center of American democracy.
“To have it desecrated in the way that it was it just took so much of the love and the passion away from me and I turned it into what I’m going now, just a continuing fight,” Dunn said. “I realized that I did all I could do as a police officer.”
Before he left office, President Biden provided a preemptive pardon to Dunn to protect him from potential MAGA retaliation for his actions on Jan. 6, testimony before Congress and continued advocacy.
Dunn knows threats to his very life lurk to this day. It’s a burden, but one he will carry, Dunn said.
There is a racial dimension to the Jan. 6 story, Dunn, who is Black, said in the interview. He recounts the torrent of slurs being hurled in his direction at the insurrection, words he never heard while wearing the police uniform until that day. He deeply details this in his book.
Big picture, Dunn said he has a rare insight into how conspiracy theories, even the wildest ones, work their way from computer and smart-phone screens and screeds into real life, how people are captured in cult-like fashion online, and radicalized. He literally fought the flesh-and-blood results of conspiracy theories in the U.S. Capitol.
“Now it is everything is conspiracy theories,” Dunn said. “It is making individuals paranoid. Paranoid individuals do what they did on January 6.”
He added, “Before January 6, you had people who thought satellites were following them or this and that. But Donald Trump has honed in on it and created a whole new population of people who — and I don’t mean this literally, but maybe — have found a hill to die on on conspiracy theories. Ashli Babbitt would still be alive if she did not come to the Capitol on January 6. If Donald Trump did not lie about the election being stolen January 6 would not have happened.”

(Photo by Maine Morning Star)Agencies in at least 28 states and the District of Columbia have issued guidance on the use of artificial intelligence in K-12 schools.
More than half of the states have created school policies to define artificial intelligence, develop best practices for using AI systems and more, according to a report from AI for Education, an advocacy group that provides AI literacy training for educators.
Despite efforts by the Trump administration to loosen federal and state AI rules in hopes of boosting innovation, teachers and students need a lot of state-level guidance for navigating the fast-moving technology, said Amanda Bickerstaff, the CEO and co-founder of AI for Education.
“What most people think about when it comes to AI adoption in the schools is academic integrity,” she said. “One of the biggest concerns that we’ve seen — and one of the reasons why there’s been a push towards AI guidance, both at the district and state level — is to provide some safety guidelines around responsible use and to create opportunities for people to know what is appropriate.”

North Carolina, which last year became one of the first states to issue AI guidance for schools, set out to study and define generative artificial intelligence for potential uses in the classroom. The policy also includes resources for students and teachers interested in learning how to interact with AI models successfully.
In addition to classroom guidance, some states emphasize ethical considerations for certain AI models. Following Georgia’s initial framework in January, the state shared additional guidance in June outlining ethical principles educators should consider before adopting the technology.
This year, Maine, Missouri, Nevada and New Mexico also released guidelines for AI in schools.
In the absence of regulations at the federal level, states are filling a critical gap, said Maddy Dwyer, a policy analyst for the Equity in Civic Technology team at the Center for Democracy & Technology, a nonprofit working to advance civil rights in the digital age.
While most state AI guidance for schools focuses on the potential benefits, risks and need for human oversight, Dwyer wrote in a recent blog post that many of the frameworks are missing out on critical AI topics, such as community engagement and deepfakes, or manipulated photos and videos.
“I think that states being able to fill the gap that is currently there is a critical piece to making sure that the use of AI is serving kids and their needs, and enhancing their educational experiences rather than detracting from them,” she said.

This finding comes from a Health and Human Services audit report, released Friday, that says Kentucky did not “effectively monitor the implementation of the COVID-19 screening testing program.” 
The audit, conducted from July 2023 through March 2025, says the state needs to “determine the allowability” of about $4.5 million in testing expenditures and “refund to the federal government any unallowable amount.” 
The report includes a written response from former Cabinet for Health and Family Services Secretary Eric Friedlander dated April 29. In that, Friedlander said the state agrees with part of the analysis — that Kentucky needs to update its procedures to make sure it is following federal contract guidelines and properly overseeing compliance. 
On the recommendation that the state analyze more than $4 million in testing money and possibly reimburse part of it, the cabinet’s response states: “all parties believe this has been resolved to mutual satisfaction.” 
“Kentucky acknowledges that testing and reconciliation of testing was a rapidly evolving process that improved with time and experience,” the cabinet’s response states. “The Department for Public Health has communicated with (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) project officer staff regarding the audit recommendation and anticipates support from CDC as all acknowledge that activity occurred within the scope of work of the award and work was performed consistent with grant requirements.”  
The Lantern asked the cabinet for further comment but did not receive any. 
Kentucky was one of many state and local health departments to receive American Rescue Plan funding during the pandemic from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to help screen for COVID-19 and reopen schools. 
Kentucky received about $134 million on April 7, 2021, to help screen for COVID-19 in school. Of that money, $128.9 million went to 1.4 million COVID-19 tests conducted by 19 vendors, the report says. The rest, $5.5 million, went to other costs like air purifiers in schools and administrative support. The state then contracted vendors from July 15, 2021, to  June 30, 2022, to do the screenings. 
The state “maintained adequate documentation” for about $49 million of American Rescue Plan dollars, the report said. 
Still, the report alleges: 

Of the 19 vendors that were awarded testing contracts, seven did not meet at least one of the requirements for providing testing services for students and staff in K-12 schools.
Kentucky did not monitor the vendors to ensure background-check documentation was obtained or maintained for contracted employees who performed COVID-19 testing on K-12 school district property prior to commencing work, which is required under federal and contract requirements.
An estimated 292 of 2,120 contracted employees who were looked at for the report did not have background checks completed before performing COVID-19 testing on K-12 school district property.
One of the vendors said it had been in business for at least one year but had only been in business for nine months when it submitted the application to test. This error occurred because the vendor was not required to submit documentation, other than the attestation, to support it had been in business at least a year. This vendor, not named in the report, was paid approximately $69 million for COVID-19 testing.
Six vendors were paid $9.7 million for testing services despite not meeting all the contract requirements. 
One vendor didn’t provide evidence that it performed COVID-19 tests. 
Kentucky did not properly document the monthly reconciliation of the COVID-19 testing invoices for each vendor during the contract period.

A few years ago, retailers used these tools to deter occasional shoplifting. Now it’s estimated that the average American family pays more than $500 annually in additional costs due to the impact of organized retail theft.
Scott McBride, the chief global asset protection officer for American Eagle Outfitters, told the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee last week that organized retail crime (ORC) amounts to much more than simple shoplifting. It represents a sophisticated criminal enterprise perpetrating massive thefts and crossing jurisdictional lines to avoid prosecution.

“While ORC is not new, its veracity, sophistication, and frequency and geographic reach have dramatically increased in the post-COVID era,” McBride explained. “These groups use encrypted message apps to recruit thieves, coordinate the consolidation of stolen goods, liquidate them through illicit online tertiary and black market sites, and even exfiltrate stolen products out of the country.”
McBride said American Eagle Outfitters, which operates 23 stores across North Carolina, notes the problem has grown so large with repeatedly victimized retail stores, it has disrupted supply chains.
A recent case involving the federal agency Homeland Security Investigations as well as state and local law enforcement, successfully recovered to almost 2,000 pairs of American Eagle jeans along with other retailer merchandise totaling almost $2 million.
“The retail jeans were valued at $100,000. RFID research revealed that those stolen AEO jeans came from 35 stores in 13 states,” McBride testified.
That one case underscores the urgent need for national level involvement, McBride said, to support local and state government, district attorneys, and state’s attorneys general in prosecuting such cases.
Cargo theft on the rise with technology resulting in more creative schemes 
Donna Lemm testified on behalf of the American Trucking Associations that the frequency and sophistication of cargo theft incidents have increased exponentially over the past several years.
A few years ago, cargo theft was barely on her company’s radar.
  Donna Lemm, IMC Logistics (Photo: U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee video feed)
“In 2021, we had five cargo thefts reported. In 2024, we had 876 cargo thefts reported.”
Lemm explained how last year fraudsters sent work order information using a spoofed email address that appeared to be from a real customer.
“Our team fulfilled the instructions and completed three loads. We did not learn that the customer’s identity had been stolen until we attempted to send them an invoice. Ultimately, IMC Logistics was on the hook for the value of the lost cargo.”
In another incident, fraudsters outfitted a truck with fake placards and printed counterfeit IDs for the drivers. Lemm said IMC Logistics’ vehicles were equipped with GPS units, but the criminals were savvy enough to disable them within 20 minutes of leaving the lot.
“The trucking industry is doing everything right, but we are still vulnerable because Organized Theft Groups (OTGs) know that cargo theft schemes that cross state lines and span multiple law enforcement jurisdictions are unlikely to be investigated or prosecuted in a meaningful way,” said Lemm.
Theft takes a toll on the workforce
Summer Stephan, president of the National District Attorneys Association, said over the past two-year period (2023 and 2024), her office in San Diego County, California filed criminal cases involving organized retail theft against 218 defendants with a loss to stores of $2.6 million.
Stephan said the aggregation of theft amounts is critical because it distinguishes between somebody who maybe shoplifting to feed an addiction versus those who are habitual organized criminals.
“We used to have criminals coming in with the calculators to go right under $950, thus leaving them at a citation misdemeanor level,” explained Stephan. “That’s what caused all our products to become locked up.”
  Summer Stephan, president of the National District Attorneys Association (Photo: U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee video feed)
Stephan said she’s especially sympathetic to store employees who are anxious about being victimized by the rise in organized retail theft.
“I went to an Ulta Beauty store where there’s 20-year-olds aspiring to become makeup artists. The way those young clerks looked was very different than the past. They’re looking over their shoulder. They’re waiting for something bad to happen.”
Stephan was talking about employees in California, but the same could be true for workers in North Carolina. In May, four individuals were charged with stealing tens of thousands of dollars’ worth of merchandise at a Ulta Beauty Store in Holly Springs.
Authorities believe that case was part of larger east coast theft ring, with the merchandise easily resold at a lower price.
Stephan testified that an often-overlooked impact of retail crime is the loss of jobs in the retail industry.
“When organized crime becomes rampant within a community, store closures and reduced hours usually follow. Each store closure and reduction of hours directly translates to a loss of jobs or hours for all employees at that location,” she explained.
In 2022, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce reported that more than 650,000 jobs were lost nationwide due to organized retail crime.
Stephan along with Lemm and McBride voiced support for the Combatting Organized Retail Crime (CORCA) Act. The legislation sponsored by Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.) would empower federal agencies to take a leading role in the coordination of enforcement activities while providing law enforcement agencies with the tools necessary to tackle the increasingly complex crimes targeting interstate and international supply chains.
Sen. Ted Budd (R-N.C.) is among a dozen bipartisan co-sponsors of the bill hoping to see its passage in the 119th Congress.

One note of caution
Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Illinois) said while he is not critical of the bill’s intent, he has reservations about the additional authority it would give to the Department of Homeland Security, which has been singularly focused (and in his opinion, overly focused) on deportations under the Trump administration.
“I don’t doubt for a second that what we’ve had described to us today is part of a much bigger network. But to say we’re worried about whether someone who’s cutting grass on a golf course today is undocumented, and we ought to put the resources of the federal government into putting them in a detention facility and deporting them. I don’t think that’s as high a priority as the subject of this hearing today,” said Durbin.
Senator John Cornyn (R-Texas) said Homeland Security has the capacity to do more with $170 billion in new funding recently allocated for Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
As losses mount, states forced to respond
While apparel and electronics top the list of the most stolen items, food and beverages along with infant formula make the list because they are easy to resell and hard to track.
Lemm, the logistics executive, said these cargo thieves are constantly adjusting their schemes to capitalize on consumer demand. During recent nationwide egg shortages, approximately 100,000 eggs were stolen from a semi-trailer in Pennsylvania. That loss alone was estimated at $40,000.
North Carolina lawmakers passed a law three years ago to increase penalties for organized retail theft based on the value of stolen merchandise. The legislation also included a provision to expedite the return of any recovered goods to the retailer or corporation. In the case of perishable items like eggs, the food cannot be resold.
Recent research by Capital One revealed that retailers in North Carolina lost $1.8 billion in revenue to theft in 2022. Return fraud cost North Carolina retailers another $2.4 billion.
Left unchecked, the report projects that shoplifting could cost the nation’s retailers over $53 billion in 2027.

(Stew Milne for Alabama Reflector)Alabama Secretary of State Wes Allen on Monday called for those who received political contributions from a Georgia man accused of running a $140 million Ponzi scheme to return them.
At least three elected Alabama Republican officials over the last four years received contributions from Edwin Brant Frost IV, an investor whose family is influential in the Georgia Republican Party, and his investment entities, which have been accused of raising funds through fraudulent means.
“I take allegations of financial fraud seriously, especially when that fraud bleeds into campaign finance. I encourage any Alabamians who have been involved to cooperate fully with law enforcement, including the SEC and our Alabama Securities Commission, to ensure that the victims who have been misled may be made whole,” Allen said.
The Alabama Secretary of State’s Office oversees campaign finance reporting but does not have the power to investigate or prosecute alleged violations of the law or compel the return of contributions.

A lawsuit filed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on July 10 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia alleged that Frost and his associated investment firms raised at least $140 million between 2014 and 2025 through fraudulent means. The lawsuit further alleges that Frost used $570,000 of the misappropriated money for political donations. According to campaign finance records, Frost, members of his family or his businesses made at least $132,000 in contributions to Alabama politicians and political action committees (PACs).
Georgia man accused of running $140M Ponzi scheme contributed to 3 Alabama officials

Former Rep. Andrew Sorrell, R-Muscle Shoals, now the Alabama state auditor and a candidate for Secretary of State; Rep. Ben Harrison, R-Elkmont; and Alabama State Board of Education member Allen Long were among the Alabama politicians who accepted contributions either from Frost or one of his various investment firms.
Sorrell and his PAC, Alabama Christian Citizens, collectively received at least $71,000 in contributions from the Frost family and their investment entities. Hours after being contacted for a comment, he claimed in a written statement that he was among the 300 people who fell victim to the scheme.
According to campaign finance records, Alabama Christian Citizens, Sorrell’s PAC, made a loan of $29,000 to First Liberty Building & Loan, one of Frost’s companies, in April 2024. According to Alabama election law, a PAC may issue a loan for “the purpose of influencing the result of an election.”
Sorrell, as well as Harrison, who received over $21,000 in donations from Brant in 2022, stated that they would make efforts to return the funds in their statements last week.
Long, a conservative member of the Alabama State Board of Education who received a $40,000 donation from First National Investments in December 2023, an unusually high amount in ALBOE campaigns, did not return a request for comment last week. Another message was left on Monday.
Other recipients of Frost’s political contributions include Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, who last received a donation from Frost in 2019, according to campaign finance records in that state; Florida Gov.

This while our state is booming economically and ranked No. 2 nationally as the best climate for business. What is wrong? Do our state legislators not care? Or do we not care as the voting public?
Please read the following disgusting facts:
Inadequate school funding

Research shows that school funding (both the amount and how it is spent) has a significant impact on student outcomes – including test scores and graduation rates. This relationship is especially strong for low-income students.
North Carolina ranks 48th in the country in per-student spending, falling nearly $5,000 below the national average, and 49th in funding effort, or the amount of spending on public education as a percentage of the state’s economy (GDP).

Teacher pay

Low compensation is consistently cited as the top reason educators are considering leaving their jobs. And incentives previously provided to encourage candidates to enter and remain in the teaching profession (e.g. longevity pay, master’s pay, retiree health benefits) have largely been eliminated.
North Carolina ranks 39th in the nation for starting teacher pay (about $42,500 on average) and 43rd in the nation for average teacher pay ($58,300 on average).
Average teacher pay in North Carolina fell more than $13,700 below the national average salary of $72,030 and below the minimum living wage for one adult and one child ($58,411).
North Carolina educators earn 25% less than comparable college graduates.

Educator working conditions

Teachers are the No. 1 school-related factor in student outcomes.
Teachers are experiencing significant burnout due to increasing workloads and class sizes, challenging working conditions, and lack of adequate support staff.
Attrition for North Carolina teachers was nearly 10% and the vacancy rate was 7.6% in the 2023-24 school year.
The burnout rate for K-12 educators outpaces all other professions nationally.
North Carolina has the 4th-highest out-of-pocket spending by teachers on classroom supplies.

Taxpayer-funded private school voucher expansion and exclusion

In 2023, the NC General Assembly expanded the Opportunity Scholarship program (taxpayer-funded vouchers for students to attend private schools) to include eligibility for all families with no income cap. Legislators also removed the requirement of having previously attended public schools.
In 2024-25, 42% of Opportunity Scholarship recipients statewide were in the two highest income tiers, coming from families making $110,000 or more annually for a family of four. Expansion of the program has primarily benefited students who were already enrolled in private schools and those living in urban counties.
Of the top 200 schools receiving vouchers, 89% discriminate in the admission process in some way (e.g. based on religion, sexual orientation, disability, gender identity, family values, academics).

Access to state-funded pre-K

Only 57% of eligible 4-year-olds are enrolled in state-funded NC Pre-K.

Student test scores

In 2024, 37% of 3rd-8th graders in North Carolina earned a college and career ready score on the end-of-grade math exam.
In 2024, 31% of 3rd-8th graders in North Carolina earned a college and career ready score on the end-of-grade reading exam.
Significant academic achievement gaps persist across racial and socioeconomic demographics.

The House’s version of the state budget this year looks very good and supportive of our public schools, especially our teachers. That’s thanks in large part to Rep. Donny Lambeth, R-Forsyth. But House members need support in their negotiations with the Senate.
All North Carolinians should lend their voice to this cause. We can and must do better.

Sign up for their newsletters at ckbe.at/newsletters
Federal funds for before- and after-school programs that were frozen for weeks will start flowing to states, a senior official with the Office of Management and Budget confirmed Friday.
The budget office has finished reviewing the 21st Century Community Learning Centers program and will release $1.3 billion on Monday, according to a copy of the email sent to states by the U.S. Department of Education on Friday.
That money was put on hold after the Trump administration announced it was reviewing nearly $7 billion in education funds that schools expected to receive at the beginning of July.
The move will bring some relief to school districts that have been scrambling to figure out how to address sudden budget gaps, and whether they should move forward with plans to hire certain staff or run certain programs.
[RELATED: CT sues Trump admin. to restore $53.6M in frozen funds for education]
But school leaders and public education advocates caution they are not out of the woods yet, as billions more in federal funds, including money meant to boost academic offerings in schools and help the children of migrant farmworkers, are still on hold.
“For families and communities that want to see their children attend schools with well-trained teachers, with support for English learners, with well-rounded curricular offerings, the fight is not over,” said Sasha Pudelski, the director of advocacy at The School Superintendents Association, which has been lobbying for the full release of the frozen funds.
The decision to release the funds comes two days after 10 Republican senators, led by Sen. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, sent a letter to Russell Vought, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, calling for the release of the funds. It was a rare example of Republicans openly criticizing the administration and spoke to how widely the cuts were felt.
On Friday, Capito said the release of the after-school funds was “in direct response” to the Republican senators’ letter in a post on the social media site X.
Two dozen states had sued the Trump administration seeking to pry the funds loose, and several Democrats in Congress and a group of Democratic governors had also urged the release of the funds.
In a press release, Jodi Grant, the executive director of Afterschool Alliance, which represents after-school providers and programs across the country, said that the release of the funds had brought “an enormous sigh of relief.”
But Grant warned that disbursement delays had already “caused massive chaos and harm, with summer learning programs abruptly shutting down and a large number of afterschool programs cancelling plans to open in the fall.” In other cases, programs fell behind on hiring staff, drawing up agreements with schools, and registering kids for the new school year.
Erik Peterson, Afterschool Alliance’s senior vice president of policy, said in an interview that the funding disruption had hit rural communities especially hard, and some programs had closed unexpectedly in Ohio, Tennessee, and Utah. Now, programs will have to put in extra work to rebuild trust with families and communities whose services were disrupted, he said.
“A lot of that damage potentially has been done,” Peterson said.
The Trump administration previously said it was looking into after-school and other grant programs because many had “been grossly misused to subsidize a radical leftwing agenda.”
[RELATED: What CT school districts would feel federal cuts the most?]
The budget office official said Friday that “guardrails have been put in place to ensure these funds are not used in violation” of any of President Donald Trump’s executive orders. States will have to certify compliance with the U.S. Constitution and several federal anti-discrimination laws, and the Education Department will continue to review spending to ensure compliance, the email to states said.
Needing to comply with federal civil rights laws to receive funds isn’t new, but the Trump administration has advanced new interpretations of those laws to bar many common practices designed to make education programs more equitable. Democratic-led states sued over a similar Trump policy requiring schools to certify they are not engaging in certain diversity, equity, and inclusion practices to get federal funds.
Federal officials warned states that using funds on “unallowable activities” could result in the loss of funds. Some state education departments are reviewing the certification requirement, Peterson said.

,DC,2025-07-21 15:25:16+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Judge orders Trump administration to ‘stop violating the law!’ and publish spending details,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/judge-orders-trump-administration-stop-violating-law-and-publish-spending-details,,"WASHINGTON — A federal judge on Monday ordered the Trump administration to once again publish details about the pace at which it plans to spend money approved by Congress.U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia Judge Emmet Sullivan wrote in his ruling that Congress “has sweeping authority” to require the president to post a website detailing how it doles out taxpayer dollars throughout the year.“As explained in this Memorandum Opinion, there is nothing unconstitutional about Congress requiring the Executive Branch to inform the public of how it is apportioning the public’s money,” he wrote. “Defendants are therefore required to stop violating the law!”The ruling won’t take effect until Thursday at 10 a.m. Eastern, giving the Trump administration time to appeal and to seek the ruling be put on hold during the appeals process.Sullivan was appointed to the federal district court by President Bill Clinton but was selected for two prior judicial appointments by President Ronald Reagan and President George H. W. Bush.Website pulled downMore than two years ago, Congress began requiring the White House budget office to publicly post apportionment information and the Biden administration took that step, though Trump officials pulled down the website in March.That decision led to two separate lawsuits, one from Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington and another from the Protect Democracy Project.Apportionments are the first step the executive branch takes when spending money appropriated by Congress. The documents and their footnotes usually detail how quickly, or how slowly, departments and agencies plan to send money out the door throughout the fiscal year.The documents and the public website would have been a window into whether the Trump administration was impounding, or refusing to spend, funding that lawmakers have said it should allocate on behalf of taxpayers.Trump administration protested provisionAn attorney for the Department of Justice argued during a May hearing the Trump administration believes the provision is unconstitutional and seeks to micromanage how the executive branch spends federal funds throughout the year.The DOJ lawyer also said posting the information within two business days, as called for in the law, would require the White House budget office to divert staff from other work.Lawyers for CREW and Protect Democracy Project told the judge the White House was in clear violation of the law and that the data is valuable information that helps the organizations monitor if a president were to cease spending on programs funded by Congress.The watchdog organization attorneys noted during that hearing the Government Accountability Office is looking into dozens of instances where the administration held onto congressionally approved funding instead of spending it.They said the Freedom of Information Act, or FOIA, wasn’t a helpful alternative to the website since it can take months or years for organizations to get a response to their request.Public’s right to see decisionsSullivan wrote in the 60-page ruling the Trump administration “complaining about the extra work” that goes along with posting the information on a public website represents “a management issue; not a constitutional one.”“Here, Congress has determined that OMB’s apportionment decisions should be publicly available so that, among other things, it and the public can see whether they are consistent with congressional appropriations,” Sullivan wrote, adding the website aids Congress with “its undisputed oversight role.”“The Acts do not dictate how OMB should apportion funds, nor do they establish a congressional management role in the administration of apportionments,” Sullivan wrote. “The Acts merely require that the final apportionment decisions be made publicly available to provide transparency to Congress and the public.”Sullivan rejected an argument from the Trump administration that publicly sharing details about the pace at which it’s spending taxpayer dollars was unconstitutional because it required “the disclosure of privileged information.”“There is no evidence in the record remotely supporting the notion that the apportionment documents are presidential communications or are in any way subject to the presidential communications privilege,” Sullivan wrote. “Accordingly, the Court rejects this constitutional claim.”Advocates applaud rulingCerin Lindgrensavage, counsel for Protect Democracy Project, wrote in a statement the judge’s ruling “makes clear that the executive branch cannot simply ignore appropriations laws they disagree with on policy grounds, no matter what President (Donald) Trump or OMB Director Russell Vought thinks.“Congress passed a law making sure the American public could see how their taxpayer dollars are being spent, and we will continue to hold the administration accountable for making good on that promise.”Nikhel Sus, deputy chief counsel at CREW, wrote in a separate statement that the organization applauds “the court’s thorough and well-reasoned decision, which reaffirms Congress’s constitutional authority to require public disclosure of how taxpayer dollars are spent.“Americans have a right to know how taxpayer money is being spent. Ensuring public access to this information serves as a critical check on the executive branch’s abuse and misuse of federal funds.”The White House budget office and Department of Justice did not immediately return a request for comment about the ruling or whether the administration would appeal to the Circuit Court.U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee ranking member Patty Murray, D-Wash., wrote in a statement that “the law is clear as day: every president is required to show the public how they are spending taxpayer dollars, and it is past time President Trump and Russ Vought get the website they illegally ripped down back up.”Senate Appropriations Chairwoman Susan Collins, R-Maine, didn’t immediately return a request for comment.",,,,2025-07-21 11:56:57.640022

(Photo by Jill Hummels/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Evergy is claiming $55 million in damages after BNSF failed to deliver coal in 2022, the utility company said in a complaint filed with federal regulators.
In a case opened in 2024 and in litigation before the Surface Transportation Board, Evergy said BNSF did not deliver coal from Wyoming’s Powder River Basin to its coal-fired generating stations, the Lawrence Energy Center in Lawrence, Kansas, and Iatan Station near Weston, Missouri.
The Surface Transportation Board is the federal agency tasked with regulating different types of surface transportation, primarily freight railroad services.
An Evergy spokeswoman referred questions about the case to documents that have been filed. BNSF did not respond to a request for comment.
In its filings, Evergy accuses BNSF of failing to provide rail service to Iatan and Lawrence stations in 2022, even though their scheduled volumes that year were consistent with previous years’ volumes.
“There is no plausible scenario in which BNSF could be said to have been surprised by or uncertain as to Complainants’ transportation needs,” testimony said. “Even if BNSF somehow credibly could claim ignorance at the outset, Evergy regularly and consistently communicated to BNSF that the limitations were leading to coal volume shortfalls, with predictably serious and adverse economic consequences.”
Evergy said damages were caused by “lost profits and opportunity costs that exceed $20,000,000 before interest and additional power purchase and other incurred costs in excess of $35,000,000 before interest.”
“The additional costs incurred by Evergy as a consequence of BNSF’s service defaults ultimately are borne by millions of Midwestern electric ratepayers,” Evergy’s filing said.
In addition, Evergy alleged it was well-reported that BNSF leadership decisions caused delivery challenges.
“It is a matter of public record that any employee or locomotive power shortages that BNSF experienced in 2022 were a consequence of its own deliberate decisions and operations plans put in place well before the Covid pandemic occurred, not the result of Covid or any other circumstance beyond its control,” testimony said.
BNSF disagreed, saying the pandemic affected business operations.
“As sections of the nation emerged from the pandemic lockdowns in the second half of 2021 at varying rates, demand for rail transportation spiked significantly,” the company’s filings said. “The combination of lack of employee, equipment and warehouse resources throughout the supply chain, along with railroad-specific challenges, resulted in network-wide fluidity problems.”
The company also pointed to “historic snowfall” in the Powder River Basin in April 2022 that affected operations.
On the current schedule, BNSF must reply to Evergy’s evidence by Oct. 23. Final briefs are due by Dec. 29.

U.S. District Judge Henry Wingate on Sunday approved the request for a temporary restraining order sought by a coalition of civil rights and legal organizations on behalf of students, parents and educators.
The American Civil Liberties Union and the Mississippi Center for Justice are representing the plaintiffs, who filed the lawsuit alongside other groups on June 9 against the state’s education boards. Wingate heard arguments on June 24 from top lawyers from both organizations, as well as Special Assistant Attorney General Rex Shannon, who represented the state-agency defendants. 
Shannon objected to the temporary restraining order in court and argued the plaintiffs didn’t have legal standing to file the lawsuit. He also admitted his office was limited in the arguments it could make because of the litigation’s compressed schedule.
The order is in effect for 14 days, and allows Wingate to extend it for an additional 14 days. Next, the plaintiffs plan to seek a preliminary injunction — a longer-lasting court order that would continue to freeze the state law. 
The state could appeal Wingate’s decision to the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, though it’s unclear if they will do so. 
“In this Court’s eye, these accounts appear to reflect a broad, chilling effect across public institutions and community organizations,” Wingate wrote in his order, of individual reports about the impact of the bill. “The evidence, at this stage, demonstrates a clear and ongoing deprivation of constitutional rights in a manner not compensable by money damages — thus warranting injunctive relief.”
In April, legislators passed House Bill 1193, which prevents public schools from creating diversity, equity and inclusion offices, engaging in “divisive” concepts and hiring people based on their race, sex, color or national origin. The State Board of Education and the Institutions of Higher Learning recently approved policies that create a complaint and investigation process for violations to the law. 
Local school boards have to create their own policies, too, which MCJ attorney Rob McDuff argued in court would be a lengthy and arduous process. 
“This statute would throw our schools into chaos if it’s allowed to go forward,” he said. “As we approach the fall semester, teachers are preparing their lesson plans … people need to know that at least for the moment, enforcement of this law is going to stop while the court further considers the issues.”
Joshua Tom, ACLU of Mississippi’s legal director, said the law’s vagueness was unconstitutional. 
“‘Engage’ is not defined,” he said. “How does a teacher or student ‘engage’? Do a mandatory reading? Talk about it in class? What if they go on a field trip and one of the concepts is introduced. Is that engaging? It’s not clear.”
He also noted that the statute was already making an impact — in an effort to comply with the law, the University of Mississippi withdrew its funding from Oxford’s annual Pride Parade a few weeks ago and prohibited university departments from marching in their capacity as professors, he said.

(Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)I never thought I would see the day when U.S. Senators John Thune and Mike Rounds and Rep. Dusty Johnson would sell out their South Dakota values and upbringing to become puppets of a president.
Nor did I think I would see them damage institutions that are at the core of South Dakota’s society. Unfortunately, it appears that President Donald Trump is so powerful that personal values no longer matter.
Last week, all three voted to rescind $1.1 billion in funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting — funding that all three had previously voted to approve.
It’s clear that National Public Radio was Trump’s target. He believes taxpayer money shouldn’t be going to support news he perceives as a challenge to his line of thinking.
US House sends bill to Trump yanking funding for NPR, PBS, foreign aid; SD congressman votes yes

But often when we act hastily and with little thought, the grenades we throw miss the intended target and damage innocent victims.
Such is the case here. Only 1% of NPR’s operating budget and 15% of the Public Broadcasting System budget comes from the corporation, and both will survive. Most of the corporation’s funding goes to support local public broadcasting systems, which likely will not.
“After the cut, NPR is still going to be NPR and PBS is still going to be PBS,” said Julie Overgaard, executive director of South Dakota Public Broadcasting. “They are all going to continue to exist.”
So will public stations in the major metropolitan areas.
“It’s the places like us that will suffer the most,” Overgaard said. “The reason the CPB was set up was so that rural communities can share in a collective public media.
“We don’t have enough people and wealth to exist on our own. The very thing they were trying to eliminate will survive. Instead, it’s something very important to our state that will be eliminated.”
Programs like “South Dakota Focus,” “In the Moment,” “Dakota Life” and “Jazz Nightly,” along with statehouse coverage and broadcasts of high school sports and activities, may all disappear.
What a legacy for Thune, Rounds and Johnson — the men who destroyed SDPB.
Last week while casting their votes, they hid behind the need to cut the budget deficit. Funny. They found deficit religion only a few weeks after they voted for Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill Act that increases the deficit. The more talented politicians become, the better they are at creating alternative realities.
Here’s the reality of SDPB’s future.
The impending loss of $2 million in funding from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting may force SDPB to quickly cut up to 20 people from its 60-member staff. The damage likely will be worse. Even if SDPB could raise $2 million in three months, it probably wouldn’t matter.
The Corporation for Public Broadcasting is essentially dead as of Sept. 30, severing the technical backbone of SDPB’s network. It facilitates the sharing of programming from network to network. It facilitates emergency alerts and emergency alerts. It handles SDPB’s website and negotiates music broadcast rights nationally.
“The situation is grave, fluid and chaotic,” Overgaard said.
Rounds acted like he was the champion leading up to the vote, holding out to the last minute as he secured an agreement to find $9.4 million in funding elsewhere for communication towers on Native American reservations. That’s not likely to be sustainable in the long-term.
“It’s a nice gesture, but it is hollow in its result,” Overgaard said of Rounds’ action. “It will still result in the demise of tribal stations.”
Programs like Native American News and other nationally shared music and talk programs likely won’t be produced, and the national network that distributes it won’t exist. Money and technical support for local programming also disappear.










The very thing they were trying to eliminate will survive. Instead, it’s something very important to our state that will be eliminated.


– Julie Overgaard, SDPB executive director


SDPB had just survived a funding fight in the South Dakota Legislature after then-Gov. Kristi Noem suggested cutting $3.6 million in state funding, also largely aimed at silencing NPR. Legislators were inundated with calls, and the result was an overwhelming restoration of funding.
“We know we are very important in people’s daily lives,” Overgaard said. “They trust us in moments of crisis and joy. This has nothing to do with whether we are a valued service. This is politics. I don’t know that we ever had a chance to win this.”
The only chance is for federal funding to be restored in the upcoming federal budget, perhaps absent taxpayer support for NPR and PBS.
SDPB supporters will have opportunities to speak with their congressional delegates during the upcoming August recess. Looking at constituents in the eye can be uncomfortable.
Trump puppets are not what we thought we elected. Thune, Rounds and Johnson, what have you become?

This week on The Codcast, it’s the state angle on artificial intelligence.

HOST: Jennifer Smith
GUEST: Sabrina Mansur, director of the Massachusetts Artificial Intelligence (AI) Hub







THE STATE OF Massachusetts is in the artificial intelligence business, starting with $100 million set aside in a 2024 economic development bill to create and fund the Massachusetts Artificial Intelligence Hub. It’s an effort to supercharge the Bay State’s role in the AI race, which has seen billions of investor dollars steered toward California-based companies. 
Massachusetts is no new entry to artificial intelligence, though, AI Hub director Sabrina Mansur told Jennifer Smith on The Codcast.  
The amount of money spent on artificial intelligence research as compared to the size of the state is quite high, Mansur said, and many of the area’s premier research institutions have been plugging away on artificial intelligence-related projects for decades. Boosting that work, state officials say, is another move in the Massachusetts competitiveness play. 
“Massachusetts is wanting to do this thoughtfully,” Mansur said, referencing the state’s strategic task force that met for a year to make recommendations on keeping the state a leader in the AI sector and “make sure that folks are prepared for this very, very rapid adoption of this technology.” 
Artificial intelligence, which Mansur generally defines as “systems that perform tasks that typically require human intelligence,” is experiencing what for some looks like a promising boom and to others the start of a tech bubble. Generative AI – which uses large sets of training data to produce images, text, and video based on user prompts – is proliferating across mainstream technology, social media networks, and is increasingly being incorporated into workplaces. 
The promise, to those like Mansur encouraging AI adoption, is new ways to recognize voices, analyze data, pinpoint patterns, and aid an array of areas of human life. She uses ChatGPT, the dominant generative AI tool, to craft bedtime stories for her children and help her plan her workflows, for instance.  
Mansur’s background includes work for Draper Labs in Cambridge and the driverless car technology company Motional. She describes the AI Hub as a convener, involving about 200 people so far, between the state and educational institutions and companies working to develop and incorporate artificial intelligence.  
Students with Northeastern University’s Innovate MA co-op program, for instance, worked on AI-based projects, including MBTA and MassHealth customer service improvements, improving state grant access, working with Massachusetts Department of Transportation highway design engineers, and creating a “generative AI sandbox” for state employees to experiment with AI tools. A teacher training pilot aimed at bringing artificial intelligence into classrooms launched in late June.  
Skeptics of rapid adoption point to a host of objections. They include the significant energy and environmental cost of training and running these models, the common inaccuracies within the tools, massive copyright infringement claims, workforce implications if managers decide to lay off employees believing AI can do their jobs better and cheaper, and the overarching concern that these tools are getting people out of practice with critical thinking skills – or worse, not developing them in the first place. 
“AI is a technology that could become a force for good or a force for ill,” Mansur said. “That depends on our actions as people and how we’re using it. So the AI Hub is focused on applying the AI, it’s focused on helping people adopt AI into the work they’re doing, and upscaling themselves in the work they’re doing with AI. We really are focused on the good, and the adoption of the good, and making it useful and productive.” 
On the episode, Mansur discusses the structure and purpose of the AI Hub (1:50), its ethical frameworks (13:15), and the energy needs of artificial intelligence tools (23:30).

(Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)U.S. Rep. Jason Crow, a Democrat from Centennial, said Sunday that he had been denied entry to an immigration detention center in his district in violation of federal law.
The Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center in Aurora, operated by private prison company GEO Group, is the only such facility in Colorado. Despite federal law guaranteeing members of Congress the right to enter ICE facilities “for the purpose of conducting oversight,” Crow’s office said Sunday that he had been “unlawfully denied access.”
“Providing oversight is critical to my job in Congress,” Crow said in a statement. “The law is clear that Members of Congress have the legal right to conduct unannounced oversight of federal detention facilities.”

Oversight visits by members of Congress have become a flashpoint in 2025 as President Donald Trump’s administration dramatically expands the scope of ICE detention and removal operations to achieve its mass deportation targets. One Democratic House member, Rep. LaMonica McIver of New Jersey, has been charged with interfering with federal law enforcement officers during a chaotic scene outside an ICE facility in Newark, during which officers also arrested the city’s mayor, Ras Baraka, on a trespassing charge.
The Department of Homeland Security has publicly instructed members of Congress to request visits to ICE detention centers a week ahead of time. Federal law, however, doesn’t permit the department to impose such conditions.
“Nothing in this section may be construed to require a member of Congress to provide prior notice of the intent to enter a facility … for the purpose of conducting oversight,” states Public Law 118-47, enacted by Congress and signed into law in 2024.
“Access to ICE Processing Centers is governed by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement,” Christopher Ferreira, a GEO Group spokesperson, told Newsline in an email. “As such, we would refer you to ICE.”
ICE did not respond to a request for comment.
The Aurora ICE detention center, with a total capacity of 1,532 detainees, has long been the target of criticism from activists over allegations of inhumane conditions and dehumanizing treatment.
Caroline Dias Goncalves, a 19-year-old Utah nursing student who was detained in the facility for 15 days last month after her arrest by ICE agents in Grand Junction, called her stay in the facility a “nightmare.” She said that detainees were forced to eat soggy food — “even the bread would come wet,” she said — and that detainees who didn’t speak English were treated worse than those who did.
Crow, who has conducted regular oversight of the ICE facility in his district since being sworn in to Congress in 2019, said that work will continue.
“Since President Trump was elected, this administration has tried to intimidate members of Congress from doing their jobs,” he said in a statement. “I will not be deterred from conducting lawful oversight. I will continue working to hold the Trump administration accountable for its actions.”

And lately, since Louisiana lawmakers discussed banning pharmacy benefit managers from owning their own pharmacies, I’ve heard arguments that such a ban would somehow harm military families, especially those who use Tricare.
But those arguments overlook a simple fact: for many military families, access to quality pharmaceutical care is already broken, and the pharmacy benefit managers helped break it.
The original purpose of these corporate middlemen was to negotiate drug prices and help lower costs. But today, companies like Express Scripts — a Cigna Group-owned company that has held the exclusive Tricare pharmacy contract since 2009 — use their unmatched power to control both the benefit and the pharmacy. They steer patients into their own mail-order operations like Accredo, a subsidiary of Express Scripts, reaping immense profits at the expense of locally operated, small-business pharmacies.
Consider that in August 2022 alone, more than 15,000 pharmacies left the Tricare network after the pharmacy benefit managers offered reimbursement contracts that didn’t even cover the cost of dispensing medication. That shift impacted more than 400,000 military families who were forced to choose between going out of network and paying higher costs or using PBM-owned mail-order pharmacies that offer little to no customer support and are prone to delays.
So when critics worry that if Louisiana were to restrict PBM pharmacy ownership, it would cause pharmacy closures and disrupt veteran care, I shake my head. It is the pharmacy benefit managers — not independent pharmacies — that are already doing this by forcing providers out of the Tricare network and reimbursing non-PBM competitors — our brick-and-mortar small businesses — at such insignificant rates that they cannot survive. It’s a system designed to limit access exclusively to the benefit of the pharmacy benefit manager.
What often gets lost in these conversations is what care actually looks like at the community level. Despite these network restrictions, Tricare patients still walk into Louisiana’s independently operated pharmacies seeking care because of the poor service they’ve experienced at the hands of the PBM mail-order pharmacy. Their medications may be lost, delayed indefinitely or spoiled in transit, and they’ve grown tired of trying to get help through a distant PBM call center. In some cases, these patients are happy to go out of network and pay out of pocket because the cash price is lower than what Express Scripts would charge. They choose local care not only because it costs less, but because it’s safer, faster and more personal.
Fortunately, the more than 600 independent pharmacies throughout Louisiana stand ready and able to serve our veterans and military families — if only the system would let us. We have the training and the community relationships to provide high-quality care. But as long as pharmacy benefit managers are allowed to both set the reimbursement rate and steer patients to their own pharmacies, we’ll never have the chance to compete fairly.
At the Louisiana Independent Pharmacies Association, we’re happy that Gov. Jeff Landry and state legislators are having meaningful conversations about reform, and we are eager to be part of a solution that provides all patients fair prices, local access and better care. We think the best solution will be built on access, transparency and real accountability — not vertical integration and self-dealing.
Veterans and military families have earned a health care system that prioritizes their needs, not corporate profits. Whatever direction Louisiana pharmacy benefit manager reform takes, I hope we continue to focus on what works — and who it really works for.

Laura Kelly. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Insurance Commissioner Vicki Schmidt expects to be repeatedly asked two policy questions while campaigning for the Kansas Republican Party’s nomination for governor.
Both trace to her years representing a Topeka-area district in the Kansas Senate, but continue to resonate with voters because they delve into the volatile issues of taxation and abortion.
In 2012, Schmidt voted with Republican colleagues for a bill slashing state income taxes. It was signed by GOP Gov. Sam Brownback under the mistaken belief that lowering the tax burden on wealthy individuals would unleash trickle-down economic forces beneficial to all. Over the subsequent five years before repeal, revenue to the state treasury cratered. Lawmakers tried to fill the shortfall by raising the state sales tax and cutting budgets for core state services, including education and transportation.
“It is a vote I regret,” Schmidt said in an interview for the Kansas Reflector podcast. “There were a lot of Republicans, including me, that did vote for that.”


She said the GOP strategy in the Senate was to place the tax bill in the hands of a House-Senate negotiating committee so a more balanced reform plan could be drafted. Instead of revisions, the House concurred with the Senate and Brownback signed the bill into law.
“We know how that all turned out,” Schmidt said. “I sincerely regret that I trusted the process to move that along, but I will tell you that I learned a big lesson that day. You can’t always trust the process.”
Schmidt, who served 14 years in the Senate and is in her second four-year term as state insurance commissioner, will also be challenged during the campaign to explain her views on abortion rights.
The Kansas Supreme Court issued a decision in 2019 affirming Kansans had personal bodily autonomy that included the right to decide whether to continue a pregnancy. In 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade that legalized abortion nationwide and made regulation of abortion a state-by-state issue.
Weeks later, Kansas voters overwhelmingly defeated a proposed amendment to the Kansas Constitution designed to allow greater restraint on abortion. The amendment lacked exceptions to save the life of the mother or in cases of rape or incest.
“The (U.S.) Supreme Court did the right thing, in my opinion, of bringing that back to the states and letting the states decide,” Schmidt said. “Like most Kansans, I don’t believe in abortion on demand, like some of the far left do. … But I do believe in reasonable exceptions, and I believe that that is where most Kansans are. ”
 
Telling the truth
Schmidt, 69, was born and raised in Wichita. She graduated from Wichita South High School, where she met her future husband at age 15. In her youth, she made deliveries for a pharmacy and saw how those professionals helped people. She enrolled in pharmacy school at the University of Kansas and has spent more than 40 years working as a pharmacist. Her husband, Mike, became an orthopedic surgeon. They raised two sons.
In the 1990s, Republican Gov. Bill Graves appointed Schmidt to the state Board of Pharmacy. That led her to testify before a committee of the Legislature. She said a couple lawmakers fell asleep during the hearing.
“As a taxpayer, that didn’t sit very well with me. I thought I could do better,” she said.
She ran for an open seat in the Senate and ended up serving District 20 from 2005 to 2019. She was elected insurance commissioner during the 2018 campaign. She was reelected in 2022, a race she won by more than 250,000 votes among nearly 1 million cast.
In her announcement for governor, Schmidt said she was the type of person who told people the truth rather than tell folks what they wanted to hear.
“It’s important for a governor to to tell the truth,” she said. “Sometimes you have to deliver hard news to people.”
 
‘Run on my record’
Schmidt said she was prepared for a competitive Republican primary in 2026 given announced candidates included Secretary of State Scott Schwab, former Gov. Jeff Colyer and Senate President Ty Masterson. Others seeking the Republican nomination include podcaster Doug Billings, former Wichita school board member Joy Eakins, former Johnson County Commissioner Charlotte O’Hara and business owner Stacy Rogers.
“I’m going to run on my record, and again, I think I have a great track record to run on,” she said. “I am the candidate that … received the most votes in the last two statewide elections no matter what the office was. I think that the voters of Kansas have spoken to my electability, and I also think that they have put their trust in me.”
Before entering the Legislature, Schmidt said she identified errors in the state’s drug manufacturer rebate program that, once remedied, delivered $390 million in benefit to the state. In the state insurance commission office, she said her staff supported consumers with about $145 million in insurance claim assistance. The department also estimated that procedural reforms helped save businesses about $75 million, she said.
Schmidt, like Colyer and Schwab, had an encounter with cancer. She was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2023. She had surgery and radiation treatments and was declared free of cancer.
“I feel great, and I do believe that I have the energy necessary to carry out a campaign,” she said.
Her illness convinced her to encourage Kansans to get mammograms in an effort to identify threats as soon as possible.
“Coming in front of Kansans and telling everybody that I had breast cancer was something I had to think about for a few seconds,” she said. “I try to talk about early detection and mammograms. It saved my life, and I know it could save others.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/P7161557-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-07-21 09:56:45.636526

USC is one of a growing number of schools nationwide establishing a center focused on civics education and encouraging civil debate amid political polarization in the country. (Photo by Travis Bell/STATEHOUSE CAROLINA/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — The University of South Carolina is one of a growing number of schools nationwide establishing a center focused on civics education and encouraging civil debate amid political polarization in the country.
South Carolina’s largest university system is establishing its Center for American Civic Leadership and Public Discourse following approval from the school’s governing board late last month.
According to a statement from the university, the center is in response to “a growing need for civil discourse, cooperation across partisan lines, and a greater understanding of the core ideals and values that shaped America.”
“The value this new academic center brings is its focus on equipping students with the knowledge, perspectives, and reasoning skills for meaningful interactions as citizens and community leaders.” added USC President Michael Amiridis.
These centers popping up at colleges across the country come as surveys and academic studies show a declining rate of civics knowledge and understanding of the core functions of government.
Less than half of Americans can name most of the rights protected under the First Amendment and under two-thirds can name the three branches of government, according to an annual survey conducted since 2014 by the University of Pennsylvania’s Annenberg Public Policy Center.
“I do think that these centers speak to a real need and a desire that a lot of students have — learning for the sake of learning — but also includes a real interest in pursuing questions such as the nature of citizenship, how people can be more attuned to what the responsibilities of citizenship and civic leadership are all about,” said Christopher Tollefsen, a professor of philosophy at USC who is serving as the center’s interim executive director until a permanent director can be hired.
Tollefson said these centers have also opened up a space for debate, discussion and disagreement, rather than “just shouting each other.”
“Polarization is a dominant theme that we see whenever people talk about what our political life and our political language is like,” Tollefson added. “Everybody has a sense that it’s no longer possible to engage in a free exchange of ideas and arguments and to fully participate in discussion with their neighbors without a feeling that the situation is very fraught. I think we’re trying to address that.”
For example, as protests erupted on college campuses in the wake of a surprise attack on southern Israel by Hamas militants on Oct. 7, 2023, and the subsequent war that broke out between Israel and Palestine, a student group at Yale University gathered in small groups to talk about the conflict.
At USC, Tollefson expects to bring on between six and eight new professors over the next five years who will teach within various departments at the university in addition to working within the center.
Similar to other student organizations, students can sign up to participate in what the center is calling a scholars program in addition to events that will be open to public.
Tollefson also eventually hopes to offer a couple of academic minors, such as one focused on philosophy, politics and economics, through the center.
While some, such as Stanford University’s Hoover Institution and the James Madison program at Princeton University, where Tollefson was a visiting fellow, have been around for decades, there’s been a more recent movement nationwide to establish such centers.
A good number of these in recent years have come out of a push from state legislatures, starting with Arizona State University in 2016. Paul Carrese, the ASU school’s founding director, will serve as one of several external advisors to USC’s new center.
And in 2022, backed by Gov. Ron DeSantis, the massive Hamilton Center started at the University of Florida.
At least 13 public university campuses across eight states — Arizona, Florida, Ohio, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Utah — have established civics units, according to reporting by Inside Higher Education. Legislatures in Iowa and West Virginia also passed requirements for centers, according to reporting by States Newsroom affiliates.
Private and Ivy League schools, such as Harvard, Johns Hopkins and Yale universities, have also joined the trend.
And in South Carolina, Allen University started the Boeing Institute on Civility with a $1.5 million gift from the aerospace giant that renovated a former hospital building in the neighborhood surrounding the historically Black university in Columbia. The institute held its first event in 2024 with Russell Wigginton, president of the National Civil Rights Museum, and Della Britton, president of the Jackie Robinson Foundation, discussing social justice issues.
Tollefson said USC’s center is different from those at several other public colleges in that it is not legislatively mandated. He said university board Chairman Thad Westbrook is among those leading the push at USC.
“Studying the American civic order and teaching our students to be good citizens should be a core function of higher education in America,” Westbrook said in a statement. “Over the past few years, we have strengthened our policies supporting free speech on campus, and we believe this center will elevate that work with a renewed focus on civil discourse.”
Westbrook, in his statement, also cited the upcoming 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence and planned celebrations in South Carolina around the sestercentennial and the state’s role in the Revolutionary War as a reason for launching the center.
The center’s first public event is set for Sept. 12, featuring Cornel West, of New York’s Union Theological Seminary, and Robert George, of Princeton University, whom USC described “well-known for their collaboration and friendship, despite their disagreement on many issues.”
Both are also on the center’s advisory board.

Sign up for their newsletter here.
Cuts to a major water-quality program in Ohio’s biennial budget will likely weaken efforts to control the spread of toxic blue-green algae in Lake Erie.
The program in question, H2Ohio, has invested millions of dollars in improving water quality throughout the state. Much of that money has gone toward cutting off the supply of nutrients to the aforementioned algae, also known as cyanobacteria, which bloom in massive quantities every summer. The new state budget, which Republican Gov. Mike DeWine signed into law on July 1, drastically cuts funding for those efforts.
Large blooms of cyanobacteria cause problems for pretty much everything that isn’t algae. They block sunlight and create aquatic “dead zones” where there isn’t enough dissolved oxygen for other organisms to survive. They also release toxins that pose significant health risks to humans, especially to people with pre-existing conditions.
David Kennedy, a professor of medicine at the University of Toledo, described a case of a 7-year-old girl with asthma who was exposed to cyanobacteria while swimming in Maumee Bay.
“Her asthma was exacerbated to the point where she needed to be intubated and had a very long, complicated stay in our medical center,” Kennedy said. The girl did eventually recover.
By reducing the nutrients entering the lake each year, scientists and environmental stewards hope to limit how big the algal blooms get. The main culprit is phosphorus, a key component in agricultural fertilizers, both commercially produced and via manure.
“Whenever it rains, that water goes into the soil, it dissolves the phosphorus just like your sugar in a coffee, and then that water leaves the field carrying the dissolved phosphorus,” said Chris Winslow, director of the Ohio Sea Grant College Program at the Ohio State University.
Some of that water finds its way to the Maumee River, then into western Lake Erie, where the phosphorus it carries becomes food for cyanobacteria. The more phosphorus the Maumee brings into the lake, the bigger the bloom that year.
Nathan Manning of the National Center for Water Quality Research at Ohio’s Heidelberg University said as of June 16 this year, researchers had measured 227 metric tons of dissolved phosphorus flowing out of the Maumee. That puts the likely total for the summer around 235 to 273 metric tons.
“The target … for dissolved reactive phosphorus is 240 metric tons. So there’s a good chance that we will stay below or right at that target, which is good news,” Manning said.
Winslow said that’s a sign everyone’s efforts are paying off, though he cautioned that it’s impossible to say for sure unless those efforts are scaled back.
“We assume these things are doing great jobs to trap nutrients, but the only way you know is to stop doing it. So if we go next year, and see that the dissolved phosphorus goes up and these programs are no longer there, it’s a good indication that they were working,” Winslow said.
With the cuts to H2Ohio, that proof may come sooner rather than later. Since its inception in 2019, the program has tackled the phosphorus problem in two ways: by incentivizing farmers to change their practices, and by funding the construction and maintenance of wetlands.
On the agricultural side, the Ohio Department of Agriculture uses H2Ohio money to help farmers limit how much fertilizer runs off their fields. That includes testing soil to determine how much fertilizer a farmer should apply in the first place, as well as training on things like manure management and overwinter cover crops. Thanks to H2Ohio, farmers don’t have to pay for those changes themselves.
Wetland management, which falls under the purview of the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, plays an equally important role. When water passes through a wetland, the plants there act as natural filters, absorbing some of the nutrients before they reach a larger river or lake.
Under the new budget, the Department of Agriculture’s yearly H2Ohio budget is going from $60.8 million to $53.6 million. The Department of Natural Resources is getting hit even harder: Its H2Ohio budget is dropping from $46.6 million to $21.2 million. The Ohio Environmental Protection Agency also gets H2Ohio dollars, mostly to protect drinking water; its budget is falling from $27.5 million to just $7.5 million.

Nate Schlater, senior director of ecological restoration at the environmental and economic development nonprofit Rural Action, is overseeing the construction of a new wetland near the Auglaize River in northwestern Ohio, which feeds into the Maumee. He and his team are using H2Ohio dollars for the project. The land was previously owned by a farmer, who sold it to Rural Action because it was prone to flooding.
Constructing could mean various things depending on the wetland. In some cases, it may be necessary to redirect where a stream flows. In the Auglaize project, the team discovered three cars buried along the stream bank in an effort to control erosion, which will have to be removed. After that, there’s seeding the appropriate plants and ensuring nothing invasive takes root in the new ecosystem.
The Ohio State University’s Winslow said it’s also important to keep monitoring the wetland after it’s finished. That also falls within ODNR’s now-reduced H2Ohio budget.
“You can build a wetland and think it’s gonna work, but then when you step back and monitor it, you’re like, ‘Oh, it’s not working as good as it should, let’s go in and do X, Y and Z,’” Winslow said.
Schlater said the money for this particular wetland has already been allocated and won’t be affected by the new budget. However, he worries the cuts may make it harder to find funding for new projects in northwest Ohio and elsewhere.
“There’s a lot of great water in the state, and there’s also a lot of impaired water in the state,” Schlater said. “The H2Ohio funding opportunity for the state was really providing a lot of money directly impacting water quality, and any reduction in that is essentially less water that’s gonna be improved, preserved or maintained.”
The H2Ohio cuts are not the only setback this year in the effort to contain Lake Erie’s harmful algal blooms. The Trump administration’s staffing cuts at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have forced that agency to suspend its deployment of Environmental Sample Processors, or ESPs, for the rest of the year. An ESP is a device that automatically collects and processes water samples from a body of water—in this case, Lake Erie—and gives researchers back home an almost real-time glimpse of how much toxin is present in a given part of the lake.
Monica Allen, director of public affairs for NOAA Research, wrote in an email that the organization’s Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory will train other staffers on ESPs during the winter months, with the goal of resuming ESP deployment in 2026.
Winslow said the cuts may force scientists to scale back how many places in Lake Erie they can sample. Those samples, which are spread over a large area, are how scientists understand what’s actually happening in the lake.
“The data will never be inaccurate. A scientist or an academic institution, if they take a water sample, they are using the highest level of rigor to analyze those samples,” Winslow said. “The one thing that you might see is the number of places that we can sample is not as broad.”
Some monitoring is done with satellites, which Winslow said should continue operating as normal. It’s understanding the chemicals in the water that may become more challenging.
“I don’t think you’ll see a hit in where the bloom is at and how thick it is, but you may see a delay in our ability to predict toxin in those blooms,” Winslow explained.
Exacerbating the problem in the long run is climate change, which is bringing increased rainfall and higher temperatures to the Great Lakes region.
“We’re seeing warmer temperatures, so the lake tends to warm up faster. This type of organism that causes these harmful algal blooms likes warmer water … so they could start showing up earlier,” Winslow said.
However, Winslow stressed that the relationship between the algal blooms and the warming climate is complex. No matter how conducive the weather is, the overall size of the bloom still depends on how much phosphorus enters the lake. What the weather does affect, he explained, is the timing and duration.
“It’s showing up early and lasting longer this time, but the maximum peak that it reaches is less than when it was cooler,” Winslow said.
Exactly what that means for people in the long run remains to be seen, according to Winslow. It does raise the probability that members of the public will see the blooms, but the peak won’t be as severe.
What could become a problem, Winslow said, is if the earlier blooms come when cyanobacteria are producing the highest amount of toxins. That depends on another nutrient that also leeches out of the soil and into the lake: nitrogen.
Nitrogen levels in Lake Erie are highest around the end of June and early July, he said. “And so what we don’t want is the peak to fall there, because then it means you have a bloom that’s huge and crazy and very, very toxic,” Winslow said.
Climate change also poses a potential threat to the mitigation efforts themselves.
“When you’re designing a wetland, you’re designing a wetland based on a certain river dumping into it, how much water’s coming from that river. Well, if we’re seeing more rainfall, we may have designed the wetlands not big enough, or maybe in the wrong place,” Winslow said. “And for farmers, they lose their nutrients when it rains. So the more rain we’re gonna get, the harder it is for them to keep their nutrients on their fields. So all of these solutions, wetlands and what we pay our farmers to do, … they’re gonna be just harder to do because of climate change, because of more precipitation.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/20170508-nu2-1024x762.png,,,2025-07-21 09:56:45.636526

Brooklyn, New York
Died July 16, 2025
South Burlington, Vermont
Details of services
Funeral services were held Friday July 18 at Ohavi Zedek Synagogue in Burlington, Vermont.


On July 16, 2025, Dr. Arthur S. Kunin, aged 99 years, passed away at his home at the Quarry Hill Residence in South Burlington, Vermont. He was born on August 11, 1925 to Lena Perelman Kunin and Elihu Kunin in Brooklyn, New York. His father, a Kosher butcher in Brooklyn, came to the United States from Belarus when he was a young boy. His mother, born in Burlington, Vermont, from a family of Jewish Lithuanian immigrants, grew up in the Old North End neighborhood known at the time as “Little Jerusalem.” She taught in a one room school house in Alburg, Vermont, before marrying and moving to Brooklyn. Arthur spent each summer of his childhood in Burlington, staying with his grandparents on Decatur Street. He loved playing with his cousin Norman Marks, and was very close to his Aunt Annie Marks.
Arthur cherished his time in the Boy Scouts, becoming an Eagle Scout. In the Scouts he gained a great love of camping and hiking. He attended City College in Brooklyn in the fall of 1943, the first person in his family to attend college. But his time in college was soon cut short by the war.
Arthur’s experiences as a Boy Scout helped prepare him for his service as a combat infantryman in the U.S. Army. After basic training at Fort Benning, he joined the 87th Infantry Division (the Golden Acorn) at Fort Jackson. In October 1944, his regiment sailed to England on the Queen Elizabeth, then converted to a troopship, relying on speed to evade German U-boats. Landing at Le Havre, France in November 1944, he encountered complete devastation. His division was assigned to General Patton’s Third Army, and first attacked German positions in the Saar Valley in France in early December. On the night of December 16, 1944, following German counter-attacks, he volunteered for a mission to rescue wounded Americans from the battlefield. As he and his comrades returned, bearing the wounded on litters, Arthur himself was seriously wounded.
He spent more than 6 months recovering from his injuries in hospitals in Oxford, England and Staten Island, New York. He was awarded the Bronze Star and Purple Heart for his service.
Arthur rarely discussed his wartime experiences until the later years of his life, but he was very proud of his military service. He was deeply affected by the friends he made, and the friends he lost in battle. He loved his country and was grateful for the freedoms and opportunities he enjoyed throughout his life. He shared a true kinship with his fellow veterans on the Shelburne Veterans Memorial Committee.
Through the GI bill, Arthur was able to enroll in Columbia University in 1945, graduating in history and economics in 1948.
He then went on to have a distinguished career in medicine, graduating from the UVM College of Medicine in 1953. He completed his Internship and Residency at Peter Bent Brigham Hospital which included a 2 year research fellowship at Boston University School of Medicine, completing residency training in 1957.
Dr. Kunin began his career as an attending physician and researcher at University of Vermont College of Medicine in 1957. Dr. Arthur Kunin married Madeleine May Kunin in 1959, making their home in Burlington, Vermont.
From 1962 to 1963, Arthur completed an additional 2-year research fellowship at The Massachusetts General Hospital. He returned to UVM for the remainder of his career, becoming one of the first full time faculty members at the College of Medicine. His research included calcium metabolism, mitochondria and as the artificial kidney and transplant came into clinical use, practicing clinical nephrology. As a staff physician at the Mary Fletcher Hospital, he was known for the excellence of his medical care, and the deep empathy with which he cared for his patients. He was beloved by his patients and their families. He greatly respected the nurses he worked with. In the 1970s, he volunteered his time in the evenings at the Burlington People’s Free Clinic, providing free health care in the Old North End to those who couldn’t afford it. He retired in 1992 as a full professor.
In parallel with his career, Arthur played a key role in raising his four children, particularly as his wife Madeleine Kunin entered Vermont politics. He quickly mastered the art of making a meal for his children within minutes of returning home from his work at the hospital. He enthusiastically helped with Madeleine’s campaigns, and enjoyed his role as the first “First Husband” of Vermont’s first woman governor.
After retiring from the UVM Medical Center in 1992, Arthur became proficient in Russian and served as the on-site director in Petrozavodsk of the Vermont Sister State Program with Karelia in the former Soviet Union. In addition, he later became interim director of the University of Vermont Holocaust studies program.
Arthur maintained a lifelong passion for travel and classical music, exploring ramen shops in Tokyo and noodle houses in Hong Kong while playing and learning violin well into his 90’s. He also served as the chair of the Vermont Mozart Festival. He was a lifelong member of the Ohavi Zedek Synagogue, where he also served on the Board. Arthur became an avid runner beginning in his 40s, completing 7 marathons including Boston and New York. He also loved sailing, nordic skiing, reading, and combing through “junk shops.”
Arthur absolutely loved life, and made an indelible impression on those who met him.
His family thanks all the nurses and caregivers at The Residence at Quarry Hill and Bayada who provided great comfort to him during his final months.
Arthur Kunin is survived by his loving and dedicated partner Mary Grass, his former wife, Madeleine Kunin, four children, Julia, Peter and wife Lisa, Adam and wife Jane, and Daniel and wife Chantal, eight grandchildren, William and wife Bridget, David, Sara, Samuel, Jacob, Charlotte, Thomas and Vivienne, and his three brothers, Calvin, Lawrence and Jack, and their families.
Donations in memory of Arthur may be made to the Shelburne Veterans Memorial Fund or the Vermont Youth Orchestra Association.

A team of Delaware firefighters has been dispatched to Colorado to assist with efforts to contain the massive Turner Gulch wildfire, which has scorched more than 15,000 acres since it was sparked by lightning earlier this month.
The Delaware Forest Service announced that it deployed E-613, a newly built Type 6 wildland fire engine, along with a three-person crew from Blackbird State Forest.
“Providing out of state resources to assist states in need strengthens Delaware’s ability to handle fires in the first state,” said Kyle Hoyd, Delaware’s State Forester. “Our dedicated crew members train year-round to be ready for wildfires whether they are out west or in our home state. I deeply admire their dedication and selflessness and thank each of them for their service.”
The crew includes Engine Boss Sam Topper, and firefighters Aiden Binko and Tom Hairgrove. They began a 14-day firefighting assignment on Sunday.

The Turner Gulch fire, discovered on July 10 during a red flag warning and dry lightning storm, has proved difficult to contain due to steep terrain, drought conditions, and hot, dry weather.
As of now, only 9% of the fire’s perimeter has been contained.
The blaze is currently being managed by the Rocky Mountain Complex Incident Management Team 1, after transitioning from the Upper Colorado River Fire Management Unit Type 3. Evacuations are underway in the affected areas.
Delaware’s deployment is part of a broader effort to support western states grappling with increasingly intense wildfires.
The Forest Service plans to continue assisting through the summer and into early fall, rotating crews to ensure continuous support and firefighter well-being.

(Photo illustration via Getty Images; logo courtesy of the Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing) Iowa regulators have suspended the license of a Veterans Affairs respiratory therapist fired for incompetence and “hostile and aggressive behavior.”
Last November, the Iowa Board of Respiratory Care charged George Iannetta with professional incompetence and making misleading or untrue representations in the practice of his profession.
The board alleged that in February 2024, Iannetta filed an application to renew his Iowa license and answered “no” to a question asking whether he had ever been investigated or sanctioned by a licensing board.

Federal records indicate that prior to making his application, Iannetta worked for the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs for several years, earning an annual salary of up to $95,383.
The board alleges that after renewing Iannetta’s Iowa license, it received a letter from Dr. Brett Rusch, executive director of the White River Junction Veterans Affairs Healthcare System in Vermont, alerting the board to disciplinary action it had taken against Iannetta.
The letter reported the VA had conducted an investigation and concluded there was substantial evidence that Iannetta “so significantly failed to meet generally accepted standards of clinical practice as to raise reasonable concern for the safety of patients.” The letter allegedly stated that conclusion had been reached based on “significant treatment and diagnostic errors” by Iannetta.
A board investigator then contacted an employee in charge of credentialing at the VA. That individual allegedly confirmed that prior to Iannetta’s resignation from the VA, he faced “permanent removal” from the VA due to conduct that occurred throughout 2023.
‘Nothing is worse than a rat!’
According to the board, its investigator then obtained a copy of the charges Veterans Affairs had imposed against Iannetta, which included failure to cooperate with an agency investigation; failure to enter required notes in patients’ medical records; delaying the entry of notes in medical record; being absent without leave; failure to carry out a supervisor’s instruction; using disrespectful language with coworkers; conduct unbecoming a federal employee; inappropriate conduct in a patient-care area; and inappropriate and unsolicited touching of a female colleague.
The charges were tied to allegations that Iannetta placed his hands on the shoulders of a coworker and rubbed them; had failed to enter medical notes into 39 different patients’ medical charts, which may have caused the patients harm; had engaged in a verbal altercation with a coworker who was fearful that Iannetta was going to hit her and summoned the VA police; had changed clothes in a common office area, resulting in a female colleague seeing him with his pants down; had changed his clothes while in an office in front of a female coworker; and had once referred to a coworker as a “rat” while adding, “I hate a rat. Nothing is worse than a rat!”
According to the Iowa board, the VA decided to fire Iannetta, concluding he had engaged in “workplace bullying” and “disruptive workplace behaviors” and had displayed “highly emotional and chaotic behaviors, heated outbursts, gross insubordination (and) lack of accountability for his inappropriate behavior.”
The Iowa board alleges its investigator emailed Iannetta several times, seeking his input on the VA’s findings. In response, the board says, Iannetta asked the investigator to send him the VA report, stating he “didn’t know the specific nature of the allegations” that had been made against him, and asserting that he was “unaware of any disciplinary actions” taken against him.
After presiding over a board hearing on the matter last month, Administrative Law Judge Rachel Morgan ordered that Iannetta’s Iowa license be suspended indefinitely for a period of at least one year. In her decision, Morgan wrote that there was “significant evidence that Iannetta engaged in professional incompetency” and that he had engaged in “repeated hostile and aggressive behavior” toward his supervisors and coworkers.
The order stipulates that before his Iowa license can be reinstated, Iannetta must undergo a psychological evaluation and comply with any recommendations for treatment. In addition, he must complete 15 hours in anger-management training and complete 15 hours of continuing-education training in ethics.
When asked by the Iowa Capital Dispatch whether he’d like to comment on the case, Iannetta said only, “I have many comments. However, I doubt there are enough words allocated to your article to accommodate them.”

New Alaska WWAMI classes begin their programs in July of each year. (Photo provided by the University of Washington)A record 30 students have started their medical education this month in a special multistate collaborative program, the University of Alaska Anchorage and University of Washington announced.
The 30 students this month entered the WWAMI program, named after the first letters of the states that participate through universities: Washington, Wyoming, Alaska, Montana and Idaho. The program allows students to begin their medical education at universities in their home states — at UAA, in the case of Alaska — and complete their work toward medical degrees at the University of Washington School of Medicine in Seattle.
The WWAMI program offers Alaska’s only in-state education toward a medical degree. There is no medical school in Alaska. Students in the program spend their first 18 months taking classes and doing training work at UAA before moving onto studies at University of Washington.
The milestone of 30 Alaska students starting their WWAMI education marks a turnaround in fortunes for the program.
In 2019, Gov. Mike Dunleavy proposed entirely eliminating state funding for the Alaska portion of the WWAMI partnership. At the time, he characterized WWAMI as a waste of state money.
Three years later, Dunleavy took the opposite position. He proposed expanding WWAMI funding so that the program could expand from 20 students from each cohort year, which was the  enrollment at the time, to 30 per cohort year.
The Legislature in 2023 approved a funding increase that allowed 25 students to start the WWAMI program last year and 30 this year.
The WWAMI program’s history dates back to 1971, when nine students enrolled in preliminary courses at the University of Alaska Fairbanks arranged in partnership with the University of Washington. They then completed their education in Seattle. Montana and Idaho entered the program in 1972, and Wyoming entered it in 1996, according to a history compiled by UAA. Alaska WWAMI relocated from UAF to UAA in 1989.

Ken Calvert in the state’s 41st Congressional District, one of the country’s most crowded and closest races.","In summary
Katherine Aleman, who teaches middle school English language learners in Corona, is the latest Democrat to challenge GOP Rep. Ken Calvert in the state’s 41st Congressional District, one of the country’s most crowded and closest races. 


Katherine Aleman, an Inland Empire public-school teacher and part-time chicken farmer, is the latest Democrat to join a crowded field of challengers hoping to unseat 41st Congressional District Rep. Ken Calvert, the longest-serving Republican in California’s congressional delegation. 
The race against Calvert, who for more than 30 years has represented Riverside County, will be one of the most closely watched in the nation as Democrats push to retake control of the U.S. House in 2026. The congressman, a Trump loyalist, has been a perpetual white whale for Democrats despite his controversial votes to overturn the results of the 2020 election. 
This time, Democratic insiders are bullish that Aleman – a mother of four sons who teaches middle school in Corona – will be the one to break their cycle of losses.
Aleman is leaning into her background as a working parent and lifelong Inland Empire resident as she works to make affordability her primary message. Along with cost of living, she said veterans’ issues and education are important to her as the daughter of a Marine helicopter pilot and an elementary school principal.
“Folks deserve someone who has walked in their shoes, who’s had to balance a household budget, who’s struggled,” Aleman told CalMatters. “We have a congressman who really has only been serving himself and his friends.”
Calvert will not be an easy target. This past quarter he outraised all of his Democratic challengers combined, pulling in more than $1.3 million in contributions and bringing his  stockpile of cash on hand to an eye-popping $2.5 million. 
“This massive fundraising haul shows just how energized voters are to keep him in Congress,” Christian Martinez, spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee wrote in a statement when the fundraising numbers were released earlier this month. 
The W-shaped district spans from working-class towns like Corona and El Cerrito in the west to wealthier Coachella Valley cities like Palm Springs in the east. Aleman’s fluency in Spanish, which she refined during two years as a Peace Corps volunteer in Paraguay, is an asset in a district where nearly 40% of the population is Hispanic. 
Aleman’s supporters, who include former U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer, say her deep roots on the western side of the district – where more than 70% of the population is – differentiate her from her competitors. That background also sets her apart from Will Rollins, a former federal prosecutor who lost to Calvert twice and whose campaign Boxer vigorously supported. 
Former U.S. Sen Barbara Boxer is a fan
“She’s an undiscovered star,” said Boxer, who sought to support a female candidate from the western side of the district. “I’ve been around a long time, and I never say that.” 
Boxer, a 24-year veteran of Capitol Hill who, alongside former Sen. Dianne Feinstein, won election to the Senate in 1992’s ‘Year of the Woman,’ pointed to Aleman’s successful 2020 campaign for Norco City Council as proof that she can win Republican votes. Aleman, the council’s lone Democrat, won despite a nearly 30% Republican voter registration advantage, but lost her reelection bid last November.
When the two women met for lunch a month ago, Boxer said she was immediately impressed with Aleman’s straightforward assessment of her district’s top issue – affordability.

“She said, ‘Senator, people can’t afford to live here anymore, and I grew up here.’ And I just saw the authenticity of her,” Boxer said of Aleman. “She fits so well into what we’re looking for,” Boxer added, “someone who has lived the lives of her constituents.”
This time, Calvert has attracted at least eight other Democratic challengers. Among them are Brandon Riker, an entrepreneur who ran for lieutenant governor of Vermont in 2016, and Anuj Dixit, a voting rights attorney who was born and raised in Riverside County. Tim Myers, the bassist for the band OneRepublic, has already bowed out and announced he will instead run for lieutenant governor.
“Katherine is exactly the type of candidate the Democratic Party needs,” said Orrin Evans, a media strategist working on Aleman’s campaign launch. His has helped Democratic candidates such as Rep. Derek Tran defeat incumbent Republicans in tough races. 
Evans said the takeaway from the 2024 election should be the importance of candidate quality, and that a “homegrown leader” like Aleman would gain the most traction. 
“Katherine’s not from Hollywood or Vermont,” he said. “She’s from the Inland Empire.”

Let’s dive into some news about immigration and the raids conducted under President Donald Trump’s administration: 

Border Patrol in Sacramento: On Thursday Border Patrol agents arrested about 10 people at a Home Depot in Sacramento — more than 500 miles away from the border. The operation signals a return of Border Patrol agents in the Eastern District of California, following a federal judge’s preliminary injunction in April to ban agents from conducting warrantless raids in the area. Gov. Gavin Newsom slammed the raid, saying that the agency is trying to dodge the court order. But in an interview with Fox News, U.S. Border Patrol Sector Chief Gregory Bovino said, “There is no sanctuary anywhere. … We’re here to stay.” Read more from CalMatters’ Wendy Fry and Sergio Olmos.


Cannabis farm raids: The California legal cannabis industry is rattled after federal agents raided two cannabis facilities in Southern California earlier this month and arrested more than 360 people. Glass House Farms operated the facilities and is one of California’s largest licensed cannabis companies. Following the raids, the United Farm Workers union warned workers who are not U.S. citizens to avoid jobs in the cannabis industry. Since weed is still illegal under federal law, simply working in the industry can present criminal pretext for arrests, regardless of immigration status. Though the legal weed market has been struggling in California, it was worth nearly $4.9 billion last year and employed an estimated 83,000 people. Read more from CalMatters’ Alexei Koseff.


School financial aid: Federal financial aid forms for students require parents to submit personal details that some worry may be used to deport family members. But the number of college-bound students applying for aid this spring with at least one parent who lacks legal status did not decrease as much as some financial aid advocates feared, according to data from the California Student Aid Commission. This is despite the country’s rising number of deportations and the fact that the IRS and the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement have a working plan to share tax information. State officials aren’t aware of examples of the Trump administration using financial aid data for immigration purposes to date.

GOP Congressmember has a new challenger

Amid an already crowded field of Democratic challengers, one more is stepping into the ring with hopes to unseat the longest-serving Republican in California’s congressional delegation, reports CalMatters’ Maya C. Miller.
Katherine Aleman is a public school teacher from the Inland Empire, and lists cost of living concerns, veterans’ issues and education as her key platform priorities. In 2020 — despite a nearly 30% Republican voter registration advantage — she successfully ran for Norco City Council and served as the council’s lone Democrat. That victory is one of the reasons why her backers, including former U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer, say she could win over Republican voters.
As Democrats aspire to retake control of the U.S. House of Representatives, Aleman joins at least eight other Democratic candidates challenging U.S. Rep. Ken Calvert in one of the most closely watched midterm races of 2026.
Calvert has represented Riverside County for more than 30 years. A Trump loyalist who voted to overturn the 2020 election results, he has a substantial, $2.5 million cash-on-hand war chest and outraised all of his Democratic challengers combined in the past quarter.

The University of California has released a new data tool showing what companies its alumni are landing jobs at and what skills those employers value, writes CalMatters’ Mikhail Zinshteyn.
The tool reveals that tens of thousands of alumni, with a range of academic degrees, have secured jobs at top companies such as Google, Amazon and Kaiser Permanente. Though many hold positions as software engineers and research associates, others are teachers, interns, product managers and more.
The data underscores the benefits of a UC education, during a time when the system is facing major financial threats, including potential federal funding cuts under Trump.

In other workforce news: California Division of Occupational Safety and Health enforces labor rules and investigates workplace accidents and injuries. But a review published last week reports that due to understaffing, the division is failing to thoroughly investigate workplaces and incidents that warrant extra scrutiny. 
As CalMatters’ Jeanne Kuang explains, last year Cal/OSHA investigated in person just about a fifth of the roughly 10,000 complaints it deemed valid. In one example, Cal/OSHA declined to investigate an incident because it occurred on a public road, which it considers outside its jurisdiction. But the incident involved workers riding a company vehicle, which is covered by workplace safety rules.

A middle school teacher with a passion for robots built from junkyard treasures will take center stage at this year’s Brandywine Festival of the Arts, set to return to Brandywine Park on September 6 and 7.
Brian Marshall, who calls himself a “mad scientist” by night, has been named the featured artist for the 2025 event, which will showcase the work of more than 240 artisans and crafters from across the region.
Marshall is best known for his whimsical robot sculptures — quirky figures assembled from vintage teapots, tools, clocks, and other metal odds and ends. He constructs each piece without welding, using bolts and rivets instead, which he says helps give the creations a lifelike feel.
“I fabricate robots, fish and more from vintage items like a modern-day Dr. Frankenstein of junk,” Marshall said.
The inspiration for his robot creations began in childhood, sparked by weekend garage sale adventures with his mother and hands-on tinkering with his father.
A key moment came when he once flipped over a teapot and imagined the spout as a nose and the lid as a mouth — a revelation that would eventually lead to the launch of his quirky Adopt-A-Bot orphanage.
At the festival, Marshall will display his full “Robot Menagerie” in a featured location. His work will be available for viewing and purchase.
“My robot sculptures do not take a critical look at social, political, or cultural issues,” he said. “I simply love the adventure of finding and collecting new objects and the problem solving involved in assembling those parts to create unique personalities.”
Marshall said his enjoyment continues as smiles emerge on the faces of children and adults when they challenge each other to name the various parts that they recognize from their youth.
“I try not to render objects unrecognizable but rather assemble in a fashion that allows others to enjoy the original engineering and artistry of the parts that inspire me,” he said. ” If I do have a message or a wish, it would be for people to think outside the box and find new ways to
use old things.”
The Brandywine Festival of the Arts, always held the weekend after Labor Day, also includes painters, jewelers, potters, photographers, woodworkers, and other artists.
The event features a food court, children’s activities, and pet adoption opportunities.
Festival hours are 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Saturday, Sept. 6, and 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Sunday, Sept. 7.
Admission is $5, and children 12 and under are free when accompanied by an adult. Pets are welcome.

Baltimore is one of 16 Maryland jurisdictions that do not have 287(g) agreements with ICE. (Photo courtesy Immigration and Customs Enforcement.Every person getting booked in jail in Frederick County is asked two questions: “Where were you born?” and “What country are you a citizen of?”
If the answer to either question is anything other than the U.S., said Sheriff Chuck Jenkins (R), officers will take the individual to the facility’s “ICE unit” where they determine the person’s legal status. If residing in the country illegally, officers will then place a detainer on them to initiate removal proceedings — if determined appropriate by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
“Rather than release a criminal back onto the street, we turn those criminals over to ICE,” Jenkins said.
Frederick is one of several Maryland counties where the sheriff’s office has opted to participate in the  “287(g)” program, which allows ICE to delegate certain immigration enforcement abilities to state and local law enforcement officials. The powers include executing administrative immigration warrants in their jails, identifying and beginning removal proceedings against individuals arrested by local law enforcement, and serving on task forces that allow officers to “enforce limited immigration authority.”
While 287(g) agreements were first established in 1996, they have gained increased public awareness and scrutiny after President Donald Trump resumed office in January and directed a significant increase in immigration enforcement across the country. So far during his presidency, immigration arrests in Maryland have doubled.
Since the beginning of this year, five more Maryland sheriff’s offices — in Allegany, Carroll, Garrett, St. Mary’s and Washington counties — have signed 287(g) agreements with ICE. Cecil, Frederick and Harford counties already had agreements in place.
While the kinds of agreement can differ, all the participating sheriff’s offices in Maryland only utilize the 287(g) program in their county jails.



Opponents of the 287(g) program say that it leads to racial profiling of Latino residents, and will only increase distrust in law enforcement.
CASA policy manager Ninfa Amador-Hernandez said it was a “great disappointment” that the Maryland General Assembly did not approve a provision of the Maryland Values Act in the last legislative session which would have ended current 287(g) agreements in the state and prohibited the formation of new ones.
“​​The impact of these programs is not just fear and mistrust in local government,” Amador-Hernandez said. “It’s also the deep trauma and separation these programs cause.”
Amador-Hernandez added that local law enforcement in Maryland shouldn’t be spending taxpayer money on the extra time and effort the program requires of officers to partner with ICE.
“There’s absolutely no reason why a locality should be using their taxpayer dollars to enhance this agency’s [ICE] already-over-funded programs,” she said.
Sheriffs who participate in the program, including those from every county in Western Maryland, have defended 287(g) agreements as an effective tool.
Harford County Sheriff Jeffrey Gahler (R) said the idea that the program is racially discriminatory or increases distrust in law enforcement among immigrant communities is “all scare tactics.” He’d like to see all 24 counties in Maryland sign a 287(g) agreement, he said
“Our job is not to do ICE’s job,” he said. “It’s not to do the FBI’s job. It’s not to do the DEA’s job. But we should be good partners on the things that relate to keeping our community safe, and this program works to keep our community safe through a partnership.”
Carroll County Sheriff Jim Dewees (R) said that critics of the program are “incredibly naive” to how it works.
“This is a jail-based model. We are not running around looking for people that ICE wants,” he said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Dewees, president of the Maryland Sheriffs Association, said the program isn’t discriminatory, as each person’s immigration status is checked, regardless of who they are.
But University of Maryland Carey School of Law Professor Maureen Sweeney said it matters who is brought to jail in the first place.
“Who are they choosing to bring in, as opposed to giving them a ticket or not even stopping them?” asked Sweeney, the faculty director of the law school’s Chacón Center for Immigrant Justice.
Sweeney pointed to past Justice Department investigations that found some U.S. sheriff’s offices with 287(g) agreements were racially profiling Latino residents.
In 2011, one DOJ investigation determined that the Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office in Arizona was engaging in a pattern of “unconstitutional policing,” then-Assistant U.S. Attorney General Thomas E. Perez wrote in a letter at the time.
The investigation found that the office was racially profiling Latinos, unlawfully stopping, detaining and arresting them, and unlawfully retaliating against individuals who complained about the office, Perez wrote in the 2011 letter. Latino drivers were four to nine times more likely to be pulled over for a traffic stop than “similarly situated non-Latino drivers,” wrote Perez.
As a result, the Department of Homeland Security terminated its 287(g) agreement with the county. The program was later reformed by President Barack Obama, removing its “Task Force Model.”
Sweeney said the program incentivizes police to engage in these kinds of unconstitutional stop-and-search tactics.
“It’s an arrest that would likely be thrown out in criminal court, but because of the more lax standards in the immigration system, they often get the credit for enforcement, even though it was an unconstitutional stop,” Sweeney said. “It is illegal to stop somebody on the basis of their race, regardless of whether you’re enforcing the criminal law or the immigration law, but the mechanisms to enforce that are so much weaker in the immigration system.”

The Frederick County Sheriff’s Office, which Jenkins said has the longest-standing 287(g) agreement in the country, has served more than 1,800 immigration detainers since it first joined in 2008.
Others are still getting off the ground. Washington County Sheriff Brian Albert said that his office’s 287(g) agreement has only been operational since July 1. So far, they’ve processed one person, he said.
Most of Maryland’s sheriffs have not signed a 287(g) agreement, however.
Montgomery County Sheriff Maxwell Uy (D), said that he didn’t join the program because county residents don’t want his office entering into an agreement to enforce immigration, and due to the fact that he doesn’t oversee the county’s jails.
“You wouldn’t want a federal officer, federal agent, to write traffic tickets. Montgomery County residents don’t want their deputies out enforcing immigration law,” he said. “It’s the community that should dictate how they want their law enforcement to engage with the public.”
Others, like Talbot County Sheriff Joe Gamble (R), said they haven’t joined simply because they don’t oversee a jail, and wouldn’t have the ability to sign on to a jail enforcement-based agreement.
At its root, Sweeney said the problem lies in uniting immigration enforcement with criminal enforcement. By combining the two, she said, immigrant communities aren’t going to trust the police, or go to them when they need to.
Immigration enforcement is going to have a drastic impact on the way people live, she said.
“We live in a global world, right? And that’s not going away,” Sweeney said. “We will come back to some kind of balance. But how long will it take, and how much damage will be done to individuals and companies, the economy, the culture? That remains to be seen.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/53171174555_ac82d5c59e_o-cropped-e1736627422608-1024x671.jpg,,,2025-07-21 08:56:15.794800

Despite fears the federal government will use personal information from financial aid applications to identify immigrant parents who lack legal status, the number of high school senior applicants from mixed-status families has not decreased as much as some thought it would, according to the California Student Aid Commission.


While witnessing a rise in deportations across the country, college-bound high school seniors with immigrant parents in California had to decide this spring whether to submit a federal financial aid application. Their fear: The federal government will use sensitive personal information from the application to identify people in the country who lack legal status. An agreement between the IRS and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to share tax information is already in motion. 
However, the latest data available from the California Student Aid Commission shows that the number of high school senior applicants from mixed-status families has not decreased as much as some financial aid advocates feared it would. In fact, the number of high school senior applicants with at least one parent lacking legal status has nearly rebounded to the 2023 number after the revised financial aid form last year kept them from being able to apply without parental Social Security numbers for several months. 
Despite the risk of exposing their parents to a deportation dragnet, 35% more college-bound high school seniors from mixed-status families have submitted a Free Application for Federal Student Aid as of the May 2 deadline compared to applications submitted by the same date last year. However, 9% fewer high school seniors from mixed-status families submitted their FAFSA compared to the same date two years ago. Community college students are notably excluded from these numbers as they have a separate deadline of Sept. 2.
Students who choose not to submit a financial aid application lose potential federal aid through grants, work study and loans. While the federal deadline is not until the end of the academic year for which a student applies, California sets its own early deadline for the FAFSA to determine state aid such as Cal Grants. 
California officials gave students a one-month extension from April 2 to May 2 to submit the FAFSA after the U.S. Department of Education opened the application in December 2024 rather than the usual launch of October. 
The California Student Aid Commission administers financial aid programs for students in California and helps organizations that counsel students on their financial aid applications. The commission’s spokesperson, Shelveen Ratnam, said the federal student aid  application should have been a little easier for mixed-status families this time around. 
“Now the concern this year has kind of been the federal landscape, the federal administration, given… all the increased immigration enforcement (and) the unprecedented data sharing between federal agencies,” Ratnam said.
“When we submitted the application together, they said to me, ‘This is for you Janet. This is for the future generations and I hope we stay together.’”Janet, graduate of Hawthorne High School in Los Angeles
In the federal financial aid application, parents must submit personal details such as their Social Security numbers. If parents do not have them due to their legal status, they need to click a box that says “I do not have a SSN.” Although Ratnam and fellow staff at the commission are not currently aware of any efforts by immigration enforcement to access the personal information of FAFSA applicants, some students said they are concerned about the possibility that the personal details of their parents might be used to deport them.
Students and parents face a tough choice
College-bound high school seniors in California who spoke to CalMatters for this story say the importance of going to college outweighs fears of their parents being deported.  
A graduate of Hawthorne High School in Los Angeles, Janet said she and her parents were antsy as they filled out the application together for the first time. Due to her family’s mixed legal status, she asked to go by her first name only. Janet recalls the concern from one of her parents who lacks permanent legal status that by submitting the application to the federal government they would be exposing themselves to immigration enforcement. However, her parents decided it was more important that their daughter receive financial aid for college.
“When we submitted the application together, they said to me, ‘This is for you Janet. This is for the future generations and I hope we stay together,’” she said.

Alondra, a graduate of University High School Charter in Los Angeles, says she feels stress because most of her family does not have permanent legal status. Alondra also requested to use only her first name to protect her family from potential deportation. Alondra said it surprised her family when she informed them of the possible risk if they apply. However, a counselor in the One Voice Scholars Program, which works with low-income, first-generation students, pointed out that Alondra’s parents already share their personal information with the federal government when they file taxes. 
“So, it’s like we already know that my parents are already in the system, so we just kind of hope that me submitting my FAFSA isn’t adding on to that risk,” Alondra said.
Some students from mixed-status families who have older siblings may already have shared their data with the U.S. Department of Education, according to Alison De Lucca, executive director of the Southern California College Access Network. She said each family has to determine the pros and cons of the implications when applying for financial aid. Mixed-status families are also likely sharing their data with the state and federal government when they file taxes, get a driver’s license, or adjust their immigration status.
Angela, a graduate of the Los Angeles County High School of the Arts who also requested to use her first name only due to her family’s mixed legal status, said she started grappling with the decision of whether to apply for federal student aid during her sophomore year. At the time, her parents were still in the process of obtaining their citizenship and did not know if they would receive it in time for Angela’s financial aid application. 
“They just really wanted me to be able to go (to college) for as cheap as possible,” Angela said.
“You worry for your friends that might not be able to do it, might not be able to get that future that they really dream of.”Angela, graduate of the Los Angeles County High School of the Arts
Angela’s parents were able to obtain citizenship recently. However, she feels some of her college options are “off the table,” including Cornell University, which had offered her a scholarship that would have funded her first year at the university. Angela grew concerned about attending universities in New York after hearing reports of Immigration and Customs Enforcement “targeting” students that led pro-Palestinian protests, such as Mahmoud Khalil at Columbia and Momodou Taal at Cornell.
She also feels guilt as some of her extended family and friends who are applying for financial aid do not have parents with permanent legal status in the U.S.
“I’m happy for myself but that feels selfish,” Angela said. “I know that I can help my family in that sense, but it’s really upsetting. You worry for your friends that might not be able to do it, might not be able to get that future that they really dream of.”
Federal financial aid application faces new problems
Following President Donald Trump’s executive order to dismantle the U.S. Department of Education, the department’s spokesperson James Bergeron wrote in a letter on March 14 that those working directly with the federal financial aid application or student loan servicing were not affected by the staff reductions. 
Although Bergeron’s letter addressed the department’s staff reduction, De Lucca said that she and fellow staff at the College Access Network are concerned that layoffs at the department could lead to less support available for students and families when they call for assistance with their financial aid applications.

“There’s less staff at the Department of Education to consult with community-based organizations like SoCal CAN (College Access Network) and our members,” De Lucca said. “So for us, it’s been more difficult to reach folks at the department when we do have questions.”
Inside Higher Ed reported in March that the staff reductions in the Office of Federal Student Aid would impact the staff’s ability to fix technical issues with the form, which were prevalent last year. Additional cuts were made to the FAFSA call center and training for financial aid practitioners, according to the same story by Inside Higher Ed. 
A federal judge blocked Trump’s executive order that led to the massive staff reduction at the education department in May. However, on July 14 the U.S. Supreme Court allowed for the president’s plan to continue.
The education department’s press office did not respond to repeated requests from CalMatters about the number of staff cuts at the Office of Federal Student Aid.
During last year’s updated FAFSA rollout, students faced technical issues with the application’s overhaul, prompting a review by the U.S. Government Accountability Office. Revisions to the application included reducing the number of questions by pulling students’ and parents’ financial information straight from the IRS. If parents were missing Social Security numbers then students could not submit a financial aid application. 
Students had to wait until March 12, 2024 for the glitch on the website to be fixed before completing their submission, still ahead of the state’s extended deadline of May 2. The issues with the application last year resulted in 9,642 fewer federal financial aid applications submitted by May 2 from students in mixed-status families in the state compared to this year, according to the California Student Aid Commission.
Sacramento State senior Fernanda Arteaga spent four months trying to submit a FAFSA last year due to her parents not having Social Security numbers.   
Arteaga tried calling the office about six times to ensure that her application had the necessary information to be submitted, but each time she had to wait for assistance, leading her to hang up and try again at another time. Finally, Arteaga was able to reach a staff member and submit her application. Experts from the federal Governmental Accountability Office testified before Congress in the fall of 2024 that 74% of the calls to the department’s call center went unanswered due to understaffing.

“I would mainly say that I just overcame those obstacles by just constantly checking in with the (Office of Federal Student Aid) and making sure that everything I could do on my end was done, and that everything I had was there,” Arteaga said. She finally received her financial aid a month into the fall 2024 semester and was granted an extension to pay for her tuition by the university while the funds were disbursed. 
With this year’s federal financial aid application, Arteaga did not encounter any website glitches, and had an easier process applying. Instead, Arteaga was concerned about the implications of applying for federal student aid given the political climate. Arteaga and her parents accepted the risk of immigration enforcement accessing their personal information through the application and ultimately applied.  
“Obviously it is a federal organization,” Arteaga said. “So we were concerned that … our information wasn’t going to be protected. But my parents, since we’ve already done applications … in the past, they were like just do it. We really need the money, and we want to get you to finish your last year in college.” 
California offers alternative financial aid application
Students who lack permanent legal status themselves are not eligible for federal financial aid. However, since 2013, the state has administered the California Dream Act Application, also known as CADAA, for those students to apply for state and campus-based aid. When students from mixed-status families were unable to submit a federal application in 2024, California opened its financial aid application temporarily to those students so they could at least apply for state aid. 
The California Student Aid Commission again opened the Dream Act application to students from mixed-status families this year to provide them a state-protected way to apply for financial aid. California state law protects students and families by not sharing their personal information with immigration officials. 
Now a state senator is proposing to open the financial aid application permanently to students from mixed-status families. State Sen. Sasha Renée Pérez, a Democrat from Pasadena, proposed Senate Bill 323, which would require the California Student Aid Commission to ensure that the state application can be used by “any student eligible for state financial aid programs,” according to the bill text. 
“It is crucial we provide California college bound students with a stable, safe, and alternative state-based financial aid application to feel safe in applying for financial aid and choosing to go to college,” Pérez said on the Senate floor June 2. 
Emmanuel Rodriguez, senior director of policy and advocacy at The Institute for College Access and Success, said California’s Dream Act application adds a level of security for applicants as the information they receive is only shared with the campuses listed on a student’s application to determine whether the student is eligible for financial aid. 
Financial aid advocates say that each family applying for financial aid must make a decision based on their specific situation and whether they should submit the federal application, the state Dream Act application, or both.

,California,2025-07-21 12:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,The Trump regime targets California’s sanctuary status at the expense of the American creed,Robert Greene,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/07/trump-targets-sanctuary-expense-american-creed/,"The federal government's actions and comments show they respect no sanctuary, no refuge, no protection in the very things they purport to be guarding: the law, the Constitution, the American people, and their safety, values and sovereignty.","Blocked for now by a federal court order from sending warrantless roving immigration patrols through Los Angeles and six other Southern California counties, U.S. agents on Thursday moved their sweeps north to Sacramento.
Border Patrol section chief Gregory Bovino made it abundantly clear that the point of the operation at a Home Depot parking lot in South Sacramento was embodied in the same word, the same concept, as the round-ups in Los Angeles. They are about “sanctuary.”
It is a word that has clearly gotten under Bovino’s skin, just as it has gotten under the skin of immigration opponents in the White House and the Capitol. 
“There is no sanctuary city,” Bovino told Fox News. “Sacramento is not a sanctuary city. The state of California is not a sanctuary state. There is no sanctuary anywhere.”
If by that he meant that no jurisdiction can protect residents from federal immigration law, he is of course correct. The Constitution’s Supremacy Clause leaves no doubt about that. States, counties and cities that describe themselves as sanctuaries are engaging in recklessly misleading political marketing. Their laws at most prevent local police from questioning suspects about their immigration status, for example, or block jailers from holding inmates past their release dates so the feds can get them.
But the federal government’s contempt for sanctuary appears to go well beyond the modest if over-sold local policies. Their actions and statements demonstrate that they respect no sanctuary, no refuge, no protection in the very things they purport to be guarding: the law, the Constitution, the American people, and their safety, values and sovereignty.
District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong’s blistering July 11 order, which the administration has appealed, lays out the frightening details of a government that has turned hard-won American freedoms inside out.
In this country, unlike most others in the world, the people are free to go about their business without having to show their papers to government agents on demand, absent probable cause to believe they have committed a crime, or at least sufficient suspicion to ask them questions. Those same agents, by contrast, must identify themselves, and not merely by brandishing their guns. They must be clearly distinguishable in action and appearance from crooks of the sort who kidnap residents of third-world countries. Here there is no army of secret police. There are no roving bands of quasi-military thugs.
Until now. Border Patrol and ICE agents in San Diego, Los Angeles, Orange and Ventura counties, and now in Sacramento, hide their faces, tint their car windows, remove their license plates, cover their badges, ignore requests for identification, and target people based on where they work and how they look. 
If this conduct is allowed to stand for federal officers, based on the specious argument that they need protection, it is inevitable that all police, perhaps all jailers, prosecutors and judges, will soon hide their faces and do their government work in secret.
Agents recognize no sanctuary in the Fourth Amendment’s protection against warrantless search and seizure. They demand at gunpoint that you show your papers and lock you up if they find them unsatisfactory. Frimpong’s order describes a U.S. citizen showing a driver’s license — and then being grabbed anyway after an agent demanded to see a passport. 
Since when do American citizens have to carry passports? 
There is no sanctuary in the 14th Amendment’s promise of equal protection or in generations of civil rights struggles, court rulings and policy updates that supposedly swept away racially disparate treatment. Frimpong’s order describes a stop in which agents let a white person walk away but not a nonwhite person. Border “czar” Tom Homan said recently that ICE agents were free to stop people based on their appearance.
There is no sanctuary in the Sixth Amendment’s right to counsel. The order describes shocking conditions in the basement of the immigration building at 300 N. Los Angeles Street, where captured suspects were so cramped they could not sit or lie down and had no access to lawyers for days.
There is no sanctuary in courthouses, churches, nursing homes or other places where agents grab people without judicial warrants. There is no sanctuary in essential work, such as farm fields, despite President Trump’s statement that perhaps farmworkers and hotel workers might get a break, because after all, farmers would not hire any murderers. He did not explain why the exemption should cover farmworkers but not, say, kitchen workers.
There is no sanctuary, no protection from deportation, even in American citizenship. The Department of Justice is stepping up a program to denaturalize people who were born elsewhere but lawfully go through the citizenship process and take the oath, but who later commit crimes. Such a move creates a second, lesser tier of citizenship, with different standards of conduct and different consequences for the same crimes. 
Second-tier citizenship was virtually abolished in American society after a century-long post-slavery struggle for equality. Must we countenance its return?
But there is no sanctuary even in being born here. The administration is moving to end birthright citizenship, which long has been an unassailable cornerstone of American identity and civil rights. Our leaders are threatening to, for the first time in 60 years, award or deny fundamental rights based not on who you are or what you do, but who your parents were and what they did.
So where can sanctuary be found? If not in lines written on the base of the Statue of Liberty, or in the Constitution, or in citizenship or in simple human decency, then where?
Is there sanctuary only in skin color? If you’re white, or perhaps if you’re Black, you may be OK. If you are brown, you’d better carry your passport for the rest of your days, and teach your children to carry theirs too. Stay away from Home Depot. Endure stops and questions. Keep your head down. It is the dream of the white supremacist. It is the achievement of the 2017 Charlottesville rally to “Unite the Right.” It is a state of affairs repugnant to the American creed. 
And the only thing, so far, that keeps it from becoming the new American normal is Judge Frimpong’s emergency order.

(Photo by Jess Daninhirsch/Capital News Service)Maryland’s newest jobs report for June showed a decline of 8,500 total jobs, including a net loss of 2,900 jobs in the public sector, which pushed the state’s unemployment rate up slightly, from 3.2 in May to 3.3% in June, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
A large part of the employment decline was the loss of 3,500 federal government jobs, Maryland’s largest single-month decrease in federal government jobs in almost three decades, the state’s labor department said.
“Maryland continues to invest in support resources to help residents who have been impacted by federal layoffs and other actions,” the state’s labor department said in a news release.
So far this year, the state has a net positive private sector gain of 5,200 jobs. But those are expected to be dragged down going forward by federal job losses.
A recent report from the comptroller’s office called the federal government the state’s “economic engine” and a driver of its employment growth, adding more than $150 billion to the state’s economy in the most recent year for which data was available, including $26.9 billion in income alone.

The report said that Maryland, despite being only the 18th largest state in terms of population, ranked  third in the number of federal employees, behind only Virginia and Washington, D.C., with its estimated 229,000 federal workers. Those employees make up about 6% of the state’s total workforce and 10% of its wages, with an average salary of $126,468.
In addition to active federal workers, the report said more than 150,000 people in Maryland receive retirement income, totaling about $8.8 billion each year.
State officials for years have fretted about the heavy reliance of the state’s economy on federal spending, and those concerns have taken a sharper edge this year with the election of President Donald Trump and his promise to cut the size of the federal workforce. Gov. Wes Moore has vowed to diversify the state economy, and state lawmakers have appointed a special 26-member House and Senate committee to track the impact of federal spending on the state through the summer.
Some early state projections anticipate as many as 29,000 workers could lose their jobs as Trump culls federal agencies and employees. The state in June launched a short-term loan program to help laid-off federal workers who might be having trouble paying their bills.
The uptick in unemployment comes as Maryland Labor Secretary Portia Wu is raising red flags about the continued solvency of the state’s unemployment fund. Wu recently told lawmakers that the state’s insurance trust fund of $2 billion currently meets federal solvency requirements, but that could change with an economic downturn or a spike in jobless numbers from what she called the current “incredibly low unemployment rate.”
Even if anticipated economic downturns do not occur, Wu said the growing number of workers who are becoming eligible for the maximum weekly benefit is stressing the system to the point where the fund could fall below federal guidelines sometime between 2026 and 2027.

And all those chickens produce a lot of waste -- which presents a threat to our waterways if not treated properly, writes Jorge Aguilar. (Photo by Lance Cheung/USDA)It’s summer in Maryland. For many, that means it’s time for the fun annual pilgrimage to the waters and beaches of the Chesapeake Bay and Ocean City.
These crown jewels of Maryland are not only places of leisure for vacation-goers — they also yield real-time benefits for the communities along our coastlines. Tourism raked in $19.4 billion in 2022, a boon for Marylanders that led to tax savings of approximately $1,000 per household.
But as extreme weather intensifies and record rainfall pours down, industrial agricultural pollution is wreaking havoc on the Eastern Shore and its alluring seaboard.
Pure and simple, there is too much chicken poop in our water.
The waters we boat on, fish in and let our kids splash around in on hot days are under threat. Decades of industrial poultry farming and the resulting pollution puts our precious ecosystems — and our summer vacations — at risk. This summer offers Gov. Wes Moore a chance to turn the tide on agricultural pollution by strengthening factory farm regulations in Maryland.
When it comes to the Eastern Shore’s shaky health, factory farms are an obvious culprit. Food & Water Watch analysis of U.S. Department of Agriculture data identified that eight of nine Eastern Shore counties have high to extremely high density of factory farmed broiler chickens — two counties, Caroline and Somerset, are among the densest in the country. At any given time, Maryland confines 36 million chickens in these industrial animal cities, with annual totals close to 300 million.

So many animals in close quarters generates an enormous amount of waste — 548 million tons of litter (chicken poop, feathers, and bedding) on the Eastern Shore annually. Ultimately, all that waste has to go somewhere. Much of it runs off into our waters.
Factory farms are particularly insidious polluters. Rather than send their waste to a treatment plant to remove harmful pollutants, these industrial facilities spew their waste directly into waterways through ventilation fans or by spreading it on farm fields. Because Maryland factory farms confine so many animals, these facilities produce far more waste than the fields can reasonably absorb. Heavy rains wash literal tons of excess land-applied waste into our waters every year.
All this runoff sends large doses of nitrogen and phosphorus into the Bay, before the pollution ultimately makes its way into the Atlantic. The influx of these chemicals leads to oxygen-greedy algal blooms that create dead zones: areas where mass die-offs of aquatic life occur. These algal blooms are deadly to the crabs, fish, oysters and other creatures that call these ecosystems home. Algal blooms can also make water unsafe for swimming by generating toxins, and washing hundreds of dead animals onto beaches.
Ineffective state oversight has let factory farms pollute with abandon for years, putting our communities and beachgoers at risk.
A state pollution permit is one of the few safeguards standing between polluting factory farms and Maryland waters — it’s due for an update this year, creating an opportunity for Moore’s administration to champion our prized vacation spots and help restore wellness to the watershed.
Since the last time this permit was updated, reporting shows the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) has struggled to adequately inspect, monitor and fine poorly performing factory farms. The Bay’s troubled health grading slipped to a C this year, down from last year’s C+. These barely passing grades demonstrate that more needs to be done at the state level to protect clean water. MDE knows the solution: Reduce industrial agricultural pollution.
It’s time for MDE to tackle factory-farm pollution. Earlier this month, Food & Water Watch wrote to Governor Moore recommending commonsense provisions to improve the 2025 permit that would help to meaningfully address the harmful agricultural waste making Marylanders and our natural spaces sick. These recommendations include:

Require that factory farms implement best management practices to better control waste pollution;
Require that factory farms conduct representative monitoring to ensure permit compliance;
Require individual National Pollutant Discharge Elimination Systems (NPDES) permits for factory farms with anaerobic digesters and other biorefinery  technologies; and
Reduce risks from manure manifestation/transfers.

Gov. Moore and MDE are uniquely positioned to champion the Eastern Shore by protecting the beaches, waterways and environment we love.

Nothing more than greenwashing — and a carefully crafted, highly unethical scam.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Rick Enser: The Greenwashing of the Telephone Gap Project.","This commentary is by Rick Enser, a biodiversity specialist who served as Coordinator of the Rhode Island Natural Heritage Program for 28 years. He is currently the Principal Conservation Biologist with the Conservation Cooperative, providing consulting services to government agencies and NGOs on biodiversity assessment and conservation planning.


The recent approval of the Telephone Gap IRP, the 11,000-acre logging project slated for one of Vermont’s largest and oldest tracts of unprotected forest, was applauded in the media by Jamey Fidel, General Counsel and Forest and Wildlife Program Director of the Vermont Natural Resource Council. 
According to Fidel, “close to half the overall acreage that will be treated will be trying out some different approaches, many of them that have a lighter touch on the land, that are designed to have more of a beneficial carbon outcome, to be bird-friendly, and also to enhance old forest conditions through harvesting.”
All dubious claims, but the most nonsensical is the suggestion that tree harvesting can be a “bird-friendly” endeavor. In fact, this phrase implies that some birds, in this case forest species, deserve to be reduced at Telephone Gap in order to provide for other birds that prefer unforested conditions.
The concept of “bird-friendly management” has its origins with the Audubon Society whose mission of protecting birds has led to all manner of private landowner assistance in fostering “bird-friendly habitat,” even in the face of a changing climate.
A 2019 article posted on Vermont Audubon’s web page, ridiculously titled “Birds are Telling Us It’s Time to Take Action on Climate,” claims that “we already know what we need to do to help the birds we love.” Among the six suggestions for “what you can do to help in Vermont” is to “plant native trees, shrubs and flowers to create bird-friendly places at your home, school, or place of work.”
Audubon’s intent here is to suggest that homeowners can replace their decidedly bird-unfriendly and climate-unfriendly mowed lawns and sterile landscaping with a diversity of native plantings to support a greater diversity of birds. Unfortunately, this rationale has been corrupted by the suggestion that forest ecosystems that already support native biodiversity should be managed to be more “bird-friendly”.
The 2012 publication “Managing Your Woods With Birds in Mind: A Vermont Landowner’s Guide,” published by Audubon Vermont and Vermont Department of Forests, Parks, and Recreation, poses the question, “What does a bird-friendly forest look like?” 
The answer: “We envision healthy forests that provide suitable breeding and post-breeding habitat conditions for a suite of Vermont birds and sustained yields of timber and other forest products and services.” As such, “bird-friendly” becomes a selective process in which foresters conduct prescriptive management to support those birds desired by the landowner. It is suggested that landowners provide a variety of habitats and ages, including unforested early successional habitats to attract woodcock, a decidedly “unfriendly” choice for true forest birds. 
Managing private forest lands with birds in mind may be an acceptable practice considering more destructive alternatives, such as clear-cutting large tracts of forest to maximize profits. But it is not acceptable on public lands where proforestation should be practiced to properly address the climate and biodiversity crises. That is the appropriate choice for the people’s forests.
Describing the Telephone Gap project as “bird-friendly” is nothing more than a ploy to enlist support from the thousands of people who simply “love birds,” especially those whose experience with Nature is mostly with the birds that visit their backyard feeders. They support the billion-dollar bird-feeding industry and the organizations that promise to protect the birds they love, but they rarely venture to wild places like Telephone Gap.
According to the environmental assessment prepared for Telephone Gap, the birds that will benefit from the proposed harvest treatments include, “many passerines such as the eastern bluebird, common yellow-throat, song sparrow, and American goldfinch,” all familiar backyard birds. The Forest Service provides zero information about the mature forest species that will be depleted by these misguided efforts to provide habitat for common birds that simply do not belong in mature forest ecosystems. 
But then again, that’s not really the goal, is it? The real intent is to log, baby, log, and the Forest Service and its sycophants have employed all manner of disinformation to justify these actions.  “A lighter touch on the land”; “bird-friendly”; “enhancing old forest through harvesting.”
Nothing more than greenwashing — and a carefully crafted, highly unethical scam.

He beat the goal he set for himself, finishing a half marathon in 1 hour and 37 minutes. While visibly tired from the feat, he walked a few laps, cheering on the runners that remained on the field. 
If not for Vanderheuf, he and 44 other inmates wouldn’t be running a half marathon in a prison yard at the Utah State Correctional Facility. He was the one to first pitch the idea to the Utah Department of Corrections — all to find purpose again after struggles with substance abuse.
For him and the other inmates, Friday’s race was more than seeing the goal they put in so much sweat and training for coming to fruition. It was also a milestone in their paths to turn their lives around.
Utah state officials invited reporters to watch the half marathon on Friday, hoping to highlight the new program and the story behind it.

Vanderheuf said the idea came to him after journalist and television host Christiane Amanpour did a segment on “26.2 to Life,” a documentary depicting the San Quentin Prison’s running club in California. Vanderheuf said he watched it on the tiny TV in his cell. 
“I felt connected to them,” he told Utah News Dispatch after finishing the race Friday. 
Vanderheuf said he was an athlete in college, but he quit sports after struggling with addiction. Now, he finds purpose in running, which he said is a crucial part of his recovery journey.
“It feels great to come back to life,” he said, especially on days like this, when the group feels “loved and seen” with visitors watching their achievements. 
“When I started running, I couldn’t put my finger on it, but I started feeling better,” Vanderheuf said. Now, in a better place, he said he’s ready to go back home, be a great dad and husband. 
Getting the 45 runners participating at the Utah State Correctional Facility’s first half marathon was a Herculean task. 
For safety reasons, it took months of preparation and training to bring them all together at an outdoor exercise lawn. It also took a couple of races getting progressively longer every month to reach the 13.1 miles goal on Friday, according to recreational therapists who organized the event.
Those 13.1 miles didn’t look like the usual half marathons that happen outside prison, in public. Instead of a straight route, runners ran in circles. Three laps accounted for about a mile and 39 made up for the total distance. 
Like in the documentary, Utah’s “Fit From Within” running club was designed to encourage participants to run 1,000 miles a year, not only tackling physical fitness, but mental health issues among incarcerated people. The effort was initiated by Vanderheuf, but is managed by the Division of Correctional Health Services, part of the Department of Health and Human Services.

The Friday event was two years in the making, Vanderheuf said. But he hopes all the effort it took means that many inmates will return home being better people. 
For him, it was a snapshot of what could await him after his parole hearing this year. By beating his time goal by a few minutes, he hopes he’s on track to run in next year’s Boston Marathon — something he hopes to accomplish when he’s no longer behind bars.
During the half marathon, some state staffers, volunteers and Utah lawmakers jogged alongside the inmates for a few laps. That included Rep. Katy Hall, R-Ogden. After she watched the same film that inspired Vanderheuf, Hall said she contacted the Department of Corrections to replicate the running club — only to learn that a similar effort was already underway.
Hall, however, kept volunteering. As a runner, she knows what running can do to improve mental health, she said. 
“It’s amazing to see the enthusiasm,” she said Friday. “It has snowballed.”
With a bill passed this year allowing private donations for a state Rehabilitation and Reentry Services Special Revenue Fund, Hall is encouraging Utahns to give financial donations which can be used to buy running shoes or treadmills, since there are only two or three on the prison’s campus, she said.



Let us know what you think...


 


Running in the club is a privilege granted with good behavior, organizers said. Runners also need to be cleared to get together, a process that takes two to four weeks. State officials say the first six months of the program have proven worthwhile so far.
Ellie Madenberg, a recreation therapist at the Department of Corrections, said she’s noticed a lot of signs of decreasing depression and anxiety in the surveys runners fill out before and after a race. The goal, she said, is to keep collecting data in the future to determine whether the program helps improve recidivism rates and other outcomes. 
After finishing shorter races with quirky names, like “Love Yourself” for Valentine’s Day, and a “March Madness” run, participants are already preparing for a 15-mile event next month and will keep on adding length to the races until they achieve a marathon.
Alex Mendoza, an inmate representative of one of the buildings that houses general-population inmates who qualify for work, programming and education initiatives, couldn’t run on Friday because of a knee injury, but he acted as “hype man” during the race.
Like many watching, he cheered on as runners completed every lap.
“The best thing is bringing everyone together,” he said. “It puts a smile on people’s faces. You don’t get to see that often.”

Shay Shelnutt, R-Trussville, all have won elections to represent parts of the county unopposed since at least 2012.
“Blount County is a very particular county,” McDerment said in an interview. “We were one of the most Trump-ian counties in the last election.”

But McDerment’s appointment also represents a significant achievement for Alabama’s Democratic Party: the establishment of a county chair in each of the state’s 67 counties. It’s a milestone for a party that has face challenges with disorganization at the local and state levels. 
“I hope and believe that people will be fed up, because there’s a lot of goodness in people around here, and we just have to give them an option, because currently they don’t have one,” McDerment said.
The effort to organize began after the election of Randy Kelly as state party chair and Ben Harris as vice chair for county affairs in 2022. Harris, who also serves as a Mobile County chair, said they wanted a chair in every county in Alabama so that they can start electing Democrats on a local level. He said that “this is a long-term strategy and a long-term effort, and it’s a part of building the party.”
“It’s a matter of building kind of brick by brick, day by day, and we’re going to do it,” Harris said.
Susan McKenney, chair of the Alabama Democratic County Chairs’ Association and chair for Marshall County, said that local organization and having Democrats running in local races is critical. She said the association has been working on this initiative for three and a half years, recruiting, training the county chairs and ensuring that all chairs are aware of their duties and how to perform them.
“The counties are the most important part of the puzzle here. This is where the rubber meets the road,” McKenney said.
For years, the party’s grassroots efforts have been described as fragmented. U.S. Army veteran Linda Turner, the chair for Houston County, remembered attending Democratic meetings “where all (she) heard was how bad the state party was and how unorganized it was. Everybody was waiting for somebody else to do the work.”
She said that before the efforts to establish a chair in every county, organizing happened only in the more populated cities like Huntsville, Mobile and Birmingham, and “everybody else was twisting their thumb because there nobody knew where to go or what to say.”
Turner said that while Georgia’s county party organization took 10 years to activate all its counties, partly due to having over 100 counties, the effort to organize the association in Alabama was due to having a “void” in the state party, leaving “people want(ing) to know where the Democratic Party was.”
“It was something that needed to happen,” she said. “Because we really hadn’t had a Democratic county party in every county in probably decades.”
For McDerment, the decision to get involved stemmed from a deep concern for fundamental rights being stripped from immigrants, adding that “if you strip due process from one group of people in this country, and due process is the method by which you determine whether or not someone’s even a citizen, then you don’t have due process for anybody in this country.”
“We’re treating people poorly and we’re dismantling the legal foundation of this country,” he said. “You can’t call people off, put them in a camp – just snatch them off the streets. That’s Nazi stuff.”
Harris said that county chairs will be building out the party’s infrastructure from the bottom-up. They are providing training sessions for chairs in different regions of the state, teaching them how to recruit candidates, how to fundraise and to discuss strategies that work best in their counties.
“Our county party leaders are out in the community. They’re out at events that are important in the community. They’re involved in recruiting candidates. They’re going to city council meetings and school board meetings and county commission meetings where issues are that are important or being argued, and they’re meeting people who are interested in those things,” Harris said.
McDerment, who has not been involved in politics prior to becoming county chair, said that the current political climate energized him to to get involved, saying that his motivation “is a sign of how things are right now,” and he believes that people might start to change their minds once they see the effects of Trump’s tariffs and policy on immigration on a local level.
“I believe in my heart of hearts that people can be motivated to change their minds when they’re confronted with something that just doesn’t work, and in this case, randomly tariffing imports from all of our greatest economic partners is not something that ever worked,” McDerment.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/AR-Election-Day-Huntsville-110524-13-1024x585.jpg,,,2025-07-21 08:56:15.794800

The office is designed to strengthen state-tribal early childhood partnerships and official say it will be rooted in respect, sovereignty and collaboration, stemming from the 2019 law that created the department. Joannie Suina spoke to KUNM about what led her into this work and her future goals for the office.
JOANNIE SUINA: I bring with me into this role, over two decades of working in culturally responsive education. I started my career as a native language teacher in my community of Cochiti Pueblo, teaching our language, Keres, which is orally based. And I did that for about seven years, and then taught at the post secondary level at the Institute of American Indian Arts. And in looking at the kind of leadership that I bring to the role, it’s very much grounded in my Pueblo values as a Native woman, and along with that, comes with being a mother as well. So, I couldn’t have been better prepared ultimately.
KUNM: As you’re coming into this role and seeing where the state stands now in overall child well being, why is it important to you to center this type of early intervention and support for families across the state?
Well, I think that early childhood care is where cultural continuance and the future and sustainability of Native lifeways meet the future of education as a whole. And I am very much centered in this work, because I believe that we’re not only raising our next language speakers, who are seeking that belonging within themselves or communities that they come from, but we’re really affirming the sacredness of what we know and practice as Native people, that our children are sacred. So centering those along with being able to collaborate across our sister agencies with New Mexico Indian Affairs Department, and ensuring that we’re aligning with the State Tribal Collaboration Act to lead and support government to government consultation across the 23 nations, tribes, and pueblos of New Mexico. I believe that this also further supports that integration of culturally and linguistically responsive practices in our early learning systems.
The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Native American Early Childhood Education and Care is the first in its nation to work towards strengthening state and tribal collaboration and early childhood education. What does that mean to you, and where do you see these partnerships going in the future? 
I think in the current climate, it’s important to bring previous policy experience, but also to focus on a healing-centered leadership approach that is rooted in my own previous work, which was on Indian boarding school policy, and looking at how that trauma in itself has created ripple effects for families, not only nationally but globally, and how language revitalization and cultural continuance being centered within curricula across early childhood programs in New Mexico are what our families and our communities need to truly achieve that healing. And being able to carry some of those stories of trauma with me and keep those at bay as I enter this new role, allows me to further be deeply relational, because I’ve lived it, I breathed it, I’ve created it. And ensuring that our children are able to experience something much different from what our ancestor relatives experienced.
And as you mentioned, you’ve only been in the role now just for a few weeks. Have you encountered any issues so far that may have changed your goals while in this position, or even sparked new ideas? 
There’s no denying that we’re in a difficult time and that our families are facing immense challenges, economic stress, overall health needs, and looking at that lasting impact of intergenerational trauma that I shared. But I truly believe in our collective power and coming on board with ECECD seed, and I believe that early childhood is where we begin to shift that story.

The Multiple Listing Service (MLS) is the go-to resource Realtors use to list properties and find prospective homes for buyers. Privatizing its ownership could potentially further decentralize an industry disrupted by online platforms that allow potential buyers to search homes on their own and avoid representation by an agent.
“The MLS is really the primary income for the Board of Realtors, and the only reason most of us are, frankly, members, since there’s very few other benefits,” Realtor Zar Zanganeh said in a social media post Thursday. “Selling the MLS is going to benefit simply a couple of people who are going to be owning it and not regulating what they charge for fees.”
Last year, the Denver Metro Association of Realtors and South Metro Denver Realtors Association, the majority shareholders of the MLS in that metro area, sold the listing to a hedge fund for an undisclosed amount.  
Listing information provided to Zillow, Redfin, and other real estate platforms is syndicated through MLS, contributing to its value. It’s unknown how much the sites currently pay for the data. A sale of the MLS to a private party could benefit platforms that partner with the new ownership. 
HousingWire reports the Colorado state board warned Denver-area agents that private ownership of the MLS could have negative consequences, particularly with regard to data, who owns it, and how it’s secured. How the data is being used by its new owner, MAZL LLC, remains a mystery.
Former LVR president Keith Lynam says the rumored sale of the local MLS “is nonsense,” and is likely based on speculation that current president George Kypreos, whose firm is the Southern Nevada broker for properties owned by Zillow, is attempting to hire Zillow executive Nobu Hata as CEO of LVR. Hata was CEO of the Denver association when it sold its MLS. 
The changes proposed by the LVR board would eliminate several board positions, including a representative of the association’s MLS committee. 
An email message sent by the board to the association’s 15,000 members says the changes “are designed to enhance governance, expand the pool of leadership candidates from which the membership can choose, protect the integrity of our elections, and streamline committees.” 
The local dispute comes in the wake of allegations of election tampering that prompted LVR’s president in January to resign two days into his term, and as some agents struggle with new rules on how they are compensated.
In 2024, the National Association of Realtors settled class-action suits that alleged the practice of shared commissions between sellers’ and buyers’ agents amounted to collusion and violated anti-trust laws by reducing competition and inflating commissions.   
The settlement prompted a seismic shift in the compensation model – requiring that sellers pay the listing agent’s commission while the buyer pays their own agent, a departure from the tradition of the seller paying both agents. Since August 17, 2024, prospective buyers have been required to sign compensation agreements with agents before viewing homes, a process some agents describe as awkward and cumbersome.
Only members of Realtor associations are subject to the new compensation rules, a factor that, coupled with association unrest, could entice more agents to drop their memberships, say industry experts.
“They would also not be subject to the Realtors’ Code of Ethics,” warns past president Judie Woods, a member of the association since 1978. The code outlines conduct and professional responsibilities for fairness and integrity. 
The membership is slated to vote on the changes July 30 via Zoom “where all of our members can vote for or against these proposed by-law changes electronically during the virtual meeting,” Kypreos said in a video message sent to members. 
“That raised red flags for many members,” says Woods. “Why are we doing a bylaw change in a Zoom meeting? We always do them at a meeting where there’s open discussion, where you discuss pros and cons, and then vote on the motion with the members that are present.” 
Kypreos and LVR did not respond to requests for comment on a potential sale of the MLS, or the reasons for a virtual, rather than in-person, general membership meeting.
A petition posted online calls for the board to scrap the Zoom meeting in favor of a traditional meeting, and urges members to vote against the proposed changes to the by-laws. 
“The proposals change a lot of the core principles of our association,” Woods said by phone Friday. “It proposes removing several committees, including the bylaw committee, which has been there since the inception. It’s part of every realtor organization. These proposed changes to the bylaws did not even go through the bylaw committee.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_2620-1-scaled-e1753021379221-1024x618.jpg,,,2025-07-21 08:56:15.794800

(National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration)The average human brain now contains enough tiny plastic fragments to equal the weight of a plastic spoon, a 50% increase in the past decade.
Those sobering statistics, included in a February study from researchers at the University of New Mexico, spurred a bipartisan, bicameral and bicoastal congressional team to introduce legislation Thursday to require the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to study the health impacts of microplastics.
U.S. Rep. Janelle Bynum and Sen. Jeff Merkley, both Oregon Democrats, and U.S. Sen. Rick Scott and Rep. Greg Steube, both Florida Republicans, introduced the Microplastics Safety Act.
Bynum told the Capital Chronicle it’s an example of the type of “low-hanging fruit” she aims to tackle as a first-term congresswoman in the minority party.

“The (Trump) administration has indicated an interest in making America healthy again, so this was the perfect opportunity to marry the interests of Oregonians with the interests of the administration,” Bynum said.
The three-page bill would require Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to identify the major causes of microplastic exposure and study the impact of exposure to microplastics on children’s health, hormones, cancer, chronic illness and reproductive health. Kennedy would need to submit a report to Congress within a year.
Scott, the chairman of the U.S. Senate’s Special Committee on Aging, said in a statement that he was especially concerned about the long-term harm microplastics pose to older Americans.
The University of New Mexico study found a clear correlation between people diagnosed with dementia and plastic — brain tissue from dementia patients had up to 10 times as much plastic than brain tissue from others — but it couldn’t determine a causal link.
“The Microplastics Safety Act is a critical step toward understanding the full scope of these risks,” Scott said. “As exposure continues to grow through food, water, air, and everyday products, this legislation will help ensure we’re guided by sound science to protect public health and our next generation.”
Microplastic pollution is everywhere, even in the exhaled breath of dolphins

Merkley added that microplastics threaten human health and the environment.
“Most of us have been taught the three Rs: reduce, reuse, and recycle. Too often, the reality for plastics is really the three Bs — buried, burned, and borne out to sea — as dangerous chemicals are seeping into our soil, air, and water,” he said in a statement.
Bynum said it’s not a coincidence that the bill’s first four sponsors hail from coastal states: People who live near the coast, or by rivers or lakes, are more likely to see large plastic washing up on beaches.
“This is a real issue that people can see every day in their communities, and they’re also probably a lot more focused on making sure that those waterways and those areas of recreation and areas where we are harvesting our food, are clean, are safe to eat and are not environmentally contaminated,” she said.
She also hopes that a federal study will help more people understand the reasoning behind policies like Oregon’s laws to phase out the use of plastic bags, straws and disposable tableware. As a state representative, Bynum voted for 2019 laws to ban single-use plastic grocery bags and prohibit restaurants from giving plastic straws to customers who don’t ask for them.
Critics decried those bans as “virtue signaling” and symptoms of a “nanny state” government.
Bynum said she hopes that having more information and research from the federal government will help more people see the value of limiting plastic, similar to how the Food and Drug Administration provides guidance on how much water to drink or what constitutes a healthy balance of protein and vegetables.
She said it may be hard to trust the results of a report from a department led by Kennedy, whose stances on vaccines and fluoride in drinking water have alarmed scientists and public health officials. But Bynum said that isn’t a reason to stop trying to help improve health and welfare.
“Ultimately, I think it is important for us to ask the question about what microplastics are doing to our bodies and to our environment, and we should continue pushing on that, whoever’s in charge of the administration,” she said.

Sorrell said last week he planned to return contributions received from a Georgia man accused of running a $140 million Ponzi scheme, and claimed that he was a victim of it. (Stew Milne for Alabama Reflector)Money has a gravitational effect on politics. A little can tilt campaigns and policy. A lot warps the democratic process like a bowling ball dropped on a bed.
So campaign finance laws show how much our leaders care about a level playing field. Strong ones reveal the flow of money and restrict the ability of the richest 1% to dominate the conversation. They keep the public in mind.
And weak ones?  Let’s take a look at last week’s political headlines in Alabama.
Alabama Political Reporter on Monday reported that Katherine Robertson, a longtime aide to Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall who is seeking the office for herself, got a $1 million donation in June from First Principles Inc.
What is First Principles Inc.? Damned if anyone knows. It’s a dark money organization with hardly any paper trail. If you want to know who’s funding it, too bad.
And it’s legal for First Principles to spread its wealth around, which Robertson’s campaign repeatedly noted in response to questions from APR. But voters still have a right to know who likes Robertson so much they’ll give her $1 million — and more importantly, why they like her so much.
Then there’s First Liberty Building & Loan.
As Alander Rocha reported Thursday, Georgia’s Edwin Brant Frost IV, the owner of First Liberty and the subject of a SEC indictment alleging Frost ran a $140 million Ponzi scheme, gave about $132,000 to three elected Republican officials in Alabama over the last four years.
Those officials — Alabama State Auditor Andrew Sorrell, who got about $71,000 in donations; Alabama State Board of Education member Allen Long, who got $40,000, and Rep. Ben Harrison, R-Elkmont, who got about $21,000 — are not accused of being involved in the scheme. Sorrell and Harrison both told Rocha they would return the contributions. (Long did not respond to questions from the Reflector.)
But then there’s the matter of the Alabama state auditor’s PAC lending Frost’s company $29,000 last year. Sorrell says he was misled like Frost’s other investors are alleged to have been.
Under Alabama law, PACs can make loans as part of a broader purpose of “influencing an election.” I look forward to hearing if and how Frost’s activity met that definition.
But beyond that, why on Earth is a political action committee allowed to make a loan to a private company? A PAC is not an FDIC-insured lender. This is an entity that gets contributions for the express purpose of electing a candidate or lobbying for a public policy. How would you like the money you spent to win an election ending up in the hands of a third party accused of fraud? Whose business activities are not subject to disclosure laws?
But there aren’t many restrictions on campaign finance spending in Alabama anyway. PAC-to-PAC transfers are banned in the state, but enforcement of that ban is situational at best. Marshall escaped a referral in 2018 for accepting money from a federal PAC for his reelection campaign that year.
And I’ve seen many other entities work to conceal their efforts on behalf of candidates. The Alabama Education Association in 2014 routed millions of dollars to out-of-state entities, which then routed millions of dollars to the association’s preferred Republican candidates without AEA’s name on them. Political consultants can also distribute one donor’s cash among multiple PACs and send the money onto candidates without any clear sense of who or what is supporting them.
Our campaign finance laws are written and enforced not to ensure voters have a clear view of the motives and interests of those seeking office, but to conceal that from us. They create a frictionless path between the wealthy and their candidates.
Which reflects the design of Alabama government. It allows the powerful to act with impunity and never have to fear the verdict of the ballot box or the censure of popular feeling. Lawmakers care far more about “stakeholders” — their term for powerful interests — than voters.
A representative government would work from the understanding that the wealthy are a very tiny sliver of the population, with unusual access to resources and priorities that could harm the rest of us. There would be a basic understanding that money and the public interest are not the same. That voters need to understand who’s using money to influence elections.
The Sorrell loan seems so far outside the intent of campaign finance, even in Alabama, that I’d like to believe someone will try to ban it next year. It’s a layup that won’t affect the ability of incumbents to draw down cash.
I’m far less optimistic that we’ll see more enforcement of existing laws. And even less effort to stop anonymous people from influencing our elections.
But why would lawmakers try? They’re working for the donors, and they work to let the donors do what they want. The state’s campaign laws reflect a basic truth: we have elections in Alabama, but not democracy.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/State-of-the-State-26-Andrew-Sorrell-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-21 08:56:15.794800

But it still takes your breath away when you witness it up close. The Washoe County Commissioners meeting July 15 evoked a scene from the movie “Jaws” — the one where Richard Dreyfus’ character tries to get the mayor of a popular destination to prioritize health and safety, but to no avail. The mayor of “Jaws” fictitious Amity Island didn’t want to jeopardize tourism revenue or future development. Harm was done.  Lives were lost.
Washoe Tahoe community members in chambers and via remote link echoed Richard Dreyfus last week pleading again with authorities not to approve development codes that would allow increased building height and density and population in a geographically constrained mountainous area lacking an up-to-date wildfire evacuation plan.  
It’s well known that Tahoe’s congested two-lane roads are ill-equipped to handle a mass evacuation. Worse, Washoe county admitted last year that its out-of-date emergency management plan never included tens of thousands of visitors – let alone construction teams and new inhabitants. Heightening the problem today, budget cuts have left federal disaster aid uncertain for states and local jurisdictions that rely on federal grants.
The dramatic proposed code changes that will forever alter north Tahoe’s rural landscape originated from Lake Tahoe’s overlord: the bi-state Tahoe Regional Planning Agency (TRPA), headquartered in Stateline, NV. The agency in recent years has become quite chummy with developers, resort operators and investors with significant business before the TRPA. These include Edgewood Companies, Vail Resorts, Palisades Tahoe, and Homewood Mountain Resort controlled by the private equity firm JMA. 
TRPA’s governing board includes Washoe county Chair Alexis Hill whose donors include developer, construction, and realtors groups. While a commissioner Hill has directed tax money to the Tahoe Prosperity Center (where she serves as Board Chair) and the Tahoe Fund (which boasts a who’s who board) to fund studies and playbooks that benefit tourism and development projects and initiatives, often vigorously opposed by Tahoe communities. Hill also sits on the Reno Sparks  Convention and Visitor’s Authority (RSCVA), which derives tens of millions of dollars in tourism revenue from transient occupancy tax and Lake Tahoe promotion.
Hill is the closest thing to a mayor for the nearly 9,000 person Washoe Tahoe community members who reside in district 1, which also includes portions of the northwest and southwest Truckee Meadows. Lake Tahoe is 22 miles long, north to south, and 12 miles wide, with 72 miles of shoreline. Unincorporated Tahoe communities rely on counties for most of their services. Some 15 rural villages and one city encircle Lake Tahoe, which spans Nevada and California. 
None of Washoe county’s five commissioners live within the Tahoe basin. 
Concern about Lake Tahoe’s environmental and wildfire challenges has been an ongoing theme.  For the past several years, Tahoe residents have shown up in force at TRPA, Nevada legislative and county meetings pleading for an updated cumulative environmental review, carrying capacity, and a comprehensive basin-wide wildfire evacuation plan ahead of any new development allowances. At a pivotal TRPA governing board meeting in December 2023 an overflowing room of residents, some forced to wait outside in a snow-filled frigid parking lot, came to express valid concerns about urbanizing a rural region with limited infrastructure. There were more than 600 pages of public comment about the egregious lack of environmental review and wildfire evacuation planning.
One resident even wrote that she was updating her will to ask her descendants to sue TRPA should she die in a wildfire.
In the past year each of Tahoe’s counties had to choose to adopt TRPA’s code changes or opt out. Hill now has to sell the package to Washoe County’s four other commissioners. Yesterday’s presentation was nothing short of a Kabuki dance between the Washoe planner Eric Young and Hill who made quite a show of pretending to care about resident’s legitimate concerns, but not so much that they’d fight TRPA on behalf of residents. 
In what’s become deja-vu all over again, Richard Miner, former head of the Incline Village and Crystal Bay Historical Society, didn’t mince words: “the county’s elected representatives must not continue to subvert the will of the citizens to the go-along-to-get-along attitude. The evidence is incontrovertible that increasing the density of the population of the Lake Tahoe Basin is the roadmap to disaster—no, ‘if, ands, or buts’ about it. It is this county’s last chance to stand up for sanity.”
He added, “Commissioner Hill, you need to show some guts and vote no on the Area Plan as now written. The protection and preservation of the Lake Tahoe Basin is now in your hands.”
Kristina Hill (no relation to the commissioner), a former TRPA planner, Washoe County Board of Adjustment Chair, and Lake Tahoe Environmental Planning Consultant for 41 years, on July 15 stated “the proposed amendments are a sham allowing more development disguised as ‘workforce housing’ which will result in more market rate residential condos and housing units.”
District 2 Commissioner Mike Clark concurred with that opinion and emphasized the chaos that accompanied the Los Angeles wildfire evacuations. He said his mantra was “do no harm” and “we shouldn’t be a part of adding more congestion up there.” He encouraged much more discussion before any action is taken.  
District 5 Commissioner Jeanne Herman added, “I agree that the concerns that people have are serious and I feel for them…I’m so concerned about what this could do.” In 2021 Herman was the lone dissenting vote against zoning changes that enabled residential homes in unincorporated district 1, many of which housed local workers holding long-term leases, to be converted into transient housing for tourists.
Commissioner Hill, who claims to be a champion for local workers, led the motion in 2021 to allow unlimited short-term rentals in Washoe Tahoe, which played no small part in the displacement of community members whose long-term rentals were not renewed.
Not recognizing the irony, she advanced the latest development code changes that will add to roadway congestion, further strain infrastructure, and heighten evacuation challenges saying: “I don’t want someone to say why did we bring this [development code] forward to the commission and the commission did nothing.”

(Stew Milne for Alabama ReflectorReflector)The Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles finalized new parole guidelines on Thursday after allowing the public to review and comment on them for the past several weeks.
The finalized version, announced Friday, is nearly identical to one that the parole board made available for comment at the end of May. The major changes involve an increase in weights given the severity of the original offense for parole applicants and more consideration of applicants’ behavior, both positive and negative, while incarcerated.
The board said in a statement that the new weight on the original offense would “better capture offenses that are classified as sexual and/or violent crimes.”

The adopted guidelines reinforce Alabama Code giving full discretion of parole decisions to the Board and further clarify how the Board may use the guidelines as a tool in conjunction with all other factors that go into the parole decision-making process,” the parole board said in a statement on Friday. “The guidelines also ensure weighted factors receive proper measurement in light of the statutory requirements and represent a sufficient scope for each factor. Additionally, the revised guidelines align with the Board’s and Bureau’s commitments to rehabilitation.”
The statement from the board said the guidelines place more emphasis on disciplinary violations while incarcerated. Additional consideration will also be given to those who finished an educational program, such as obtaining a GED or completing a vocational program while incarcerated in prison.
“For each applicant’s final scoring on the Board’s guidelines, a neutral category was added to account for cases that are evenly balanced,” the parole board said. “A neutral baseline score calls for the Board’s decision to be guided by other factors in its comprehensive review of the inmate’s file and information provided at the time of the hearing.”
Parole applicants will also be able to submit video statements to the board.
“The video complements an inmate’s Institutional Parole Officer’s (IPO) Report, which is compiled by an IPO prior to a parole hearing,” the parole board said.
Parole guidelines are non-binding recommendations that use a point system to determine whether a person should be granted parole.  The more points an applicant accumulates, the less likely they are to be recommended for parole.
The guidelines consider several factors, from the underlying offense to behavior while incarcerated and the quality of the re-entry plan that people submit to help reduce recidivism.
Many criminal justice reform organizations that weighed in on the guidelines recommended that they give more consideration to applicants’ behavior in prison and less on the original offense.
“Each of the suggestions offered are measures rooted in peer-reviewed scholarship proven to have direct correlation to improved recidivation and public safety outcomes – benefitting the general community, ADOC staff, as well as parole applicants,” said Jerome Dees, policy director for the Southern Poverty Law Center, in a statement on Friday. “We hope that moving forward, the newly constituted Board will look to data-driven factors to inform their decisions which will ultimately impact all Alabamians.”
In the end, not many of the groups’ recommendations were included in the finalized version.
“We appreciate the thorough review and consideration of our comments, and at least the guidelines now take into account completion of educational programming,” said Carla Crowder, executive director of Alabama Appleseed, in a statement on Friday. “However, we are extremely disappointed that these guidelines place all the responsibility upon incarcerated people to prepare their own reentry plans or else be penalized by these guidelines. Yet, the statewide reentry commission has determined it’s almost impossible to do so based on gaps in services inside ADOC. The state just continues to punish people for institutional failures and that’s wrong.”
The deadline for adopting the new parole guidelines was 2022, and legislators became increasingly frustrated over the last year over the delays. A provision put in the 2026 General Fund budget earlier this year made the board’s funding next year contingent on the adoption of the guidelines.
The parole board said in the news release that it will continue to review the guidelines every three years per state statute. Regardless, criminal justice reform groups remain disappointed with the finalized version.
“This cannot be what the legislature had in mind when it called for a review of the guidelines,” said Lauren Faraino, a civil rights attorney, in a statement. “In any other area of public life, we would never accept a scoring system this flawed, this slanted, and this untethered from results. No one would trust a health care policy, an education rating, or a business decision that relied purely on the gut instincts of a single lifetime prosecutor. Yet that’s exactly what we’re doing here.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Parole_Board_018-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-21 08:56:15.794800

This story was originally reported by Mel Leonor Barclay, Marissa Martinez and Jennifer Gerson of The 19th.
A key office charged by Congress with coordinating the federal government’s work against human trafficking was gutted last Friday, the latest in a string of cuts across different agencies to the government’s work on an issue that Republicans have long hailed as a top priority.
The cuts at the State Department’s Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons (TIP) decimated a team that worked to combat labor and sex trafficking abroad and helped coordinate domestic efforts across other agencies, including the departments of Justice, Health and Human Services, and Labor.
The so-called “reduction-in-force” at the State Department came amid a maelstrom surrounding the Trump administration over its handling of federal investigations into sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who died in prison while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges in 2019. Officials have said he died by suicide, but his death sparked new conspiracy theories that were fueled by President Donald Trump, who at one point maintained a friendship with Epstein. When this month the Justice Department said there was no Epstein client list, after previously promising to release it, many who had supported Trump and Attorney General Pam Bondi were angered, in part because they believed the client list would reveal new truths about Epstein.
Republicans have for years made human trafficking a key issue, pushing for legislation to boost law enforcement and support for victims and telling voters that combating trafficking was a major priority.
For Secretary of State Marco Rubio, anti-trafficking work has been a centerpiece of his policy agenda. Rubio cosponsored bipartisan legislation to help domestic trafficking survivors during his time in the Senate and as recently as May discussed his concerns about a rise in human trafficking in an unstable Haiti. He criticized former President Joe Biden’s immigration policy by saying it “empowered” child trafficking into the United States.
Bondi, too, has long been an advocate of local and federal efforts to combat human trafficking, making it a key focus of her tenure as Florida’s attorney general. She went on to lobby on behalf of a Christian anti-human-trafficking advocacy group and the Qatari government on anti-human-trafficking efforts.
People working on human trafficking issues in the federal government and for advocacy groups on the front lines of that work in the United States and abroad have been surprised at the pullback. The administration’s attention to the issue during Trump’s first term and the ascent of high-profile advocates to the Cabinet gave them the impression that their work would be shielded from the kinds of cuts they were seeing elsewhere.
Instead, funding and staffing for human trafficking work has taken sizable hits.
“We really thought that the broad, bipartisan nature of the issue of trafficking was going to provide some protection for our office. All Americans are against trafficking — Republicans, Democrats, everybody,” said Cindy Dyer, the former ambassador-at-large under Biden to monitor and combat trafficking in persons at the State Department. The office she oversaw had close to 90 full-time staffers. It lost about a dozen to the Trump administration’s voluntary resignation program earlier in the year, and, last Friday, about half were dismissed. The remaining were demoted, Dyer said.
The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The office’s work spanned a broad range of human trafficking issues, including sex trafficking, which disproportionately affects women, girls and LGBTQ+ people, and forced domestic labor, which also disproportionately affects women and girls. Dyer is now the chief program officer at the McCain Institute at Arizona State University, which promotes democracy and human rights across the world.
“We really thought that broad bipartisan support we have had for 25 years — ever since the Trafficking Victims Protection Act passed in 2000 — would provide us some protection, and it did not. And I think people are really both surprised and disappointed,” said Dyer, who also worked in the Justice Department in the George W. Bush administration.
The most recent reauthorization of the law was approved in 2017, during the first Trump administration. The law charged the TIP office with producing an annual report that was due to Congress on June 30; this year’s report has been delayed without explanation. Last week’s cuts severely impacted the team working on that report, which is widely considered a critical global assessment of human trafficking prevention work.
Before those staffing cuts, the office had also paused the disbursement of grants for nongovernmental organizations working on human trafficking. The 19th could not confirm the current status of those grants.
Varina Winder, who worked as the chief of staff in the Office of Global Women’s Issues at the State Department during the Biden administration, said she was dismayed by the pullback on work to uphold global human rights, including stopping trafficking at TIP.
“If you can’t empower the office that is literally ending human slavery, what does that say about your larger ambitions about the value proposition of humans in this administration?” she said.
Martina Vandenberg of the Human Trafficking Legal Center said federal work to combat human trafficking falls into four buckets: the State Department’s global work, prosecution at the Justice Department, federal funding for outside groups and immigration policy. Every area has taken a hit since the start of the administration, Vandenberg said.
“We have grave concerns,” said Vandenberg, whose anti-trafficking advocacy group connects trafficking survivors with pro bono representation. “It is distressing to see U.S. anti-trafficking programs decimated by an administration that rode to victory, at least in part, on claims that it would combat human trafficking.”
The Human Trafficking Legal Center published an analysis of federal data this week showing that visas for victims of human trafficking who cooperate with law enforcement to arrest and prosecute traffickers are being issued at record-low levels, despite a growing backlog. (The 19th reported on this backlog in May.)
At the Labor Department, the Trump administration in March put an end to close to 70 programs and more than $500 million in grant funding that the agency was using to combat child labor and human trafficking in countries that have trade agreements with the United States. The funding helped ensure foreign governments were fighting human trafficking while also protecting U.S. jobs, The Washington Post reported at the time. The office that managed the funding was also tasked with producing a congressionally mandated report that, in part, outlined goods produced with child labor.
“To have this administration cut funding so significantly has just been a huge blow to the progress that has been made over the last several decades,” said a federal government employee familiar with this work who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of fear of retaliation.
“Within the anti-trafficking movement and in the government, we were hoping that we would be protected in some way since during Trump’s first administration, there was more funding for anti-trafficking then than there had been in previous administrations even. And Ivanka Trump took a really strong interest in the issue,” the employee said. In his first term, the president’s oldest daughter made the issue central to her portfolio and hosted a summit at the White House.
“We’ve just seen a huge shift in this administration, and honestly, it’s sent shock waves through the community,” the employee said.
On Thursday night, Trump said he would authorize Bondi to request from a federal court the grand jury testimony from Epstein’s trial. It was a reversal from her previous position on what she would release, though it is still unclear what transcripts the courts could approve to be made public.
Reps. Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, and Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican, have been trying to force a floor vote on releasing the complete Epstein files. Several far-right Republicans have signed on to the discharge petition effort so far, including Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene, Eli Crane, Lauren Boebert and Max Miller.
Discharge petitions are a procedural maneuver that circumvents House leadership and the powerful Rules Committee to force a floor vote. They’ve rarely been successful because they require a majority of House members’ signatures to kick off. Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, managed to kill the last one raised in April, which would have let new parents vote by proxy while away from the Capitol.
But Khanna said he’s confident that the petition will move forward: “We have the votes.”
“Moms being allowed to vote in the House is important,” he said of the failed discharge petition effort, then added: “But the release of the Epstein files to the MAGA base matters 100 times more to them. I think it’s a totally different situation in terms of the intensity of scrutiny. … The base cares so deeply about this.”
Next week, a group of high-profile Republicans are expected to gather at the Capitol for the annual International Summit Against Human Trafficking put on by the Conservative Political Action Conference, the group behind the annual gathering of right-wing activists and politicians.
“This pivotal event upholds CPAC’s steadfast dedication to eradicating modern-day slavery by uniting survivors, legislators, advocates, and law enforcement from both domestic and international communities to drive bold solutions,” the announcement for the event reads. The group said earlier this month that Trump’s investments in immigration enforcement in the “one big beautiful bill” will “hit traffickers where it hurts by taking away the shadows they exploit.”
Just days later, Freedom Network USA, one of the leading anti-trafficking groups in the country, is planning to hold a webinar on World Day Against Trafficking in Persons “to break down how the Trump administration’s heinous attacks have impacted human trafficking survivors.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2223544407-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-21 07:56:43.042568

Microgrids are essentially local “islands” of energy generation and storage systems that connect to a utility but can operate independently when needed. Many are designed to serve community facilities such as hospitals and schools during emergencies.
California passed its own microgrid policy in 2018, but Oregon advocates say the new legislation there is the most ambitious in the nation.
If a utility needs to shut off transmission lines during a period of high wildfire danger, a community microgrid could use a combination of local solar and battery storage to keep key facilities online even while cut off from the main grid.
The pair of bills in Oregon passed with large, bipartisan majorities and are awaiting the expected signature of Democratic Gov. Tina Kotek.
AI data centers are using more power. Regular customers are footing the bill.

One of the bills orders the Oregon Public Utility Commission to create a regulatory framework for private and community-owned microgrids. It also orders regulators to establish rules for buildings to connect to microgrids. Under the measure, local governments can establish “microgrid zones” with unique land-use regulations.
Oregon state Rep. Mark Gamba, a Democrat who serves as vice chair on the House Climate, Energy, and Environment Committee, said the state needs further changes to its land use to speed up permitting for energy projects. The microgrid legislation, he said, “cuts a little bit of red tape.”
“This is not the end-all, be-all on fixing the permitting system by any stretch, but this was what we could get passed this year,” Gamba said in an interview.
The other bill would allow a public utility or a third-party consultant to evaluate requests to connect a microgrid to the public power grid. Backers say it would help ease a regulatory bottleneck slowing clean energy projects, trade publication Utility Dive reported.
Rural communities are especially susceptible to power reliability issues, Dylan Kruse, president of Oregon-based nonprofit Sustainable Northwest, told Utility Dive.
Some utilities opposed the legislation, Oregon Public Broadcasting reported, saying it could be risky to allow third parties to connect to utility infrastructure. They cited their own work to establish microgrids with public partners.
Kruse told OPB that wildfires, heat waves and snowstorms are creating urgency to make the grid more resilient.
“We’re seeing challenges with the grid,” he said. “It’s impacting communities and we’re seeing a lot more of these outages and they are looking for alternatives to say, ‘Look, if the lights are going to go off, we’ve got to have some options here’.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-07-21 11:30:00+00:00,CT Mirror,What to know about two new COVID variants spreading in CT,Jenna Carlesso,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/21/ct-covid-variants-stratus-nimbus/,Two new COVID-19 variants are spreading across the country and doctors in Connecticut are expecting they could bring an uptick in cases.,"Two new COVID-19 variants are spreading through the U.S., and medical providers in Connecticut are expecting an uptick in cases in the coming weeks.
NB.1.8.1, also known as Nimbus, has become the dominant variant throughout the country and health officials say that while sequencing efforts have declined, it appears to be a driver of new cases in Connecticut.
Another variant, XFG, or Stratus, was recently labeled a “variant under monitoring” by the World Health Organization and was cited as the third most common in the U.S. in late June, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Nowcast estimates. The LP.8.1 variant, prevalent during the winter, remained the second most common.
Some Connecticut hospital physicians have reported seeing more COVID patients in recent weeks.
“We have seen an increase in COVID patients. They’re being treated with the appropriate medications,” said Dr. Husnain Kermalli, chief medical officer at Saint Mary’s Hospital in Waterbury. “Their hospitalizations, thankfully, have not been very complicated. We’ve been managing them effectively and getting them back out into the community.”
COVID cases have been on the rise in parts of the South and along portions of the West Coast, as well as in some midwestern and northeastern states. Connecticut has not yet seen a summer swell of infections, but health officials say cases could increase in the coming weeks.
“We have seen summer waves just about every year, so I don’t think it would be unexpected for us to see COVID cases start to increase,” said Dr. Lynn Sosa, director of infectious diseases at the state Department of Public Health.
Here’s what to know about the new variants.
Newest variants appear to be more transmissible.
Nimbus was first detected in the U.S. in early spring, and Stratus began picking up steam not long after.
Both appear to be more transmissible than previous variants, but there is no evidence to suggest they are more severe, health officials said.
“As the virus evolves, the main thing is the latest version of it can transmit easier,” Sosa said. “What’s going to make it more able to survive, to keep going, is the fact that it’s more easily spread. If not, it can’t compete with other strains.”
“If any variant is more easily spread than the previous one, eventually Stratus will probably take over.”
Dr. Ulysses Wu, chief epidemiologist and system director for infectious diseases at Hartford HealthCare, said the newest variants are not more severe than previous versions.
“It’s about the same,” he said, adding: “Your risk for long COVID is still going to be the same.”
Sore throat and hoarseness are reported as key symptoms.
Nimbus has garnered the nickname “razor blade throat” in national news reports after several people noted severe sore throat as a key symptom of the variant.
And some medical providers say hoarseness appears to be a pronounced symptom with Stratus.
“The symptoms are — what have been described amongst the social media gathering — a razor blade sensation, a pretty severe sore throat, along with some gastrointestinal symptoms of nausea, maybe some vomiting. Those are probably telltale signs of having this type of variant in your system,” Kermalli said of Nimbus.
But most symptoms of the two newest variants are generally consistent with previous strains, health officials said.
“They’re not much different,” Wu said. “For Nimbus, they’re giving the name ‘razor blade throat,’ but sore throat has always happened with COVID. And then for Stratus, the symptom is a scratchy voice, or what I like to call … ‘smoker’s voice,’ that’s probably a little bit new, but it doesn’t really mean anything different.”
Cough, fever, shortness of breath, fatigue, headaches and body aches remain common symptoms of COVID.
Doctors urge people to stay home if sick.
Medical providers recommend staying home when feeling ill. At-home testing kits are available.
The COVID vaccines are expected to remain effective against symptomatic and severe disease with Stratus and Nimbus, according to the World Health Organization. Health officials suggested staying up to date on vaccination.
“For the public, I would say, take your same precautions,” Wu said. “Your protection is still the same. You should still get vaccinated. You should still wear a mask. … If you have a high suspicion [of illness], you should do several tests, and at the very least, you should be masking to prevent transmission.”
“If you’re sick, you should stay home, because these are really transmissible variants. That’s the best way to keep other people healthy,” Sosa added. “We want people to cover their cough if they have to go out. We want people to wash their hands. All the things that we would normally do, those are the same things we should keep doing with these variants.”
Recovery time and treatment are the same.
Recovery from COVID varies from person to person, but recovery times with the newest variants are generally the same as with prior versions, health officials said.
“Let’s say day zero is symptom onset. Probably by days seven to 10, they’re going to start to feel better,” Kermalli said. “For some people, it’s going to be on the inside of day four, day five; for others, it might last all the way up to day 15. If symptoms have lasted longer, it’s probably going to take you a little bit longer to get back up to full speed again.”
The treatments are also similar.
“For people who get sick, especially if they’re older or if they have underlying medical conditions, they should talk to their doctor about treatment,” Sosa said. “Treatments are still available for COVID, specifically Paxlovid.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023_1005_SR_CovidVaccine_004-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-07-21 07:56:43.042568

She hoped to spotlight her great-grandfather, Arthur Mapes — a poet known for writing Indiana state poems and designated as the state’s “poet laureate.”

But her teacher advised against it. Without official sources to support his significance, and relying on family accounts, the project wouldn’t meet the assignments criteria. So instead, she chose another famous Indiana poet, James Whitcomb Riley. 
A few years down the road, Mapes Turner began the application process to secure a historical marker honoring her grandfather. She didn’t expect the journey to become so meaningful, she said. After family members combed through archives and compiled research, they submitted an application to the Indiana Historical Marker Program. 
Now, future students researching notable Hoosiers will have an official source to cite. 
Arthur Mapes will soon be recognized with a state historical marker, featuring the familiar blue enamel background and raised gold lettering. It’ll be nestled in the trails of Bixler Lake Park in Kendallville, a place where he grew up and wandered the woods, drawing inspiration for his poetry. 
“The Indiana Historical Bureau, acknowledging that it does have statewide impact, was meaningful to me and to our family,” Mapes Turner said. “Just to know that it’s literally going to be cast in iron for future generations to see the permanence of it is really special to us.”
Mapes’ marker is close to production, though the program is in transition. In June, Indiana agencies laid off dozens of state employees in response to recently enacted budget cuts. Some of the deepest cuts appeared at the Indiana Historical Bureau, a division of the Indiana State Library.
Five of the bureau’s six employees were let go without advance notice — leaving one person to run the office and manage the markers.
“Historical markers provide snapshots and tangible reminders of our state and nation’s past,” Director Casey Pfeiffer said. “… Even with over 750 markers, we have just barely scratched the surface of the stories that could be shared.”
 The marker program

The Indiana State Historical Marker Program began in 1946, with the first marker placed in December of that year highlighting the Indiana State Capitol. 
David Steele, managing principal of the Steele Group, has successfully placed five historical markers in the near south side of Indianapolis. He calls the state’s historical marker program the “best-kept secret in the state government.”
Out of Steele’s five markers, he said he is particularly proud of a marker honoring Leedy Manufacturing, a factory known for creating Purdue University’s “World’s Largest Drum,” and the vibraphone. 
  Purdue Bass Drum – Leedy Manufacturing Company – Bass Photo Collection Indianapolis – Indiana Historical Society 1921 (David Steele/Courtesy)
“That’s one of the coolest stories of a manufacturing company in the city,” Steele said. 
He also placed markers honoring German immigrant communities including early drugstore founder, John Hook. Growing up in Fountain Square, Steele said he rarely saw historical markers in his neighborhood. But when traveling to areas like Meridian Hills or the old north side of Indianapolis, there were always historical markers. 
So years later down the road, Steele became interested in highlighting the neighborhood he grew up in, and the key Indiana historical aspects of the near South Side that no one knew about. 
Since historical markers are not amenable to revision, marker texts are thoroughly documented with primary source material. Steele said what attracted him to the marker program the most was the research that goes into each marker. 
A friend told Steele to do a marker on Meredith Nicholson, an author known for writing the book “The House a Thousand Candles.” He said if you go to his home, there is a small local marker saying that he lived there. 
When Steele dove into city records of when he was supposed to live there, he could not find Nicholson listed anywhere. Indiana architecture experts helped him find that Nicholson was a poor writer who married into money — the house was bought by his wife and listed in her maiden name. They even tracked it down to where she transferred the deed to her husband. 
“Those are things that make this marker program so legitimate,” Steele said. 
Legacy in metal
Each of the markers is crafted by Sewah Studios, a century-old company based in Marietta, Ohio. Company President Bradford Smith said Indiana is one of the leading marker programs and is one of the oldest Sewah Studios state partnerships out of the 44 states that they work with. 
“We’ve been honored to feature them as one of our top programs across the country. They are definitely important to us,” he said. 
Smith said they create every marker by hand with a 100-year-old process. He said typically it takes about three weeks to produce the marker and ship it to Indiana. 
Smith compared production to minting a coin. He said it goes through five phases, starting with typesetting, moving to a cast aluminum foundry to make marker impressions, then to a finishing department, followed by a powder-coating process. Last is decorating the letters with gold lettering and adding the iconic aluminum rail. The marker is finished with a protective clear coat to give it a wet-looking professional finish. 
“When you see that blue marker with the original rails, Indiana outline, it’s just an iconic feature for all Indianans’ to be proud of,” Smith said.

Each of the markers costs $3,300 to produce and install — typically paid for through private funding. Mapes’ marker, for instance, was fully funded by his former employer, Flint & Walling Inc., with the Kendallville Parks Department volunteering to install it. 
Choosing the marker’s location wasn’t easy, Mapes Turner said. The family ultimately selected Bixler Lake Park, where Mapes spent his childhood walking trails and hunting small game to feed his family during the Great Depression. A bench nearby already honors him and his wife. 
“I think my grandfather wouldn’t believe this,” she said. “He was a humble man who worked in a factory, but loved the beauty of words. For the state to honor that now — decades after his poem — it’s incredibly special.” 
 Uncovering forgotten histories

Pfeiffer said markers run the gamut from state history, arts, sports and agriculture to science, medicine, business and military history. 
Interest in the marker program has grown in recent years, with an increase starting in 2016 due to the state’s bicentennial and a renewed interest in preserving the state’s history, she said.
Over the past four years, Pfeiffer said the program has received more than 30 applications annually and has approved 16-19 markers each of those years. So far in 2025, the bureau has helped dedicate seven markers.
Some markers elevate untold stories — especially those omitted from textbooks. 
Eunice Trotter, Black heritage preservation program director for Indiana Landmarks and Historic Preservation, has helped erect 15 markers around the state in three years. One honoring Mary Bateman Clark, a formerly enslaved woman whose 1821 court case helped end indentured servants in Indiana, is posted outside of the Knox County Courthouse. 
Trotter said the marker is one of the few markers memorializing Black heritage in the community. With her own research, she was able to preserve contributions and the presence of Black Americans in pre-statehood Indiana. 
“That case was found in 1821, so nobody would have known that it’s a case that should have been included in Indiana state history classes,” she said. “It still isn’t really included to the state, so it’s the only reminder of that history we have.”

Trotter said her organization typically hires researchers to dive deep into the history that’s required for a marker — like a case from the 1920s when Black children in Lyles Station in Gibson County, were subjected to harmful radiation experiments to treat ringworm.

Many of those children suffered lifelong damage. Trotter is now pushing for a marker to honor them, especially after a lawsuit was filed and dismissed, and the children were left with no compensation.  
A 2009 movie titled “Hole in the Head: A Life Revealed” tells the story of a child that was affected. 
“It’s the kind of work that we’re doing seeks to uncover, document and preserve or restore Black History heritage sites,” Trotter said. “This is history and sites that are little-known, but they are there, just waiting to be uncovered. And there’s just so much history that we don’t know so fast. You know, it just gets overwhelming thinking about it,” Trotter said.
“Markers are the way to give a snippet of important history that might otherwise not be known,” she added.
And sometimes they include history that isn’t pleasant.
Trotter mentioned a marker that tells the story of John Tucker’s lynching in Indianapolis. It was placed in 2023.
Another marker notes the history of Indiana’s 1907 eugenics law, which authorized a forced sterilization program “to prevent procreation of confirmed criminals, idiots, imbeciles and rapists” in state institutions. It was placed in 2017.
Meanwhile, some markers have been vandalized, stolen or run over — like the Calvin Fletcher marker in Indianapolis, which was replaced after three years of fundraising, only to be run down again. Fletcher opposed slavery and promoted organization of U.S. colored troops in Indiana in Civil War, according to his marker.

Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images.Congress set aside $50 billion for rural hospitals and medical providers to allay fears over the billions more in historic cuts to federal health care spending that President Donald Trump signed into law on Independence Day.
But is that bandage big enough to save struggling rural hospitals?
“I have more questions than I have answers,” said Alan Morgan, CEO of the National Rural Health Association, a nonprofit policy group. “No one has those answers yet.”
Morgan noted that the new money for rural health, to be spent over five years, is far less than the $155 billion in rural Medicaid spending cuts over 10 years, as estimated by KFF, a nonprofit health policy and research group.
Experts, hospital leaders and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle fear that Trump’s signature legislation will particularly gut rural hospitals and clinics, which see an outsize share of patients who are insured through Medicaid, the federal-state public health insurance for people with low incomes. The new law slashes more than $1 trillion from Medicaid over the next 10 years to help pay for tax cuts that disproportionately benefit the wealthy.

The $50 billion addition was an effort by Republican leaders in Congress to win the votes of colleagues within their party who initially balked at supporting such steep cuts to Medicaid and other health services.
In the U.S. Senate, the rural program helped secure the vote of Alaska moderate Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who expressed concern about the law’s impact on health care in her state. About 1 in 3 Alaskans are insured through Medicaid.
Jared Kosin, the president and CEO of the Alaska Hospital & Healthcare Association, said he’s deeply frustrated with the new law’s gutting of Medicaid funding, which he thinks will wreak lasting damage on Alaskans. And Republicans sidestepped potential solutions by just throwing money into a program, he said.
“It’s frustrating in the public realm when decisions like this are made fast and, frankly, carelessly,” he said.
“The consequences are going to fall on us, not them.”
More than half of the law’s cuts to funding in rural areas are concentrated in 12 states with large rural populations that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act to cover more people, according to KFF: Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania and Virginia.
Some GOP lawmakers in Congress have heralded the $50 billion rural program as a health care victory. But it’s still unclear which hospitals, clinics and other providers would receive money and how much.
How it works
The Rural Health Transformation Program will dole out $10 billion annually from fiscal years 2026 through 2030.
States must apply for their funding by the end of this year, submitting a detailed plan on how it would be used.
The law outlines some ways that states can use the money, according to an analysis of the legislation from the Bipartisan Policy Center:

Making payments to rural hospitals to help them maintain essential services such as emergency room care or labor and delivery.
Recruiting and training rural doctors, nurses and other health workers.
Bolstering emergency medical services such as ambulances and EMTs.
Using new technologies, including telehealth.
Providing opioid use disorder treatment and mental health services.
Improving preventive care and chronic disease management.

Half of the $10 billion each year will be distributed evenly across states that have applied for it. The other half can be distributed by the administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services — currently Dr. Mehmet Oz — at his discretion, based on a state’s rural population and rural health facilities.
Although the program doesn’t replace the amount states are likely to lose, Morgan said it’s still an opportunity to rethink how rural health care is funded. He’d like to see states given flexibility in how they’re able to use the funds, and he hopes they focus on keeping rural communities healthy through preventive care while still helping hospitals keep their doors open.
“If done correctly, it could really change the future course for rural America,” Morgan said. “That is such a tough ask, though.”
Hardest hit
Kentucky could take the biggest hit from the new law’s reduction in rural Medicaid funding, losing an estimated $12 billion over 10 years, according to a KFF analysis.

The state’s Medicaid department is still waiting for additional federal guidance to understand how the state’s program will be affected, Kendra Steele, spokesperson with the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services, told Stateline in a statement.
“Over 1.4 million Kentuckians rely on Medicaid — including half of all children in our state, seniors and more vulnerable populations — and the passage of legislation on the federal level will have serious impacts for those individuals, rural health care and hospitals and local economies,” she wrote.
Even with the new program, states across the country will have to reevaluate their budgets in light of the cuts, said Hemi Tewarson, executive director at the National Academy for State Health Policy, a nonpartisan group that supports states in developing health care policies.
“Every region is slightly different and there’s not a one-size-fits-all approach,” she said. “Hospital ownership varies [as well as] the types of services that are critical for the community where they’re located. They have to think about new ways to provide those services in a context with fewer resources.”
About 44% of rural hospitals are operating in the red, according to a KFF analysis of Rand Hospital Data, a higher share than the 35% of hospitals in urban areas.
‘Rural at heart’ 
Prior to the bill’s passage, Oz attempted to reassure U.S. House Republicans that their districts could get money from the program even if they weren’t specifically rural, Politico reported earlier this month.



We’re all rural at heart when it comes to money.


– Alan Morgan, CEO of the National Rural Health Association



Pennsylvania Republican U.S. Rep. Rob Bresnahan said money would begin flowing to his district as early as the beginning of next year, telling the Wilkes-Barre Times Leader earlier this month that he met with Trump, Oz and others to secure pledges that hospitals in his district could access the fund. He represents the northeastern corner of Pennsylvania, which includes suburban and rural areas, as well as the cities of Scranton and Wilkes-Barre.
Though the legislation includes guidelines on which facilities or areas qualify as “rural,” Morgan, of the National Rural Health Association, expects a mad dash from lawmakers and providers to claim rural status in order to get a piece of the funding.
“That’s going to be a huge issue — defining who’s rural,” Morgan said. “We’re all rural at heart when it comes to money.”

There was a precious time last summer when a Guatemalan immigrant finally felt at home in Missouri. 
He, his wife and their young son were in a festive group of random people who’d gone to a mid-Missouri river to relax and float downstream in a throng of canoes and kayaks.
“It was beautiful,” he told The Marshall Project – St. Louis in Spanish. “We had been all over and we felt welcome.”
Now, they are afraid to enjoy those moments. Apart from going to work and running necessary errands, the family is hunkered down, hiding for their lives. 
Six months into President Donald Trump’s second term, a historic crackdown on undocumented residents intensifies. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and a growing pack of agencies have helped transport, detain and deport thousands of people from all corners of the country, while pushing others deeper underground. Immigration attorneys in St. Louis say people are being detained without notice. The local ICE office lobby is often packed. The Guatemalan family has a relative who was recently deported.
The Trump administration has increased travel bans, detention space and daily arrest goals. High profile elected officials have been wrestled to the floor and handcuffed while trying to intervene and demand due process. Meanwhile, millions of noncitizens remain in the shadows, wanting to be left alone to earn a better living for their families. 
The Marshall Project – St. Louis is withholding the undocumented family’s names because they fear being detained by immigration authorities.
“We haven’t left to go anywhere,” the father said from inside a bare-bones rental home along a busy street in the St. Louis area. “We can’t because of fear. For us, as Latinos, somebody might ask us for documents, call the police or something else.”
 The Triumph

He described their home of El Triunfo, Guatemala, as a threatening and corrupt rivertown on the border of southern Mexico controlled by organized crime.
That’s why he fled to Mexico in 2018, first to Cancún, then to Mexico City, and Nuevo Laredo, right across the Rio Grande from Laredo, Texas.
In Nuevo Laredo, he said extortionists threatened to kill him and a family friend who was hosting him there if he didn’t pay $4,000 and help serve as a lookout for the group. He did that for a few months before paying $10,000 for a guided crossing into the United States. 
He made it to Houston and paid another $1,500 for the final leg to St. Ann, Missouri, a St. Louis suburb where he initially lived. He arrived in February 2019 with a heavy heart. 
“I had come here to support my family and get ahead,” he said. “I was also leaving them behind.” 
St. Ann doesn’t seem like the place to find solace. A community of small, post-World War II houses and a lot of parkland, it became known for an aggressive police department that held and turned people over to immigration authorities. 
Aaron Jimenez, the city’s elected chief of police, said the reputation is a holdover from a prior administration and era.
“We aren’t looking to deport people,” said Jimenez, who said he is serving his last term as chief. “We have so many other problems in our area, like homelessness and overdoses.”
Once he arrived, the Guatemalan man started working odd jobs to begin paying for his wife and son to join him.
His wife made the voyage to Missouri in 2023, about four years after he did. It cost them $16,000. A year after that, their son made the guided crossing without them for $8,000.
“It’s better to have him suffer a couple days than to have him stay in my hometown,” he said.
Finally united, they had that fun day on a mid-Missouri river. They also drove to Chicago last summer to pursue documents at the Guatemalan consulate. While there, they toured The Bean at Millennium Park and had a taste of home at a Guatemalan fast-food restaurant. 
They enrolled their son, now 11, in school, where he easily made friends. The wife would linger at drop-off to chat with parents.
The good vibe didn’t last. 
These days, the mom won’t linger at school pick-up or drop-off. Their once outgoing son can’t hang out at the neighborhood park or pool this summer. The father is scared that neighbors would report them to the police, so they mostly stay inside. 
Recently, the father said he was pulled over while passing through Clayton, the prominent seat of St. Louis County government, with his latest boss in the vehicle. 
He said he doesn’t have a driver’s license, but he pays for insurance. 
The police let him go. Many others haven’t been so lucky.
Their bodies are also still recovering since they left Guatemala. He injured his back falling from the second story of a home while working as a roofer; she was hurt in a crash on her way to Missouri.
 Immigration enforcement

Jessica Mayo, an attorney and codirector of the Migrant and Immigrant Community Action Project in St. Louis, said that people are being detained without notice, sometimes through deceptive means that can lead to deportation. Some are separated from their children without plans in place to care for them.
“Many immigrants in this country right now are living in a constant crisis mode of fear and anxiety,” Mayo said at a rally in June.
She said the immigration system isn’t designed to help people.
“The fact that it can be used to destroy communities and families is not an accident,” she told the crowd. “This has been going on since long before Trump, but Trump is certainly doing everything he can to ramp it up.”
Jimenez, the St. Ann police chief, said in an interview that there needs to be a quicker path to citizenship and authorized worker programs.
“Let’s get these people who are really good people vetted,” he said. “That’s easier than, ‘Let’s get rid of everybody.’”  
While he said his department isn’t prioritizing deportations, they have referred some people to immigration authorities in recent months, including a Peruvian man who allegedly assaulted a young woman. For his part, the chief said he doesn’t seek to refer people accused of nonviolent offenses.
“I do leave it to the officer’s discretion,” he said. “If we didn’t want that, then we might as well have robots as police.” 
 Easy decision

The so-called Northern Triangle countries of Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras have seen mass migration driven by poverty and high crime, with more expected in the coming years, according to the Congressional Research Service.
About half the population of Guatemala is under the age of 25, according to the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency data from 2024. Returning there isn’t a viable option for the man from El Triunfo and his family. 
The Guatemalan man said his brother, a street vender, was kidnapped in late May after crossing the border into southern Mexico to buy supplies for work. Family members checked hospitals and put up signs asking for the public’s help locating him. 
He shared a recording with The Marshal Project – St. Louis of a telephone conversation with a man who claimed to have information about his brother and demanded a $4,000 ransom for it. He said his extended family had paid the equivalent of about $500 to other opportunists. His brother hadn’t surfaced, and threats remained against another.
“We hope that he returns, and that if he’s dead they return the body,” he said, a tear trickling through the whiskers of his unshaven face.
He said he’d quickly try to return to Missouri if he were detained and deported. His back is sore and the trip is costly, but there’s less risk and more opportunity to work in St. Louis than in the Guatemalan rivertown his small family fled. 
They’d also like to have more children. 
“Not right now because of what’s going on,” he said. “I don’t want something to happen to me and she is left alone, a pregnant woman trying to get a job.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/living-in-fear-collage-140_final2-1024x536.jpg,,,2025-07-21 07:56:43.042568

If you wake up every morning worrying you’ve landed in hell, you pretty much have. 
It’s hotter than Satan’s house cat.  
Venture outside and it feels like you’re walking through a sauna wearing a suit made of polar bear fur while carrying a five-gallon pot of live coals. 
Like so much in Florida, summer gets worse every year.
The heat is immoral; unconscionable; unendurable.
It should be illegal. 
Surely Florida’s governor could figure out how to outlaw this heat.
He solved that pesky climate change business by simply erasing any mention of it in state statutes. 
 Maybe he could proclaim 100 degrees is really only 80, 80 is 50, and 50 is below freezing.  
Kind of like what they call “vanity sizing:” A size 14 dress is now labeled a 10. 
Or maybe we could use Celsius: 37 degrees sounds a lot better than 100.
See? You feel cooler already, don’t you?  
Or not.
Those of us living in the reality-based culture know you cannot beat the Florida heat. 
The best you can hope for is to reach some kind of accommodation with it, appease it the way the ancients would sacrifice a goat or a chicken to butter up a surly god given to smiting people for fun, or figure out ways to avoid the worst of it.
To Do List
I’m a native Floridian; I have suggestions:

 Find a swimming pool. Lie in the water. Do not get out unless you are joined by an alligator — which happens quite often — and then extricate yourself slowly. No sudden movements. (Gators do not follow homeowners’ association rules.)
If reptiles run you out of the pool, try a bathtub. Yes, your skin will become quite wrinkly, but it’s better than heat rash. 
Go shopping. You’re risking heatstroke getting from the parking lot to the door, but once you get inside your favorite big box store, the air-conditioning will be delightfully frosty.

You can spend hours and hours in Walmart, looking at “school clothes” even if you don’t go to school. Florida’s Back to School sales tax holiday runs throughout August. Unfortunately, the guns and ammo sales tax holiday doesn’t begin until Sept. 8. But it’ll still be hot enough to scald a scorpion and still be hurricane season. 
You can get yourself a bargain firearm suitable for firing into the storm! 

 Bribe a grocery store or restaurant to let you sit in their walk-in freezer. Make sure you’ve got a cell signal in there: We don’t want any tragedies.
 Speaking of ice, here’s something you can do using your home freezer. Stick a pair of jeans and a t-shirt in there, wait three hours, then put them on.

They’ll be stiff for 20 minutes or so, but you’ll enjoy the personal air-conditioning.   

 Leave. Go to Greenland. 

Forget Canada (they’re certainly trying to forget us). Greenland will be the 51st state. The only reason it hasn’t happened already is that Donald Trump has been too busy blowing up the National Weather Service, NASA, and NOAA. 
But you don’t want to wait till half of Florida flees our polluted aquifers, flooded suburbs, hurricane-ravaged condos and malarial sinks. 
Get ahead of the crowd and scope out Nuuk’s best spots for Musk Ox steak and Eric the Red beer.
You’ll never run out of ice in Greenland. 
Not for five or six years, at least. 
Rising tide
This dang Chinese hoax is warming up everything from the Antarctic to the Indian Ocean to the Pacific to the north Atlantic. 
Greenland’s ice sheet is melting, faster and faster every year. So are the glaciers and the icebergs. 
How do I know this? Because some of NASA’s global climate change research websites are still up (see link above), but who knows for how long. 
Now where do you think that all that water from the ice sheets will go?
If you answered “everywhere,” you’re correct.
  Sea-level rise is evident in this photo of a flooded palm tree taken on the Florida Panhandle’s St. Vincent Island. (Photo by Susan Cerulean)
If you said, “Especially Florida,” you get bonus points. 
One of the annoying little quirks of vast quantities of melting ice is rising sea levels. 
We live in the southernmost state, the most watery state, the one that floods if you stare at it hard. 
A lot of us live just a few feet above sea level. 
Since 1970, the sea level has risen seven inches, which might not sound too bad, except even a Category 1 hurricane — Debby in 2024, say — can produce a storm surge of 2-5 feet.
With a whopper like Helene, it’s more like 15 feet. 
You see the problem.  
Seas aren’t only rising, they’re getting hotter. Hotter seas breed bigger storms.
Over the past few weeks, the temperature of the Gulf of Mexico (no, I’m not calling it by that fake Trump name) has ranged from 80 to 92 degrees. 
The warmer the water, the faster it evaporates, the faster it evaporates, the heavier the rainfall.  
Add to that temperatures in the high 90s and you get a heat-plus-humidity situation which almost certainly violates the Geneva Conventions on torture.
Compared to the poor souls along the Guadalupe River in Texas, we’ve been lucky.  
Our luck is unlikely to hold. Every part of Florida is susceptible to flash floods. 
 Deflection, denial
This is, of course, a global problem. 
China is now the worst greenhouse gas offender, but the U.S. is right behind and, given how the regime hates being Number Two, I’m sure we will soon regain the title of Biggest Threat to Human Life on Earth.
New research by the nonprofit Climate and Community Institute shows the 17% increase in the Pentagon’s budget translates into an enormous increase in carbon emissions: 178 tons in 2026.
That’s half of what the entire United Kingdom emits. 
We’re not stopping there, either. Trump is enabling extractive industries to pillage the land from sea to shining sea, making swingeing cuts to wind and solar energy programs, and ordering an ancient, costly, and dirty Michigan coal plant to stay open.  
What, you ask, is Florida doing about this?
(Can you hear me laughing bitterly?)
To be fair, the governor did sign a ban on drilling along the Apalachicola River. 
But when it comes to the climate crisis, he deflects and denies.
In addition to trying to deep-six the whole issue by refusing to name it and calling attempts to address the causes of the precipitous rise in temperatures “left-wing stuff,” he wants you to believe monster storms have always happened in Florida and always will. 
It’s just “tropical weather.” 
And despite what Marjorie Taylor Greene, Georgia U.S. representative and weekend scientist, says, weather is not controlled by the government.
But just to be sure, she says she’ll sponsor legislation prohibiting “the injection, release or dispersion of chemicals or substances into the atmosphere for the express purpose of altering weather, temperature, climate or sunlight intensity.”

Ahead of the curve
Florida, always ahead of the crazy curve, has already passed such a bill, and the governor has signed it. 
He cites dark fears of “chemtrails” deployed by shadowy green activists trying to fight climate change by “injecting different things in the atmosphere, blocking the sun and doing all this stuff.”
He added, “We’re the Sunshine State. We want to have the nice sunshine.”
First of all, “chemtrails” are not a thing. Those white lines swooshing behind aircraft are condensation trails, i.e. little bitty ice crystals formed when the exhaust from the plane hits the cold high-altitude air.
Second, while there’s some preliminary research on using geoengineering to reflect sunshine back into space, we don’t know how this might affect rainfall or food production and many scientists don’t think it’s feasible or desirable.
Moreover, why spend billions fooling with the sun when we could develop sustainable power, stop burning fossil fuels, encourage clean energy, and hold polluters accountable for destroying the environment. 
Despite most Floridians figuring they can ride this thing out in their air-conditioned caves, the reckoning will soon come.
The hotter it gets, the more air-conditioning we’ll use; the more we crank up the AC, the hotter it gets.
No matter what nonsense the MAGA brain trust comes up with, data are still data.
Storms are stronger. The seas are invading. The heat is becoming increasingly deadly: Florida leads the nation in heat-related illnesses. 
Science doesn’t care what Marjorie Taylor Greene, Donald Trump, or Ron DeSantis believe.
As I said, you can’t beat the heat. But the heat can — and will — beat you.

A provision in the tax and spending bill President Donald Trump signed into law July 4 will require the 40 states plus Washington, D.C., that have expanded Medicaid to check paperwork at least twice a year to ensure those enrollees are volunteering or working at least 80 hours a month or attending school at least half time.
The new law provides states $200 million for fiscal year 2026 to get their systems up and running. But some experts say states will have difficulty meeting the deadline with that funding and worry enrollees might lose their health benefits as a result.
A year and a half to comply is likely not going to be enough time for most states, especially since the federal government must craft guidance on how they should implement their programs, said Dr. Benjamin Sommers, a health economist at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. He predicted it will be difficult to create technology simple enough — such as a phone app — to streamline the process for all enrollees.
“Two hundred million [dollars] is not going to cover the 40 expansion states that we have,” he told Stateline. “There is not a silver bullet here, and there isn’t a single app out there that’s going to keep people who should be in Medicaid from losing coverage. That’s just not realistic.”

A spokesperson for the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services, Hannah Jones, told Stateline that “it will take a significant amount of time and investment in order to implement work requirements.”
Jones said an estimated 255,000 people in North Carolina could lose coverage because of these requirements and their “administrative burden.”
“More automation reduces manual work on beneficiaries and eligibility case workers, but it requires more time, funding, and staff resources to implement,” Jones wrote in an email.
Emma Herrock, a spokesperson for the Louisiana Department of Health, wrote in an email that the vast majority of the state’s Medicaid enrollees already work, and the agency expects few people to be disenrolled. Herrock said the department will establish work verification systems by the end of 2026.
“The department is taking a thoughtful approach to implementation,” Herrock wrote. “We are already working with several Louisiana agencies … in order to receive data on recipients who are working.”
She added that the department views work requirements “as a means to grow our economy, while reinforcing the value of work and self-sufficiency.”
In New York, it could cost the state $500 million to administer the new requirements, New York Department of Health spokesperson Danielle De Souza wrote in an email.
Between 600,000 and 1.1 million individuals who are eligible for and enrolled in Medicaid could potentially lose coverage because of work reporting requirements, she wrote, based on what happened when states were required to resume checking eligibility after the COVID-19 health emergency ended.
“The department will remain steadfast in its commitment to protecting the health of all New Yorkers and will work to mitigate the impacts of this law,” De Souza wrote.
The new rules apply to states that expanded Medicaid to adults between the ages of 19 and 64 with incomes below 138% of the federal poverty line (about $22,000 for an individual), an option that was made available under the 2010 Affordable Care Act. More than 20 million people were enrolled through Medicaid expansion as of June 2024 — those are the patients who will face work requirements.


There isn’t a single app out there that’s going to keep people who should be in Medicaid from losing coverage. That’s just not realistic.


– Dr. Benjamin Sommers, health economist at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health


Reapplying for Medicaid, which typically has been required once a year, already is burdensome for some patients, said Dr. Bobby Mukkamala, president of the American Medical Association.
“On top of that, now we’re going to be challenging so many people who were at least able to deal with it financially with things like … proving that they got a job,” Mukkamala said in an interview.
Previous attempts at implementing work requirements have ended up costing states millions in administrative and consulting fees. And in some cases, people who were eligible for Medicaid lost their coverage due to paperwork issues.
Arkansas’ example
Several states wanted to implement work requirements during the first Trump administration. But only Arkansas fully did so, in 2018, before a federal judge halted the requirements. More than 18,000 Arkansas residents lost Medicaid coverage during the 10 months the requirements were in effect.

Sommers, of Harvard, noted that most people were disenrolled because they didn’t know about the policy or made paperwork errors, not because they weren’t working.
“Red tape led to people losing their coverage,” he said. “They had more trouble affording their medications. They were putting off needed care.”
Brian Blase, president of the Paragon Health Institute, a conservative policy group that advises congressional Republicans, said he thinks concerns about the new requirements are overblown because there’s more advanced technology now.
“Lots of government programs have initial implementation challenges,” Blase told Stateline. “Arkansas was seven years ago, and if you just think about the change in the technological advancements over the past seven years … we didn’t have artificial intelligence and just the ability of modern tech.”
As it stands, each state has varying technological capabilities, and will have a different timeline and budget, said Michael Heifetz, a managing director at consulting firm Alvarez & Marsal and a former Medicaid director in Wisconsin. His team contracts with states to implement Medicaid, including work requirements, and other programs.
He also noted that the Trump administration can give states a deadline extension on implementing work requirements to Dec. 31, 2028, if they show they are making a “good faith effort.” States will need to share data across agencies in new ways, he said.
“It will require some form of data sharing and communications with educational agencies, workforce training agencies and some other agencies that typically aren’t in the Medicaid ecosystem,” Heifetz said.
State governments may resist hiring full-time positions for those tasks, he said, but “artificial intelligence and other tools can help work through these processes in a smoother fashion.”
Other state efforts
Efforts in other states to implement work requirements have had mixed results.
In Georgia, for example, an experimental work requirement program cost taxpayers more than $86 million in its first 18 months but enrolled just 6,500 people during that time, according to an investigation by ProPublica and The Current published in February. That’s 75% fewer participants than the state had estimated for the program’s first year.

The nonpartisan U.S. Government Accountability Office in 2019 looked at five states that tested systems to track Medicaid work requirements under the first Trump administration. Those demonstration projects were rescinded during the Biden administration.
The states estimated their projected administrative costs for implementing work requirements for one to three years, and the total far surpassed the $200 million Congress has provided in the new law. Kentucky alone estimated $270 million, Wisconsin $70 million, Indiana $35 million, Arkansas $26 million and New Hampshire $6 million.
Susan Barnidge, an assistant director on the GAO health care team and an author of the report, said the agency found that across states there wasn’t much federal oversight of administrative costs on test programs. Oversight will be key as states roll out their work requirement systems, she said.
“We found some weaknesses in [federal] Centers for Medicare & Medicaid oversight of certain federal funding for certain administrative activities. So we found examples of things that states sought federal funding for that didn’t appear to be allowable,” Barnidge said in an interview. “I think that will remain relevant.”
Mukkamala, of the American Medical Association, said the burden will in some ways fall to doctors’ offices to help keep patients enrolled, as they work with patients to check eligibility and possibly help get them on Medicaid. He works in Flint, Michigan, as an otolaryngologist, or ear, nose and throat doctor, and said a third of his patients are on Medicaid.
“As if it’s easy to take care of their health care issue, given things like prior authorization,” Mukkamala told Stateline. “Now to add to the challenge, we have to figure out how to get them covered.”

As President Donald Trump seeks to weaken or eliminate the federal consumer watchdog agency, some states are considering how they can beef up their own protections against unfair business practices. (Bryce Spivey/Consumer Financial Protection Bureau via Flickr)With basic costs continuing to outpace Hoosiers’ take-home pay, now is the time for Indiana policymakers to protect consumers and put a stop to the ‘scamification’ of Hoosiers.
The worrying trend is clear: Homeownership is declining in Indiana, especially among Black Hoosiers and low-income families, making inter-generational wealth-building harder than ever. Indiana now has the lowest renter household income in the Midwest and one of the highest rates of severe cost burden for vulnerable renters. And more than 4 in 10 Hoosiers have reported difficulty paying for usual household expenses.
As everyday costs rise but paychecks remain stagnant, Hoosiers naturally look for ways to make their income stretch, like an old blanket that no longer covers a growing child. That’s where our policymakers have allowed the ‘scamification’ to step in, by reducing consumer protections and sanctioning products that strip wealth away from Hoosiers with few options to make ends meet.
Unfortunately, the current federal administration is supercharging ‘scamification’, in part by freezing the critical work of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) just as frauds and complaints are on the rise. Since 2011, Hoosiers have submitted nearly 90,000 complaints to the CFPB, at a rate that has doubled in the last year alone. Hoosiers’ most common complaints regarding credit reporting, debt collection, mortgages, bank accounts, and credit cards won’t magically go away just because Congress recently slashed CFPB resources by nearly half in the ‘One Beautiful Bill Act’. But without a strong CFPB, Hoosiers will most certainly be left more vulnerable to more and worse scams in the future.
Other actions at the federal level will leave Hoosiers with less in their wallets as well. While a 2024 CFPB rule meant to crack down on ‘junk fees’ would have capped overdraft fees from an average of $32 to $8, under the new administration, the CFBP joined a banking industry consortium that successfully petitioned a judge to block the fee cap. The ruling will cost Americans $10 billion in savings annually. And while on January 7, the CFPB finalized a new rule to remove medical debt from credit reports, six months later a federal judge ruled those medical debts can remain in credit reports, a move that will negatively affect the estimated 1 in 6 Hoosiers with medical debt in collections.
Trailing in consumer protections
On top of the loss of federal consumer protections, Hoosiers must contend with a state landscape rife with debt traps that has earned an ‘F’ for consumer protections. The Private Equity State Risk Index lists Indiana at ‘High Risk’ for private equity takeover of our health care, housing, jobs, and pensions. Without guardrails, Hoosiers stand at risk of having many of the basics they count on ‘scamified’ into wealth-drainers.   
Hoosiers also already face a consumer policy environment that allows payday loans with effective APRs up to 391%. Bipartisan legislation to cap payday loans at 36% APR (the same cap required in order to lend to active duty service members) has been filed each session for nearly a decade but has not made it across the finish line. This past session saw worrying new attempts to hike charges on supervised loans, such as unconscionably high new rates on auto loans. Time will tell if guardrails put on newly-sanctioned Earned Wage Access products will be enough to prevent them from becoming yet another debt trap.
So, what can be done to stop the ‘scamification’ of Hoosiers? 
Employers can do their part by utilizing no-cost Community Loan Center alternatives to payday loans as an employee benefit. The State of Indiana should also consider Sen. Spencer Deery’s proposal to protect taxpayer resources by extending CLC protections to state employees. Above all, we need our policymakers to retake the reins of consumer protections and stop gutting watchdogs like the CFPB at the federal level. State lawmakers should re-think the trend of carve-outs to existing protections and instead set the bar higher with consumer needs at the forefront. These decisions can be hard, though, especially in the face of well-resourced special interests. To learn more Hoosiers can join Hoosiers for Responsible Lending and advocate for a stronger and more fair Indiana for all consumers.

The Outdoor Learning Grants program, established by the state Legislature in 2021, offered subsidies for schools to send fifth- and sixth-grade students to the outdoor school programs. But lawmakers zeroed out the grants as they worked to solve a budget gap this year. Enrollment is expected to drop as a result.
These programs are held at dedicated outdoor education centers and allow students to engage in hands-on activities out in nature, with an emphasis on scientific inquiry, environmental awareness and teamwork. 
Funding also went to schools, tribes and program providers to develop outdoor education curricula.  
The goal was to support outdoor educational experiences for students across the state and include high levels of accessibility for students with disabilities. 
Tribal schools, schools in rural areas and schools with high populations of free and reduced-price lunch students, migrant students, students of color, English language learners, and students receiving special education services were eligible for the subsidies.
Washington’s Office of the Superintendent of Instruction cites research showing that students who participate in outdoor educational activities are more likely to graduate, are better behaved in school, and have improved relationships with their peers. 
The state subsidies leveled the playing field for schools that couldn’t afford to send students to overnight outdoor school programs, said Greg Barker, managing director of the Washington School Principals’ Education Foundation. The foundation administers the Outdoor Learning Grant program and manages the Cispus outdoor learning center in Lewis County. 
Approximately 730 schools signed up for the state subsidies for the 2024-25 school year, and an estimated 790 were expected to apply this year, Barker said. 
There is still about $1.4 million left over from the last budget to help students at 50 to 60 of the highest-need schools attend outdoor school in the 2025-26 school year, but there’s not nearly enough savings to support all of the schools applying.
In the last two-year budget, lawmakers provided $20 million for the grants, double the amount allocated in the budget before that. 
Bellingham School District is among those losing funding from the grants this year. 
Last year, subsidies from the program covered $190,125 of the $200,000 it cost to send all of its fifth-grade students to overnight outdoor school programs at the North Cascades Institute in Skagit County and Camp Kirby on Samish Island. 
The Bellingham district launched its outdoor learning program in 2013, with the district’s 13 schools initially doing individual fundraising to cover the cost. 
The program is a critical part of meeting the district’s goal of holistic child development, said Tom Gresham, a director of teaching and learning with the district and organizer of its fifth-grade outdoor learning program. 
“It’s a really good culmination of what kids have been learning in all sorts of ways: science, writing, reading, environmental learning, and just how to get along with other human beings,” Gresham said of outdoor learning. 
The district began funding outdoor learning in its regular budget in 2020, and did so up until the state launched the Outdoor Learning Grants program. 
“For us, that was great, because then we could direct that funding towards some other things,” said Gresham. 
With the state funding gone, the district is trying to shift back to fundraising to keep the outdoor learning program alive. 
“We’re still in this place of trying to figure it all out,” Gresham said. 
A few other school districts, like Northshore, Kent and Olympia, are trying out fundraising as well, Barker said. 
Many districts, however, are cutting back on outdoor learning. 
For some, that means fewer days at outdoor school or a shift to alternative forms of outdoor learning, like a field trip to a local park or nature reserve. 
Schools that typically sign up for fall outdoor programs are the most affected by the loss of the grants because they have less time to find alternative funding. 
The North Cascades Institute anticipates that only 25% of its usual fall groups will attend this year, but expects enrollment to bounce back as early as this spring. 
“Our projections are looking pretty good,” said the institute’s program director, Eric Buher. 
The North Cascades Institute does its own fundraising to subsidize up to 60% of costs for schools to send students to its overnight outdoor school. But now that its own Outdoor Learning Grant funding has been cut, Buher said the organization may need to rethink its approach. 
“We’re looking for innovative ways to do things, to cut our costs, to increase donations to help bring schools in, but we also know that that’s going to be a journey,” Buher said.  
Cispus Learning Center is seeing immediate effects from the loss of grant funding and, as a result, is drastically reducing its program offerings this year. 
Staff are shifting focus to maintain the center’s website, keep its curriculum up to date and work with agencies like the Department of Natural Resources and Department of Fish and Wildlife to help schools maintain and adapt their outdoor learning programs.
Buher and Barker both hope that the state Legislature will renew its commitment to funding outdoor education once the budget stabilizes. 
“We really want to keep kids outdoors,” Barker said. “We’re just continuing to look for those resources to help them in the short term.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/DSC01619-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-07-21 07:56:43.042568

(Rebecca Rivas/Missouri Independent).Missouri cannabis regulators say they’re halfway through getting fingerprint background checks for about 16,000 marijuana workers and volunteers who didn’t get them between 2022 and 2024.
Anyone who wants to work in the cannabis industry must get an “agent ID badge” through the Missouri Division of Cannabis Regulation, which is when the background check normally occurs.
Since the division began doing the retroactive fingerprint checks in February, the number of agent IDs has declined by 2,400 — going from 21,132 in February to 18,737 in June, according to the division’s data and reports webpage. 
Lisa Cox, spokeswoman for the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services, said only 17 people have had their agent IDs revoked because the fingerprinting process showed a disqualifying felony offense on their criminal record, as of July 15. 
The vast majority, or 2,032 active agent IDs, have been “revoked due to non-submission of fingerprints,” Cox said. “Those who have been revoked for non-submission of fingerprints may reapply and should contact DCR directly for assistance with this request.”
  Facility agents are individuals with approved ID cards who work or volunteer in a licensed marijuana facility. (Screenshot of the Missouri Division of Cannabis Regulations data and reports webpage.)
When the state legalized medical marijuana in 2018, fingerprint background checks had been a requirement to apply for an agent ID card to work in the cannabis industry. 
That mandate lasted until December 2022, when the recreational marijuana constitutional amendment went into effect and only required owners of cannabis companies to get fingerprinted. Other employees had to attest to not committing disqualifying offenses.
In 2023, Missouri lawmakers passed a bill to once again require all employees, contractors, owners and volunteers to submit their fingerprints to the Missouri Highway Patrol for a criminal background check.
However, it took until October 2024 for the FBI to approve the division’s statutory authority to review state and federal criminal background records,  Cox said.
Since February, the division has been sending emails to individuals with agent ID cards approved between December 8, 2022 and December 1, 2024.
“Our request process is based on the date that the ID card was approved,” said Shayna Arndt, the division’s section director of patient and application services, during the July DCR Out Loud podcast. “We have sent out a message to the impacted agents and designated contacts for all facilities for the summer.” 
The constitution states that people with a “disqualifying felony” can’t work in the industry, and that’s broadly defined as any violation of a state or federal law designated a felony under Missouri law. 
According to the division, a lot of their review is subjective.
“What is written into law is then applied to each individual record, so it is a case-by-case analysis and can’t simply be determined by a checklist of potential offenses,” Cox told The Independent previously.
In the constitution, there is an exception for marijuana offenses eligible for expungement, and a time limit for other offenses.
An applicant can obtain an agent ID if they committed a non-violent offense more than five years ago and served no prison time. For other felonies, “more than five years have passed since the person was released from parole or probation, and he or she has not been convicted of any subsequent felony criminal offenses,” it states.
Every state handles background checks differently because the federal government doesn’t regulate the marijuana industry in any way, as it’s federally illegal.
Before the fingerprinting requirement went back into effect in December 2024, people could have their agent IDs approved and get to work within a 48-hour time period, said Christy Essex, who runs the largest Missouri-based cannabis staffing company, Se7en Staffing & Employment Solutions.
Now, it takes about 7-10 days. Essex believes that turnaround time could be faster if there were more state-approved facilities offered.
Despite the longer wait time, Essex said, “it’s definitely for the greater good to keep employees safe, the facilities safe, and the industry safe.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/flora-farms-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-21 06:56:19.038276

This story by Aaron Calvin was first published in News & Citizen on July 17.
With the pending purchase of an adjacent tract of land, the Peter A. Krusch Nature Preserve is set to greatly expand the publicly accessible forestland in Cambridge.
The Krusch Preserve Committee, which in 2021 established the preserve on land acquired by the town from resident Sally Laughlin, opened a 51-acre tract of dynamic woodland to the public, and created an accessible route to the Cambridge Pines State Forest.
A neighboring piece of land known as the Bormann property was considered for the preserve at the time, but an initial grant application was denied. Now, four years after the preserve first opened, the town is planning to acquire nearly 30 acres of additional land with assistance from the Vermont Land Trust.
The purchase will also connect the central section of the preserve with another piece of land owned by Cambridge village. Part of that land is off-limits to the public due to the existence of a wellhead on the tract, but trails that will be built through the area will more than double the area of publicly accessible forest, Laughlin said.
The expansion will add more diversity to the preserve, she said, and expand the preserve to over 200 acres.
“I was delighted when we walked up into the Bormann land, which is more hardwood forest, more maples and so forth,” Laughlin said. “There are wood thrush there, and there’ll be some different species of birds and plants and so forth.”
The Cambridge Pines State Forest contains some of the oldest trees in the town — it is a second-growth forest that has been mostly left intact since it was logged about 200 years ago. The current preserve contains meadow, forest, wetlands, Dragon Brook and a sand blow, land that has been rendered sandy and unvegetated by stiff winds.
The new portions opened up by this purchase will add higher elevation habitats to the range, and even features what Laughlin says is “probably the oldest yellow birch in Vermont,” just over the line into the village’s property.
The preserve has become regionally popular in its four years of public use, with a tracker borrowed from the Lamoille County Planning Commission indicating the preserve saw thousands of visitors within a 10-month span.
The Bormann family has entered an agreement to sell its property to the land trust, which will then transfer it to the town for the appraised value of $235,000. With additional costs, the land trust has estimated that the overall cost of the project to be at around $300,000, most of which will be covered by a grant they’re seeking from the Vermont Housing and Conservation Trust, along with $20,000 from the Cambridge Conservation Commission and additional funding raised by the nonprofit Friends of the Krusch Nature Preserve.
Bob Heiser and Friends of the Krusch Nature Preserve president Mary Fiedler, in a letter to the selectboard from land trust project director, noted that expanding the preserve has important environmental benefits.
“The forestland is part of a larger forest block identified by the State of Vermont as a Priority ‘Connectivity Block’ and Priority ‘Interior Forest Block,’ providing critical ecological connectivity on a statewide level,” the letter said.
The Cambridge Selectboard voted at its July 1 meeting to sign a letter of support to the housing and conservation board in support of the grant.
A public informational meeting about the project will be held Monday, Sept. 8 at 6 p.m. at the Cambridge Historical Society.

Phil Murphy in 2025. (Photos by Hal Brown and Amanda Brown)New Jersey’s gubernatorial candidates are clashing over a Trump administration plan to house detained migrants at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst.
U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth unveiled the Fort Dix plan last week in a letter to members of Congress. Rep. Mikie Sherrill, the Democratic nominee for governor in November, called the move “unacceptable.”
“This is a blatant misuse of one of New Jersey’s most critical military assets and reduces a vital national security installation to a stage for political theater, which flies in the face of an apolitical military,” Sherrill said in a statement. “Using the base for detention operations risks degrading operational capacity, places an inappropriate burden on our service members, and harms civil-military relations.”
She urged the administration to immediately reverse its decision and “respect the essential role our servicemembers and military bases play in defending the nation.” Her House Democratic colleagues and New Jersey’s two U.S. senators, Cory Booker and Andy Kim, both Democrats, also oppose the Fort Dix plan.
Jack Ciattarelli, a former assemblyman and Sherrill’s Republican opponent in the fall, blamed Democrats for forcing President Donald Trump’s hand. In a statement from his campaign, Ciattarelli said Sherrill and her party “are the ones who should be held accountable.”
“NJ Democrats, including Mikie Sherrill, created a crisis by putting out the welcome mat for illegal immigrants with their dangerous Sanctuary State policies. Having created the crisis, they now want to blame the White House for being forced to deal with it. That’s like an arsonist complaining about having started a fire,” he said.
On the campaign trail, Ciattarelli has sided with Trump’s mass deportation efforts. He has said that if elected, on his first day in office he would strike down a state directive limiting local law enforcement cooperation with federal immigration authorities.
Sherrill and Ciattarelli are competing to succeed Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat who cannot seek a third term in November. He leaves office in January.
New Jersey has two detention centers for immigrant detainees, Elizabeth Detention Center and Delaney Hall in Newark. Delaney Hall in May became the second migrant jail to open under the new Trump administration. Its opening spurred protests that led to federal charges for Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, for trespassing, and Rep. LaMonica McIver (D-10), who is accused of assaulting federal officers. Federal prosecutors dropped the charge against Baraka days after he was arrested.
Federal officials are also exploring reopening the Albert M. “Bo” Robinson Treatment Center, a 1,000-bed facility in Trenton that held state prisoners until 2022, according to records obtained by the American Civil Liberties Union in November.

I have written about them here before. They are eight global citizens who fled their homeland in the midst of a civil war. They waited years in a refugee camp and jumped through all the hoops required to obtain legal refugee status in the United States.
When they arrived in Kansas City in January, we thought they were the lucky ones. In a world of displacement and conflict, they had joined the sliver of refugees selected to find safety and opportunity here.
Twelve days after this family’s arrival, Donald Trump was inaugurated and America became a different country.
As a member of a team volunteering with a resettlement agency for this family, I’ve had a front row seat to the cruelty that the Trump administration has inflicted on people whose only mistake, if you can call it that, was to arrive here with hope.
As one of his first acts in office, Trump cut off all refugee admissions (except for a small number of white South Africans). He also froze federal funding for families who were already here.
In the wake of that shocking news, the resettlement agency that my team works with was forced to lay off nearly half its staff. 
We worried about who would pay the rent on the small house where the family lives. Fortunately, charitable donors came through and the bills got paid.
In the anxiety-filled first months of this year, as we worked to enroll teenagers in school and escorted adults to literacy classes and job fairs, I gained a new appreciation for two services: SNAP and Medicaid. 
The family I was involved with had no source of cash. Possibly because of the political climate, jobs were hard to come by. My team helped out with necessities, like toilet paper. The saving grace was an EBT card that allowed family members to go to a grocery store like everyone else and purchase healthy food through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.
Refugees qualify for SNAP because, up until now, they arrived with “qualified” immigration status. SNAP has never been available to undocumented immigrants.
The same is the case with Medicaid. My family could go to the Samuel U. Rodgers Health Center in Kansas City — a place I will forever applaud for the professionalism and kindness of its staff — and be screened for illness, receive prescriptions and get dental checkups. 
(Note to HHS Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr.: The water at the refugee camp was not fluoridated; one of the teenagers had 22 cavities.) 
Spring and summer brought some better news. The federal government coughed up a bit of cash assistance. Della Lamb Community Services, the resettlement agency, found jobs for the two male adults in the family. It is hard work, in the food processing industry, but they are elated to have paychecks.
And then, on July 4, Trump signed the absurdly named One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA). 
If you are looking for evidence of America’s turn to meanness and isolation, it is  right there in the new law. Which was passed, by the way, with the votes of every Republican member of Missouri’s Congressional delegation. That includes Sen. Josh Hawley, who spent weeks yapping about how unwise it would be to cut Medicaid funding, before he voted to do exactly that.
OBBBA quadruples the amount of money that can be spent on facilities where immigrants, including children, can be detained indefinitely. It provides approximately $32 billion to supercharge the hiring of ICE agents to round up immigrants and terrorize entire communities.
And it makes newly arrived refugees and asylees ineligible for SNAP benefits and Medicaid coverage.
“The bill is, without a doubt, unprecedented in the harm it will cause refugee and other immigrant communities,” the resettlement and advocacy group Global Refuge declared after the vote.
There’s more. The bill significantly increases the fees that lawful immigrants must pay to enter the United States and maintain legal status. Refugees and others — who generally arrive here penniless  — will now have to pay $550 for the precious employment authorization cards that enable them to work. The cards must be renewed every six months, at a cost of $275.
In other words, refugees will have to pay to work. They will work grueling and tedious jobs and pay taxes for their labor, yet they will be ineligible for the government benefits that enable their families to survive. 
The provisions in the big, terrible bill, if left unchanged, will effectively end America’s long history of welcoming refugees and asylees. There will be no need for Trump or any president to cap admissions because no refugee will be able to survive without food assistance or health care. I assume that is the point.
As things now stand, refugees and other lawful immigrants will become part of the 220,000 Missourians who will lose Medicaid coverage in October 2026. The SNAP cutoff will happen almost immediately. 
My six-month volunteer commitment with my refugee family has technically ended, so I do not know if they are aware of the changes that are coming. 
Like all refugees, this family is resilient. I have watched them meet challenges in amazing ways. 
They are fearful, though, about their future in a nation that no longer extends a hand to the rest of the world. I share their dread.

Article Summary

An 18-year-old girl died in a foster home in Fairview Heights, Illinois, where she lived for four years.
The state’s Department of Children and Family Services is refusing to release a timeline of her case until a criminal investigation and trial are completed.
A decades-old state law requires the agency to release a report within six months of a child death or life-threatening injury.
Lawmakers and child advocates are calling for transparency in all cases involving deaths or serious injuries.

This summary was written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.


Mackenzi Felmlee fell through the safety net of doctors, judges, lawyers, social workers, teachers, child welfare organizations and the state agency charged with protecting abused and neglected children in Illinois until she was found bruised and struggling to breathe at the bottom of the basement stairs in a Fairview Heights foster home.

Eighteen-year-old Mackenzi died on May 11, 2024, from a blood clot that hit her lungs, doctors said. Her neck, shoulders, legs and face were bruised, and her dehydrated body weighed just 90 pounds.

But the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services has refused to release a timeline or reports detailing their actions in the case — despite a law that requires DCFS to make findings and recommendations available when a child dies or is seriously injured in its care.

And it likely won’t release any information for years.

Last month, a St. Clair County grand jury indicted Mackenzi’s foster mother, Shameka Williams, and Williams’ mother, Cornelia Reid, herself a former foster parent, on charges of first-degree murder, involuntary manslaughter, aggravated domestic battery, intimidation, unlawful restraint and domestic battery in connection with Mackenzi’s death.

“We won’t have a timeline to share until after a trial takes place,” DCFS spokesperson Heather Tarczan wrote June 26 in an email to Capitol News Illinois.

Lutheran Child and Family Services, a DCFS contractor, employed the caseworker who oversaw Mackenzi. It declined to comment citing confidentiality, aside from calling the incident “tragic.”

During her time in Williams’ foster home, Mackenzi was the target of beatings and tortuous behavior, including humiliation by mocking and being forced to wear feces-stained masks and underwear on her face, prosecutors said during a court hearing. Despite repeated complaints of abuse and neglect from other foster children in the home, Mackenzi remained in Williams’ home for four years.

While Mackenzi died more than a year ago, a DCFS spokesperson said the state agency could not conduct a procedural review of what happened inside the home until a criminal investigation is completed, citing a portion of state law that says information should not be released if it could undermine a criminal investigation or trial.

Under a 1997 Illinois law, DCFS is required to produce a report on every child who is a ward of the state who dies or sustains serious injury. The report should contain findings and recommendations for administrative or policy changes.

Earlier this year, Illinois Answers Project reported that DCFS failed to produce these  reports that examined failures in more than 1,200 deaths and 3,000 life-threatening injuries to children in the state’s care since 2018.

Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart sponsored the law in 1997 when he served in the state legislature. That law was amended in 2008 to make the reports public after a series of news stories by the Belleville News-Democrat about 53 children who died while in DCFS’ care. The law requires a presumption that the best interest of the public will be served by releasing information concerning the child’s death and any other investigations concerning the child or other children living in the household.

The law’s goal was transparency and accountability to restore public trust in the child protection agency, Dart told Capitol News Illinois.

“The public who, by the way, is paying for this entire system. The public deserves to know what happened here, what went wrong with this,” Dart said.

The long fall of Mackenzi Felmlee

Mackenzi Rose Felmlee was born July 13, 2005, to Bonnie Rose Felmlee and Rasul Sykes. She had three sisters.

In 2015, Bonnie Felmlee, facing a prison sentence for a theft charge in Nevada, entrusted Dennis Pickens with the care of 10-year-old Mackenzi and her sisters. The next year, Pickens asked a Fayette County judge to formally appoint him guardian. The request was approved in January 2017.

At that time, Pickens wrote in his guardianship petition that Mackenzi was a “normal 12-year-old girl” and was above average in school. In junior high, she was on the track team and the honor roll.

Bonnie Felmlee moved into Pickens’ Vandalia home with Pickens and her children after her release from prison.

In August 2018, Bonnie Felmlee called police and reported that she found 20 naked pictures of then-13-year-old Mackenzi on Pickens’ phone, according to court documents.

Pickens, a retired federal prison guard, was charged with four counts of producing child pornography. That was followed by another charge of predatory criminal sexual assault with Mackenzi as the victim.

Though it declined to provide a detailed timeline of its involvement in the case, DCFS responded to Capitol News Illinois’ questions regarding when Mackenzi came into state care and certain aspects of her care.

In May 2019, DCFS took custody of Mackenzi and her siblings. The four sisters were sent to separate homes — with only two remaining together.

DCFS confirmed that Mackenzi was placed in Williams’ foster home in Fairview Heights in April 2020 under the supervision of Lutheran Child and Family Services.

“We are deeply saddened by this tragic incident, and our hearts go out to all those affected,"" a spokesperson for Lutheran Child and Family Services responded in an email.

The DCFS contractor declined further comment, citing confidentiality rules.

Mackenzi enrolled in Belleville East High School. Her grades were average in 2020 and 2021. A month after her placement with Williams, Mackenzi posted a video to TikTok with Reid, doing a choreographed dance with the caption: #coolgrandma.

But later in 2021 and 2022, things seemed to take a turn. Mackenzi was failing and truant, missing 15 out of 55 school days, records showed. She enrolled in night GED classes in January 2023 where she failed most of her classes for not completing the work.

In response to written questions, DCFS said they are “looking into” who permitted Mackenzi to leave regular school with Lutheran Child and Family Services.

In 2022, another foster child came into Williams’ home — a girl identified by prosecutors only as “D.E.” who later would tell police “when you first move in with Shameka, it was fine, but the longer you were there the worse it got.” She told police that Williams would withhold food, not allow the girls to shower, and hit them with whatever she could find: a belt, a hanger, or her hand.

Three years after DCFS took custody of the former honor roll student, Mackenzi was diagnosed with multiple mental illnesses, including post-traumatic stress disorder, bipolar disorder and depression.  She reportedly was under psychiatric care.  She was also incontinent; Williams made her wear diapers tied with plastic bags to her legs to keep the waste from leaking, prosecutors said.

But according to a report from the DCFS Office of the Inspector General, Mackenzi wanted her foster mother to adopt her, though it isn’t clear where this information was obtained by the OIG. Mackenzi, who was by then nearly 17 years old, had been in Williams’ home for two years.

The OIG report also documented the breakdown between Mackenzi and her biological family, stating she refused visits with her sisters.

Despite losing her parental rights in April 2022, Bonnie Felmlee tried to find out about the pending criminal case against the man accused of molesting Mackenzi — a case that dragged on for more than seven years. Pickens was found guilty in October 2024 — five months after Mackenzi’s death.

Required reporting ignored

There are two public reports that mention Mackenzi’s death — the DCFS Office of the Inspector General Annual Report to the Governor and the General Assembly for 2024, and the Departmental Report on Death or Serious Life-Threatening Injury.

Mackenzi’s case was one of 202 deaths or serious injuries to children in Illinois from April 1 to June 30, 2024, listed in quarterly reports to the legislature, although the names of those who died are not listed, but the report dates and cities are listed. One case corresponded to Mackenzi.  The cause of death for Mackenzi was listed as death by neglect.

The report listed both the DCFS investigation and the criminal investigation as pending. There was no follow-up in subsequent quarterly reports.

These anonymous quarterly reports include the date the incident was reported to DCFS; whether the child was in DCFS custody; the status of the allegation; what, if any, action DCFS took; whether criminal charges were filed; and the legislative district, city and zip code where the death or injury occurred.

Of those 202 cases, there are 45 deaths listed. Criminal charges were issued in six of the cases.

Capitol News Illinois reached out to legislators with questions regarding Mackenzi’s death to determine whether they received more comprehensive reports. Sen. Erica Harriss, R- Glen Carbon, in whose district Mackenzi lived, confirmed she had received no findings or recommendations related to Mackenzi’s death.

Harriss contacted DCFS Director Heidi Mueller, who responded in a July 3 letter that “All at DCFS are heartbroken by what occurred.”

In the letter, Mueller cited the administrative rule that directs DCFS to extend its investigatory timeline when prosecutors or police request the department to delay making a determination due to a pending criminal investigation.

“In short, in this case, DCFS will complete its investigation once law enforcement has finished theirs,” Mueller stated.

Mueller further stated Fairview Heights Police continue to investigate the case and “had not shared the information it had gathered with DCFS, including electronic forensic evidence that appear necessary to understand this case.”

Fairview Heights police declined to comment, citing an ongoing investigation.

[caption id=""attachment_77098"" align=""alignright"" width=""260""] Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart (File photo)[/caption]

“I will continue to closely monitor this situation and strongly advocate for the protection and well-being of our most vulnerable children, as well as prosecution and accountability of those whose negligence has contributed to this tragedy,” Harriss said in a statement to Capitol News Illinois.

Cook County Public Guardian Charles Golbert, an outspoken critic of DCFS, provides legal representation to thousands of abused and neglected children who are wards of the court. Golbert said DCFS needs to be swift and open in releasing information regarding their handling of Mackenzi’s case.

“We call on DCFS for full transparency including prompt release of a detailed timeline about its prior involvement with the family and what its representatives observed when investigating and licensing the home and visiting Mackenzi and others in the home, and the details of its investigations of all other reports of child abuse in the home,” Golbert said in a statement.

The OIG reported that “the youth’s placement worker made regular visits and last saw the youth two days before her death.”

Police have said the Mackenzi’s injuries were in various stages of healing, but it is not known whether the Lutheran Child and Family Services' placement worker reported any injuries, as required by law. DCFS did not disclose whether there was a pending abuse investigation regarding Mackenzi prior to her death.

[caption id=""attachment_77097"" align=""alignleft"" width=""244""] Cook County Public Guardian Charles Golbert (File photo)[/caption]

Mackenzi was also the subject of a juvenile abuse case. That case was filed in Fayette County, where she was taken into state custody when she was living with her mother and Pickens in Vandalia.

In Illinois, the media have special standing to attend juvenile hearings, but juvenile court files are closed to the public.

Fourth Judicial Circuit Chief Judge Martin W. Siemer declined a request by Capitol News Illinois to review the file, finding that although the law provided juvenile court cases may be obtained for good cause, the law restricts who can see those records and found the press is not among them.

Dart contended that a procedural review of Mackenzi’s death was long overdue, given she died more than a year ago.

“The nature of this bill was to be just very straightforward. These kids’ deaths were to be investigated, the facts of what happened were to be divulged, and it was to be divulged so we can fix it and that it doesn't happen again. And anyone who's not following that is somebody who clearly, clearly does not have the best interest of these children at heart,” Dart said.

Inside the foster home

Shameka Williams became a licensed foster parent in 2012 with special training to house children with emotional, behavioral or other special needs, according to DCFS. She was licensed by another DCFS contractor, Caritas Family Solutions.

In a court hearing, prosecutors detailed abuse allegations involving Williams that dated back a decade, including:


In 2015, a 14-year-old reported that Williams hit him with a belt and threatened to take away his belongings if he left. He showed the investigator scars, but Williams told them that the boy was dark complected, making it difficult to determine whether the injuries were old or new. The boy told the investigator that if he was returned to Williams, he would attack her and run away, preferring to “die in the cold than stay.” The boy was removed, but the allegation was unfounded.
A 17-year-old girl told DCFS in 2017 that Williams left town without planning for the girl’s care. Williams allegedly told the girl to “sleep outside” because no one would care for her because she wasn’t behaving. Williams later left the girl in the care of a friend, who was supposed to take her to school. The foster child missed four days of school. The teen told the worker she cried herself to sleep. The allegation was unfounded.
Another 16-year-old foster child in Williams’ care took a bus to her former foster home. Williams went and dragged the child out and threw her in the car. She told medical personnel that she didn’t feel safe at Williams’ home and reported thoughts of suicide, as well as killing Williams. The allegation was unfounded.


DCFS said because investigators found no evidence of abuse, the agency continued to place children with Williams and left Mackenzi in the home.

In addition to physical abuse of Mackenzi, there were also documented cases of mental abuse. At a court hearing, prosecutors showed video footage that showed Mackenzi being beaten by Williams with a belt while the teen is forced to say, “It’s not good to manipulate.”

In another video, Williams forced Mackenzi to repeat: “I am a doof. I hate myself.”

Reid, Williams’ mother who had retired as a foster parent, also faced allegations of abuse.

In 2019, an 11-year-old boy reported Reid beat him with a belt. She also allegedly punched him and hit him with a brush. The boy was removed from the home, but the investigator found no evidence of abuse.

Fairview Heights Police reported they received 31 calls involving Williams, Reid or the foster home in the five years prior to Mackenzi’s death. Police declined to release details of those calls.

Her foster sister, identified as D.E., later told police that Mackenzi wasn’t happy and things got worse for her as her 18th birthday approached. Without a legal tie to her parents and still a ward of the state, Mackenzi waited for the adoption to proceed. It was not completed by July 13, 2023, Mackenzi's 18th birthday.

Ten months later, on the day before Mother’s Day, Mackenzi died.

“This child was in the custody of the state, so theoretically, in a practical sense, we were their parents at the time,” Dart said. “Okay, so we need to learn what went wrong here, because this was our system that we put this child in. And so, we need to find out quickly what went wrong so it doesn't happen again.”

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)As Iowa’s universities release external funding numbers for fiscal year 2025, questions remain as to what the federal funding landscape will look like in the future. However, research leaders at Iowa State University say they are optimistic about their chances of keeping dollars coming in for vital research and other areas.
Iowa State University received $549.3 million in external funding in fiscal year 2025, the university announced, of which nearly $330 million went to research. The Ames university saw record funding from three federal agencies — the U.S. Department of Energy, National Science Foundation and Department of Transportation.
According to a statement provided by ISU and attributed to Associate Vice President for Research Jim Reecy and Dan Kirkpatrick, strategic communications manager for the Office of the Vice President for Research, only four projects awarded in the past fiscal year were canceled or terminated due to shifts in federal funding, totaling $822,000 in funding.

While it is “very difficult to anticipate how the university’s federal research funding might change in the 2026 fiscal year,” the statement said, many current government priorities align with university initiatives and research, including artificial intelligence, advanced manufacturing, genomics and rural infrastructure.
“Just as they’ve adapted through changing priorities of previous administrations – and will do so for future administrations – the Iowa State research team will explore alternative and creative funding opportunities that align with their key areas of research focus,” the statement said.
Funding from federal sources made up the largest portion of the $705.6 million in external funding the University of Iowa received in fiscal year 2025, totaling $300 million. Dollars went to supporting 2,300 university projects, according to a news release, and nearly $534 million was put toward “research, scholarship, and creative activities.”
“This support reflects the value of research at the University of Iowa,” said Lois Geist, who served as the UI’s interim vice president for research during the fiscal year, in the release. “Our faculty, staff, and students are addressing some of the most pressing challenges facing Iowa and the world.”
In response to questions from the Iowa Capital Dispatch, UI Public Relations Manager Chris Brewer referred to the university’s federal updates website and said in an email the university has no more to add.
Cuts to federal funding have hit both universities in past months, with the UI seeing funding halt for its international writing program, Iowa Flood Center and Iowa Geological Survey initiatives and other research. Funding cuts could also impact graduate students, who are paid to teach and assist in research.
According to an article written by Kirkpatrick and posted by the university, research funding provided by the U.S. Department of Agriculture dropped by nearly 50%, or more than $24 million, compared to last year. The department also provided only capacity funding for research between January and May of this year, and awarded no new, competitive research grants.
ISU President Wendy Wintersteen joined a call from academic organizations and businesses across the U.S. for renewed national investment in research and development, signing a joint statement in late May in support for strengthening domestic innovation and production.
In response to a question about the possibility of separate external funding filling gaps left by rescinded federal funding, the statement said there are other avenues for revenue in the form of state government, business and industry partners, commodity groups and private foundations.
“Regardless of the federal funding environment, the team at the university will continue to explore, expand, and strengthen partnerships with non-federal sponsors in the next fiscal year and beyond,” the statement said.

(Photo courtesy of Emma Widmar)At the age of 26, Emma Widmar has been chronically ill for more than half her lifetime.
Widmar was 12 when her symptoms first showed up — severe allergies to food, hormones and her environment. At the age of 18 she qualified for Social Security disability payments as well as for Medicaid. The combined federal-state health insurance program pays for her ongoing medical care, frequent emergency room visits and necessary home care.
“I equate Medicaid to a lifeline,” Widmar says. “Some people might think that’s an exaggeration, but it isn’t. It ensures all my needs are met.”


Federal fallout

	
As federal funding and systems dwindle, states are left to decide how and
whether to make up the difference.
Read the latest > 


With the enactment on July 4 of the mega-bill extending the tax cuts passed during President Donald Trump’s first term along with deep cuts in Medicaid and other safety net programs, Widmar is uncertain how her life might change.
After she graduated from Gateway Technical College, Widmar worked for four years for the Racine County Eye, an online journalism outlet. A case of respiratory syncytial virus — RSV — in January 2024 brought on severe neuropathy and hampered her breathing, forcing her to give up a job she had loved.
“I lost my ability to walk,” Widmar says. “It really wreaked havoc on my body and I couldn’t keep up.”
As complex as her health problems are, they’ve also become deeply familiar to her. 
 “It has been my life, and I simply can’t ignore it,” Widmar says. “It’s just the way that it is.”
While she and her family along with many others hope that science will one day unlock treatments for intractable illnesses such as hers, “these are chronic, lifelong conditions that right now there’s no cure for,” she says. For now, “it’s about finding the best quality of life for myself.”
Widmar lives with her parents in Mount Pleasant. Her mother is a primary caregiver.
Wisconsin’s home- and community-based care Medicaid waiver covers the cost of medications “that allow me to function,” she says.
 It also makes it possible for her to have additional home and personal caregivers. With Medicaid “those caretakers can be compensated,” Widmar says. “It ensures that I always have eyes on me and that I’m getting what I need.”
Her chronic food allergies require a special diet, with food that is more expensive than the typical grocery store purchase. Widmar’s disability has qualified her for benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program — SNAP, known as FoodShare in Wisconsin.
“Health care and food assistance are not just line items in a budget — they are a matter of life and death for American families,” said Sondra Goldschein, executive director of Family Friendly Economy, which campaigned against the mega-bill and shared the stories of people affected by it, including Widmar.
The bill passed despite widespread popular opposition. Widmar says she wants to encourage people “to continue voicing their opinions to policymakers, lawmakers and politicians,” not give up in resignation. “We are the ones that employ the government,” she says. “They work for us and we have to remind them of that.”
Widmar suspects most people wouldn’t consider her a typical Medicaid recipient — younger, coming from a middle-class upbringing and with a family that is able to support her. But that’s really the point: Medicaid, she observes, has helped people from all different backgrounds, regardless of class, race, ethnicity or education.
She also expects the spending cuts will ripple far beyond the Medicaid population.
“We’re altering health care as a whole, which will have an impact on everyone,” Widmar says.
For several years, the Affordable Care Act has helped drive down the number of people without health insurance. The mega-bill’s changes not just to Medicaid but also the ACA have been forecast to reverse that trend, increasing the uninsured population by 17 million over the next decade.
One Medicaid change, scheduled to take effect in 2027, will be the imposition of work requirements for some recipients. Nationally, two-thirds of Medicaid recipients already work full- or part-time, according to KFF, a nonprofit health policy research, polling and news organization, and researchers have found that some people who qualify are excluded due to paperwork problems.
Widmar has already experienced a work requirement as part of her SNAP enrollment. When her illness made work impossible, the requirement was waived.
With the extent of her current disabilities, she hopes that she would qualify for an exemption from the coming Medicaid work requirement.
She might not know for sure until late 2026, however. Wisconsin won’t be able to draw up the details of how it implements the work requirement until the publication of the federal rules, which aren’t due until next June.
In her previous experience with SNAP, Widmar said work requirements didn’t always match the realities for people with disabilities.
“Unfortunately we don’t make it easier for people who are disabled to have a job and contribute,” she says. “It’s not a system that says, ‘We have a work requirement — do what you’re able to do…’”
When she was able to work, “I loved my job,” Widmar says. Her employer was understanding and accommodated her disabilities.
That was no small matter. Because of her condition, Widmar says, she can’t be alone: Her low blood pressure can cause her to faint unpredictably. Her hours also had to be flexible to match her erratic energy levels.
“It’s difficult to work and have a disability and be on these programs,” Widmar says. “It’s like an agility course you have to go through.”
While Widmar is concerned about what lies ahead for her when the changes to Medicaid take effect, her foremost worry is for people whose lives are more difficult.
“I have a support system to help me get through it. But there’s people that don’t know where to turn for help. And it’s really unfortunate for them,” she says.
For people living at or near poverty, she sees life on the verge of becoming more harsh.
“We’re already at bare bones,” Widmar says, “and now we’re taking away more from the most vulnerable populations.”

In reading and writing, the share of students scoring at or above the college-ready threshold rose to 54.5%, up from 51.8% the year before and 50.5% in 2023.
A greater number of students continued to score in the “below college-ready” category for math, however. Just 25.2% of test-takers earned passing scores in 2025.



About 24.5% of Indiana students who took the SAT during the last academic year met the readiness benchmark on both subject portions, according to the Indiana Department of Education. That’s a 0.3% increase compared to last year, but still 4% down from 2023.
“We still have a large number of students in that below-college-ready group,” said Lynn Schemel, IDOE’s chief academic officer. “We want to move that … in the (right) direction … but we have more work to do.”
The new test results were released last week and discussed by the State Board of Education. Data from the latest round of ILEARN testing was also published.
State law requires IDOE to administer a national college entrance exam to high school students before graduation.
How scores work
The SAT includes math, reading and writing sections. The assessment, administered by the College Board, scores students as “At College-Ready,” “Approaching College-Ready,” or “Below College-Ready,” depending on their performance.
A student who scores “Approaching” with one more year remaining in high school is expected to be at “At College-Ready” by graduation.
Students who score at or above the benchmark have a 75% chance of earning at least a C in their first semester of credit-bearing college courses in that subject area, IDOE officials said.










As a board, we’ve talked a lot about what skills students need in high school. Does the SAT fit that? I think that’s a conversation we’ll continue to have.


– Indiana Education Secretary Katie Jenner


Of the 81,620 students who took the reading and writing assessment in 2025, more than half met the college-ready benchmark. About 36.4% of students were approaching a passing score, while 9.2% remained below.
In math, 21.6% of students were “approaching” college-readiness, and 53% were below the readiness benchmark.
That’s a decline from 2024, when roughly 52.8% of test-takers were below college-ready levels, and from 45.2% who trailed the benchmark in 2023. 
About 25% of students posted college-ready math scores in 2024. IDOE data indicates 30.7% of students who took the SAT were college-ready in math in 2023.
“(The latest data) underscores the urgency of the work we’re doing,” Schemel said, referencing new instructional resources and educational screeners designed to improve foundational math skills. 
The state, she noted, is currently building math support systems for students in grades K–2 and 9–12 to mirror recent literacy investments made for elementary and middle school grades.
Board members weigh in
Board members acknowledged the need for additional math support, but some questioned whether the SAT is the right tool to evaluate all progress among all Indiana students, especially those not planning to attend college.
“This is a college-ready exam, and we administer it to students who aren’t going to college,” said board member B.J. Watts. “Let’s be honest — it’s not important to them. That doesn’t mean they don’t have other skills where they shine. But that’s not going to show up here, at least not yet.”
Indiana ILEARN scores show continued growth in math — but reading levels stay flat

Indiana Education Secretary Katie Jenner echoed the need for continued discussion. 
“As a board, we’ve talked a lot about what skills students need in high school,” Jenner said. “Does the SAT fit that? I think that’s a conversation we’ll continue to have.”
Education officials further pointed to a wave of reforms aimed at supporting students earlier in their education, like numeracy screeners, teacher training in evidence-based instruction methods, and math intervention plans. 
All of those efforts are still ramping up, Schemel said.
“We’re trying to wrap our arms around the standards at the high school level now, too,” Hurst said. “That includes what students are getting in their courses before they even get to this SAT moment.”
Jenner added that SAT scores are likely to evolve more as Indiana rolls out new pathways to graduation. 
Under the state’s new high school diploma model — which is set to take effect for all schools by 2029 — all juniors will still be required by law to take the SAT, but scores are only used toward graduation if a student chooses that option under one of the college-bound or employment-readiness tracks, or “seals.”
“We’re maximizing the four years of high school,” she said. “Whether students pursue enrollment, enlistment or employment, our work has to prepare them for all three.”

“We are witnessing a dangerous reversal of one of public health’s greatest achievements,” said Paul Kilgore, co-director of the Wayne State University Center for Emerging and Infectious Diseases and director of research and professor of pharmacy practice in the Eugene Applebaum College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences.
“What’s particularly alarming is that 17 of Michigan’s 18 cases were unvaccinated. This is entirely preventable. History shows us what happens when we become complacent – in 1990, we saw nearly 28,000 cases and 89 deaths nationwide,” said Kilgore.
According to the Centers for Disease Control, there are 1,309 confirmed cases of Measles across the country, with three confirmed deaths, the first measles-related deaths in the U.S. in a decade.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
While 95% vaccination is needed to prevent outbreaks, the Center for Emerging and Infectious Diseases warns that Michigan’s childhood measles vaccination rate stands at only 79%.
Of the 1,309 confirmed cases, 92% were among unvaccinated individuals.
“This outbreak represents a critical failure in our system of public health communication,” said Matthew Seeger, a professor of communication and a Center for Emerging and Infectious Diseases co-director. “Sadly, we’re seeing the consequences of conflicting messages and misinformation leading to confusion, distrust and vaccine hesitancy. Clear, consistent and understandable communication with trusted credible sources is essential to rebuild confidence in one of medicine’s most important public health tools.”
The recommendation follows the decision in June by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to fire all 17 members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, widely seen as part of a vaccine-skeptical agenda from the Trump administration.
The Center further warned that measles is highly contagious with 90% of susceptible individuals exposed to the virus becoming infected.
Additionally, the virus can cause “immune amnesia” destroying up to 73% of antibodies that protect against other diseases and leaving survivors vulnerable to other infections for two to three years after recovery.
In the face of the ongoing outbreak, Wayne State researchers recommend parents should immediately verify their children’s vaccination status and schedule catch-up vaccines if needed. They also recommend adults born after 1957 and unsure of their immunity consult with their health care provider.
“The measles vaccine has been safely administered to billions of people worldwide for over 60 years,” Kilgore said. “Two doses provide 97% protection for life. This isn’t just about preventing measles – it’s about protecting our children’s entire immune system and our community’s health.”
Additionally, the center advises health care facilities to review infection control protocols.
Anyone experiencing symptoms – including fever, cough, runny nose and red eyes followed by a rash – should call their health care provider before visiting to prevent further spread of the illness, Wayne state researchers said.
While the disease has been considered eliminated in the United States for 25 years, the country is at risk of losing that status, the center warned, with other nations losing elimination status due to prolonged outbreaks.

Idaho Department of Fish and Game Wildlife Research Manager Matt Mumma presented the new population estimate and a summary of the new methods the state uses to estimate the wolf population at the Idaho Fish and Game Commission’s meeting Thursday in Coeur d’Alene, which was streamed live online by the state.
After years of reporting the state’s estimated wolf population as of Aug. 1, Fish and Game officials switched to estimating the wolf population as of late May with this week’s report. 
The different reporting dates are part of a larger change where the state switched from deploying trail cameras, which were used from 2019 to 2023, to estimate its wolf population. Idaho is now using a new method, which involves collecting age and genetic information from a tooth from every wolf killed in Idaho, to estimate how many new wolf litters the state has, as well as Idaho’s overall wolf population.
Officials call the new method the ABC method, which is short for Approximate Bayesian Computation.
 Counting wolves in Idaho using the ABC population method

As Fish and Game officials refined the new ABC population method over the past year, adding additional data to the model resulted in changes to previous years’ wolf population estimates, state officials said.
Idaho Department of Wildlife Bureau Chief Shane Roberts told the Sun on Friday that state officials added an additional four metrics to the ABC method after it was unveiled last year. Based on that additional data, Roberts said the ABC method produced higher wolf population estimates for several previous years.
“It did make all our previous estimates go up slightly,” Roberts said in an interview Friday. 
Ghost wolves: As Idaho aims to reduce its wolf population, advocates worry counts aren’t accurate

Some outside researchers had been critical of Idaho using trail cameras to estimate wolf populations, and Idaho Department of FIsh and Game officials acknowledged last year that the trail cam methods could become less accurate as the wolf population decreases. 
Wildlife biologists and experts estimate the wolf population because wolves are too elusive and Idaho is too rugged and remote for officials to undertake an actual physical count of every wolf in the state. 
Roberts said the changes in population estimation dates and the new methods are all designed to help the state produce the most accurate wolf count possible using that latest data and most accurate methods. 
Roberts said Idaho Department of Fish and Game officials realize some of the changes may be confusing to the public. But he said the state plans to use the May numbers and the ABC model consistently going forward. 
When analyzing Idaho wolf population trends over the years, Roberts said it is important to make a distinction that previous population estimates were tied to August and the new numbers are tied to May – and there is a difference between the two. Roberts also said he continues to have confidence in the trends that previous wolf population estimates reported.
“I do believe the general trends of all those estimates combined, regardless of methodology, the trends are telling us what we believe to be the true story of wolves,” Roberts said.
“The general trends are telling the story of gradual growth followed by gradual decline,” Roberts added.
 Reporting Idaho’s wolf population in May yields highest possible wolf population count due to birth of new pups

One of the effects of changing the population estimate to May is that the new reporting date will produce an estimate of the state’s wolf population at its highest level of the year due to the dynamics of Idaho’s wolf population.

“You might find this up and down pattern strange, but the reason for that up and down pattern is because wolves give birth to litters in April and May, and so that’s the very top of wolf abundance,” Mumma said during Thursday’s meeting. “And then through natural mortality and harvest (hunting), the wolf population slowly declines until the following April-May time period when they give birth to more wolves.”
Therefore any wolf population number from August would be expected to be lower than a population number taken in May, which would be expected to be higher.
The impact of changing the reporting time period does make a difference. 
During the July 2024 Idaho Fish and Game Commission meeting, Fish and Game officials estimated the state’s wolf population at 1,150 wolves as of Aug. 1, 2023. 
This year, Idaho Department of Fish and Game officials estimated the state’s wolf population at 1,235 wolves as of late May 2024.
State officials said there were actually fewer wolves in 2024 than in 2023 even though the raw number attached to the 2024 estimate is higher than the 2023 estimated population number the state released a year ago.
Separately, Roberts also said additional metrics and data added to the ABC method this year produced a revised, slightly higher wolf population estimate for August 2023 than the original 1,150 wolf estimate. Roberts was out of his office Friday and did not have the revised August 2023 estimate available while being interviewed by the Sun. Roberts pledged to follow up later next week or in the near future with additional information about revised estimates and the expanded ABC method.
Overall, Roberts said the department switched to the May population estimate with the latest wolf population report because that is the most accurate time period to report wolves under the new ABC model, which estimates the number of new wolf litters each year.
Idaho’s new population estimate is essentially tied to the time right after the last littler of wolves in the state is born each year.
“The reasoning why we are shifting to May is one of the things the ABC method is estimating is the litters that are produced,” Roberts said. “It is essentially estimating its population at its peak abundance, right after the peak of reproduction.”
Similarly, Roberts said state officials used the August time period for the old trail camera estimates because officials used the cameras during the months of July and August to collect pictures of wolves. Releasing a population estimate tied to Aug. 1 each year was the most accurate way to report the wolf population based on when the trail cam photos were taken, Roberts said. 
Some outside researchers have told the Idaho Capital Sun that the accuracy of the state’s wolf population estimate is extremely important with the state seeking to reduce its wolf population down to an average annual population of about 500 wolves. 
Mumma, the wildlife research manager for Fish and Game, told commissioners Thursday that the state recently submitted its new wolf population estimation methods to a peer-reviewed journal for publication consideration.

John Kane IV speak July 10, 2025, to the Stillwater Frontier Rotary Club. (Photo by Barbara Hoberock/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — After earning his graduate law degree from New York University, Brent Howard accepted a job in Oklahoma City.
But he quickly decided the long hours that came with practicing law in a metropolitan area wasn’t for him, and moved back to his hometown of Altus and the family farm.
“I didn’t feel I had the quality of life I wanted to pursue,” said Howard, who also serves as a Republican state senator. “I just felt a calling to be back home, work with my family and have my own practice.” 
Howard, who is also a fifth generation family farmer, is one of 40 attorneys who lives in Jackson County, a county of about 25,000 residents in southwestern Oklahoma. Neighboring Harmon County has four attorneys while Greer has just two.
The counties are among a growing number grappling with a shortage of lawyers, which experts say is requiring Oklahomans to travel further to obtain legal representation and creating access disparities between those who can afford attorneys and those who cannot. 
Howard said it also creates a conundrum for the state’s criminal defense process because defendants facing charges are constitutionally guaranteed the right to an attorney if they cannot afford one.
In all, an estimated 20 Oklahoma counties have been classified as a “legal desert,” meaning they have fewer than one licensed attorney for every 1,000 people, according to an Oklahoma Bar Association analysis. Another 29 had fewer than 1.5 lawyers per 1,000 residents, according to the group’s latest analysis. 
The shortage of lawyers is a national issue, but Oklahoma’s dearth has captured the attention of Oklahoma Supreme Court Vice-Chief Justice Dana Kuehn. She talked about the issue recently during a presentation to the Stillwater Frontier Rotary Club.
When people go to law school in Norman, Oklahoma City or Tulsa, many don’t return to practice in the rural communities they came from, Kuehn said after the meeting.
“It is called a drought in the rural communities,” she said.
While Oklahoma and Tulsa counties have thousands of practicing attorneys, others have fewer than a handful.
The problem is exacerbated by the fact that in Oklahoma, the state’s practicing attorneys are aging, said Dale Kenyon Williams Jr., Oklahoma Bar Association president. 
More of the organization’s members are now over 70 than under 30, he said.
He said most Oklahomans also cannot afford legal services, which has increased the number of people representing themselves in legal proceedings or who are relying instead on the internet or artificial intelligence for legal advice and assistance, Williams said. 
“In person interaction is absolutely the best way to establish a trusting relationship and work together to accomplish the client’s goals,” he said.
The cost of an education
Williams, who has practiced since 1977, said the skyrocketing cost of a legal education coupled with a bad reputation for the profession has contributed to the shortages. 
“Lawyers do much more than plaintiffs’ work,” said Marc Roark, University of Tulsa College of Law interim dean. “They do probate. They do family matters. They represent families when they find themselves in criminal problems. They represent school children as they are navigating the IEP (Individualized Education Program) process for accommodations in schools.”
He said the price of law school has gone up nationally.
The Education Data Initiative, which compiles statistics about higher education, reported in July that the average cost of law school is $217,480, which includes an average tuition cost of about $46,000 per year. In-state tuition rates at public university law schools increased nearly $1,300 between 2023 and 2024, the group found.  
The standard rate at the University of Tulsa for tuition is a little more than $30,000 a year, he said.
“Oklahoma law schools are some of the most affordable in the country, yet it is still a lot of money for most people,” said David Holt, dean of the Oklahoma City University School of Law.
Solutions
Holt said some other states have experimented with apprenticeship models as opposed to requiring attorneys to pass the bar exam.
“Some find that attractive and might make a commitment to practice in underserved areas in exchange for that opportunity,” said Holt, who is also the mayor of Oklahoma City.
Solving the problem could also involve assistance with education, teaching students at an earlier age about the profession and making office space and establishing a practice more affordable for young attorneys, said Williams, president of the state bar.

Legal professionals attending a Wyoming conference look to citizens to stand up for safety and independence of judges.
The post Judges, lawyers describe perils of attacking judiciary at Grand Teton National Park gathering appeared first on WyoFile .","Economic and community stability depend on an independent judiciary that fairly applies laws, key legal figures said Friday in Jackson Hole as they called on citizens to defend the rule of law.
“The rule of law is in jeopardy,” said Robert Henry, a former chief judge for the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals. During a four-day conference at Jackson Lake Lodge, Henry joined a chorus of judges and lawyers describing the peril of undermining the legal system that underpins a functioning society.  
When people take out mortgages or save money for college, for example, they’re banking on those long-term decisions being legally enforceable, said Richard Deane, Jr., president of the American College of Trial Lawyers, which organized the regional meeting.
The comments come at a time when the judiciary has increasingly come under fire by President Donald Trump and his allies, who have blamed judges for thwarting his policies. In Wyoming, some Republican lawmakers have hurled similar complaints.
In response to those attacks on the courts, the lawyers and judges on Friday’s panel emphasized that defending the rule of law, an independent judiciary and access to justice is a nonpartisan issue.
“So what is the rule of law?” Henry asked.
A former Oklahoma legislator and attorney general, he summed up how scholars answer that question. The law must be spelled out so people know it in advance. The law also must be public, clear, stable and certain, though it can change over time. 
“It must be applied equally,” he said. “The government also must follow the law.” And it requires an impartial, independent magistrate, he said.

“This is a fight,” Henry said, noting that he’s joined efforts to defend attorneys, under attack, via amicus briefs. That follows a career of asking attorneys to defend judges. 
“Judges have famously neither sword nor purse, but only judgment,” Henry said. “Hamilton said that. He’s a figure on Broadway,” he joked, lightening the mood in the room. 
But threats to judges are deadly serious, fellow panelist and former Wyoming Gov. Mike Sullivan said, holding up a photo of a “wanted” poster of judges displayed outside the office of U.S. Rep. Andy Ogles, a Tennessee Republican. 
“The Federal Bar Association wrote a letter to his office protesting this and expressing the concern that everyone in this country should have about the safety and independence of judges and what this kind of conduct does to the rule of law,” Sullivan, a lawyer himself, warned. 
As Sullivan sees it, the administration and Congress are ignoring the rule of law, and the U.S. Supreme Court is looking the other way. 
“It is the citizens that are going to have to do something if it’s going to be corrected,” Sullivan said. “If we can’t avoid the cliff we’re walking toward.”
Retired Wyoming Supreme Court Chief Justice Mike Golden said he and others in Wyoming’s legal profession are publicly defending the rule of law. Golden and Sullivan were among more than 100 members of Wyoming’s legal community who called on the state’s congressional delegation to condemn attacks on the judiciary. 
“Obviously, that’s the best thing that we can do is speak out at every opportunity in our local communities,” Golden said.
But he expressed frustration with Wyoming’s congressional delegation for describing Wyoming jurists as “biased and liberal.”
“How in the world can that be?” he asked, questioning how following the U.S. Constitution could be deemed liberal and biased. 
“And how do you respond to that?” Golden asked. “How do you get through to them?”
Sen. John Barrasso isn’t a lawyer, he noted, but Rep. Harriet Hageman and Sen. Cynthia Lummis are both attorneys, required by their profession to take an oath to defend and uphold the state and U.S. constitutions, Golden said. Golden himself has taken that oath as a lawyer, military officer and judge.
“I think in my own life, I take that oath every damn day,” Golden said. “It’s hard for me not to get angry, and I’m sure it is for all of you.” 
But he added the anger has to be tempered and directed to the right audience — not congressional representatives, who respond only with form letters. 
“All we can do is speak truth to power and do it responsibly,” Golden said. “I’ll continue to do that as long as I’m able.”
“We need to defend all of those who wear the robe.”Retired Judge William Downes 
Former U.S. District Chief Court Judge William Downes of Wyoming echoed Golden’s call to speak out to civic groups and churches and to stand up for judges. 
“It is truly a coward who attacks a judge,” Downes said. “Because a judge has to stay in his or her chambers and be silent.” Cases come to the judges; they don’t seek them out, he noted. 
Downes also pointed to Judge Esther Salas, who pursued legislation to enhance security for judges nationwide after a gunman killed her only child and wounded her husband in a 2020 attack aimed at her. 
“That woman needs to be honored, and we need to defend her,” Downes said. “We need to defend all of those who wear the robe.”

Lester Training Center in Oklahoma City on July 17. (Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)The Oklahoma Highway Patrol needs to take a hard look at themselves in the rearview mirror and figure out their priorities.
Because even as the state agency was planning to no longer patrol interstates in our state’s most populous cities to prioritize resources in rural areas, the Highway Patrol was posting pictures on social media of their patrol vehicles parked in a field of bison, begging people to vote for them so they could be included in the American Association of State Troopers’ calendar. 
They were urging Oklahomans to “Train with a Trooper” by exercising with them at three locations this month. They were celebrating leading a July 4 parade in Owasso. They were highlighting how they used their resources to support “drone detection” during an airshow at Tinker Air Force Base.
Yet, they suddenly want us to believe that they don’t have enough resources to patrol the interstates in Oklahoma City, Tulsa, Edmond, Moore, Norman, Midwest City and Del City. They’re expecting those municipal police departments to pick up their slack by Nov. 1, so they can instead focus on areas that have a smaller law enforcement footprint.
The switcheroo, they said, allows the Highway Patrol to adapt to the “evolving needs of our state.”
I suspect this is not in response to the “evolving needs of our state,” but instead “the evolving needs” of what the Highway Patrol wants to spend its time doing versus what they’re supposed to be doing, which is to patrol state highways and interstates across Oklahoma.
After all, it’s a lot more fun to take pictures with bison than it is to stop drug traffickers. It’s more fun to stop errant drones than it is to comfort a child who was rescued from human trafficking during a traffic stop along Interstate 40. And I’m sure it feels good to win popularity contests because theirs is a really tough job.
We’re paying some troopers as much as $95,194.57 a year (according to the agency’s own Facebook post) to stop drug and human traffickers, respond to highway wrecks and enforce the rules of the road.
The Oklahoma Highway Patrol touts its “rich heritage” of “proudly protecting Oklahomans since 1937.” It notes that the majority of its troopers are assigned to patrol the state’s 111,994 miles of “city, county and state-maintained roads and highways.”
The Highway Patrol argues that they are several hundred troopers short of what’s needed to patrol Oklahoma. But instead of asking lawmakers to give them more money, they unilaterally made the decision to not to “grow state government” and to prioritize some taxpayers at the expense of others.
The logic appears to be that if they have to ignore anyone, it ought to be over a third of Oklahomans who live in urban and suburban communities and who pay to maintain local police departments.
How is that equitable? If this is so great, why did the Highway Patrol drop this bombshell now instead of during the legislative session?
Nobody deserves to go without, but it makes zero sense for an agency that is aptly named the “Highway Patrol” to stop patrolling sections of several of the most traveled highways in our state, including Interstate 40 and Interstate 35. 
As the Del City Police Chief Loyd Berger told television station KOCO, this move takes away from the citizens who live within his jurisdiction. Rep. Ross Ford, R-Broken Arrow, a former Tulsa Police officer, said his previous employer can fill the void, but “shouldn’t have to.”
Residents in those seven cities don’t pay their cops to routinely investigate fatal accidents along I-35, pull over 18-wheelers or spend copious amounts of time directing traffic during accidents along interstates. They’re already supposed to be paying for a dedicated state law enforcement agency to do that.
If the Highway Patrol wants to shirk this much responsibility, then it would be reasonable to cut their budget in proportion next year, and allocate those funds to the local municipalities that are suddenly stuck doing their job.
But figuring out that breakdown is going to be even more complicated because I suspect the Highway Patrol isn’t going to stop providing on-field security at the University of Oklahoma football games in Norman and participating in other special events in all those municipalities. That’s fun after all.
Troopers also still plan to patrol some urban roadways — the ones the Oklahoma Turnpike Authority pays them to.
Are we OK with the Highway Patrol becoming a pay-to-play agency that patrols some urban interstates, but only the ones where governmental entities pay them extra compensation?
This is not how law enforcement is supposed to work. It’s appalling that our top elected leaders are apparently OK with this.
Because as I write this, there’s not been a peep of public opposition from Republicans Gov. Kevin Stitt, House Speaker Kyle Hilbert, of Bristow, and Senate President Pro Tem Lonnie Paxton, of Tuttle. Maybe that’s because two of them live in areas that benefit from the transition and the third has his own police force to protect him?
Attorney General Gentner Drummond, meanwhile, has been asked to weigh in on this debacle. It’s going to be really telling to see how this 2026 gubernatorial contender weighs in.
Because if this favoritism is allowed to slide, I fear it’s only a matter of time before the Highway Patrol feels emboldened to abandon its coverage in other areas that have their own police forces.
Maybe if the Highway Patrol wants to cut back somewhere, they should start by stopping responding to calls on all city and country roads that aren’t designated highways except in the most dire emergencies.
They’re named the “Highway Patrol” for a reason. Perhaps they should get back to the job we’re paying them to do.

(Photo by Sean Gallup/Getty Images)LINCOLN — County officials and advocates for rural development cried foul over recent changes in a federal initiative to expand access to high-speed internet, saying they will force thousands in rural Nebraska to settle for second-rate broadband.
Take Seward County, just outside of Lincoln, for example.
County Commissioner Misty Ahmic of Milford was part of a county task force dedicated to bringing high-speed internet to so-called “dark territories” in the county. It spent four years holding town hall meetings, polling local residents about their internet service and challenging inaccuracies in a federal map showing where the internet is supposedly high speed.
That work identified 1,724 locations in Seward County that would be eligible for federal grants to help companies bring broadband service to areas deemed too expensive to serve, without government help.
Changing programs
But much of that work, in one advocate’s words, went “poof” after the task force was informed about new changes in the Broadband Equity, Access and Deployment (BEAD) Act to cut costs. Now, only 629 locations in Seward County are eligible for a portion of the $405 million in grants available in Nebraska.
Statewide, the changes have disqualified more than half of the nearly 30,000 locations identified initially as eligible BEAD grants because they were locations unserved or underserved by high-speed internet.

In addition, the priority was changed – instead of prioritizing more reliable, easily upgraded fiber optic service, BEAD now gives more deference to cheaper-to-build alternatives, including satellite service like Elon Musk’s Starlink or fixed wireless.
The sudden change, as the BEAD grants were about to be awarded, has county and state officials scrambling to understand what’s left and if there’s a chance to make more areas — once deemed eligible — eligible again.
More than half of the state’s 93 county boards have signed onto letters to federal officials objecting to the changes.
“It’s very frustrating. We have all these holes in our county, and BEAD was going to bring service to those areas,” Ahmic said.
Fears of two-tiered system
Oliver Borchers-Williams of the Lincoln-based Southeast Nebraska Development District said the changes promise to set up a “two-tiered system,” where state-of-the-art fiber is easily available in urban areas, but in some rural areas, only less-reliable wireless and satellite service is available.
“It’s technology that wouldn’t cut it in a city, but we’re saying it’s good enough for rural areas,” said Borchers-Williams, who saw hundreds of locations in his 16-county area deemed ineligible.
BEAD was adopted during the Biden Administration, which touted the $42.5 billion program as “internet for all” and the final solution to bring affordable, high-speed internet services to even the most remote and hard-to-serve areas of the country.
At the time, Biden said broadband service was as important as bringing electricity to every home decades ago. Having high-speed internet is essential in running a business, as well as for advanced “precision agriculture” increasingly used by farmers and to provide a reliable link with medical providers via tele-health. Ask a gamer if they’d rather have fiber.
Funding set aside
Nebraska was allocated $405 million to expand broadband, but officials now say that probably only about half of that outlay will be spent under the new rules.
“There’s a lot of frustration out here,” said State Sen. Tom Brandt of Plymouth, who saw hundreds of previously eligible locations deemed ineligible for upgrades due to the recent changes.
There have been several federal and state initiatives to help fund the expansion of broadband into areas companies deem too expensive and too sparsely settled to serve. But one state effort, the $20 million-a-year Broadband Bridge program, was eliminated by Gov. Jim Pillen due to state budget problems.
Earlier this month, state and local officials learned of the extent of the changes ordered in June by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), eliminating thousands of locations in Nebraska.
The NTIA billed the changes as cutting billions of dollars in spending, reducing paperwork, eliminating labor requirements and overall “ending Biden’s broadband burdens.”
Officials here said that the changes did eliminate some unnecessary red tape but that they were mostly aimed at cutting spending, a top priority of the Trump Administration. It also opened the way for less-reliable “unlicensed fixed wireless” service to be counted as “serving” an area with broadband and opened the way for those providers to bid for grants. The bottom line, they said, is less reliable, slower internet.
“Cost is the only thing that matters now,” said Borchers-Williams.
Said Ahmic, “Now it’s let’s get it done as cheaply as possible and as quickly as possible.”

Costs vs. investments
To be sure, stringing a mile of fiber optic cable can cost between $5,000 to $20,000, according to industry estimates, which is much more expensive than sending an internet signal from a tower or satellite. Stringing fiber to some remote customers could cost up to $45,000, and the initial state plans called for some sites to be served by technologies other than fiber due to the high cost.
But, advocates say, fiber internet is much more reliable (especially in bad weather), provides higher speeds and can be “scaled” even higher as technology improves. Unlicensed fixed wireless service, they say, can be slowed during certain times of the day, or slowed because someone has used up most of their data.
“If you’re a gamer, you’d rather use fiber than a low-orbit satellite,” said Tip O’Neill, president of the Nebraska Telecommunications Association.

Federal and state officials say they’re working with the NTIA to learn what, if any, latitude Nebraska now has in deploying BEAD funds.
“We are currently gathering and analyzing data to evaluate all the options afforded to us through the new BEAD guidance,” said Patrick Haggerty, the state’s broadband office chief, in an email response to questions.
He added that “deploying a diverse set of technologies has always been essential” in reaching broadband to all Nebraskans.
Officials weigh in
A spokeswoman for U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), via email, said that the senator recognizes how essential high-quality internet service is to Nebraska and especially rural areas. She said the senator is working with the NTIA “to ensure Nebraska retains as much decision-making authority as possible in the agency’s evaluation of our subgrantee selection.”
Candace Meredith, deputy director with the Nebraska Association of County Officials, said her organization is reaching out to federal officials in hopes that fiber can be deployed to more locations.
“This is a huge economic driver for our rural communities,” Meredith said, adding that months of work local officials did to identify eligible areas went “poof.”
Borchers-Williams added that the changes will reduce jobs in the state, citing the recent layoff of 70 workers in the state by Lincoln-based ALLO, a fiber-optic internet provider.
O’Neill, who represents fiber optic internet providers, said you can “never say never” about changes in regulations and programs.
But Ahmic and Borchers-Williams are less optimistic. BEAD, they said, was viewed as the final solution to connect rural areas to good internet. But the recent changes mean that isn’t going to happen.
“I think we’re still going to have to wrestle with inadequate connectivity in rural Nebraska,” Borchers-Williams said. “This isn’t going to fix it.”

(Photo by Shauneen Miranda/States Newsroom)CAMP at the University of Idaho is closed, at least for now.
This isn’t a baseball, church or a recreational camp, this is the College Assistance for Migrants Program, a federally sponsored program which helps migrant farm workers enter and stay in college.
On June 30, UI’s CAMP grant ended without renewal, forcing closure of a key higher education program in a heavily agricultural state. In 2022 (the last year with available numbers), there were 61,828 migrant farm workers in Idaho or roughly 72 percent of all farm workers in the state.
UI did reapply, but to date the U.S. Department of Education has yet to renew or continue any existing or renewing grants.
“While we remain hopeful that funding will be renewed, the U.S. Department of Education has not yet provided an official timeline for when that might occur,” CAMP director Evelina Arevalos said.
To be clear, each student in CAMP must either be a U.S. citizen or a permanent resident. The applicants must also have spent 75 days working in agriculture doing seasonal/migrant work during a two-year period and be qualified under the federal Workforce Investment Act.
According to the federal program, CAMP projects help farm workers complete their first year in college. The assistance includes tutoring, career counseling, academic skill building, health services and exposure to cultural events, academic programs and other educational activities not normally available to migrant workers.
For those who ask, yes – farm workers, especially migrants, usually do not have access to academic services in high school that non-farm workers take for granted. If one is out working in a field or in a dairy, they are generally out of high school, eliminating any access to after school activities or additional services (such as college prep and counseling) offered for junior and seniors. This puts them behind the curve when they enter higher education.
Why would a farm worker want to attend college? For many reasons, not the least of which is financial. In Idaho, the average salary of a migrant farm worker is $31,225 a year. That generally does not include insurance and other benefits. A college education can help raise a family into a better job and income bracket.
For people who have the talent and desire for a specific profession. A college education can help them achieve their dream, whether it be a business professional, teacher, artist, scientist or any number of professions.
Where are Idaho’s migrant farm workers? While they work in all agribusiness fields, dairy is Idaho’s largest migrant farm worker employer. The Idaho Dairymen’s Association numbers show 90 percent of all dairy workers in the state are foreign born and Spanish speaking. Of the 90 percent, 78 percent are from Mexico and 11 percent are from Central America; the remaining 11 percent are from the U.S.
Not all those workers are undocumented. Last year the UI McClure Center for Public Policy reported an estimated 35,000 migrant farm workers are unauthorized and that group contributes roughly $570 million in available spending and they paid $26.3 million in sales, property and state income taxes. National trends show the number of unauthorized workers are on the decline although Idaho’s population seems to be remaining stable.
No matter their legal status, it is migrant farm workers who play a key role in Idaho’s agricultural economy as well as the state’s construction and hospitality industries, often doing hard, thankless jobs others are unwilling to do. As a state highly dependent on agribusiness, it makes sense to try to keep those workers in state.
Therein lies the rub with the loss of the CAMP grant. Migrant farm workers could decide to leave the state for other areas if they cannot receive the help they need to attend college. That would be a massive blow to the state’s agribusiness industries, especially dairy.
In the meantime, the UI grant is gone, two CAMP employees have been reassigned and the director is phasing out the program for any incoming students.
UI needs help in reestablishing that grant, and it would be a major step up if the state’s congressional delegation were to assist in bringing the money back to Idaho. After all, the people who qualify for the program are not only working hard jobs for the benefit of the state, they are also U.S. citizens or permanent residents who could use a hand up rather hand a handout.

Andy Ogles to seek federal funding for a feasibility study. (Photo: John Partipilo)A group pushing to resurrect decades-old plans to build a dam on the Duck River in Columbia is working with U.S. Rep. Andy Ogles to secure congressional funding to fast-track a feasibility study.
Columbia Dam Now’s goal is evident in their name: they want the federal government to fund the reconstruction of the Columbia Dam (which was halted in the 1980s and eventually dismantled in 1990s) as soon as possible.
A spokesperson for Ogles confirmed he is “actively working” with U.S. Rep. Chuck Fleischmann — a fellow Tennessee Republican and chairman of energy and water appropriations — and the House Appropriations Committee to “explore what steps can be taken at a federal level to allow for a dam to be built along the Duck River.” 
A feasibility study would be the first step of that process. The spokesperson did not address questions about the amount of funding being sought or a decision timeline.
Proponents position the dam as the only way to secure a source of affordable drinking water for fast-growing southern Middle Tennessee and tout the economic development potential of creating a lake in Columbia. Opponents aren’t buying it.
“Don’t Dam the Duck,” a group formed with the help of social media in response to the dam campaign, contends that the project would have detrimental environmental impacts to the already at-risk river, which is recognized as a Class II scenic waterway in Tennessee and the most biodiverse freshwater river in North America. They also have concerns about the dam’s feasibility and what land would be seized to complete the project.
The Columbia Dam is a sensitive subject for the Maury County community, members of which saw their family’s land taken by the government when the dam was greenlit in the 1960s.
The initial dam project ran into several snags, including a lawsuit over environmental impacts, the addition of two mussel species present in the Duck to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s endangered species list, landowner lawsuits, a rising price tag, permitting issues with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and a cost-benefit analysis that left scrapping the dam as the project’s strongest positive benefit, according to a 200-page Congressional report on the project published in 1980 and a historical summary from the Duck River Development Agency.

Construction on the dam was ultimately halted in 1983, when the concrete portion of it was 92% complete and earth work was about 60% complete. TVA had purchased around 45% of the land planned for the entire project.
“TVA has no plans at this time to build a new dam or reservoir in our seven-state region. TVA will continue to work with federal, state and local partners to help ensure there is sufficient water supply for communities along the Duck River,” TVA spokesperson Scott Brooks wrote in an email.
Partnership created by Gov. Bill Lee reviewing regional water options
At a public meeting hosted by Columbia Dam Now on July 15, some attendees referred to the ongoing work of the Duck River Watershed Planning Partnership, a 19-person advisory group created by Gov. Bill Lee to shape a plan for the Duck River’s preservation and the fulfillment of regional water needs. That board has met twice and plans to release its first report to the state on Nov. 20.
The Duck River Conservancy, a coalition of landowners dedicated to preserving the river, opposes the revival of the dam project, with Chairman Doug Jones stating it “would completely undercut the Governor’s commitment to preserving the Duck River watershed.” The group cited concerns over ongoing water waste by utilities, drought, and environmental impacts.
Columbia Dam Now is headed by Jerry Bridenbaugh, an attorney and Maury County commissioner, and Jason Gilliam, a member of the Maury County Water System board and chair of the Maury County Republican Party.
Gilliam said he respects the Planning Partnership’s process but intends to hold the group accountable to providing a solution for affordable water. He dismisses other ideas — including a potential pipeline to bring water from the larger Cumberland River — as prohibitively expensive and “asinine.”
“What some people don’t seem to understand and can’t wrap their heads around is the fact that the ability to attain affordable water for us here in the southern counties of Middle Tennessee is gone if we don’t build this dam,” he said.
Sarah Gilliam, a member of the Don’t Dam the Duck group (and distantly related to Jason Gilliam by marriage), disagrees. She said it’s not clear whose property might be taken if the project were to move forward, and questions remain about related infrastructure costs and legal obstacles.
“There are stakeholders in our community who believe that, based on data and research and known information, that having the dam is not the only feasible option,” Sarah Gilliam said. “We understand that people are frustrated and they need water now. But no matter what you do, it’s going to take time, and there’s a partnership very well-suited to do this work, and we would like to see them finish this work and hear what they’ve come up with.”
The Mallory Valley Utility District, which serves more than 5,000 customers in the Franklin, Brentwood and Cool Springs area, is in the process of completing a feasibility study for the pipeline, including its estimated cost, that is slated to conclude this fall.
Columbia Dam Now has spent the last several months collecting non-binding resolutions from various county and city governments in the area to take to congressional leaders as a show of support, Jason Gilliam said. The Columbia City Council and Maury County Commission are among the entities to pass such resolutions.
Should the congressional funding for the feasibility study receive approval, the study could shed light on the proposed footprint of the lake, the modern cost of building a dam in Columbia and the project’s potential benefits and drawbacks for surrounding communities.",https://tennesseelookout.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Duck-River-010-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-07-21 06:56:19.038276

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)Congress set aside $50 billion for rural hospitals and medical providers to allay fears over the billions more in historic cuts to federal health care spending that President Donald Trump signed into law on Independence Day.
But is that bandage big enough to save struggling rural hospitals?
“I have more questions than I have answers,” said Alan Morgan, CEO of the National Rural Health Association, a nonprofit policy group. “No one has those answers yet.”
Morgan noted that the new money for rural health, to be spent over five years, is far less than the $155 billion in rural Medicaid spending cuts over 10 years, as estimated by KFF, a nonprofit health policy and research group.
Experts, hospital leaders and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle fear that Trump’s signature legislation will particularly gut rural hospitals and clinics, which see an outsize share of patients who are insured through Medicaid, the federal-state public health insurance for people with low incomes. The new law slashes more than $1 trillion from Medicaid over the next 10 years to help pay for tax cuts that disproportionately benefit the wealthy.
States scramble to shield hospitals from GOP Medicaid cuts
The $50 billion addition was an effort by Republican leaders in Congress to win the votes of colleagues within their party who initially balked at supporting such steep cuts to Medicaid and other health services.
In the U.S. Senate, the rural program helped secure the vote of Alaska moderate Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who expressed concern about the law’s impact on health care in her state. About 1 in 3 Alaskans are insured through Medicaid.
Jared Kosin, the president and CEO of the Alaska Hospital & Healthcare Association, said he’s deeply frustrated with the new law’s gutting of Medicaid funding, which he thinks will wreak lasting damage on Alaskans. And Republicans sidestepped potential solutions by just throwing money into a program, he said.
“It’s frustrating in the public realm when decisions like this are made fast and, frankly, carelessly,” he said.
“The consequences are going to fall on us, not them.”
More than half of the law’s cuts to funding in rural areas are concentrated in 12 states with large rural populations that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act to cover more people, according to KFF: Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania and Virginia.
Some GOP lawmakers in Congress have heralded the $50 billion rural program as a health care victory. But it’s still unclear which hospitals, clinics and other providers would receive money and how much.
How it works
The Rural Health Transformation Program will dole out $10 billion annually from fiscal years 2026 through 2030.
States must apply for their funding by the end of this year, submitting a detailed plan on how it would be used.
The law outlines some ways that states can use the money, according to an analysis of the legislation from the Bipartisan Policy Center:

Making payments to rural hospitals to help them maintain essential services such as emergency room care or labor and delivery.
Recruiting and training rural doctors, nurses and other health workers.
Bolstering emergency medical services such as ambulances and EMTs.
Using new technologies, including telehealth.
Providing opioid use disorder treatment and mental health services.
Improving preventive care and chronic disease management.

Half of the $10 billion each year will be distributed evenly across states that have applied for it. The other half can be distributed by the administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services — currently Dr. Mehmet Oz — at his discretion, based on a state’s rural population and rural health facilities.
Although the program doesn’t replace the amount states are likely to lose, Morgan said it’s still an opportunity to rethink how rural health care is funded. He’d like to see states given flexibility in how they’re able to use the funds, and he hopes they focus on keeping rural communities healthy through preventive care while still helping hospitals keep their doors open.
“If done correctly, it could really change the future course for rural America,” Morgan said. “That is such a tough ask, though.”
Hardest hit
Kentucky could take the biggest hit from the new law’s reduction in rural Medicaid funding, losing an estimated $12 billion over 10 years, according to a KFF analysis.
Tracking Medicaid patients’ work status may prove difficult for states
The state’s Medicaid department is still waiting for additional federal guidance to understand how the state’s program will be affected, Kendra Steele, spokesperson with the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services, told Stateline in a statement.
“Over 1.4 million Kentuckians rely on Medicaid — including half of all children in our state, seniors and more vulnerable populations — and the passage of legislation on the federal level will have serious impacts for those individuals, rural health care and hospitals and local economies,” she wrote.
Even with the new program, states across the country will have to reevaluate their budgets in light of the cuts, said Hemi Tewarson, executive director at the National Academy for State Health Policy, a nonpartisan group that supports states in developing health care policies.
“Every region is slightly different and there’s not a one-size-fits-all approach,” she said. “Hospital ownership varies [as well as] the types of services that are critical for the community where they’re located. They have to think about new ways to provide those services in a context with fewer resources.”
About 44% of rural hospitals are operating in the red, according to a KFF analysis of Rand Hospital Data, a higher share than the 35% of hospitals in urban areas.
‘Rural at heart’
Prior to the bill’s passage, Oz attempted to reassure U.S. House Republicans that their districts could get money from the program even if they weren’t specifically rural, Politico reported earlier this month.




We’re all rural at heart when it comes to money.


– Alan Morgan, CEO of the National Rural Health Association



Pennsylvania Republican U.S. Rep. Rob Bresnahan said money would begin flowing to his district as early as the beginning of next year, telling the Wilkes-Barre Times Leader earlier this month that he met with Trump, Oz and others to secure pledges that hospitals in his district could access the fund. He represents the northeastern corner of Pennsylvania, which includes suburban and rural areas, as well as the cities of Scranton and Wilkes-Barre.
Though the legislation includes guidelines on which facilities or areas qualify as “rural,” Morgan, of the National Rural Health Association, expects a mad dash from lawmakers and providers to claim rural status in order to get a piece of the funding.
“That’s going to be a huge issue — defining who’s rural,” Morgan said. “We’re all rural at heart when it comes to money.”

But is that bandage big enough to save struggling rural hospitals?
“I have more questions than I have answers,” said Alan Morgan, CEO of the National Rural Health Association, a nonprofit policy group. “No one has those answers yet.”
Morgan noted that the new money for rural health, to be spent over five years, is far less than the $155 billion in rural Medicaid spending cuts over 10 years, as estimated by KFF, a nonprofit health policy and research group.
Experts, hospital leaders and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle fear that Trump’s signature legislation will particularly gut rural hospitals and clinics, which see an outsize share of patients who are insured through Medicaid, the federal-state public health insurance for people with low incomes. The new law slashes more than $1 trillion from Medicaid over the next 10 years to help pay for tax cuts that disproportionately benefit the wealthy.
States scramble to shield hospitals from GOP Medicaid cuts

The $50 billion addition was an effort by Republican leaders in Congress to win the votes of colleagues within their party who initially balked at supporting such steep cuts to Medicaid and other health services.
In the U.S. Senate, the rural program helped secure the vote of Alaska moderate Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who expressed concern about the law’s impact on health care in her state. About 1 in 3 Alaskans are insured through Medicaid.
Jared Kosin, the president and CEO of the Alaska Hospital & Healthcare Association, said he’s deeply frustrated with the new law’s gutting of Medicaid funding, which he thinks will wreak lasting damage on Alaskans. And Republicans sidestepped potential solutions by just throwing money into a program, he said.
“It’s frustrating in the public realm when decisions like this are made fast and, frankly, carelessly,” he said.
“The consequences are going to fall on us, not them.”
More than half of the law’s cuts to funding in rural areas are concentrated in 12 states with large rural populations that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act to cover more people, according to KFF: Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania and Virginia.
Some GOP lawmakers in Congress have heralded the $50 billion rural program as a health care victory. But it’s still unclear which hospitals, clinics and other providers would receive money and how much.

 How the Rural Health Transformation Program works

The Rural Health Transformation Program will dole out $10 billion annually from fiscal years 2026 through 2030.
States must apply for their funding by the end of this year, submitting a detailed plan on how it would be used.
The law outlines some ways that states can use the money, according to an analysis of the legislation from the Bipartisan Policy Center:

Making payments to rural hospitals to help them maintain essential services such as emergency room care or labor and delivery.
Recruiting and training rural doctors, nurses and other health workers.
Bolstering emergency medical services such as ambulances and EMTs.
Using new technologies, including telehealth.
Providing opioid use disorder treatment and mental health services.
Improving preventive care and chronic disease management.

Half of the $10 billion each year will be distributed evenly across states that have applied for it. The other half can be distributed by the administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services — currently Dr. Mehmet Oz — at his discretion, based on a state’s rural population and rural health facilities.

Barton has […[...]","(The 74 photo illustration)Political operative David Barton held up a thick Bible with years of wear on its dark brown cover and proclaimed its pages put Protestant Christianity at the center of the country’s very foundation.
“This is actually printed by the official printer of Congress,” said Barton, a best-selling author and influential far-right Christian nationalist. Barton has spent the last 40 years arguing that the separation of church and state is a myth — and has built a multimillion-dollar media and lobbying operation to influence public opinion and shape laws around the belief that the United States was founded as a Judeo-Christian nation.
At this particular hearing in April, Barton appeared before the Texas House education committee and testified in favor of legislation, since signed into law, requiring that posters of the Ten Commandments be placed inside every classroom in the state’s nearly 9,100 public schools by September. With him, Barton brought a small collection of books he claims were foundational to the country’s public education system until the 20th Century.
Barton isn’t just a primary pitchman for the Ten Commandments law in Texas, his home state, an investigation by The 74 reveals. His fingerprints appear on 28 bills that have cropped up before the legislatures in 18 states this year. A data analysis of the bills exposes how their language, structure and requirements are inherently identical. In dozens of instances, they match model legislation pitched by Barton verbatim.

At the Texas hearing, Barton’s eyes fixated on the cover of the rare 1782 Aitken Bible.
“It also says it’s ‘a neat Edition of the Holy Scriptures for the use of schools,’” he continued. “It has the Ten Commandments.”
In actuality, Barton lifted language from Philadelphia printer Robert Aitken calling on Congress to sanction a Bible that could also be for “the use of schools.” Christian nationalists have for years  falsely claimed the Revolutionary-era printing includes a government promotion of Christianity. Barton has long been accused of taking historical quotes out of context, and in 2012, the Christian publisher of his bestselling book on Thomas Jefferson ceased its production because “basic truths just were not there.”
Texas is one of three states in the last two years to pass a law requiring that the Ten Commandments be posted in public schools. The mandates are part of a coordinated nationwide effort to overturn a 1980 Supreme Court ruling forbidding Kentucky from requiring Ten Commandments displays in classrooms.
As the influence of Barton and the burgeoning Christian nationalist movement find favor in state legislatures, the White House and with U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson — who cites Barton as a “profound influence” — the lobbyists and lawmakers behind the state Ten Commandments bills told The 74 they’re confident the current Supreme Court’s conservative super-majority is on their side, too.

 

The analysis by The 74 reveals how language in virtually every state bill matches model legislation created by Project Blitz, a Barton-steered Christian “bill mill” that’s long flooded statehouses  with legislative templates that promote Christianity in public schools, legalize discrimination against LGBTQ+ people and restrict abortion.
A dozen bills specify, for example, that the Ten Commandments displays must be hung in a “conspicuous” location. Another 11 specify they should be at least 11-by-14 inches in size. Nearly all of the bills — 25 — mandate a Christian version of the religious and ethical directives be displayed as a “poster or framed.” The 74 tallied 96 instances where bills introduced this year match Project Blitz’s model legislation, including template bills to require the Ten Commandments or the phrase “In God We Trust” in public schools.
Among the architects of Project Blitz is the Barton-founded influence machine, WallBuilders. The flurry of state bills were introduced after WallBuilders — the name is an Old Testament reference to rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem —  convened its annual national conference of state legislators in November where the model legislation was promoted.
After Louisiana passed its first-in-the-nation Ten Commandments law last year, new mandates approved in Arkansas and Texas this year follow the same Project Blitz template.

 ‘No such thing as separation of God and government’

Texas state Sen. Mayes Middleton is the joint author of  the state’s new Ten Commandments law and the author of another new law permitting a daily prayer period and Bible readings in public schools statewide. Republican Gov. Greg Abbott signed both in June.
  Texas Sen. Mayes Middleton
Middleton, whose district southeast of Houston includes his hometown of Galveston, acknowledged Barton’s influence over not just his own legislative agenda, but Texas’ broader conservative movement. Barton previously served as vice chair of the state Republican Party.
“Of course, WallBuilders is very supportive of the bill,” Middleton told The 74, as were the conservative legal groups Alliance Defending Freedom and the First Liberty Institute. “And, of course, all of their missions is to advance religious liberties, especially in the public realm where there is no such thing as separation of God and government.”
Founded by Barton in 1988, WallBuilders promotes theories — discredited by serious scholars — about Christianity’s central role in the formation of the United States through its podcasts, books and a museum with “one of the largest private collections of United States historical documents.”

Through WallBuilders’ lobbying arm, the Pro-Family Legislative Network, Barton leads direct outreach to lawmakers and educators at its annual conferences at a four-star waterfront resort in suburban Dallas. It was at this gathering where Indiana Rep. J.D. Prescott, a Republican, got the idea for Ten Commandments legislation in his state, he told The 74.
Prescott proposed a bill  requiring a “durable poster or framed picture” of the commandments in each library and classroom at all public schools statewide. The legislation ultimately failed to garner support. Bills in other states also failed to gain traction, including in South Dakota where the bill’s critics — including some Republicans — said a government mandate was the wrong way to spread Christianity and ran afoul of the Constitution.
“Our early common school system was really designed to teach biblical principles in the Bible, so it’s just getting back to that point,” said Prescott, who described himself as a “student of history.”
The Pro-Family Legislative conference offers lawmakers scholarships and discounted hotel rates to attend the event. In at least one instance,  a New Hampshire state lawmaker  filed a disclosure form reporting that he had received $859.47 from the Pro-Family Legislative Network, including $500 reimbursing him for air fare, to attend the November 2024 conference.
Prescott told The 74,  “I learned a lot of it at a WallBuilders conference hosted by David Barton. They’ve got a great conference for legislators down in Texas every November. I did look at the WallBuilders model legislation and it’s a good place to start.”
 Not everyone’s Ten Commandments

Experts said the bills seek to do more than require “durable” Ten Commandments posters in every public school classroom. The campaign is part of a broader, well-organized and deep-pocketed assault, they argue, on the separation of church and state.
Although WallBuilders isn’t required to disclose its donors, the nonprofit Center for Media and Democracy analyzed federal tax filings with the Internal Revenue Service to bring its finances into focus. In 2021, WallBuilders reported $5.9 million in revenue and $6.3 million in total assets.
The group relies heavily on donor-advised giving, a tax loophole that allows anonymous supporters across the political spectrum to contribute to contentious causes without scrutiny.  For example, donor-advised funds have been exploited by far-right activists to leverage global campaigns against the civil rights of women and the LGBTQ+ community, according to a 2023 investigation by openDemocracy.

Mercury One, a nonprofit founded by high-profile conservative pundit and media personality Glenn Beck, is both a WallBuilders donor and primary sponsor of Barton’s annual Pro-Family Legislative Conference to brief elected officials “on pressing issues from a constitutional perspective.”
Barton, who didn’t respond to multiple requests for comment, describes himself as a self-taught historian and the owner of the largest private collection of historical documents about the Founding Fathers. His critics pan the graduate of the Oral Roberts University as a discredited pseudohistorian and propagandist.
Barton is “the granddaddy of Christian nationalist disinformation,” constitutional attorney Andrew Seidel, who serves as vice president of strategic communications at Americans United for Separation of Church and State, told The 74.
  John Fea, Messiah University
John Fea, an American history professor and history department chair at Messiah University, a private evangelical Christian institution in Pennsylvania, accused Barton of cherry-picking historical information to present a misleading portrayal of the past, one that bolsters his own present-day political agenda.
“This is clearly an attempt by Christian nationalists to try to advance their own version of what America should be,” Fea said, noting that even as historians challenge Barton, he’s amassed influence among Republican lawmakers interested in leveraging a distorted accounting of history for political gain.
“Barton provides that history for these lawmakers. It adds a certain depth, even though it’s hollow.”
Darcy Hirsh, the senior director of government relations and advocacy at the nonprofit National Council for Jewish Women, said the Ten Commandments laws present an attack on “the strict wall of separation” between church and state.
“Any efforts to perpetuate the falsehood that the United States is a Christian nation is something that we find deeply alarming,” Hirsh said. Requiring a protestant Christian version of the Ten Commandments in schools, she said, is “exclusionary and coercive” to children from diverse backgrounds.
“A Protestant interpretation of the Ten Commandments is different than the Jewish interpretation of the Ten Commandments, in fact, they are numbered differently,” she said. Constitutional protections separating church and state, she said, are critical to the country’s democratic society.
“It’s that protection that has really allowed the Jewish community and other minority faith communities to flourish in the U.S.”

The laws successfully passed in Louisiana, Arkansas and Texas now face lawsuits from parents alleging they violate the separation of church and state. The issue could soon appear again before the nation’s highest court. In June, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans, among the nation’s most conservative, struck down Louisiana’s Ten Commandments display mandate, finding it “plainly unconstitutional.”

‘I Can’t Wait to Be Sued’: Louisiana Ten Commandments Law Not Just About Schools

 




Parents with diverse religious identities are being backed by the American Civil Liberties Union and Americans United for Separation of Church and State in challenging the laws. In a complaint filed in Arkansas, parents allege students will be “unconstitutionally coerced into religious observance” and “pressured to suppress their personal religious beliefs.”
Fea, the evangelical historian, told The 74 the far-right campaign isn’t about the Ten Commandments’ place in the nation’s founding but about advancing the influence of Christianity in society.
“They’re using this historical argument to disguise the fact that they believe that somehow — and I don’t know how this happens, by osmosis or whatever — a student sitting in a classroom where the Ten Commandments is displayed will somehow buy into those ideals and values and become more Christian,” he said.
 ‘The hostility is gone’

At the Texas House education committee hearing in April, Barton held up a second book. This one was much smaller than the first, but just as old and, Barton testified, just as significant.
Barton lectured the Republican-controlled state legislature on The New England Primer, a widely used Colonial-era reading text. The book, he said, drilled first graders with 43 questions about the Ten Commandments.
Then he introduced a third book, and a fourth.
“The courts have pointed to the Ten Commandments as the reason we have all types of laws,” Barton testified. “So there’s a lot of history and tradition for that document that’s not there for other documents.”

Barton’s prop-focused presentation isn’t just scripted — it’s well rehearsed. This year, the 71-year-old has traveled across the country with his books and a small team of collaborators to spread the gospel of Christian nationalism. Like the bills before the state legislatures, Barton’s speech was replicated again and again.
As Barton testified on the Ten Commandment bills nationally, legislative sponsors routinely parroted his talking points, not just about Christianity’s role in the country’s origin, but the Supreme Court’s support for their movement.
During his recent appearances in Nebraska and other states, Barton’s testimonies invoked the court’s 2022 opinion upholding the rights of a Washington state high school football coach to lead prayers with his team on the 50-yard line after games.

Supreme Court Backs School Coach Who Prayed on 50-Yard Line After Football Games

 




Prescott, the Indiana lawmaker, said he became interested in introducing his bill after learning of the implications of the coach’s Supreme Court victory.
To Barton and other members of his coalition, the court’s opinion in Kennedy v. Bremerton School District creates a clear path to require Ten Commandments in schools — and inject Christianity into other facets of public life — by proving they’re part of a longstanding traditional practice.
In finding for Coach Kennedy, the Supreme Court abandoned its 1971 opinion ruling that religious displays don’t violate the Constitution if they have significant secular or nonreligious purposes. The court’s new standard revolves around whether the religious displays are part of historical practices. In other words, the heart of Barton’s pitch.
“That is the new standard, so the hostility is gone,” he testified. “Showing that this is something that is longstanding practice, you go back to The New England Primer.”
 Bought and paid for — according to specs

Even as bill proponents championed states’ rights as one legal justification for their Ten Commandments display mandates, Middleton, the Texas legislative leader,  said there is a key benefit to the near-identical requirements in the bills across the 18 states.
“We just wanted uniformity in these displays. We thought that was important,” the oil company president and cattle rancher told The 74. “Obviously, these are primarily going to be donated as well, so it’s probably going to be primarily private funds funding these.”
Project Blitz model legislation devises a funding scheme that revolves around donated displays without the reliance on public funds — a provision that appears in 16 states’ bills. Others invoke the model legislation by encouraging donated displays, but broaden the mandate so schools are also free to spend taxpayer dollars to comply.
Mirroring the Project Blitz model legislation, the new Arkansas law requires the Ten Commandments display be composed of a “durable poster or framed copy” of the document and that it be “prominently” positioned in each public classroom and library across the state. The law also stipulates that the posters should be donated by outside groups, meaning the same private entities who had a hand in crafting the specifications, supporting the bills and getting them on legislators’ radars, will also be the ones buying the versions of the Ten Commandments that wind up in schools.

Even as the Louisiana law is caught up in federal court, religious groups who lobbied for the law’s passage and have close ties to the WallBuilders have plans to donate the displays set to appear in classrooms across the state.
In April, First Liberty Institute and The Louisiana Family Forum announced that Patriot Mobile, which describes itself as “America’s ONLY Christian conservative wireless provider,” had donated 3,000 Ten Commandments displays “as part of a project to provide, at no cost to the Louisiana taxpayer, displays in schools throughout Louisiana.”

(Contributed/Pure Dakota)Changes to North Dakota’s medical marijuana program aimed at expanding program access and product options for patients are set to go into effect Aug. 1.
The North Dakota Legislature passed a series of bills during the 2025 legislative session that changed the state’s medical marijuana laws. The new changes will allow for low-dose THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) edibles to be sold at medical dispensaries. The application process will change to allow patients easier access to the program for a longer time before needing to renew their medical cannabis cards.
House Bill 1203 will allow THC edible products to be included in the state’s medical marijuana program. The products must be hard or soft lozenges in a square shape that contain no more than 5 milligrams of THC per serving and no more than 50 milligrams in a package. Other food and beverages that contain THC will still not be allowed under the new law.
Jake Mittelsteadt, director of retail operations for Pure Dakota Health, a medical marijuana dispensary in Bismarck, said the new law allowing edible products to be sold to patients could be a gamechanger.
“Since day one of this program, the amount of people that joined the program, that come to the state, everybody, especially in the older demographics, their priorities have always been gummies and edibles,” Mittelsteadt said. 
Medical dispensaries have been able to carry other oral products, such as tinctures or capsules, but edibles are what patients prefer, he said.
“Having something simple, straightforward, accurate and safe that we can provide to patients as a non-inhalation method of administration is going to, in my opinion, completely revolutionize the program here in North Dakota,” Mittelsteadt said.

Like all of the state’s medical marijuana products, the edibles will be manufactured and processed in North Dakota. Production can’t begin until Aug. 1, so he said the new edibles should be on dispensary shelves by the end of August or early September.
There was some opposition to the changes. 
Stephanie Engebretson submitted testimony in opposition to the edibles bill on behalf of the Chiefs of Police Association of North Dakota. In her testimony, she said edibles are the THC product that children are most likely to consume and the edibles take longer to feel the product’s effect, which could cause some customers to take more doses and compound the effects.
She said the organization suggested the bill be amended to require edible products to be stored in a locked location when children are present and remove the flavoring of the edible product to ensure children do not find a flavor they enjoy, if they do encounter it.
None of the suggestions were included in the final version of the legislation.
Rep. Steve Vetter, R-Grand Forks, chief sponsor of the bill allowing edibles, said he was voted into the Legislature in 2016, the same election as the medical marijuana program ballot measure, which was approved with 64% of the statewide vote. During that campaign, he said he heard from multiple North Dakotans about their desire for edible products.
“This is a bigger deal, generally, for the elderly population,” Vetter said. He added the effects of edible products react differently in the body compared to other methods of delivery and can be beneficial for some ailments, like chronic pain.
Another change as a result of the bill will allow tele-health care providers to be used during an initial meeting to qualify a patient’s illness for a medical marijuana card. More than two dozen debilitating illnesses qualify for the medical cannabis program under state law.

Mittelsteadt said he believes removing the in-person visit hurdles will allow more potential patients into the medical marijuana program. Previously, tele-health appointments could only be used to renew a patient’s medical marijuana card.
He said the tele-health option is also important because some North Dakota health care providers have refused to issue chronic condition documentation for patients to obtain their cards. Mittelsteadt added there is no health care provider in Williston willing to meet with patients to obtain a medical marijuana card. The closest health care provider willing to work with potential medical marijuana patients in northwest North Dakota is in Watford City, he said.
“That certainly has gotten better over the years as people have become more comfortable with it (the program),” Mittelsteadt said. “But it has also been a gigantic pain point for us and for patients here in North Dakota.”
Jason Wahl, director of the medical marijuana program for the Department of Health and Human Services, said the state cannot force health care providers to participate in the medical marijuana application process.
“It is completely up to that health care provider. The department has no say in regards to that, nor should the department have a say in regards to what a health care provider is going to do with their patient,” Wahl said.
Another new law, Senate Bill 2294, will change the expiration dates of medical marijuana cards from one-year to two-year terms.
Vetter said the competition from recreational cannabis markets in neighboring Montana and Minnesota will be something lawmakers will need to continue to monitor to keep North Dakota’s medical marijuana program stable.
“That was a driving force this last time, essentially, if we don’t keep these places open, then what we have is a bunch of people breaking the law,” he said.

Mittelsteadt said Pure Dakota Health has retail locations in Williston, Bismarck and Fargo, but the Williston location has not seen as much of an increase in foot traffic over the last year. 
“Our Williston location is so close to the (Montana) border that we have some competition there,” he said. “But looking here in Bismarck, we’ve definitely seen a marketable growth in patient count over the last year. ”
According to the 2024 North Dakota medical marijuana annual report, more than 10,000 medical marijuana patient cards were issued by the state last year, including dozens of caregivers who are able to purchase medical marijuana for their patients who may not be able to go to a dispensary.
“While there was growth in the registered, qualifying patient population, that growth really leveled off a little while ago,” Wahl said.
Wahl said, after an initial allotment of general and special funds from the Legislature during the 2017-19 biennium to get their office up and running, the medical marijuan program’s budget has been completely covered by the permit and application fees.
North Dakota’s medical marijuana law became effective in 2017 and, by 2020, the medical cannabis dispensaries raked up $6.4 million in total sales. Sales tripled over the next two years, rising to $20 million in 2022, but have recently stabilized, totaling $22.4 million last year.
Under state law, North Dakota allows only two permitted manufacturing and processing facilities and eight retail dispensaries for the entire state.
Another bill set to take effect in August, Senate Bill 2293, will set the maximum container size for THC concentrate at 1 gram. It also allows those who are unable to receive North Dakota identification cards due to a medical condition to submit other documentation to qualify for the medical marijuana program. 
Mittelsteadt said the 2025 legislative session was a big step forward in preserving the medical marijuana program in North Dakota.
“This most recent legislative session has been the most promising, in terms of them saying, ‘Let’s do something to actually benefit the patients and actually benefit the program,’” Mittelsteadt said. “Let’s keep running with it. Listen to the feedback from the patients, listen to the feedback from the industry … just using common sense when we’re looking at this is going to be vital.”

(Scott Olson/Getty Images)Congress set aside $50 billion for rural hospitals and medical providers to allay fears over the billions more in historic cuts to federal health care spending that President Donald Trump signed into law on Independence Day.
But is that bandage big enough to save struggling rural hospitals?
“I have more questions than I have answers,” said Alan Morgan, CEO of the National Rural Health Association, a nonprofit policy group. “No one has those answers yet.”
Morgan noted that the new money for rural health, to be spent over five years, is far less than the $155 billion in rural Medicaid spending cuts over 10 years, as estimated by KFF, a nonprofit health policy and research group.
Experts, hospital leaders and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle fear that Trump’s signature legislation will particularly gut rural hospitals and clinics, which see an outsize share of patients who are insured through Medicaid, the federal-state public health insurance for people with low incomes. The new law slashes more than $1 trillion from Medicaid over the next 10 years to help pay for tax cuts that disproportionately benefit the wealthy.

The $50 billion addition was an effort by Republican leaders in Congress to win the votes of colleagues within their party who initially balked at supporting such steep cuts to Medicaid and other health services.
In the U.S. Senate, the rural program helped secure the vote of Alaska moderate Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who expressed concern about the law’s impact on health care in her state. About 1 in 3 Alaskans are insured through Medicaid.
Jared Kosin, the president and CEO of the Alaska Hospital & Healthcare Association, said he’s deeply frustrated with the new law’s gutting of Medicaid funding, which he thinks will wreak lasting damage on Alaskans. And Republicans sidestepped potential solutions by just throwing money into a program, he said.
“It’s frustrating in the public realm when decisions like this are made fast and, frankly, carelessly,” he said.
“The consequences are going to fall on us, not them.”
More than half of the law’s cuts to funding in rural areas are concentrated in 12 states with large rural populations that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act to cover more people, according to KFF: Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania and Virginia.
Some GOP lawmakers in Congress have heralded the $50 billion rural program as a health care victory. But it’s still unclear which hospitals, clinics and other providers would receive money and how much.
How it works
The Rural Health Transformation Program will dole out $10 billion annually from fiscal years 2026 through 2030.
States must apply for their funding by the end of this year, submitting a detailed plan on how it would be used.
The law outlines some ways that states can use the money, according to an analysis of the legislation from the Bipartisan Policy Center:

Making payments to rural hospitals to help them maintain essential services such as emergency room care or labor and delivery.
Recruiting and training rural doctors, nurses and other health workers.
Bolstering emergency medical services such as ambulances and EMTs.
Using new technologies, including telehealth.
Providing opioid use disorder treatment and mental health services.
Improving preventive care and chronic disease management.

Half of the $10 billion each year will be distributed evenly across states that have applied for it. The other half can be distributed by the administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services — currently Dr. Mehmet Oz — at his discretion, based on a state’s rural population and rural health facilities.
Although the program doesn’t replace the amount states are likely to lose, Morgan said it’s still an opportunity to rethink how rural health care is funded. He’d like to see states given flexibility in how they’re able to use the funds, and he hopes they focus on keeping rural communities healthy through preventive care while still helping hospitals keep their doors open.
“If done correctly, it could really change the future course for rural America,” Morgan said. “That is such a tough ask, though.”
Hardest hit
Kentucky could take the biggest hit from the new law’s reduction in rural Medicaid funding, losing an estimated $12 billion over 10 years, according to a KFF analysis.

The state’s Medicaid department is still waiting for additional federal guidance to understand how the state’s program will be affected, Kendra Steele, spokesperson with the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services, told Stateline in a statement.
“Over 1.4 million Kentuckians rely on Medicaid — including half of all children in our state, seniors and more vulnerable populations — and the passage of legislation on the federal level will have serious impacts for those individuals, rural health care and hospitals and local economies,” she wrote.
Even with the new program, states across the country will have to reevaluate their budgets in light of the cuts, said Hemi Tewarson, executive director at the National Academy for State Health Policy, a nonpartisan group that supports states in developing health care policies.
“Every region is slightly different and there’s not a one-size-fits-all approach,” she said. “Hospital ownership varies [as well as] the types of services that are critical for the community where they’re located. They have to think about new ways to provide those services in a context with fewer resources.”
About 44% of rural hospitals are operating in the red, according to a KFF analysis of Rand Hospital Data, a higher share than the 35% of hospitals in urban areas.
‘Rural at heart’
Prior to the bill’s passage, Oz attempted to reassure U.S. House Republicans that their districts could get money from the program even if they weren’t specifically rural, Politico reported earlier this month.










We’re all rural at heart when it comes to money.


– Alan Morgan, National Rural Health Association CEO


Pennsylvania Republican U.S. Rep. Rob Bresnahan said money would begin flowing to his district as early as the beginning of next year, telling the Wilkes-Barre Times Leader earlier this month that he met with Trump, Oz and others to secure pledges that hospitals in his district could access the fund. He represents the northeastern corner of Pennsylvania, which includes suburban and rural areas, as well as the cities of Scranton and Wilkes-Barre.
Though the legislation includes guidelines on which facilities or areas qualify as “rural,” Morgan, of the National Rural Health Association, expects a mad dash from lawmakers and providers to claim rural status in order to get a piece of the funding.
“That’s going to be a huge issue — defining who’s rural,” Morgan said. “We’re all rural at heart when it comes to money.”

(Architect of the Capitol/U.S. government work)Money is already pouring in to Colorado’s 8th Congressional District race as a crowded field of Democrats battle for the chance to flip the state’s most competitive House seat.
Incumbent U.S. Rep. Gabe Evans, a Fort Lupton Republican, is maintaining a narrow fundraising lead over his nearest Democratic rival with over $1.7 million raised in the first half of 2025, as he looks to defy expectations in the 2026 midterms and hold on to a seat he won by fewer than 2,500 votes last year.
Nearly three-quarters of Evans’ total haul came from political action committees or so-called joint fundraising committees, an increasingly popular campaign finance tool that allows wealthy donors to write large checks that are then split between many different candidates pursuant to individual contribution limits.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Top donors to Grow Our Majority and Defend Our Majority, joint committees that have transferred a total of over $238,000 to Evans’ campaign, include conservative billionaires like Peter Thiel, Steve Wynn, Charles Schwab and Ross Perot Jr., according to Federal Election Commission disclosures. Evans’ direct campaign haul also includes over $500,000 in receipts from roughly 200 political and corporate PACs, including the National Association of Realtors, the American Hospital Association and more than a dozen oil and gas companies.
Evans raised roughly $400,000 in individual contributions through June 30, FEC records show, with about half of that total coming from donors who gave the $3,500 maximum. Just 3% of his overall fundraising came from direct individual donors giving less than $200.
Candidates seeking the Democratic nomination in the 8th District include former Rep. Yadira Caraveo, who was unseated by Evans in 2024; state Reps. Manny Rutinel of Commerce City and Shannon Bird of Northglenn; state Treasurer Dave Young; and Amie Baca-Oehlert, former head of the Colorado Education Association.
Since an early entry into the race in January, Rutinel has raked in contributions from small-dollar donors, including many out-of-state contributors, through the digital fundraising platform ActBlue, FEC disclosures show. He has nearly equaled Evans’ fundraising haul with over $1.6 million in contributions, just over half of which came from donors giving less than $200. That’s the highest percentage of small-dollar donations of any candidate in the race.
Bird, by contrast, collected 9% of her haul from small donors after announcing her campaign in May. Disclosures show the vast majority of her $400,000 in itemized individual contributions came from Colorado donors — in large part from a long list of influential donors and political insiders, including philanthropists Rutt Bridges and Merle Chambers, and lobbyists Doug Friednash, Josh Hanfling and R.D. Sewald.
Caraveo announced a bid to win back her 8th District seat in April, but she trailed both Rutinel and Bird in second-quarter fundraising, bringing in just $164,000 in individual contributions.
Young and Baca-Oehlert joined the race on back-to-back days last month, a few weeks ahead of the FEC’s June 30 reporting deadline. Young, a former state lawmaker serving in his second term as state treasurer, reported raising just under $75,000 in that period. Baca-Oehlert, a former teachers union president endorsed by the Colorado Working Families Party, raised $57,646, including a $5,000 contribution from a National Education Association PAC.
The 8th District is a top target for Democrats in the 2026 midterms as they aim to flip control of the House, where the GOP holds a narrow majority. Direct spending by campaign committees will likely make up only a small portion of expenditures in the 2026 campaign cycle. So-called super PACs, which can raise and spend unlimited sums of money from wealthy donors and corporations, reported a total of $17.7 million in independent expenditures on the 8th District race in 2022 and another $29.5 million in 2024.
Youth Save Democracy, a Democratic-aligned group, is the only PAC to report any independent expenditures in the 8th District so far this cycle, a $4,749 payment to a voter analytics firm in April.

Don Bacon. She describes herself as a “unique candidate” who can meet the moment for Democrats who want to win.,"Douglas County District Court Clerk Crystal Rhoades is running to be the Democratic nominee in Nebraska's 2nd Congressional District.(Courtesy of Crystal Rhoades for Congress)OMAHA — Douglas County District Court Clerk Crystal Rhoades is done exploring a bid. She is running to be the Democratic nominee for the Nebraska 2nd Congressional District. 
She describes herself as a “unique candidate” who can meet the moment for Democrats who want to win.
“I am tired of the chaos in Washington,” Rhoades told the Nebraska Examiner in recent days. “I am tired of people who don’t know what it’s like to punch a time clock and live paycheck to paycheck.”
The lifelong Omahan has a history of helping local Democrats win elections as a political consultant, including a significant role in helping John Ewing Jr. become the first Democrat to lead the largest city in Nebraska in roughly a decade.
Last month, she shared internal polling indicating that she and State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha are within the margin of error for Democratic primary voters in NE-02. The polling has former political action committee co-founder and business owner Denise Powell at what Rhoades called a “distant third,” a characterization Powell’s campaign describes as wrong.
Recent FEC filings have shown Powell out-fundraising Cavanaugh. Powell has connections to some of local Democrats’ top donors.
While Rhoades has faced criticism from her own and opposing parties, she remains the last Democrat elected to a statewide post as a member of the Nebraska Public Service Commission, the state’s catch-all regulator for topics ranging from emergency telecommunications to pipelines. 
“I’ve got 20 years of a proven track record of delivering results for the people of this district, Rhoades said. “I have a track record of flipping seats from red to blue up and down the ballot. Nobody else in the race has all of those qualifications and criteria.” 
Critics of Rhoades’ service at the courthouse and in politics, including some Democrats in Douglas and Sarpy Counties, have said she too often butts heads with coworkers and potential allies.

Rhoades pointed to her record of “doing the right thing even when it’s hard” as a plus for voters. Her team’s polling indicates that potential Democratic primary voters in the district want someone who would fight President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress, someone with a proven record and someone who can win.
Last week, Retired Navy veteran Kishla Askins joined the Democratic primary. Earlier this year, State Sen. John Cavanaugh, the son of a former Democratic congressman from Omaha, formally announced his candidacy. Denise Powell, the co-founder of a political action committee and a business owner, announced her bid in May. Mark Johnston and Evangelos Argyrakis also have confirmed that they are running. 
Rhoades gives the race a second  longtime elected official, along with Cavanaugh, plus at least one well-funded newcomer, in Powell, and possibly two, with Askins. Rhoades has been in Nebraska politics for more than a decade.
Rhoades said she plans to use her working-class background to separate herself from the candidates. She has said she would focus on kitchen-table issues.
“Democrats have seen an erosion of support from that particular demographic, because our policies and our positions haven’t aligned with the needs of the working-class voters.” 
Nationwide, Democrats have been seeking answers as President Donald Trump made gains among working-class voters, including minority voters last year. Some economists and political scientists have argued that the flaws of free trade contributed to the rise of Trump and his political movement. 
Trump capitalized on working-class anxieties over some jobs being sent overseas and some people feeling left behind. 
Rhoades said she would focus on policy changes that protect and grow the middle class, creating jobs that pay a living wage, and protecting democracy. Specifically, she wants to address lingering inflation and push back against Trump’s tariffs and approach to immigration.
Another reason Rhoades said she is running is that she is concerned about Cavanaugh potentially vacating a statehouse seat at a time when one or two votes in the Legislature could let the Republican majority further erode abortion rights and pass more of the controversial legislation a handful of moderates, Democrats and progressives stop, because Republican Gov. Jim Pillen would get to appoint Cavanaugh’s replacement if he wins. 
“I want to make sure that we aren’t sacrificing some of the things that the Democrats have been able to hold off in the Legislature,” Rhoades said. 
Supporters of other Democratic candidates have criticized Rhoades for leaving the Nebraska Public Service Commission for the local clerk’s job and letting herself be replaced by a Republican appointee. Rhoades has said the stakes are not the same, that her regulatory role at the PSC wouldn’t make possible a potential shift to winner-take-all or a stricter abortion ban.
The 2nd District, which includes all of urban Douglas and rural Saunders Counties and a slice of suburban western Sarpy County, is typically a target of both national parties, as one of the rare remaining districts that is politically split. The district retains a slight GOP lean. 
With five-term U.S. Rep. Don Bacon retiring, the open-seat race is drawing a politically diverse and competitive field. 
The nonpartisan Center for Politics, the home of Larry Sabato’s Crystal Ball, shifted the Omaha-based House race to lean democratic from toss-up. The Cook Political Report also shifted the race to lean Democrat. 
Omaha City Council Vice President Brinker Harding and former State Sen. Brett Lindstrom of Omaha have announced bids to be the Republican nominee. National and local political observers expect it to prove one of the more competitive races in Congress for the 2026 midterms. 
“There’s too much at risk here for [Democrats] to be taking chances on this seat,” Rhoades said. “We’ve got some really big problems in this country, and it calls for very serious people.”

(Will Price | West Virginia Legislative Photography)West Virginia lawmakers put $17 million in the state budget for a pay increase for Birth to Three workers, who hadn’t seen a raise in more than two decades. The successful program provides free services to babies and toddlers who have developmental delays.
And, while most workers are getting a raise, the state Department of Health is going to cut pay for virtual therapists, who often provide services to children in rural areas where there’s a shortage of local therapists. 
The pay cut — especially as the state is struggling to retain its workforce — came as a surprise to lawmakers. 
“I don’t think I will speak for myself when I say I didn’t hear from a single legislator who was in favor of cutting the pay to any Birth to Three service provider. This was a department decision,” said Sen Ben Queen, R-Harrison, who serves on the Senate Finance Committee. Queen’s 1-year-old son is receiving services through the program.
“It does disappoint me,” he added. “I think the department celebrated and spiked the football that they got pay raises for their employees and then passed down a pay decrease.”
Katie Comer Reidy has worked as a speech therapist with Birth to Three for nearly 10 years and now provides virtual services. It’s “such a happy job,” she said. She uses Zoom to coach families on how to help their children reach milestones.
According to the state health department, the rate for virtual providers will decrease by 15%.
“I was excited to see that Birth to Three got a raise … but I was disappointed to see that the virtual providers took a bit of a cut. I do feel that the virtual providers are a big part of Birth to Three now,” said Comer Reidy, who lives in Charleston. “I fear that it will decrease the amount of virtual providers, and then, because of that … some of these families in rural counties might have a harder time getting the services that they need.”
Birth to Three started offering virtual services to children during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Gailyn M. Markham, director of communications for the state Department of Health, said that while determining the pay rates, the agency wanted to “ensure the state’s budget for the Birth to Three program could meet the growing needs of children and families in West Virginia.”
Birth to Three served 8,510 children in 2023. The program’s budget needs to account for the growing number of children, as well as a decreasing number of Medicaid-eligible children following the “unwinding” of Medicaid post-pandemic and increasing costs of assistive technology, Markham explained. 
“The funding provided by the state Legislature was based on the department’s projected need after these factors were evaluated,” she wrote in an email, adding that the state also receives $2.2 million in federal funding for the program.  
“To meet the needs of families during the pandemic, virtual services were permitted and reimbursed at the in-person rate. Post-pandemic, virtual services will remain allowable but the rate was reduced by 15%, recognizing that services provided virtually and at the service provider location are able to be offered at a lower cost than in person services,” she continued.

‘It’s a serious issue’
Not every state has a no-cost program like Birth to Three, which can be especially critical as West Virginia has the highest rate of prenatal exposure to drugs. This puts these children at a higher risk for a variety of physical and mental disabilities, and experts say early intervention is key.
Birth to Three uses 900 practitioners to provide physical, speech and occupational therapies and other services to children in all 55 counties. It served 16% of the state’s zero to 2-year-old population in 2023.
Comer Reidy said one of the most rewarding parts of the job was connecting with parents — not just the child who is being helped. “You then become a person that moms and dads will call when they’re having a hard time, and you [are] able to be a support system for somebody,” she said. 
During the legislative session, the House of Delegates and Senate each pushed bills that specifically gave Birth to Three workers a raise.
  Sen. Brian Helton, R-Fayette
Sen. Brian Helton, R-Fayette, introduced a version in the Senate, and it passed through the chamber unanimously but got held up in the House Finance Committee, where state budget concerns regularly stalled bills with price tags. 
His bill proposed a 25% increase raise for all workers; he said the allocated money in the final state budget would give in-person therapists around a 15% raise.
“These are the most vulnerable children in our society, the ones having problems getting off to a good start,” Helton said. “When you look at inflation over the past decade or so, and you consider the fact that in today’s environment, it’s hard to find good quality, skilled people from lots of positions that we as a state, we just couldn’t afford to take chances to lose these workers who provide such valuable service.”
Helton was also surprised to learn that pay had been cut for virtual providers, saying, “You never like to see anyone get a decrease.” But he said that in-person therapy offered benefits for children, and the pay increase could push more therapists to provide in-person services. 
“When you look at all the numbers, my understanding was some of that was done just to drive more people out into the field and to ensure that they’re actually getting … in person with people that work with these babies,” Helton said.
Queen said the Senate Finance Committee will be looking into why the pay was cut for virtual providers.
“It’s a reality of some sort of a budget issue that they didn’t share with us in a hearing process. And I hope we can get to the bottom of it sooner than later and not discourage people from leaving the system,” he said. “I haven’t personally heard of anyone jumping ship, but I can tell you that when you decrease someone’s pay in 2025 when the rest of the folks inside the very same department got a pay raise, it’s very discouraging.”
He continued, “It’s a serious issue, and I hope that this creates more conversation and transparency. We want departments to be successful.”

,Mississippi Today,2025-07-21 10:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,Mississippi schools face $68M Trump federal funding freeze just days before classes start,Devna Bose,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/07/21/trump-education-cuts-mississippi-schools-federal-funding-freeze/,"Across the country, nearly $7 billion in federal education money is on hold by the Trump administration.","Mississippi schools are going into the new academic year with holes in their budgets, thanks to the federal government’s decision to freeze billions in education dollars. 
Across the country, nearly $7 billion is on hold — money that pays for professional development, afterschool programs and programming for English language learners. Of that amount, $68 million is frozen for Mississippi.
After the federal government announced its decision to “review” the funds in a three-sentence email on June 30, U.S. senators across party lines have called for the Trump administration to release the money, which Congress had allocated in March. Additionally, a coalition of attorneys general and governors from 24 states and Washington, D.C., have filed a lawsuit challenging the federal government’s decision. 
Mississippi is not one of those states. 
The state education department hosted a virtual meeting about the funding two weeks ago for Mississippi school superintendents and federal programming directors, who still have many questions. Nearly 500 people attended, state Superintendent of Education Lance Evans said at a recent state board of education meeting. 
The issue came up repeatedly, too, at the annual Mississippi Association of School Superintendents convention last week because there’s no guarantee when or if the funds will be released. 
“The Mississippi Department of Education shares the same level of anxiety and frustration as our school districts during this process,” Evans said in an emailed statement. “We hope the U.S. Department of Education will expedite its review and see fit to release the funds, which are essential to providing education services on the state and local levels in Mississippi.”
Though the amount is just 2% of the state’s overall $3.32 billion education budget, the decision is already impacting school districts. And it comes at a critical time — just days away from the start of the school year, when many districts are hosting professional development sessions for their staff — and at a confusing time, as school leaders are still trying to understand the full impact of other federal spending decisions on their districts. 
Jackson Public Schools leaders discussed their $1.8 million loss at their July 15 board meeting, though they couldn’t detail the full financial impact just yet. 
“We’re seeking to minimize the effect of the loss of this revenue,” said Margaret Purnell, JPS executive director of business services.
Sunflower County Consolidated School District’s new superintendent, James Johnson-Waldington, has had to grapple with the loss of Title II funding, which pays for professional development, during his first few days on the job.

The district is still hosting professional development sessions for its teachers — it can’t afford to lose its well-fought ‘B’ rating from the state education department — but will have to use local funds to do it. 
“Hopefully if the funds are released, we can get reimbursed,” he said. “But in the meantime, we just have to do what we have to do for the wellbeing of our staff and students.”
The Union Public School District in central Mississippi isn’t cancelling the professional development sessions they have planned this week, but they have decided to handle it all in-house to save some money. 
The district receives about $75,000 in Title II and IV funding, which pays for student support services. Because the district is relatively small, Union often has to outsource for professional development needs. That’s mostly what the $47,000 it receives in Title II funds goes toward, and it’s historically the only pot of money that pays for professional development within the district. 
As a response to their students’ mental health needs during the transition period between elementary school and high school, the majority of the system’s Title IV funding goes toward paying for their middle school counselor to be full-time. The counselors at the other two schools are part-time. 
Now the district will have to dip into its own pockets to pay the rest of that counselor’s salary.
“She’s already employed, and we’re going to do right by people,” Superintendent Tyler Hansford said. “When you make a commitment to someone, we try to honor it here in Mississippi.”

While it might seem like $75,000 is just a drop in the bucket for a district that operates on an $11 million overall budget, Hansford said every dollar counts. For example, while that counselor’s services are much-needed in the district, whatever money they’ll use on her salary means that’s less money to use on other needed resources at the district, such as a new assistant teacher.
“It’s always a numbers game,” Hansford said. “It’s like putting together a puzzle. This money is that missing piece. You can’t complete the puzzle without it.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/06074506/829A9188-scaled.jpg,,,2025-07-21 06:56:19.038276

(Photo by Audrey Carleton/Capital and Main)A score of energy, tech and capital investment companies announced their commitments nearly a week ago to more than $93 billion worth of projects to prepare Pennsylvania for a role in the artificial intelligence revolution that proponents say will transform the world’s economy.
The projects range from plans to build a fleet of new nuclear reactors across the country to workforce development programs to train the next generation of tradespeople and technicians to build and operate new power plants and data centers.
Announced to coincide with GOP U.S. Sen. Dave McCormick’s Pennsylvania Energy and Innovation Summit in Pittsburgh last Tuesday, the investments were cast as crucial to winning a race against China to dominate in AI.
And with President Donald Trump headlining the event at Carnegie Mellon University,, the panelists largely reflected Trump’s “Drill, baby, drill,” fossil fuel-forward energy policy.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
With the exception of nuclear power, Trump falsely disparaged renewable energy during his remarks in a roundtable discussion on AI and feeding its demand for electricity. Trump signed a budget reconciliation bill this month that cancels tax credits for wind and solar energy projects, which observers say will slow their entry into the market. 
“You can own your own electric plants, and they’ll be powered by maybe nuclear, maybe gas, maybe coal. You know, we brought coal back in,” Trump said. “They won’t be powered by wind, because it doesn’t work. I hate to say it just doesn’t work. It’s rather intermittent.”
In fact, wind energy is becoming a key source of electricity, according to the World Economic Forum, which cited a record 117 gigawatts of new capacity installed globally in 2023. A gigawatt is enough electricity to power about 750,000 homes.
Environmental advocates protested the summit, with hundreds of people flooding the streets around CMU. They condemned plans to power AI using fossil fuels, warning that it would increase carbon emissions that cause climate change and, despite claims to the contrary, make electricity more expensive for consumers.

Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro also drew criticism for his participation in the summit.
“This is exactly the wrong direction on energy at this critical time. Pennsylvania has a chance to pivot right now and lead on the renewable energy transition that we need to fight the climate crisis. This meeting is just about planning more fracking projects and asking Pennsylvanians to sacrifice our health and the environment yet again.” Sandy Field, chair of the Climate Reality Project: Susquehanna Valley PA chapter, said in a statement.
Shapiro told reporters that he also questions the Trump administration’s opposition to clean energy projects. “I think that reconciliation bills is bad from Pennsylvania,” he said. “It’s somewhat ironic that we’re here talking about energy jobs and the bill that the president presumably will be touting would gut 26,000 energy jobs. I think it’s a bad deal.”
Eric Epstein, chair of TMI-Alert questioned whether many of the projects will happen. His group is opposed to restarting the former Three Mile Island nuclear plant in Dauphin County to power an artificial intelligence data center.
“Most of the proposed projects are in the planning or fantasy stages, and depend on  private equity, investment from outside of the state and federal government subsidies,” he told the Capital-Star, adding that political and financial factors could affect their viability.
So, what’s in the $93.5 billion investment that McCormick touted at his summit? The Capital-Star broke down the list.

Six natural gas projects totaling $24.2 billion that range from new electricity generating capacity, such as Frontier Group’s plan to convert the former Bruce Mansfield coal-fired power plant in Beaver County to a 3.6 gigawatt natural gas-fired plant, to gas driller Equinor’s plan to increase natural gas production. Two of the projects on the list include the price of natural gas that will be purchased to fuel existing or upgraded power plants, including an agreement in principle to buy $15 billion worth of gas.
Two projects involve nuclear energy. Constellation Energy said it will spend $2.4 billion to increase the output of its existing nuclear power plant near Limerick, Montgomery County. That’s in addition to Constellation’s announcement earlier this year of a $1.6 billion deal with Microsoft to restart the former Three Mile Island power plant, renamed the Crane Clean Energy Center. It’s also applying to renew its license for the Peach Bottom Clean Energy Center in York County to continue operating those reactors until 2054. Westinghouse Electric Co. said it will build 10 new nuclear plants in the United States, which will generate an estimated $6 billion in economic activity and create 15,000 new jobs in southwest Pennsylvania.
Hydroelectric power is the sole source of renewable energy among the projects announced.. Brookfield Asset Management said it has a $3 billion 20-year deal with Google to purchase electricity from the Safe Harbor and Holtwood hydroelectric dams on the Susquehanna River. Brookfield said it will relicense and overhaul dams, which were built in the early 20th century, to produce 3 gigawatts of electricity.
Two of the commonwealth’s major electric distribution companies, PPL Corp. and First Energy, said they will expand their grid capacities to support the demand from data centers. First Energy said it will spend $15 billion on infrastructure improvements in 57 counties. PPL said it will spend $6.8 billion on grid improvements and a joint venture with investment manager Blackrock Inc. to build a gas fired power plant near Marcellus shale gas supplies.
 Three tech firms said they will invest in workforce development projects. AI product developer Anthropic will inject $2 million towards programs at Carnegie Mellon University to support advancing AI-powered energy solutions and building the cybersecurity workforce needed to protect America’s energy infrastructure. Social media company Meta will make a $2.5 million gift to support early-stage Carnegie Mellon University-affiliated startups, including those in the energy, infrastructure, health care and defense industries. Google said it has launched a new “AI Works for PA” initiative offering free training for one million Pennsylvania small businesses and Pittsburgh residents. The tech giant also provided a grant to the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers and National Electrical Contractors Association electrical training program.

Data centers, like ones that Amazon Web Services announced in May it will build in Luzerne County and in Bucks County, are warehouse-like buildings containing vast numbers of computers to perform the processing that AI applications such as Chat GPT need. The AWS center planned adjacent to the Susquehanna Steam Electric Station in Salem Township could add about 1.2 gigawatts of demand to the commonwealth’s electricity grid.

PJM Interconnection, the organization that operates the electricity grid for Pennsylvania and 12 other states, has predicted its peak demand will grow by about 70 gigawatts to 220 gigawatts by 2040. The growth is being driven not only by AI, but also the increased electrification of transportation and industry.
Recognizing that Pennsylvania is facing a power crunch in coming years, Shapiro has proposed a plan to ensure the commonwealth remains competitive in the energy market. It would leverage the state’s natural gas resources while making it an attractive location for sustainable energy technologies. Part of the plan, now under consideration as a suite of bills before the General Assembly, is a goal to obtain 35% of the state’s energy from renewable sources by 2035. 
Another element of Shapiro’s Lightning Plan is a state board dedicated to streamlining the permitting process for new energy projects.
State Rep. Greg Vitali, who chairs the House Environmental and Natural Resource Protection Committee said those and other renewable energy initiatives, including a bill to allow shared community solar developments, have not passed yet.
“We are certainly not doing what we should be doing as a state as far as expanding renewables,” Vitali said, adding that the loss of tax credits would make it harder. “I’m not expecting much help from the federal government at all.”
 After speaking last Tuesday on a panel with McCormick and AWS CEO Matt Garman, Shapiro expressed cautious optimism about the projects announced during the summit.
“Obviously, there’s a difference between what someone says in a press release today and when shovels go in the ground in the future,” he said. “I want to see all of these dollars come to Pennsylvania, and we’re going to be working closely with the companies that want to plant a flag here, to allow them to get their shovels in the ground and scale up and create jobs.”

(Kentucky Lantern photo by David Stephenson)FRANKFORT — Lucas Deaton of Walton, a lawyer for the Kentucky Bar Association, brought his 5-year-old daughter, Audrey, to see Kentucky’s grandest building — the state Capitol — before it closes to the public for several years.
A most lonely place greeted them on their Dads-Take-Daughters-to-Work outing on a hot day in early summer.
The famous statues of Lincoln and other Kentucky notables were there for the father and daughter to admire. So were the impressive dome and rotunda, along with the four-story building’s 70 iconic columns, sky lights and other striking architectural features and opulent decorative finishes.
But nearly gone from the Capitol were the hundreds of people who usually make it a most busy place.
The Capitol has not been so desolate on a workday since before June 2, 1910, when Gov. Augustus Willson joined former governors, judges, generals, members of Congress and thousands of proud Kentuckians in grand ceremonies to open Kentucky’s new Capitol for business.
Soon there will be nobody working in the building except renovators and security.

For three years, perhaps longer, the Capitol will remain a most lonely place. No late-breaking gubernatorial news conferences. No lively debates in the legislative chambers. No impactful hearings in the august Supreme Court chambers. No public rallies in the Rotunda. No students on field trips.
State government offices in the building are relocating as the Capitol is getting a facelift. The project’s cost is still subject to change. So is the time to get it done. The legislature expects to return to the Capitol in time for the session that convenes in January 2029.
 Biggest renovation of Kentucky Capitol in its history
Construction on the massive building in south Frankfort began in 1904. It replaced the earlier 1830 Capitol, still standing in downtown Frankfort. The old Capitol had become too small to accommodate the growing state government.
The price tag for the new state Capitol was $1.82 million. The cost for today’s renovations is expected to be nearly $300 million, maybe higher, but that includes items that were not in the Capitol when it opened in 1910, such as modern heating and cooling systems to provide temperature control throughout the building.
Much of the renovations will address leaky, rusty water pipes; gobs of outdated electrical wiring in the ceilings, heating and cooling systems, and worn terracotta tiles covering the outside of the dome, some of which date back to 1941.
Enough organic material accumulated on the dome that a small tree was found growing from it. The cost of the dome work has topped $16 million.
A roof replacement is planned after the dome restoration is completed. A new roof will cost about $7 million.

Renovation of the 200 historic windows in the building alone will cost $10.5 million.
The elevator on the north side of the Capitol will be enlarged to comply with guidelines of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). It will be able to carry a stretcher in a medical emergency. The elevator on the south side will be reviewed.
When renovations are complete, there will be public, accessible women’s and men’s restrooms on both sides of the Capitol on every floor. Currently, there are 18 women’s restroom stalls in the Capitol; after the renovation, there will be 28. Family restrooms will also be added on multiple floors.
Costs also jumped with construction of a temporary building near the Capitol Annex to house the state House and Senate when in session. The temporary quarters cost about $14 million to build.
No plans have yet been made on what to do with the new building once the Capitol is in operation again. It was built to last 10 years.
 Why the renovations are needed
Senate President Robert Stivers, R-Manchester, said the Capitol was “getting old with a lot of years of wear and tear and needed a lot of work.”
He said the goal of the renovations is to make the Capitol “safer, more energy efficient and comfortable.”

Mike Wynn, a spokesperson for the Kentucky Legislative Research Commission, said the General Assembly is scheduled to reconvene in the Capitol for the 2029 regular session that begins in January of that year.
“The project is on track, but as with any major renovation, the completion date may change as the project moves along,” he added.
The cost also may change, said Finance and Administration Cabinet spokesperson Kinsey Morrison. The total cost now is expected to be $291.5 million, she said, but that may rise with additional work needed. “When some work is done on an old building, often another problem is found,” she said.
The last major renovation of the facility was more than 70 years ago. Slightly more than $1.1 million was spent in 2017 to give the Capitol’s facade a thorough cleaning and to start some minor restoration of infrastructure.
Senate President Stivers said he doubts visitors will notice much change when they see the renovated Capitol but “a lot is going on.”
 Hardships caused by the renovations
The exodus of state workers from the Capitol was expected to end by mid-July. Moving vans surrounded the Capitol for weeks to haul equipment to new offices.
Donna Farmer, the designated construction project manager for the renovations, said at a recent news briefing that the Capitol is expected to close to the public by the end of August.
She said several public attractions on the Capitol campus will remain open to the public. They include the Floral Clock, floral beds, the COVID-19 memorial monument and the Gold Star Family Monument.

She also noted a new visitors’ center is in the offing.
Gov. Andy Beshear and his staff will move to the Old Governor’s Mansion and State Office Building in downtown Frankfort. Lt. Gov. Jacqueline Coleman and her staff are headed to Berry Hill Mansion.
New office spaces for the Supreme Court of Kentucky and the State Law Library with its 20,000 books are now at 669 Chamberlain Avenue. The Circuit Court Clerk Conduct Commission also is at the new location. The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in August at the Robert F. Stephens Circuit Courthouse in Lexington.
The attorney general’s office will move its personnel in the Capitol to its second Frankfort office — Capital Complex East on Capital Center Drive. The secretary of state’s office is going to 1025 Capital Center Drive, suite 201 in Frankfort.
Proprietors of media offices, known as “Press Row,” on the second floor of the Capitol have found their own office space or are working from their homes, an arrangement that became popular during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The closing of the Capitol also will mean a new location for the inauguration of the next governor on Dec. 14, 2027.
With much pageantry, a new governor is usually sworn into office on the steps leading to the Capitol’s front entrance. The 2027 inauguration will be held a little lower, on the Capitol’s far north steps near Capital Avenue.
A security fence will be installed surrounding the construction area to ensure the safety of employees and visitors to the Capitol campus. The Capitol’s west and east parking lots will be closed. The Capitol Annex’s east parking lot and parking garage will remain open.
The most public feature of the renovation project is the temporary building for the House and Senate adjacent to the Annex. It’s more practical than pompous. But it won’t be that public.
Neither chamber will have a public gallery like the ones in the Capitol. The Kentucky Educational Television network will continue to air live proceedings in the chambers for public consumption.
The only members of the public allowed in the chambers will be those with special invitations from legislators. There will be several desks for members of the media.

The temporary structure is a one-story, 26,000-square-foot building. It includes space for majority and minority leadership offices, caucus rooms, support staff and emergency personnel. There is a purpose-built media area located in the vestibule of the temporary structure which offers Wi-Fi access and electrical outlets for media to cover floor proceedings.
Offices for legislative leaders in the temporary structure will mirror the prior office allocation in the Capitol. The temporary structure will also provide space for clerks and support staff.
When there is need for a joint House-Senate session, it will assemble in the House, as in the Capitol.
Legislators are next scheduled to meet in January 2026 for a 60-day session to write a two-year budget.
But Gov. Andy Beshear is considering whether to call them back to Frankfort early for a special session to address funding for natural disasters that have wrecked the state.
If there should be a special session, “We are ready,” said Stivers.
The architect for the renovations is EOP. Messer Construction Co. is the construction manager. Both businesses have offices in Lexington and Louisville. The Finance Cabinet said additional information on other contractors will be available upon completion of all bid awards and available through open records requests.
Stivers congratulated Gov. Beshear and former Gov. Matt Bevin for working on the Capitol renovations.
“It is a mammoth project with much planning but I think we are all headed in the right direction on it,” he said. “I know it will be better for the people who work in the Capitol when it is completed.”
It should also please Kentuckians when they can again amble the Capitol’s hallowed halls.
“I hope to bring Audrey back when it reopens,” said dad Deaton. “She will be about 9 then. I think she will enjoy it even more.”

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)Congress set aside $50 billion for rural hospitals and medical providers to allay fears over the billions more in historic cuts to federal health care spending that President Donald Trump signed into law on Independence Day.
But is that bandage big enough to save struggling rural hospitals?
“I have more questions than I have answers,” said Alan Morgan, CEO of the National Rural Health Association, a nonprofit policy group. “No one has those answers yet.”
Morgan noted that the new money for rural health, to be spent over five years, is far less than the $155 billion in rural Medicaid spending cuts over 10 years, as estimated by KFF, a nonprofit health policy and research group. In Pennsylvania, the loss would be $6.38 billion over the next decade.
More than half of the law’s cuts to funding in rural areas are concentrated in 12 states with large rural populations that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act to cover more people, according to KFF: Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania and Virginia.
Experts, hospital leaders and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle fear that Trump’s signature legislation will particularly gut rural hospitals and clinics, which see an outsize share of patients who are insured through Medicaid, the federal-state public health insurance for people with low incomes. The new law slashes more than $1 trillion from Medicaid over the next 10 years to help pay for tax cuts that disproportionately benefit the wealthy.
States scramble to shield hospitals from GOP Medicaid cuts

The $50 billion addition was an effort by Republican leaders in Congress to win the votes of colleagues within their party who initially balked at supporting such steep cuts to Medicaid and other health services.
In the U.S. Senate, the rural program helped secure the vote of Alaska moderate Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who expressed concern about the law’s impact on health care in her state. About 1 in 3 Alaskans are insured through Medicaid.
Jared Kosin, the president and CEO of the Alaska Hospital & Healthcare Association, said he’s deeply frustrated with the new law’s gutting of Medicaid funding, which he thinks will wreak lasting damage on Alaskans. And Republicans sidestepped potential solutions by just throwing money into a program, he said.
“It’s frustrating in the public realm when decisions like this are made fast and, frankly, carelessly,” he said.
“The consequences are going to fall on us, not them.”
Some GOP lawmakers in Congress have heralded the $50 billion rural program as a health care victory. But it’s still unclear which hospitals, clinics and other providers would receive money and how much.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
How it works
The Rural Health Transformation Program will dole out $10 billion annually from fiscal years 2026 through 2030.
States must apply for their funding by the end of this year, submitting a detailed plan on how it would be used.
The law outlines some ways that states can use the money, according to an analysis of the legislation from the Bipartisan Policy Center:

Making payments to rural hospitals to help them maintain essential services such as emergency room care or labor and delivery.
Recruiting and training rural doctors, nurses and other health workers.
Bolstering emergency medical services such as ambulances and EMTs.
Using new technologies, including telehealth.
Providing opioid use disorder treatment and mental health services.
Improving preventive care and chronic disease management.

Half of the $10 billion each year will be distributed evenly across states that have applied for it. The other half can be distributed by the administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services — currently Dr. Mehmet Oz — at his discretion, based on a state’s rural population and rural health facilities.
Although the program doesn’t replace the amount states are likely to lose, Morgan said it’s still an opportunity to rethink how rural health care is funded. He’d like to see states given flexibility in how they’re able to use the funds, and he hopes they focus on keeping rural communities healthy through preventive care while still helping hospitals keep their doors open.
“If done correctly, it could really change the future course for rural America,” Morgan said. “That is such a tough ask, though.”
Hardest hit
Kentucky could take the biggest hit from the new law’s reduction in rural Medicaid funding, losing an estimated $12 billion over 10 years, according to a KFF analysis.
Tracking Medicaid patients’ work status may prove difficult for states

The state’s Medicaid department is still waiting for additional federal guidance to understand how the state’s program will be affected, Kendra Steele, spokesperson with the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services, told Stateline in a statement.
“Over 1.4 million Kentuckians rely on Medicaid — including half of all children in our state, seniors and more vulnerable populations — and the passage of legislation on the federal level will have serious impacts for those individuals, rural health care and hospitals and local economies,” she wrote.
Even with the new program, states across the country will have to reevaluate their budgets in light of the cuts, said Hemi Tewarson, executive director at the National Academy for State Health Policy, a nonpartisan group that supports states in developing health care policies.
“Every region is slightly different and there’s not a one-size-fits-all approach,” she said. “Hospital ownership varies [as well as] the types of services that are critical for the community where they’re located. They have to think about new ways to provide those services in a context with fewer resources.”
About 44% of rural hospitals are operating in the red, according to a KFF analysis of Rand Hospital Data, a higher share than the 35% of hospitals in urban areas.
‘Rural at heart’
Prior to the bill’s passage, Oz attempted to reassure U.S. House Republicans that their districts could get money from the program even if they weren’t specifically rural, Politico reported earlier this month.










We’re all rural at heart when it comes to money. 


– Alan Morgan, CEO of the National Rural Health Association


Pennsylvania Republican U.S. Rep. Rob Bresnahan said money would begin flowing to his district as early as the beginning of next year, telling the Wilkes-Barre Times Leader earlier this month that he met with Trump, Oz and others to secure pledges that hospitals in his district could access the fund. He represents the northeastern corner of Pennsylvania, which includes suburban and rural areas, as well as the cities of Scranton and Wilkes-Barre.
Though the legislation includes guidelines on which facilities or areas qualify as “rural,” Morgan, of the National Rural Health Association, expects a mad dash from lawmakers and providers to claim rural status in order to get a piece of the funding.
“That’s going to be a huge issue — defining who’s rural,” Morgan said. “We’re all rural at heart when it comes to money.”

“These upstream investments are proving to be effective,” Crowley said, “but we know there’s more work to do in expanding substance use prevention, harm reduction, treatment, and recovery efforts.” 
The Milwaukee County Board Committee on Finance unanimously approved Crowley’s proposal during a meeting Thursday. Next week, the full county board will vote on whether to approve the plan. The projects, proposed for the 2026-28 fiscal years, include providing outreach to older adults with disabilities through door-to-door canvasing and  funding community-based organizations which partner with the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). Providing more staffing to the medical examiner’s office, funding residential room and board programs for people struggling with addiction and enhancing the county’s publicly available data analysis of the overdose crisis are among the other proposed initiatives. 
“Through these proven initiatives and by working together, we will keep leading the way to change the lives of individuals affected by substance use disorder and reduce the likelihood of overdose-related fatalities in our community — because lives depend on it,” Crowley said in a statement. 
Shakita LaGrant-McClain, executive director of DHHS, said the funding will allow the department to “continue the life-saving work that began with the initial round of opioid settlement funds…We are seeing promising trends and look forward to continuing our prevention, harm reduction, treatment and recovery work, including ensuring residents have access to harm reduction supplies, targeted community outreach, and collaboration with community partners.”
A publicly available dashboard illustrates the toll the overdose epidemic has taken on Milwaukee County. It provides information on both fatal and non-fatal overdoses, which communities are most impacted, how much anti-overdose Naloxone has been utilized, and more. Across Milwaukee County, over 4,500 people have lost their lives to an overdose between 2016 and 2024. The deaths peaked in 2022, which saw 674 people lose their lives to an overdose. Non-fatal overdoses are even more common; more than 5,400 occurred during 2022. There have been 1,061 non-fatal overdoses so far this year and 124 people have died of an overdose in 2025. 
The data shows that so far this year, 14% of fatal overdoses have been people between 55-59 years old and 11% were  60-64. People aged 35-39 made up 13% of the fatal overdoses this year. The lowest percentages came from young people 15-29 years old, and much older people aged 75-85 years or more. 
Over 18 years, Milwaukee County will receive a total of $111 million in opioid settlement funds. So far, $34 million has been allocated across three cohorts of funded projects focused on breaking cycles of addiction, advancing racial equality and improving community health.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by David Stephenson)The Kentucky General Assembly plans to convene in temporary chambers for at least the next three years while the Capitol undergoes extensive renovations. 
During those years, there will be no public galleries where citizens can watch as the House and Senate debate and vote on new laws.
No rotunda where advocates and protesters can gather for rallies.
 And less opportunity for citizens and lobbyists to personally interact with lawmakers in the halls.
People will be able to watch the legislature in session in real time from next door in the Capitol Annex via live streams of the proceedings.
But the setup leaves some Frankfort regulars concerned. 
Amye Bensenhaver, co-director of the Kentucky Open Government Coalition, said that without a space for the public to observe in person, the legislature risks violating the state Open Meetings Act. 
A Senate Republican spokesperson rejected any suggestion that the temporary arrangement violates open government laws. He said the expense of building a gallery in a temporary building could not be justified and would have been “an irresponsible use of taxpayer dollars.”

Becky Jones, vice president of the League of Women Voters’ Kentucky chapter, said the League understands the cost concerns but would like to see more proactive steps to ensure public access to the legislative process.
“I think the League certainly appreciates the cost constraints that the legislature faced when building the temporary structure that’s going to service for three more years,” Jones recently told the Kentucky Lantern. “We also appreciate that the loss of a public viewing gallery is not insignificant, and I think there could have been more definitive steps taken to ensure that we will have access via this live stream.”
“The chambers are for the people, not merely the legislators,” Jones said. 
The state’s public broadcast network, KET, will still have cameras in the House and Senate chambers to carry the live stream, but Congress recently voted for significant cuts to public media funding nationwide. 
Physical presence and participation
The Senate’s Republican leaders last month unveiled the Senate side of the temporary building. Senate President Robert Stivers took reporters on a tour of the space, showing offices and conference rooms down the hall from the temporary Senate floor. 
Asked about the absence of a public gallery, Stivers cited cost. The Capitol galleries overlook the floors of the House and Senate and are entered by their own stairs.
“I think what the discussion was, we could have built the gallery, but you think about expensive — this is already expensive,” Stivers said of the $14 million structure where the legislature plans to hold at at least three regular sessions. The Capitol renovation is expected to cost almost $300 million.

Republican Caucus Chair Robby Mills, of Henderson, said during the press conference that “public access is still going to be 100% to the process” with KET streaming.
Reporters will still be allowed in the chamber as well. 
Finance and Administration Cabinet spokesperson Kinsey Woodson told the Lantern in an email that “the General Assembly never requested a design option with a public gallery space, and therefore no estimate was ever made.” 
Bensenhaver, a former Kentucky assistant attorney general who authored open records and open meetings decisions for 25 years, said Stivers’ comments during the press conference sounded “really dismissive of what his predecessors in office considered a priority.” 
In 2013, the General Assembly codified that public agencies must “provide meeting room conditions, including adequate space, seating, and acoustics, which insofar as is feasible allow effective public observation of the public meetings.” Later that same year, lawmakers added to state law that for any public meeting, agencies “shall evaluate space requirements, seating capacity, and acoustics.” 
“There’s a physical presence that I think is so important to public participation — this idea that by the strength of your numbers, you show support or opposition to an idea or a proposal,” Bensenhaver said.
Jones had similar thoughts. When people are allowed in a gallery space, they might see how lawmakers off camera react to debate on the floor, and that might open an opportunity to approach the lawmaker and ask about their reaction. 
“When you’re observing what’s going on the floor, it’s like you’re watching a play,” Jones said. “ You can see things that happen that aren’t going to necessarily be provided by a livestream, because we have to depend on the person running the camera and how many cameras are set up.”
Dustin Isaacs, a spokesperson for the Senate majority caucus, said in a statement to the Lantern that the temporary setup does not violate the Open Meeting Act. “Claims to the contrary ignore both the plain language of the statute and common sense.”

“The law requires public meetings to be observable ‘insofar as is feasible.’ The Kentucky Attorney General affirmed that standard during the pandemic (OAG 20-05), recognizing that under extraordinary circumstances, physical accommodations may be adjusted, as long as the public can still observe proceedings effectively. A full Capitol renovation, planned with input from both the legislative and executive branches, clearly qualifies. Constructing a second-story gallery in a temporary chamber is not just impractical; it is structurally, logistically, and financially infeasible and would be an irresponsible use of taxpayer dollars.”
Isaacs added that those who’ve engaged with lawmakers on this issue “will hopefully recognize we’ve been responsive and have focused on delivering accessible solutions despite challenging circumstances beyond our control.” He reiterated the addition of viewing rooms with the livestreams in the annex, maintaining press access and “continued online transparency,” arguing these “tools not only meet the law’s requirements for public observation, but arguably exceed them.” 
While lawmakers understand that some would prefer the option of in-person gallery seating, but some have suggested that not having the gallery is because of lawmakers’ contempt for public transparency, which is “not only inaccurate, it’s hyperbolic and revisionist,” Isaacs said. 
“The gallery isn’t meant to be a venue for protest or spectacle. It has always been a place for quiet observation, not disruption,” he said. 
Isaacs compared expecting the temporary building to fully replicate the permanent chambers in the Capitol to “insisting all public communication be hand-delivered or printed when a website goes down.” During the renovation, legislative information and meetings will be accessible to the public. 
Isaacs added that lawmakers have “acted in good faith and within the law.” 
“Recasting a temporary logistical challenge as a constitutional crisis does not reflect a commitment to transparency,” he said. “It demonstrates a commitment to political theater.” 
Changes to advocacy?
The extensive renovation also means that the Capitol rotunda is closed. The space, centrally located between the House and Senate and in front of the governor’s office, was often used for press conferences and rallies by outside groups. 
No similar central space is part of the temporary legislative quarters. But Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear said in a July 10 press conference that his administration was working on an alternative space for groups to use and hold rallies, “maybe not as large as could have been in the Capitol rotunda.”
“We recognize that’s needed, and we’re working on that which is within our control,” he said.

Kate Miller, the ACLU of Kentucky’s advocacy director, told the Lantern that “it’s too early to know what the impact will be on constituents being able to engage their lawmakers” during the renovation. Most of the ACLU’s advocacy efforts took place in lawmakers’ annex offices by connecting constituents with members of the legislature. 
Mike Harmon, director of state outreach for the Commonwealth Policy Center, said in an email that the rotunda would be missed. He also touted the effectiveness of building individual relationships with lawmakers. 
The advocates who most influenced him when he was in the House “were those who were sincere in what they believed and were not afraid to answer the question, ‘who is for it and who is against it?’” It didn’t mean those advocates “always got what they asked for, but I did consider those types of conversations with greater weight,” the former state auditor added. 
“True advocacy comes from developing relationships and not becoming angry when an issue you want doesn’t pan out that session. There is always another session and another issue that you want to advocate for with legislators,” Harmon said, predicting that the Commonwealth Policy Center’s development of such relationships will make up for the loss of personal access in the temporary building. “I would imagine the negative impact to our efforts should be minimal.” 
Jones of the League said that during the renovation “people might be drawn to find different ways to make their presence known.” That might look like silent protests or being outside the temporary structure. It could also look like being more present in committee meetings and preparing statements to give during hearings.
“I think it’s hard to predict how advocacy will change,” Jones said. “I think it will change. I’m just not sure how that’s going to happen.”

The board says it will not purge a voter’s registration if they don’t provide the information, but it will require them to fill out extra paperwork and vote with a provisional ballot that may or may not count.  That ambiguity and extra burden will cause many to just walk away without voting – and it’s a good reason to help people remove themselves from the board’s list. 
Who are these voters and how can you help? 
Briefly, the affected voters are disproportionately young, Black, and vote Democratic – although nearly half of them have never voted. A large majority registered when they were in their teens or twenties and provided minimal information at the time – which is why they’re on the board’s list.
Statewide, white registered voters outnumber non-whites by more than two to one, but voters of color actually outnumber whites on this list. And the partisan tilt among those on the list who have cast ballots is about 60%-40% in favor of Democrats, quite different from the state’s purple hue. 
The full list of 103,000 voters is on the State Board’s website at this link – it’s searchable by name and can be filtered by county or downloaded. Names will be deleted as voters provide ID info or county election staff find a number in another document, such as an absentee ballot application.
The affected voters should contact their county board of elections listed here to provide information in person or by mail, or re-register online if they have a DMV ID (best option: open this link, scroll to bottom and “Continue as Guest”). Voters still on the list in early August will get a mailing from the board.
You can help by widely publicizing this website page with the searchable list and action steps: www.ncsbe.gov/registrationrepair. Check the list for family and friends, and promote the website on social media. 
More than 27,000 of the 103,000 were among the 60,000 early voters in 2024 who NC Supreme Court candidate Jefferson Griffin tried to disqualify by claiming they had “incomplete registrations.” (The other 33,000 Griffin-challenged voters gave an ID number when they registered but the number didn’t verify as theirs for various reasons, mostly data glitches and administrative error. That group and thousands of similar voters will be asked for an ID number in a later board mailing.)  
The State Board says the missing information is required by state law and the federal Help America Vote Act (HAVA), but many registration forms failed to make that clear. 
Actually, as county election officials attest, state law says the identity number must be “requested” but it is not required. If the number is missing or doesn’t verify, the voter can complete their registration by presenting one of the identification documents specified in HAVA when they first vote (for example, a photo ID or a utility bill, bank statement or government document with their name and address).  
All 60,000 voters challenged by Jefferson Griffin provided a HAVA document when they first voted, which made their registration legal. Biased Republican state judges ignored that fact, but a federal judge finally quashed Griffin’s attempt to rewrite the rules in place for the 2024 election. 
Going forward, the State Board of Elections says it will require voters who come to the polls with a missing ID number to furnish one and vote with a provisional ballot that may not count unless the number verifies. In a busy election, that means waiting in a second line for a clerk to explain a multi-part form to fill out and a ballot that may be canceled. Too many people will just leave, frustrated and effectively disenfranchised. 
Hopefully, a judge will soon eliminate the board’s new provisional ballot requirement, especially because everyone must now present a type of HAVA ID to vote, namely a photo ID. Whether voters provide an ID number that verifies or not, they’re also providing a HAVA document at the polls, which resolves any identification issue. Let them vote a regular ballot as the law specifies.

While highly opinionated, the newsletter regularly digs up public records related to the prison project. The Advocate is republishing a lightly edited recent newsletter with permission.
For at least the last two decades, Arkansas has been touted as a conservatively run, fiscally responsible state — we have a balanced budget via annual adjustments to the Revenue Stabilization Act and generally run a surplus that, although recently dwindling, at least isn’t a deficit.
Unfortunately for the state and all its taxpayers, the current administration is hell bent on building (or at least trying to build) a mega prison through a process and at a location that are all but laughably bad. As we recently reported, not only did the state start the project without sufficient funding, but we also now know that the expenses being reimbursed for this project aren’t exactly what you might expect.
Alcohol, first-class travel & valet — in duplicate


Arkansas taxpayers are footing the bill not just for [consultant] Vanir’s  “management” fees and extensive travel, but for first-class flights, luxury hotels, and even alcohol — sometimes twice via duplicate expense reports. These aren’t padded costs to be expected in the normal course of business; they’re violations of Arkansas law and policy, and it’s taken the Department of Corrections almost a year to catch on and push back.


 


On July 14th, Department of Corrections’ Chief Financial Officer, Chad Brown, issued a formal memo to Vanir, highlighting several egregious billing practices:

Alcohol charged to the state despite an explicit prohibition under Arkansas travel policy.
First-class airfare billed to taxpayers, with no justification other than comfort.
Hotel rates exceeding allowed nightly maximums, with ADC begrudgingly agreeing to reimburse at a flat $200 per night “for these specific invoices” but warning Vanir not to do it again.
Valet services, hotel points, and duplicate receipts — all impermissible, all submitted for reimbursement.

This is more than just a few honest mistakes. This is 10 months’ worth of invoices expected to be paid by hardworking Arkansans to California-based consultants flying first-class into our state, expensing boozy steakhouse dinners, tacking on valet parking and hotel reward points, then billing us for it — in duplicate.
All while working on a prison project that the legislature has refused to fund five times.
  Receipts submitted by Vanir Construction Management to the Arkansas Department of Corrections.
But hey, at least you’re tipping 20%
 Money please



There’s a difference between responsible oversight and a blank check — and based on the invoices and internal memos we’ve reviewed, it’s clear that the State is handing California-based Vanir the latter. Unfortunately, it appears we were correct when we wrote about the rationale for our inherent distrust of Vanir.


Take Invoice 180726 for January 2025. Vanir charged the state:

$1,119.18 for a single airfare by Project Director Michael Beaber.
$1,063.57 for Project Manager Luann Salado’s lodging—more than five times the federal per diem for some regions of Arkansas.
$580.41 for a “business meal” by Principal-in-Charge Codi Newsom, submitted with no itemized detail. Or the one she asked for the alcohol and desserts to be crossed out, so they don’t see it.
Valet services, duplicate mileage receipts, and multiple upgrades clearly flagged by Department of Correction’s memo as violations of policy.

Or look at Invoice 180674 for December 2024. Vanir billed:

$915.95 for one employee’s airfare.
$567.84 for Beaber’s hotel stay.
Over $400 in valet and parking fees, and another $378.36 in rental car charges in the same invoice.

To date, Vanir has billed you a total of $46,916.89. And the expense reports read less like travel for work and more like a lavish weekend getaway on the State’s dime—all for a project only one person in this state actually wants in its current iteration
Arkansas paying a premium, getting nothing in return
Not only are you paying Vanir to jet set around the country living large, but it also seems like the only thing they’re capable of doing is missing deadlines, increasing the ultimate cost of the project, fabricating excuses, refusing to meet with lawmakers, and kicking the can down the road.
  Excerpt from Vanir letter to Arkansas officials regarding prison project targets.
Surprising to no one, the deadline was flubbed — and, just like that, more money comes out of your pocket.
This kind of waste wouldn’t be happening if:

We lived the “Arkansas First” mantra as much as the administration preaches it. Do we not have an Arkansas company capable of doing this work? Are our state agencies too incompetent to undertake a capital project on their own? It appears our government thinks so.
We weren’t rushing forward with a massive prison project in Franklin County that’s deeply unpopular, likely unlawful, has yet to be properly studied, and perhaps most importantly, still lacks legislative funding.

We’ve now burned through nearly $400k in five months and put ourselves on the hook for over $75m more for Vanir to do little more than twiddle their thumbs and sip champagne—and we’re only barely getting started. Remember, there’s not even a plan for this thing yet.
Backbone. Anyone.
At a time when rural counties are struggling to keep hospitals open and Arkansans are breaking their backs to keep food on the table, our government is hemorrhaging public funds on valet parking and Merlot. Or was it Reisling and Malbec? There are rumblings, some not so subtle, that the powers that be are growing increasingly displeased with the Franklin County location and Vanir’s conduct. Unsurprising, given that everyone involved with this project disaster looks more foolish by the day.
If the Board of Corrections can muster the courage, it has yet another opportunity to take control of this fiasco at its next meeting on August 1st. And, while they can’t stop at merely asking questions without taking action, they can certainly start by asking why the people of Arkansas are paying a premium for consultants to live like queens while our communities are left footing the bill.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Lap-of-Luxury-GravelGrit-1024x737.webp,,,2025-07-21 05:56:11.261557

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)Detective Joseph Mensah, a  Waukesha County Sheriff’s detective who attracted protests and controversy for his involvement in three fatal shootings over a five year period while employed at the Wauwatosa Police Department (WPD) will resign from the Sheriff’s office. Mensah, hired to the Waukesha County Sheriff’s Department in 2021, issued a resignation letter on July 17. In a resignation letter, Mensah said he plans to leave the law enforcement profession all together. 
An version of the letter was posted on social media by Jessica McBride, a contributor to the right-wing media outlet Wisconsin Right Now. Mensah’s resignation will be effective on July 31, according to the letter. 
A Waukesha County Sheriffs Department spokesperson sent a slightly different version of the letter to Wisconsin Examiner upon request. “After much consideration, I feel it would be in the best interest of the Sheriffs Department, the community, my family, and my own personal well-being, that I transition out of the law enforcement profession,” Mensah wrote in the letter. “Words can not express how grateful I am that you, Sheriff Severson, along with Inspector Gumm, Deputy Inspector, the command staff, and the Waukesha County Sheriff’s Department accepted me and brought me into your family when I needed you most. I am beyond grateful and thankful, that I had the opportunity to serve alongside the men and women of this agency. If there is anything I can do to assist with this process, please let me know.”
  The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
Mensah was hired by the Waukesha County Sheriff’s Department after resigning from WPD in 2020, following months of protests. After he was  hired by WPD in 2015, Mensah was involved in three fatal shootings. In his first year on the job Mensah shot 29-year-old Antonio Gonzales, who was wielding a sword when officers arrived at his home. Less than a year later, Mensah fatally shot 25-year-old Jay Anderson Jr., who was sleeping in his car in a county park. Mensah said that Anderson lunged for a handgun that sat beside him on the front passenger seat. Four years later in early 2020, Mensah killed 17-year-old Alvin Cole, who was fleeing Mayfair Mall with his friends after being involved in a fight, and brandishing a handgun. Mensah said that Cole attempted to shoot him during the chase. 
The Milwaukee County District Attorney’s Office declined to charge Mensah in any of those shootings, stating that his actions were either justified or privileged. 
Residents and elected officials in Wauwatosa called for criminal charges against Mensah for the three shootings. When the district attorney declined to issue charges in the Cole shooting, protests ensued and a curfew was declared in Wauwatosa with  protesters confronted by militarized law enforcement.
An independent investigation found that Mensah violated department policies when he gave radio interviews in which  he discussed the Cole shooting, which was still under investigation at the time, and gave misleading information about his fatal shootings, according to the report, authored by attorney Steven Biskupic. 
Mensah’s three shootings in Wauwatosa also became the subject of several lawsuits. In 2021, a John Doe hearing was called to review the Anderson shooting, after which a Milwaukee County Circuit Court judge ruled that probable cause existed to charge Mensah with a crime. Special prosecutors appointed to the case, however, declined to pursue charges. 
In 2025, Mensah testified before state legislative committees to advocate for prohibitions against the use of the John Doe law to review fatal shootings by police. Mensah told Wisconsin Examiner that he’d sought a promotion to lieutenant while at the sheriff’s department, but was unsuccessful. 
Another federal civil lawsuit involving the Cole shooting was brought to trial, and a judge found that Mensah and other officers provided contradictory statements. Wisconsin Examiner also found that Mensah and other officers violated policies related to police shooting investigations in the Milwaukee area. The Cole trial in 2025 ended in a hung jury, with a retrial scheduled for early September. 
In a statement to Wisconsin Examiner, a spokesperson for the Waukesha County Sheriff’s Department said that agency staff “support Detective Mensah and wish him the best.” 
Attorney Kimberley Motley, who has represented the families of those killed by Mensah and the protesters who supported them, said in a statement to Wisconsin Examiner that the Cole family “is looking forward to the trial that is set in September against Joseph Mensah. Both the Alvin Cole and Jay Anderson family continue to focus on fighting for justice on behalf of their loved ones.”

Co-sponsors of Reed’s bill included a long list of state senators: Gary Boswell, Jared Carpenter, Shelley Funke Frommeyer, Jason Howell, Scott Madon, Stephen Meredith, Majority Caucus Chair Robby Mills, Michael Nemes, Matt Nunn, Steve Rawlings, Craig Richardson, Brandon Smith, Senate President Robert Stivers, Brandon Storm, Lindsey Tichenor, Robin Webb, Stephen West, Phillip Wheeler, Gex Williams, Majority Whip Mike Wilson and Majority Floor Leader Max Wise.
Testifying in the seat next to Reed was a representative from the National Rifle Association.

Before the committee voted to advance SB 75, Sen. Danny Carroll, a police officer for more than two decades, spoke against the bill. 
“I personally do not see anything to gain by passing this bill, and that’s from 24 years as a law enforcement officer,” Carroll said. “You know, you are always taught to assume that everyone is carrying a concealed weapon, mainly with the segment of society that law enforcement often deals with, and I think this is just going to kick this up to another level where they are going to be carrying concealed.”
Sen. Carroll continued, “I was lost when we took training away from carrying concealed with constitutional carry. My entire adult life as a law enforcement officer, I was trained regularly to know how and when to shoot that gun. The idea of people carrying a concealed weapon, who may not even know how to shoot that weapon, is terrifying. I think we went too far there, and I think this is another where we have gone too far.” 
Sen. Carroll’s warnings, in his area of expertise, were disregarded. 
Their discussion lasted ~25 minutes. The committee voted to send the bill to the senate floor, where it passed easily 26-11 before it stalled in the House.
Recent gun bills include, but are not limited to, the following:
Two years ago House Bill 153 made Kentucky a Second Amendment sanctuary state. HB 153 passed in the House 78-19 and in the Senate 27-9 and became law on March 28, 2023.
Senate Bill 13 was filed by GOP Sen. Whitney Westerfield in 2024 to address temporarily removing firearms from those who are mentally unstable. SB 13 was assigned to the Veterans, Military Affairs and Public Protection committee. It never received a hearing.
And it is notable that House Bill 5 — the omnibus anti-crime bill ignominiously titled the “Safer Kentucky Act” that garnered a massive amount of committee time, publicity and news coverage — addressed punishment for crimes after-the-fact but did not address prevention of gun violence at all. HB 5 became law on April 12, 2024.
Meanwhile, numerous firearm safety bills are proposed each year but never considered. What follows is a partial list of bills that were filed during Kentucky’s 2025 regular session. 
None of these bills ever received a hearing.
House Bill 330 — Prohibit firearm possession by convicted domestic abusers. 
House Bill 409 — Require a 5 day waiting period.  
Senate Bill 235 — A re-filing of 2024 Senate Bill 13 (CARR) to temporarily remove firearms from a person in mental health crisis. Neither bill received a hearing.  
House Bill 55 — Hold adults civilly liable for minors accessing their guns. 
House Bill 93 — A person shall not target shoot carelessly, recklessly, or without regard for the safety of any person.  
House Bill 20 — Prohibit unlawful storage of a firearm; establish elements of the crime as recklessly allowing access to an unsecured firearm by a minor.
House Bill 124 — Require background checks for private firearms sales; require reporting to law enforcement of firearm and ammunition thefts and losses; require the safe storage of firearms and more.
House Bill 214 — Tax credit for taking firearm training.  
Senate Bill 92 —Require destruction if the firearm was used in the commission of a violent offense.
Following the 2023 Old National Bank mass shooting in Louisville, the Kentucky Medical Association designated gun violence a public health crisis. The Lexington Herald-Leader reported: “Two of the KMA’s proposals related to gun safety include barbed criticisms of Kentucky’s GOP supermajority, which, as one resolution notes, ‘has denied protection of our school children, citizens and police officers by ignoring control measures for assault rifles and killing enhancements by avoiding enactment of effective background checks and ‘red flag’ laws.’”
Two years later, after the shooting of a Kentucky State Police officer and a shooting in a church, the Republican Party of Kentucky posted the following on its X account: “We are deeply shocked and heartbroken by the tragic attack on law enforcement and members of the faith community in central Kentucky. We ask everyone to join us in praying for the families of those who lost their lives and for the recovery of those who were injured.”
Kentucky’s gun laws are among the worst in the country. 
Our lawmakers are shocked, heartbroken, praying. And yet, year after year after year, these same lawmakers dismiss the advice of their own experts — like Sen. Carroll — and refuse to so much as consider bills to make Kentuckians safer from gun violence.

(Photo by Parker Michels-Boyce for the Virginia Mercury)Facing renewed scrutiny after back-to-back water crises, Richmond Mayor Danny Avula has announced the creation of two new water-focused work groups aimed at building a more resilient regional system and restoring public trust.
“These two work groups mark a critical step forward in building a stronger, more resilient water system for the region,” Avula said in a statement. “Just today, we saw that spirit of collaboration in action as Richmond provided additional water to our neighboring locality during their planned maintenance. That’s what partnership looks like: clear communication, shared problem-solving, and mutual support.”
The announcement comes just weeks after a second major boil water advisory in less than six months rattled large portions of the city and surrounding counties. Though other central Virginia localities including Hopewell and Petersburg most recently experienced water-related emergencies, Richmond’s earlier water crises —  and its recovery and resilience efforts — remain a top focus of public concern.
Petersburg officials: flooding spurred by intense rain, aging water system, lack of river dredging

In January, a cascade of failures at Richmond’s aging Water Treatment Plant left thousands without safe water for nearly a week. And in late May, another operational issue forced the city to issue an emergency alert affecting dozens of neighborhoods across Richmond’s Northside, Southside and central districts.
Of the newly founded groups, one will focus internally on scenario planning and long-term financial strategy. Led by Chief Administrative Officer Odie Donald and Public Utilities Director Scott Morris, the team will evaluate capital investment needs, debt management strategies and ratepayer impacts. They will consult with external financial experts, including Davenport Financial Advisors and Raftelis.
The second group will be a regional collaboration, including water utility leaders and technical experts from Chesterfield, Hanover, and Henrico counties, whose water systems connect to Richmond’s. That team will coordinate operations, capital improvement plans, rate models, and joint funding requests. It will also formalize a routine communication structure to keep all partners updated.
“These work groups and real-time collaborations are exactly what it takes to meet the challenges of modern infrastructure,” Morris said. “The ability to assist Henrico in this way underscores our capacity, but more importantly, it shows how jurisdictional coordination helps us all move forward with confidence.”
But the mayor’s announcement lands in the shadow of Richmond’s troubled recent track record. 
On May 27, just as the system was recovering from early-morning repairs, filters at the water plant re-clogged after running at full capacity. Pressure dropped in the Ginter Park tank, and by mid-morning, officials had issued a boil water advisory that later expanded across the city, covering areas from Carytown to Manchester and VCU to Ancarrow’s Landing.
New boil water advisory issued in Richmond, months after January water crisis

Avula acknowledged that the city’s messaging to residents changed throughout the day, with the first public notice assuring the public that drinking water was unaffected, followed by a citywide boil alert a few hours later. He said the delay was due to the city’s efforts to first alert neighboring localities and reduce demand before informing the broader public.
The city had reached out to Chesterfield and Henrico counties to “try to figure out, ‘hey, what can we do to reduce demand on the system?’” Avula said at the time. “That allowed us to have more time to recover the facility and then make a plan of action to move forward.”
The flip-flop in messaging only added to public frustration following the January disaster, which state health officials have called “completely avoidable.” 
In an April report, the Virginia Department of Health blamed the January failure on “a long chain of preventable failures,” including untested backup batteries, broken valves, and a failure to follow emergency protocols. The water plant flooded after a winter storm knocked out power and backup systems failed.
“The crisis could have been prevented with better operational decisions,” said State Health Commissioner Dr. Karen Shelton upon the report’s release. “Our goal now is to ensure corrective actions are taken swiftly and effectively, so Richmond-area families can trust their water supply.”
In response to the January incident, the city received a second formal violation notice and is now under state mandate to develop a corrective action plan. An independent engineering probe identified more than $63 million in urgent infrastructure upgrades on top of the $60 million already proposed in Richmond’s capital plan.
Those include automating emergency systems, modernizing electrical infrastructure, and redesigning critical flood-prone elements of the treatment plant.
While Avula praised the Department of Public Utilities’ recent work, the VDH report described a “culture of complacency” where makeshift fixes became standard and systemic risks went unaddressed.
Now, as summer heats up, the mayor hopes that formalizing collaboration and financial planning will signal a turning point. Both newly created work groups have already begun meeting to chart next steps, the city said in a statement.

(Photo by Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)When Dominion Energy Virginia filed its latest integrated resource plan (IRP) last fall, critics (including me) complained that the company failed to lay out a cost-effective approach that would meet soaring energy demand from data centers while complying with Virginia’s decarbonization mandate. We hoped regulators at the State Corporation Commission would reject the IRP and demand better of our largest utility.
Instead, they chickened out. 
The SCC’s final order, issued July 15, is short but not really to the point. The order finds Dominion’s IRP “legally sufficient,” while citing previous SCC orders for the proposition that “acceptance” doesn’t mean approval “of the magnitude or specifics of Dominion’s future spending plans.” It would be hard to imagine a less enthusiastic endorsement, and the lack of analysis leaves advocates wondering, where’s the meat?
SCC says Dominion’s future spending plan ‘legally sufficient,’ warns against impact on consumers

It’s true that an IRP is “only” a planning document; it doesn’t commit a utility to carrying out the plan, and the SCC still has to approve any project the utility decides to move forward with. But the point of the exercise is to ensure utilities are on the right track; that their demand projections are on target and their plans for meeting demand are realistic, cost-effective and comply with all relevant laws. This needs discussion and analysis, not merely an up-or-down vote.
Admittedly, the SCC has a long history of approving lousy IRPs while directing Dominion to do a better job the next time. That was the case here, too, with the order directing Dominion to do a few things differently in its next IRP, due in the fall of 2026. 
First, the SCC wants to see a 20-year timeline instead of the 15-year period that Dominion used this year, which is all the law requires. It’s an obvious ask, even apart from the fact the SCC cites that the regional grid operator PJM uses a 20-year planning window. A better reason is that we are just 20 years away from Dominion’s 2045 deadline for full decarbonization under the Virginia Clean Economy Act (VCEA), and anything the utility does now will have consequences extending out to that deadline. 
The SCC also neglected to mention that using just a 15-year window, and omitting the 25-year planning period that Dominion included in previous IRPs, allowed the company to avoid showing the economic consequences to consumers of spending money for fossil fuel generation that either will shut down or may become economically obsolete by 2045, long before the plants are paid off. If Dominion thinks it can justify sinking customers’ money into assets it knows will become stranded, we all deserve to see the rationale. 
The order also directs Dominion to include in its modeling at least one pathway that complies with the requirement of the VCEA that carbon-emitting facilities (including any new gas plants) be retired by 2045. This goes beyond obvious: the lack of a VCEA-compliant plan should have prompted the SCC to reject the IRP outright. 
But of course, Dominion claims new gas plants are needed for reliability, which would make them legal under the VCEA in spite of their carbon emissions and questionable long-term viability. Reliability is a red herring, as I’ve argued, and other parties to the IRP case modeled how Dominion can meet demand without building new fossil fuels. Dominion should have been required to prove its case.
But here again, the SCC chose not to engage on the issue. Requiring Dominion to do better next time is as far as it is willing to go. This is unfortunate, but the silence can’t last: in March, Dominion filed for approval of the first of its planned new gas plants. The SCC will have to address need and reliability to make a decision in that case, and it would have been better for all concerned if it had grappled with these questions now.
The order falls short in other ways, as well. While the SCC expresses concern about forecasted rate increases, it doesn’t even mention the data centers that are driving the problem. 
This is astonishing; even before Dominion filed its IRP last fall, the commission ordered the company to supplement the record with an analysis of data center impacts. When Dominion did so, it became clear that all of the load growth (and likely, much of the projected rate increases) results from this one industry. It’s beyond strange that the SCC does not even mention the supplement it ordered, or discuss whether Dominion’s duty to serve truly prevents it from protecting existing customers.
The order also accepts Dominion’s argument that it had to artificially limit the amount of low-cost solar it could include in its modeling, due to the increased difficulty of siting solar projects in Virginia. It’s true that many rural counties have been denying permits to solar projects, even as they approve data centers. But I’ve also heard a Dominion lobbyist tell legislators that permit denials have not been a problem for the company, an assertion that may have persuaded some legislators to vote against bills that would make solar siting easier. It appears Dominion tells legislators one thing and the SCC another. 
The SCC’s order contains a few other requirements for the next IRP, mostly things that really should have been included in this one. The IRP should model Virginia’s return to the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, reflecting a Virginia court’s ruling that Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s withdrawal was unlawful. The IRP should assume Dominion achieves the energy efficiency targets that the SCC itself established for the company. Dominion should include an analysis of impacts on base rates and should share its modeling with utility watchdog Clean Virginia, as well as run modeling based on SCC staff inputs. Long-duration storage, a maturing technology that can replace gas combustion turbines, should be included in the next modeling.
Is it too hot for common sense?

“Do better next time” is a well-worn directive from the SCC to Dominion, but it is deeply disappointing at a time when Virginia is facing an unprecedented surge in demand from data centers and accompanying increases in utility rates. 
It’s disappointing in another way, too: this is the first major ruling from the SCC since two new judges were added to the three-member commission, and all three were appointed by a Democratically-controlled Senate. If there was ever a time for the SCC to get tough with Dominion on its climate obligations, this should have been it. 
No doubt, the problem lies in Dominion’s influence over the entire process. The utility doles out exceedingly generous campaign donations to members of both parties, so the company retains influence no matter who is in power. Not only does this give Dominion sway over who is appointed to the SCC, but commissioners have to be mindful that getting reappointed at the end of their six-year terms depends on how satisfied these Dominion-backed senators are with their rulings. 
As long as Dominion is allowed to shower senators with unlimited campaign cash, the SCC will never be free of the utility’s pernicious influence. 
Meanwhile, though, Dominion’s poor performance, and the SCC’s unwillingness to call it out, demonstrate the necessity of the comprehensive IRP reform legislation that the governor vetoed this spring. The Commission on Electric Utility Regulation is already working on similar legislation for the next session. 
Passing the IRP reform bill may not inject the SCC with greater courage, but it will ensure the commission, and the public, get a fuller look at the facts.

(Photo by Dan Reynolds Photography/Getty Image)The Community College of Rhode Island (CCRI) was awarded a $1 million grant to expand its skilled trade programs, the Lowe’s Foundation announced Friday. 
The funding will allow CCRI to grow its electrical apprenticeship program,  launched last November with funding from the state Department of Labor and Training, offering lessons in math, blueprints, financial literacy and other topics for aspiring construction workers. 
The Lowe’s Foundation grant will also help energize the Ready to Build program, which focuses on construction and building trades in Rhode Island, which ranked among the three slowest states for new housing construction last year, according to data released by the U.S. Census Bureau in May 2025.
Gov. Dan McKee proposed an $800,000 investment in the school’s pre-apprenticeship Ready to Build program in his fiscal 2026 budget. But it ultimately went unfunded in the final spending plan even as the Executive Office of Housing pursues a goal of building 15,000 new homes in the state over the next five years. 
The grant money will be used to create lab spaces to increase capacity for CCRI classes as well as craft a credited program that combines a new construction management certificate with a degree program, the foundation said. 
Rosemary A. Costigan, the president of CCRI, in a statement called the grant “an extraordinary recognition” of the school’s commitment to building career paths for skilled tradespeople. 
“With this investment, we will equip our students with the tools and technology they need to thrive — and help meet Rhode Island’s growing demand for a highly trained workforce,” Costigan said. 
CCRI is one of 12 community colleges nationwide this year awarded a total of $7 million via the foundation’s Gable Grants program, and the only school in New England to receive one. In the 2024 grant cohort, Central Maine Community College won a $500,000 grant from the foundation.  
The Lowe’s Foundation is an independent nonprofit created by the home improvement retail giant and was designed to infuse $50 million into community and technical schools over five years, with the goal of training 50,000 tradespeople. Grants have also been awarded to community and nationally based nonprofits. Since its inauguration round of grants in 2023, the initiative has deposited $43 million into education coffers in 28 states, with the aim of boosting education in fields like carpentry, construction, HVAC, electrical work, plumbing and property maintenance.

Dance eases anxiety, strengthens resilience and improves the ability to regulate one’s emotions. And it’s been a lifelong pursuit for the Pawtucket resident, shown in Slater Park. (Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)I was drowning. My mind raced, thoughts tangled so fast I couldn’t catch them. School felt like a battlefield, and every day, I lost. Teachers gave up, calling me lazy, distracted, too much to handle.
Eventually, I saw a psychiatrist who prescribed medication. I stayed on it for almost two years, adjusting dosages and switching prescriptions in hopes that something would click. Some days, I felt numb. Other days, I felt anxious in a whole new way. While the meds quieted the noise, they also dulled everything else. My energy, my motivation, and my sense of self faded. I wasn’t healing. I was disappearing.
Then came dance.
My mother signed me up for a local class after school when I was 8, hoping it would help me release some of the energy bottled up inside. I almost didn’t go. But the moment I stepped into the studio, something shifted. Dance didn’t ask me to sit still. It let me exist exactly as I was. The constant movement matched the rhythm of my thoughts and let me breathe without fear of falling behind. For the first time, my body and mind worked together instead of fighting each other. I felt alive.
We are in a youth mental health crisis. According to the CDC, rates of depression among adolescents have doubled in the past decade.  Rates of anxiety have also significantly increased. Yet creativity is still treated like a luxury. That needs to change.
Science backs up what I lived. Researchers at Harvard and Columbia have shown that dance activates brain regions tied to emotional regulation and memory. A 2021 meta-analysis in Frontiers in Psychology examined over 100 studies and confirmed what I knew deep in my bones. Dance therapy eases anxiety, strengthens resilience, and connects people in ways nothing else can.
Despite this evidence, the arts are dismissed as hobbies. They are stripped from schools, underfunded in community programs, and left out of serious mental health policy. In the last decade alone, public arts support dropped nearly 30%, even as creative programs have been shown to reduce stress and boost engagement, especially for neurodiverse youth and students in high-need districts.










The moment I stepped into the studio, something shifted. Dance didn’t ask me to sit still. It let me exist exactly as I was. 


Traditional treatment models leave too many behind. Therapy is expensive and out of reach for those who need it most. Medication helps some but fails others. Schools continue to cut arts funding, closing doors that could be lifelines.
Mental health care must be wide enough to catch everyone, not just those who respond to clinical methods. We need to broaden what healing looks like.
Schools must restore arts programs as essential emotional infrastructure. Community centers should create space for movement, music, and visual art when words are not enough. Policymakers must recognize the arts as valid, evidence-based care and fund them accordingly.
And readers, this includes you. Advocate for school arts funding by writing to your local school board or city council. Support community programs that use dance or art for healing. Ask your representatives what they are doing to make mental health care more inclusive and remind them that the arts matter.
Creativity is not a luxury. It is survival.

(Getty Images)One of my doctoral students recently graduated, and with his experience as a student researcher, he secured a job in a research lab at a large information technology company.
That’s part of how federal research funding makes an impact: it provides crucial support to train the next generation of scientists, engineers, inventors, and entrepreneurs.
Sharp reductions in funding to the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health are in the news, and much more depends on their funding than the creation of knowledge. We risk not only lost research, but also lost training for highly skilled labor, with repercussions that may never be fully remedied.
I’m an associate professor in the College of Information Sciences and Technology at Penn State, and I frequently encounter misconceptions when I talk about what it’s like to perform research as a professor. Many people think that professors do all of the work of research, with students having minimal or no involvement. Within STEM (science technology, engineering, and mathematics), that’s far from the truth. Modern research is labor-intensive and requires the involvement of many people, especially students.

It’s common for a research-active professor to have several students working with them on projects. Professors know the landscape of their subject area and they use that knowledge to identify productive research topics, to guide students through developing them, and to help them create impactful results.
Students run experiments, collect samples and data, and analyze results, among other tasks. Professors sometimes say that their students run individual projects, while the professor provides strategic leadership and runs the lab.
Research grants pay for the expenses of research, and student salaries and tuition are two of the largest expenses. In the grants I receive, they’re the largest direct costs by far. Many STEM graduate students, especially doctoral students, are employed as research assistants. These positions pay a small salary to perform research and typically cover tuition and benefits too. Without that financial support, these students wouldn’t be able to devote five or six years to the research activities and training necessary for a doctoral degree.
Toward workforce development, research is one of the most effective — and personally rewarding –ways that we can train students for future STEM careers. Student researchers learn how to tackle difficult problems for which there are no answer keys, because research is the process of creating the answers.
They learn to work in collaborative teams, give presentations, write well, and integrate feedback on their work. All of this happens in a hands-on, open-ended setting that course-based learning does not provide.
The benefits to students exceed those, even. Graduate student researchers build professional networks by collaborating and attending conferences. Undergraduate researchers get intellectual enrichment beyond what coursework can provide, as well as a preview of what graduate school is like.
Anecdotally, regardless of their career paths, many student researchers also report high satisfaction with their work. The knowledge that one researcher creates might be modest, but the aggregation of that knowledge –across many researchers, over time — improves our understanding of the natural world and produces new technologies to benefit humanity.
Replacing academic research with corporate research is sometimes floated as an option, but this is infeasible for multiple reasons. One is the distinction between applied research and basic research. Applied research is focused on creating knowledge specifically to enable new products and services.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
In contrast, basic research expands what humanity knows or what we can do, both in a broad sense. Applied research relies upon people trained in an environment of basic research, where they have the freedom to think creatively and study fundamental problems.
Research universities provide that environment.
Beyond that distinction, the costs of training researchers make it unlikely for companies to provide the same experience universities are built to offer. Doctoral students spend several years learning how to perform research, and during that equivalent time in a company, they would contribute little—if anything—to the company’s bottom line. Except at a few very large companies, creating a robust learning environment doesn’t fit into industry structure or goals, while universities are designed around education.
I already see the repercussions of uncertainty in the funding landscape: one of my master’s students lost a research assistantship that he expected to receive this fall. This is one example among many of a growing disruption in our universities’ abilities to produce skilled researchers. This production can withstand small disruptions, but a large one like we’re witnessing puts it in serious peril.
We depend on student researchers for many advancements in science and technology, and they depend on us to support their work. Pennsylvania’s legislators and our representatives in Congress can play their role by standing up for NSF and NIH funding.

(Photo by David DeWitt, Ohio Capital Journal.)Ohio House Republican leaders are making a last-ditch effort to convince their GOP colleagues to override several of Gov. Mike DeWine’s vetoes.
It’s now a numbers game as the majority of legislators try to overturn three school-specific vetoes the governor made in the state operating budget.
“I don’t know what the numbers will be,” DeWine said Friday.
And state Rep. David Thomas, who has been leading the property tax relief charge, doesn’t know the number of votes he has, either. But he does know what his district wants, he said.
“I hear, literally every day still, from my constituents that their property taxes are spiking, that they’re too high, it’s just pushing them to the brink,” state Rep. David Thomas, R-Jefferson, said.
Both educators and homeowners say the stakes are high.
DeWine vetoed restrictions on the ability to put emergency levies on the ballot or request an increase to a current levy. That provision would have eliminated levy replacements on property taxes for all political subdivisions. For schools, it would have prohibited them from imposing a fixed-sum emergency levy, a substitute emergency levy and a combined school district income tax and fixed-sum property tax levy.
“It would have put school districts around the state in a constant levy cycle,” Cleveland Heights School Board Member Dan Heintz said. “Every voter would have had tax fatigue and levy fatigue.”
The governor vetoed another that would have required that emergency and substitute tax levies, incremental growth levies, conversion levies, and the property tax portion of combined income tax and property tax levies be included in the 20-mill floor calculation for school funding purposes.
He also removed a provision that would have allowed county budget commissions to unilaterally take money away from passed school levies if they find it “reasonably necessary.”
Lawmakers have admitted that they have struggled to pass any meaningful property tax reform for years, hurting homeowners like Beth Blackmarr. Thomas said this is their attempt.
“You can own your home outright and lose your home, something that you’ve worked hard and paid all your life for, and lose that because you can’t pay the property taxes on it,” Blackmarr said.
Overriding the governor takes 60 votes. With only 65 Republicans, Thomas can only afford to lose six people. There are signs that House Leadership is concerned about whether they have the votes.
Former House Speaker Jason Stephens, R-Kitts Hill, said he has been called and messaged repeatedly by both legislators and organizations as leadership tries to get lawmakers on board. Other lawmakers shared the same story of override supporters trying to whip votes.
“It’s going to be hard to convince me,” Stephens said, chuckling and acknowledging he can’t be convinced. “I’m not canceling my plans.”
The overrides will provide little relief to homeowners but more stress on schools, he said.
“It sends the wrong message to the people that there’s going to be this great big property tax relief if we override the governor’s veto — which is just simply not the case,” the former speaker said.
Stephens isn’t coming back for the override session, but if he were, he would be voting no, he said. We’ve confirmed that at least three other GOP lawmakers aren’t returning or are voting no. Three others told us they were on the fence, but leaning towards no. Several who had previously told WEW they were no votes could not be reached on Friday.
“I imagine I’ll still be answering questions even the morning of the override vote, just so that folks are as comfortable as possible,” Thomas said. “I’m pretty confident… that we’ll win the day on Monday.”
DeWine says that the lawmakers have the right to override him, as he has already made his point.
“I’m not going to talk about what the numbers are going to be,” he said, smiling.
To discourage an override, the governor created a new property tax working group to evaluate the best solutions. It will be run by former Cincinnati Republican lawmaker Bill Seitz and Ohio Business Roundtable CEO Pat Tiberi.
According to Seitz, they are set to meet after the vote.
“I’ve made my position clear on it. They’re going to do what they think is best, again, as part of our process set in the Constitution of Ohio,” he said. “You’re seeing that play out, so we’ll see what happens on Monday.”

Joe Cook/Georgia RiversGeorgia environmentalists are still celebrating a conservation group’s announcement last month that it plans to purchase thousands of acres of land targeted for mining near the Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge. 
But they read the win, they say, not as a moment to pop the champagne, but a call to action.
Mining interests are still eyeing property near the refuge, they say, and to preserve additional acreage, they need to build on their advocacy efforts, including persuading environmental groups to buy mineral rights in other areas attractive to mining businesses and highlighting easements for purchase along mineral-rich Trail Ridge.
And they say they need to continue to press Georgia leaders to enact the legal protections for the Okefenokee that have eluded them for years at the state Capitol. Lawmakers will return to Atlanta for a new legislative session in January. 
“We can’t rest on our laurels,” said Brian Foster, a spokesman for Georgia Conservancy, one of the environmental groups leading the charge. “There is still a lot of work to be done.”
There’s a reason for their urgency, Georgia environmentalists said.
In the late 1990s, the environmental community thought the Okefenokee was safe from mining after chemical giant DuPont was persuaded to donate thousands of acres to The Conservation Fund because of public opposition to DuPont’s mining plans. 
Three decades later, Alabama-based Twin Pines Minerals, which has owned land along Trial Ridge since 2019, appeared close this year to realizing its plans to mine the area for titanium dioxide, a whitening agent in toothpaste, paint, sunscreen and other products.
But The Conservation Fund, a nonprofit based in Arlington, Virginia, stepped in again, announcing late last month that it would spend almost $60 million to purchase close to 8,000 acres owned by Twin Pines.
Environmentalists were elated, but quickly turned their attention to protecting land that could still be purchased for mining.
“If there is one thing that is abundantly clear to us is that the past is prologue when it comes to the Okefenokee,” said Christian Hunt, chairman of the Okefenokee Protection Alliance. 
“Roughly 25 years ago we were pretty much in the same position we’re in today,” said Hunt, who also is director of national wildlife refuges and parks program for Defenders of Wildlife. “It’s very clear to everybody involved at this stage that goodwill alone is not going to save the swamp and we need to secure durable protections.”
Environment Georgia launched a campaign to collect 10,000 signatures calling on Gov. Brian Kemp to pursue permanent protections for the Okefenokee just days after The Conservation Fund’s announcement. The organization hopes to meet its goal by the end of the summer. 
“We know that there are mineral rights that are still in the hands of people who could and would like to use them, so we would like to make sure that we find a permanent protection that ensures that there is not another mine proposed,” Environment Georgia Director Jennette Gayer said. 
“Our hope is that we do not find ourselves in the same position a couple of decades from now,” she said. 
Kim Bednarek, executive director of Okefenokee Swamp Park and Adventures, said environmentalists are not the only ones concerned about the refuge. It has a direct impact on the economies of Charlton, Ware and Clinch counties, which are home to the majority of the Okefenokee’s shallow, 438,000-acre, peat-filled wetland along the Georgia-Florida border.
A healthy Okefenokee promotes agritourism in the three small south Georgia counties, which have a combined population of about 54,000 people, as well creating jobs and encouraging workforce development, she said. 
In addition, the Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge has been nominated to be a UNESCO World Heritage Site, which could further boost its visitation numbers, Bednarek said. A decision on the nomination is expected next year. 
More than 800,000 people visit the Okefenokee annually, according to Okefenokee Swamp Park and Adventures. Visitors spend about $91.5 million in Ware, Charlton, and Clinch counties.
“It’s really a huge opportunity for the region and the gateway communities around the Okefenokee to benefit from increased tourism and educational and research activities,” Bednarek said. “We want to see more sustained attention and investment in the communities and the people around the Okefenokee. If the people are benefitting from a conserved landscape, then they’ll want to make sure the landscape stays preserved.”
Megan Huynh, senior attorney and wetlands and coasts program leader for the Southern Environmental Law Center, echoed Bednarek.
“Now that the mine is gone, there’s a responsibility to support opportunities for those communities that aren’t at odds with the health of the Okefenokee,” she said.
Mike Worley, president and CEO of the Georgia Wildlife Federation, said the goal is to use every available tool to ensure the future of the Okefenokee.
“The main thing right now is to celebrate the victory that we’ve had and be prepared to finish the job,” he said.

(File photo by Hadley Barndollar/New Hampshire Bulletin)Robie Farm has raised beef, pork, and poultry in Piermont since 1870. Twelve miles up Route 10, sandwiched between the Connecticut River and the Appalachian Trail, the Haverhill Cooperative Middle School has served lunches to adolescents since 1968. 
But due to the complicated and frugal economics driving school meal supplies, the farm has never been a natural supplier to the school district up the road. Amid the thorny, balance-sheet-driven purchase decisions year after year, beef and chicken from out of state typically win the day. 
Last school year, that changed slightly: The school district’s food supplier bought about $3,000 of beef patties from Robie Farm, said Jonathan Flopke, the farm’s sales and operations manager. And this coming school year, the district is seeking to increase those purchases, boosted by a new grant from the state intended to build on a movement: “Farm to School.” 
New Hampshire is spending $190,000 on a pilot program to improve the ability of school districts to buy food from New Hampshire farms. In May, the Department of Agriculture, Markets, and Food awarded eight school districts amounts ranging from $10,000 to $50,000 for the coming school year; the Executive Council approved those awards in late June.
The program is intended to help the department learn how to increase those purchases, and will “provide an opportunity to work with a small number of school districts to identify challenges in the procurement framework,” as well as look at the feasibility of incorporating, according to the department’s request to the Executive Council. 
Haverhill, which is receiving $19,000, will use the money to buy more from Robie and other farms, says Dolores Fox, the district’s superintendent.
“The intent there is that we work with our local providers, recognizing that the cost there may be more than if we were working with a larger supplier,” Fox said. 
State grants will also go to seven other school districts: Newfound Area School District, Colebrook School District, Exeter Region School District, Jaffrey-Rindge Cooperative School District, Northumberland School District, Fall Mountain Regional School District, and Littleton School District.
Those schools must increase the volume or variety of New Hampshire products incorporated into the food they serve, according to the grant agreement, and must provide data to the department on those products. That food can include dairy, fish, pork, beef, poultry, eggs, fruits, vegetables, cider, maple syrup, and minimally processed dairy, produce, and protein. The product must originate in New Hampshire but may be processed anywhere in New England. 
The schools are also required to check in monthly with the University of New Hampshire’s existing Farm to School program to discuss how the funding is being spent and how to better connect schools with farms.
The program was intended to give an award to one school district per county, but there was less demand than expected — eight schools applied in total, and no schools applied from Belknap, Carroll, Hillsborough, or Strafford counties.
To Stacey Purslow, the program coordinator for the UNH Farm to School initiative, the challenge for schools lies not in desire for local food, but in the cost.
With tight budgets, constraints on food supply chains, and inflation, schools often save money by purchasing from larger suppliers, Purslow noted. That can mean buying from food warehouses in Chelsea, Mass., who in turn source their food from across the country. 
Many schools, like Haverhill, contract with the Abbey Group, a Vermont-based food service management company that works with schools across New England. In those cases, the company usually makes the decisions on where to buy certain food items, not the school district.
New Hampshire schools have shown increasing interest in recent years in building their partnerships with farms. That’s what the UNH Farm to School program, created in 2003, is meant to help facilitate.
But this is the first time lawmakers have set aside money to directly help fund those school partnerships, Purslow said.
When done well, the partnerships benefit both the schools and the farmers, Purslow said.
“It does support agriculture, and it keeps our agricultural land in farming, instead of selling out to developments,” she said. “Local food can be more nutritious. You can find more variety if you buy local foods. It’s fresher. It hasn’t traveled across the country. It hasn’t been picked unripe. It’s just better for you.”
But Purslow and others have also acknowledged New Hampshire’s Farm to School program is in a fledgling stage. The $190,000 across the state, which was approved by lawmakers in 2024, is not much, even divided among just eight school districts. And the funding is one-time. Lawmakers have not indicated whether they will appropriate more, but there is no money in the two-year budget to do so. 
Vermont, in contrast, has run a state-supported farm-to-school program since 2006. Its robust agriculture industry has helped that initiative grow, said Purslow.
In New Hampshire, absent similar state financing, some schools have made independent arrangements with farms.
At Brookdale Fruit Farm in Hollis, fall heralds more than just the apple-picking season. It now also includes the return to school.
The farm has long sold its apples in bulk to grocery stores, wholesale buyers, and distributors, some of which supply schools. But increasingly, it has been making direct sales to local schools, which are skipping the distributors and picking up directly from the farm.
It started with sales of no-sugar-added applesauce, said Zoe Stapp, one of the farm’s managers. That expanded to apples and cider, a few cases a week. Now, some schools are consistent customers, ordering large quantities through the winter, she said.
Unlike the apples bought through distributors, the local purchases are cheaper for the schools, fresher — packed within two days of being sent to the schools — and more customizable, Stapp says. Food service directors and other school staff can select specific varieties of apples from the farm, much like any in-person customer.
The partnerships help the farm, too. They are able to more easily sell smaller apples, which are better for younger children. And they help increase community awareness of the farm, Stapp said. And they help when the crowds of families begin to wane.
“A lot of people, because their kids are in school, aren’t coming out to your farm stand, they’re not visiting your pick-your-own during the week,” Stapp said. “So it gives us another outlet to move our product, especially in the slower season.”
More attention and investment through the state’s pilot program will only help, she added.
In Haverhill, that local support for agriculture has long thrived. The produce and livestock at the North Haverhill Fair every July is a testament.
“Agriculture as an industry is a part of our community —not just a part of our heritage, but also an active part of our current community,” Fox said. 
But this year, there will be a new tribute to Upper Valley farms. When the school releases its weekly menus, some descriptions will include a note on which ingredients are local, and from which farms.
“It’s another way of advertising that relationship, of sharing that relationship,” Fox said.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/IMG_8053-1-1024x671.jpg,,,2025-07-21 05:56:11.261557

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)Congress set aside $50 billion for rural hospitals and medical providers to allay fears over the billions more in historic cuts to federal health care spending that President Donald Trump signed into law on Independence Day.
But is that bandage big enough to save struggling rural hospitals?
“I have more questions than I have answers,” said Alan Morgan, CEO of the National Rural Health Association, a nonprofit policy group. “No one has those answers yet.”
Morgan noted that the new money for rural health, to be spent over five years, is far less than the $155 billion in rural Medicaid spending cuts over 10 years, as estimated by KFF, a nonprofit health policy and research group.
Experts, hospital leaders and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle fear that Trump’s signature legislation will particularly gut rural hospitals and clinics, which see an outsize share of patients who are insured through Medicaid, the federal-state public health insurance for people with low incomes. The new law slashes more than $1 trillion from Medicaid over the next 10 years to help pay for tax cuts that disproportionately benefit the wealthy.

The $50 billion addition was an effort by Republican leaders in Congress to win the votes of colleagues within their party who initially balked at supporting such steep cuts to Medicaid and other health services.
In the U.S. Senate, the rural program helped secure the vote of Alaska moderate Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who expressed concern about the law’s impact on health care in her state. About 1 in 3 Alaskans are insured through Medicaid.
Jared Kosin, the president and CEO of the Alaska Hospital & Healthcare Association, said he’s deeply frustrated with the new law’s gutting of Medicaid funding, which he thinks will wreak lasting damage on Alaskans. And Republicans sidestepped potential solutions by just throwing money into a program, he said.
“It’s frustrating in the public realm when decisions like this are made fast and, frankly, carelessly,” he said.
“The consequences are going to fall on us, not them.”
More than half of the law’s cuts to funding in rural areas are concentrated in 12 states with large rural populations that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act to cover more people, according to KFF: Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania and Virginia.
Some GOP lawmakers in Congress have heralded the $50 billion rural program as a health care victory. But it’s still unclear which hospitals, clinics and other providers would receive money and how much.
 How it works

The Rural Health Transformation Program will dole out $10 billion annually from fiscal years 2026 through 2030.
States must apply for their funding by the end of this year, submitting a detailed plan on how it would be used.
The law outlines some ways that states can use the money, according to an analysis of the legislation from the Bipartisan Policy Center:

Making payments to rural hospitals to help them maintain essential services such as emergency room care or labor and delivery.
Recruiting and training rural doctors, nurses and other health workers.
Bolstering emergency medical services such as ambulances and EMTs.
Using new technologies, including telehealth.
Providing opioid use disorder treatment and mental health services.
Improving preventive care and chronic disease management.

Half of the $10 billion each year will be distributed evenly across states that have applied for it. The other half can be distributed by the administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services — currently Dr. Mehmet Oz — at his discretion, based on a state’s rural population and rural health facilities.
Although the program doesn’t replace the amount states are likely to lose, Morgan said it’s still an opportunity to rethink how rural health care is funded. He’d like to see states given flexibility in how they’re able to use the funds, and he hopes they focus on keeping rural communities healthy through preventive care while still helping hospitals keep their doors open.
“If done correctly, it could really change the future course for rural America,” Morgan said. “That is such a tough ask, though.”
 Hardest hit

Kentucky could take the biggest hit from the new law’s reduction in rural Medicaid funding, losing an estimated $12 billion over 10 years, according to a KFF analysis.

The state’s Medicaid department is still waiting for additional federal guidance to understand how the state’s program will be affected, Kendra Steele, spokesperson with the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services, told Stateline in a statement.
“Over 1.4 million Kentuckians rely on Medicaid — including half of all children in our state, seniors and more vulnerable populations — and the passage of legislation on the federal level will have serious impacts for those individuals, rural health care and hospitals and local economies,” she wrote.
Even with the new program, states across the country will have to reevaluate their budgets in light of the cuts, said Hemi Tewarson, executive director at the National Academy for State Health Policy, a nonpartisan group that supports states in developing health care policies.
“Every region is slightly different and there’s not a one-size-fits-all approach,” she said. “Hospital ownership varies [as well as] the types of services that are critical for the community where they’re located. They have to think about new ways to provide those services in a context with fewer resources.”
About 44% of rural hospitals are operating in the red, according to a KFF analysis of Rand Hospital Data, a higher share than the 35% of hospitals in urban areas.
 ‘Rural at heart’

Prior to the bill’s passage, Oz attempted to reassure U.S. House Republicans that their districts could get money from the program even if they weren’t specifically rural, Politico reported earlier this month.










We’re all rural at heart when it comes to money.


– Alan Morgan, CEO, National Rural Health Association




Pennsylvania Republican U.S. Rep. Rob Bresnahan said money would begin flowing to his district as early as the beginning of next year, telling the Wilkes-Barre Times Leader earlier this month that he met with Trump, Oz and others to secure pledges that hospitals in his district could access the fund. He represents the northeastern corner of Pennsylvania, which includes suburban and rural areas, as well as the cities of Scranton and Wilkes-Barre.


Though the legislation includes guidelines on which facilities or areas qualify as “rural,” Morgan, of the National Rural Health Association, expects a mad dash from lawmakers and providers to claim rural status in order to get a piece of the funding.
“That’s going to be a huge issue — defining who’s rural,” Morgan said. “We’re all rural at heart when it comes to money.”

(Photo by Amanda Mills/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)Cuts to food assistance and health care through the recently signed federal tax cut and sending bill may jeopardize Maine’s free school meals program.
Cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and Medicaid will not only leave thousands of families without access to the critical social safety nets, but also indirectly threaten whether Maine can keep offering free breakfast and lunch to all students, experts said. That’s because SNAP and Medicaid data is used by schools to determine who is eligible for free meals, and although all Maine students now eat for free, a higher percentage of families in a district qualifying for free or reduced breakfast and lunch means a higher federal reimbursement rate for the state.
“The ripple effect is devastating for some households,” said Anna Korsen, deputy director of Full Plates, Full Potential, a nonprofit focusing on food insecurity and nutrition. 
“And it’s the same households who are already struggling to make ends meet, already having to make really hard choices about, ‘Do I pay for rent? Do I pay for medicine? Do I pay for food?’”
Under the universal meal program, the state pays districts to offer meals without charging students, but the amount of money that comes from the federal government depends on the percentage of low-income families each public school serves. The higher the percentage of families that qualify for free meals, the bigger the federal reimbursement. 
Traditionally, this percentage was determined by parents filling out free-and-reduced meal applications, but now that school meals are free for all students, the state shifted away from relying on the applications and now uses different ways of determining the free and reduced meal eligibility in each school, which is an important data point used for various federally funded programs.
One of those ways is Direct Certification, under which if a student or their family is eligible for SNAP or Medicaid, a state-federal program that provides health coverage for low-income people, they automatically qualify for free school meals. So far, the Maine Department of Education has not received any guidance about potential changes to the Direct Certification process for free and reduced lunch benefits, according to department spokesperson Chloe Teboe. 
But due to changes in the “big, beautiful bill,” thousands of Mainers may lose access to SNAP or Medicaid, meaning they will no longer be counted in a school district’s percentage of students qualifying for free school meals — an important funding metric to determine poverty level within the district — although they are technically eligible. That means the state will not receive adequate reimbursement for providing meals to those students, adding to the state share of school meal funding.
“Free meals for all was already a big ask when it first went into law, and that was when the federal government was giving more money,” Allison Leavitt, nutrition director of the Lisbon School Department and president of the Maine School Nutrition Association said. “Now the feds are giving less money and it’s like, how do we do this?”
Some school districts, such as Lisbon, have secured Community Eligibility Provision (CEP) status for the next four years, which offers an alternative for school districts to not have to submit free and reduced meal eligibility every year. That status, which more than 120 schools are using this year, according to Maine Department of Education data, simplifies the process by automatically qualifying schools with a high percentage of low-income students for the higher federal reimbursement rate, and keeps them at that rate for a few years.
“CEP helps schools to focus on their primary job of feeding and educating kids, instead of trying to chase down all this paperwork to make sure they’re getting the right amount of federal funding to meet their students’ needs,” Korsen said. “It just streamlines everything and SNAP and Medicaid are really important programs that inform schools eligibility for CEP.”
Under former President Joe Biden’s administration, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees school lunch programs, lowered the program’s eligibility threshold from 40% to 25% of students from low-income families, meaning more Maine schools could receive federal meal funding starting the 2024-25 school year. That’s what allowed Leavitt’s district, which has about 30% of students eligible for free or reduced school meals, to seek the status.
School nutrition directors are now closely monitoring potential policy changes that might impact that program’s eligibility, she said. A few months ago, a federal budget proposal suggested raising the threshold to 60%, which would have only allowed a handful of Maine districts to qualify, and Leavitt’s district wouldn’t have been one of them. 
“Even though I am ‘locked in’ to CEP, they could come back next month and change something,” she said. “Should they go to 60%, almost nobody’s going to be eligible in Maine.”
The challenges of collecting free and reduced meal information manually 
If a school is not eligible for the Community Eligibility Provision, they have to rely on collecting income data by asking families to fill out free and reduced meal forms. These are not only time consuming from an administrative perspective but, since all Maine students continue to eat for free, there is little incentive for parents to fill them out. 
“You’re also probably going to see people refraining from participating just because of the burden of filling out all the extra paperwork that may be coming down the road,” said Erica Kenney, associate professor of public health nutrition at Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health.
As families lose SNAP and Medicaid benefits, schools will have a hard time keeping track of who qualifies for free and reduced meals on paper, Kenney said. 
“They’re still going to be there,” she said, “But there’s not going to be any way for states to know who’s there and who’s not there.”
Going back to this system also creates administrative burdens for school nutrition directors, who would need to track changing eligibility and potentially return to older, complex meal application processes to seek reimbursement, Leavitt added. Besides, because Maine’s income threshold for free meals is extremely low — $41,795 annually for a family of four —she said many students who realistically need free meals are not eligible for them based on the forms.
“In this day and age with the price of groceries, rent, cars, gas … it’s kind of a joke,” Leavitt said.
All three nutrition experts that spoke with Maine Morning Star warned that these changes threaten not just meal access, but students’ overall ability to learn and develop, highlighting the critical link between nutrition and educational success. Rural schools and districts with high poverty rates would be particularly vulnerable to these potential disruptions, they said.
“If kids aren’t eating at home outside of school, their ability to learn and develop and be a healthy person is impacted,” Korsen said. 
Beyond meal access, the changes could ripple through other educational funding streams, Korsen said. Title I grants and other federal educational support programs often rely on free and reduced-price meal data for allocation. As fewer students become automatically eligible, schools could see reduced funding for critical educational resources and support programs.

(Photo courtesy of the Connecticut Division of Scientific Services)Across the country, state and local crime labs are drowning in evidence.
From rape kits to drug samples to vials of blood, delays in forensic testing are stalling prosecutions, stretching court calendars and forcing impossible choices about what gets tested — and what doesn’t.
Now, as the need for forensic testing grows, state and local crime labs may face steep federal funding cuts that could further delay justice for victims, derail criminal investigations and overwhelm already backlogged systems.
Two key federal grant programs that support state and local forensic labs are at risk: One faces a major cut, while the other is funded below its authorized cap despite growing demand.
The proposed cuts have alarmed forensic experts and crime lab directors who say some labs rely heavily on these federal grants to keep up with mounting caseloads.
“That would have dire consequences on a lot of crime laboratories who depend on those funds for maintaining operations,” said Scott Hummel, the president of the American Society of Crime Laboratory Directors, a national nonprofit professional organization.
“If you limit those resources even further, there will be backlogs,” said Hummel, who also works as a quality assurance manager at the Kansas City Police Crime Laboratory in Missouri. “Those backlogs just keep growing and growing, and labs are forced to make difficult decisions on how they prioritize their casework.”
When labs fall behind
Crime labs are often invisible to the public but essential to criminal investigations. They test DNA, analyze drug samples, match ballistics and verify evidence in everything from rape cases to gun homicides. The evidence may lead to arrests, but it’s also critical in court, shaping outcomes for victims, defendants, prosecutors and defense attorneys alike.
But years of underinvestment have left many labs without enough scientists, equipment and funding to keep up. As forensic technology has advanced — particularly in digital evidence and DNA testing — demand also has risen sharply.
More states are tracking rape kits. But key support for survivors may be slipping away.

“As technology gets better, there’s an expectation, I think, that labs can do more than they have the capacity for,” Hummel said.
At the same time, new state laws and testing mandates are increasing pressure on already strained labs. In some states, changes in drug laws — such as renewed crackdowns on marijuana or stricter DUI thresholds — have led to a surge in requests for toxicology and drug analysis. Other states have expanded mandatory evidence testing requirements, often without providing additional funding.
Some lab directors who spoke with Stateline said that even well-intentioned policies can create bottlenecks when resources don’t keep pace with demand.
“It’s important for policymakers to realize that the criminal justice system is demanding more from us, and so we need the resources to keep up with the increased demand,” said James Carroll, the crime laboratory director with the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department.
Low pay is also a challenge, with some analysts opting for private-sector jobs that offer higher salaries and better benefits. Training new analysts can take months or even years, making it difficult to quickly fill critical positions and retain experienced staff.
“We have to be absolutely perfect, and if you have something that isn’t perfect, that can be a career ruiner,” said Mike Lyttle, the assistant director of the forensic services division at the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation. “That is a lot of pressure.”
But that pressure can come at a cost — especially when analysts bear the brunt of it.
Lab directors and managers who spoke with Stateline said that overworking staff is not only inappropriate, but also risky. It can lead to quality issues, including “dry labbing,” or fabricated results, which could call hundreds or even thousands of cases into question.
As delays mount across the country, some state and local governments are rethinking how their crime labs are structured and funded.

– James Carroll, crime laboratory director with the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department


In Colorado, officials are dealing with the aftermath of a major DNA testing scandal involving state-run labs, and several new laws have been enacted to establish a review board and address backlogs. Lawmakers in Rhode Island considered a bill earlier this year that would have shifted oversight of its state crime lab to the state attorney general’s office, but the bill was tabled for further study.
In Shelby County, Tennessee, a new $1.5 million investment will go toward the region’s first local lab focused on rapid DNA analysis, digital forensics and weapons ballistics. Memphis City Council officials also are working on funding at least two new positions at a state laboratory to prioritize cases from the Memphis area.
Hard choices
The national push to test sexual assault kits has helped bring attention to forensic evidence backlogs. But in some labs, it has also forced tough choices about what gets tested first.
In Oregon, for example, Brian Medlock, the director of the state police forensic science division, announced in January that the state lab had halted DNA analysis for all property crime evidence. Testing won’t resume until the sexual assault kit backlog is cleared — a goal the agency doesn’t expect to meet until the end of the year. As of June, 474 sexual assault kits were still awaiting testing, according to the state’s dashboard.
Like Oregon, the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation also is deprioritizing nonviolent cases as it works through its rape kit backlog. The agency currently has six forensic biology analysts in training across the state, limiting how many cases it can process, according to Lyttle.
The goal is to eventually process lower-priority cases, he said, but the current focus remains on sexual assault kits. Still, Lyttle acknowledged that delaying the analysis of evidence in nonviolent cases can be a missed opportunity. Uploading DNA profiles from those cases to the national database, CODIS, could help identify offenders earlier — potentially before they go on to commit more serious crimes.
“You may be losing people early because you’re deprioritizing those nonviolent cases and not getting them identified as quickly as you could,” he said. “Every case is important.”
Looming cuts
Trump has proposed slashing one major forensic science grant program and holding funding flat for another — a combination that some officials fear could worsen evidence backlogs amid rising demand.
Street-level violence prevention programs have been decimated by Trump just ahead of summer

The Paul Coverdell Forensic Science Improvement Grants Program, which aims to help labs replace aging equipment, train staff and reduce case backlogs, would be cut by 71% under President Donald Trump’s proposed fiscal year 2026 budget — from $35 million to $10 million.
Another, the Debbie Smith DNA Backlog Grant Program, would receive $120 million under the proposal — below the $151 million cap authorized by Congress in 2023. While Congress can approve up to that amount, it often allocates less: $130 million in fiscal year 2023, and $120 million in both fiscal years 2024 and 2025.
The program helps labs process backlogged evidence, including sexual assault kits, and supports the expansion of the national DNA database, CODIS.
These proposals are part of the administration’s annual discretionary budget request; Congress must finalize federal agency yearly spending by Sept. 30. Presidential budget proposals are often reshaped by Congress, but Trump’s spending plans have found strong backing among Republicans on Capitol Hill. With the GOP holding majorities in both chambers, proposals to cut or limit funding for forensic science programs may be more likely to advance.
A state in crisis and a model for change
The Colorado Bureau of Investigation’s crime labs are under intense scrutiny following a major DNA testing scandal and widespread staffing shortages that have slowed down forensic work across the board. The bureau is facing backlogs in every discipline or type of case, according to Lance Allen, a deputy director who oversees forensic services.
Much of the current crisis stems from the case of Yvonne “Missy” Woods, a former DNA scientist now facing more than 100 criminal charges for allegedly manipulating DNA results over her 30-year career. Her alleged misconduct, combined with long-standing understaffing issues, has led to severe delays.
As of June, the average turnaround time for processing sexual assault kits in Colorado was 570 days, or about 1 1/2 years, with more than 1,200 kits still awaiting testing, according to the state’s dashboard. The agency’s goal is to reduce that timeline to 90 days.
“We are not satisfied with this turnaround time either, and this backlog is also unacceptable to us, and we know we have to do better,” Allen told Stateline.
States push to combat human trafficking amid federal funding cuts

But the backlog isn’t limited to sexual assault cases. Blood alcohol testing has also slowed dramatically, according to defense attorney Matthew Haltzman, who said he has handled cases in which results took five to six months to come back.
In that time, he said, even clients who were ultimately found not to be intoxicated were forced to navigate the court system — attending hearings, undergoing weekly drug and alcohol testing and complying with pretrial supervision.
“It’s just a lose-lose for everybody in the legal process, but more so for the accused than anyone else,” Haltzman said. “It’s a massive deprivation of liberty.”
The current turnaround time for all toxicology tests is 99 days, or just over three months, according to Vanessa Beall, the Colorado bureau’s toxicology program manager. About 80% of cases are completed within that time frame or less, and all toxicology tests include blood alcohol and drug analysis.
With additional toxicologists, the bureau is already meeting its 2025 goal and aims to reduce that turnaround time to 70 days by the end of 2026.
This year, the bureau and state lawmakers have rolled out measures aimed at restoring trust in the system. Those efforts include sending more than 1,000 rape kits to private labs to reduce turnaround times, expanding staff training programs and establishing a review board within the state attorney general’s office to improve oversight.
Lawmakers also approved $3 million to support outsourcing and lab operations, along with a separate law requiring the reporting of misconduct within Colorado’s state-run forensic laboratories.
Meanwhile, Connecticut is drawing national attention for its consistent performance and growing capabilities.
Once plagued by serious issues — including a suspended accreditation in 2011 that disrupted criminal proceedings — Connecticut’s forensic lab has steadily strengthened its operations. This year, it earned a perfect accreditation score for the third year in a row.
Following its accreditation loss, the lab faced a backlog of 12,000 cases, and by 2013, turnaround times stretched up to 2 1/2 years. Today, the average turnaround is just 20 days across all disciplines.
DNA cases, including those involving sexual assault evidence, are typically processed in about 27 days. Firearms cases take about 35 days, and computer crimes about 60, according to Guy Vallaro, the director of the Connecticut Division of Scientific Services.
He credits much of the lab’s progress to its team of scientists and staff, who he says are deeply committed to both accuracy and improvement.
“When you have a good staff, you can do incredible things,” Vallaro said.

(Getty Images)New Hampshire is the 12th most expensive state to rent housing and Granite Staters must make about $27 an hour to comfortably afford a market-rate one-bedroom apartment, according to a national housing organization. 
The organization, the National Low Income Housing Coalition, produced a report last week called “Out of Reach” that compares the median prices of rent to the income levels required to pay that rent in each state. The analysis follows widely accepted guidance that households should not spend more than 30% of their income on rent. 
In New Hampshire, fair market rent for a one-bedroom apartment is now $1,401 per month, the report notes. That requires about $56,026 per year to afford that rent, above the median income for one person in New Hampshire of $46,197. Working 40 hours a week would require one person to make about $27 per hour, and wage data indicates that people in many industries make less than that, the report continues. Fast-food workers make a median hourly wage of $14.84, home health aides make $17.91, and retail salespeople make $17.34.
The data suggests that rent is out of reach for many unless they share apartments, work more than 40 hours a week, or spend more than 30% of their income on housing. 
The data also suggests that many households make less than they need to comfortably afford rent. In New Hampshire, 71,239 renting households make below 50% of the area median income, which equates to 45% of all renters. And at 50% area median income or below, those households can comfortably afford two-bedroom homes of up to $1,616 per month, according to the coalition.
The fair market rental rate for two-bedroom homes: $1,824 per month. 
“This year’s Out of Reach report shows that, despite economic gains for some, low-income renters continue to face impossible choices between paying rent and meeting basic needs,” said Renee Willis, the coalition’s president and CEO, in a statement. In her statement, Willis denounced recent moves by the Trump administration to cut back Section 8 housing assistance, and called for more funding for low-income renters.  
This year, Republicans and Democrats in New Hampshire passed a number of bills intended to reduce zoning regulations and allow for more housing development to increase housing supply and lower rents, and Gov. Kelly Ayotte signed many of those laws this month. But some housing advocates have criticized the lack of state funding to support affordable housing initiatives they say are also important to turn the tide. 
“Housing Action NH is working hard to ensure every Granite Stater has a place to call home, but the Out of Reach report illustrates the challenge we have ahead of us and the negative impact our housing crisis has on our state’s workforce and economy,” said Nick Taylor, the director of Housing Action NH, an advocacy group. “… While the state Legislature continues to make progress, there is much more to be done, and we must protect the critical HUD programs currently under attack.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/rentcontrol-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-21 05:56:11.261557

The 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline has responded to nearly 600,000 calls, texts, and chats from Ohioans in the three years since it was launched.
The 988 service was launched for those who are experiencing a mental health or addiction crisis can call, text or chat 988 to get support. The Ohio Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services administers the 988 Lifeline through an in-state network of contact centers.

“988 is a direct connection to compassionate, accessible care and support for anyone experiencing behavioral health related distress,” OhioMHAS Director LeeAnne Cornyn said in a press release. “By providing immediate support, the Lifeline makes behavioral health care more accessible for everyone, no matter where they are or what they’re facing.”
Since 988 launched in July 2022, there have been 592,294 total 988 contacts (calls, chats, and texts) from Ohioans, according to OhioMHAS. 
This averages to 16,453 988 contacts per month — including 11,296 calls, 3,131 texts and 2,026 chats, according to OhioMHAS. 
It takes an average of 23 seconds for 988 to answer in Ohio, compared to 34 seconds nationally, according to OhioMHAS. 
“As more Ohioans become familiar with the service, our hope is that reaching out to 988 for a behavioral health crisis will become as natural as calling 911 for other types of emergencies,” Cornyn said.
The number of Ohioans who died by suicide decreased 1% in 2023, according to the Ohio Department of Health. 1,777 Ohioans died by suicide in 2023 — 20 fewer than 2022.

(Mario Tama/Getty Images)Lawmakers are trying to restore access to GLP-1 weight loss drugs, like Ozempic and Wegovy, after Ohio removed medical coverage for state employees.
When he was 21 years old, Josh Williams fell 30 feet off the side of a train, crushing his spine — causing 20 years of pain.

“I underwent a lot of back surgeries and at one point I grew to 458 pounds in my heaviest,” Williams said. “I was on prescription opiates for over a decade, and it ruined my metabolism.”

His struggle to lose the weight exacerbated his back pain, he said, but one drug made all the difference.
“It really did save my life,” he added. “It allowed me to get out of bed and get back into the workforce.”
Williams, a Republican state representative, is now introducing legislation to help other state employees access the medication.
The Ohio Department of Administrative Services (DAS) announced that starting July 1st, GLP-1 medications would no longer be covered by the state’s benefits plan for weight loss. It will still be covered for diabetes.
“The State of Ohio covered GLP-1 medications for weight loss since July of 2022. However, our costs for GLP-1 medications for weight loss continued to escalate despite our implementation of cost containment measures,” DAS spokesperson J.C. Benton said in an email statement. “The decision to stop coverage was a difficult, but a fiscally necessary one… DAS has worked tirelessly to maintain a generous, competitive benefits plan for all 106,000 state employees and their dependents.”
DAS is offering health coaching, nutrition and incentive programs and online classes for weight loss, instead, Benton continued.
“I wish they would have reached out to legislators for a chance to fix this,” Williams said.
He created a fix of his own, authoring H.B. 388, which would require DAS to reimburse employees up to $500 per month in the first year of GLP-1 treatment and up to $250 per month in the second year. To qualify, applicants must provide proof of a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or greater, a physician’s diagnosis and documentation of payment.
The bill is bipartisan, cosponsored by state Rep. Dontavius Jarrells (D-Columbus).
“This legislation ensures that state employees access FDA-approved, life-saving medications without being burdened by extreme out-of-pocket costs,” Jarrells said. “We’re creating a pathway to better health outcomes while acknowledging the importance of preventative care in fighting chronic diseases like obesity and diabetes.”
DAS was unable to do an interview with us, but Case Western Reserve University medical law professor Sharona Hoffman explained that the sudden popularity of GLP-1 products has dramatically increased prices.
According to estimates by DAS and confirmed by Gov. Mike DeWine’s team for FY25, the 3,500 employees on the medications have cost the state roughly $40 million.
“It makes sense if you have budget constraints to try to figure out what you can eliminate,” Hoffman said. “I’m not that surprised they’re focusing on this.”
She highlighted how beneficial they can be for people who have applicable medical issues, but added that not everyone truly needs the weight loss drugs.
“For some people, it’s really elective, it’s a cosmetic thing and they’re not in danger of health problems,” the professor said. “Health insurance usually does not cover elective treatments.”
Removing coverage for the drugs isn’t unique to Ohio, she said.
“Only about half the states currently provide coverage for these drugs for non-diabetes purposes,” she said.
Some insurance companies are also restricting or denying coverage for GLP-1 medications used for weight loss, such as Blue Cross Blue Shield and Anthem.
Although Williams is frustrated by DAS, he also blames pharmacy benefit managers — PBMs — for the high cost.
“We are pleased that Rep. Williams is bringing to light the high cost that GLP-1 medications for weight loss has had on the state health plan and look forward to working with him,” Benton said.
Williams said they should have come to him first, since his proposal would reduce the cost for DAS from $40 million to about $20 million. With other reductions he made, he estimated that there would end up being only 2,000 employees enrolled, equalling about $9 million in costs.
“I think this is a great drug that’s proven to be safe,” Williams said. “Our employees should have access to it if it’s medically necessary.”
Williams, who is now running for Congress, said that he will not benefit from his proposal since he will not be in the legislature. He hopes to unseat longtime U.S. Rep. Marcy Kaptur of Ohio’s 9th District.

(Clay Wirestone/Kansas Reflector)We were motoring along a leafy stretch of road in rural Alabama that my mother-in-law has dubbed “the valley of death.”
Along this stretch, dozens or hundreds or thousands of people — depending on her mood during the telling — have driven their cars off the road and into a ravine overrun with kudzu. Perhaps their skeletal bodies remain, with the invasive vine wound around them like an organic straitjacket.
My mother-in-law enjoys herself.
Yet as I drove along that stretch over vacation, I found myself dwelling on the valley of death that we’re passing through right now in the United States and Kansas. I don’t need to write about the national situation: It’s traumatic enough and well covered enough. But here in Kansas, we can both see the road ahead and the steep slopes along either side with horrible clarity.
The gubernatorial election next year matters greatly. We’ve seen a bevy of high-profile candidates join the race — Cindy Holscher on the Democratic side; Scott Schwab, Jeff Colyer, Vicki Schmidt and Ty Masterson on the Republican side. More will join their ranks.
Our state took a flying leap off the valley of death during the administration of former Gov. Sam Brownback. His signature tax “experiment” showed many in the state just how wrong things could go after making bad policy choices. (Supply-side economics don’t work, have never worked and will never work. Just saying, kids.)
I’ve written repeatedly that the Kansas Legislature has forgotten those lessons. A new chief executive of the state could throw us back into the valley.
This time, the kudzu might not be quite so forgiving in releasing us.
Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly’s tenure was described in a fawning New York Times piece last week. Our nation’s newspaper of record appeared shocked to learn what everyone in Kansas has known for the better part of seven years: Kelly knows her stuff. She’s a outstanding retail politician. However, remaining in power means knowing your constituents and caring about results.
“Even as the national party shifted leftward, Ms. Kelly leaned into her image as a moderate pragmatist,” wrote Michelle Cottle about the 2022 gubernatorial election.
Later on she describes the governor: “Straightforward and steady, with a wry wit and an air of efficiency, Ms. Kelly indeed seems classically of the heartland.”
In a political scene stuffed with braggarts, showoffs and ego-driven maroons, Kelly stands out for her sheer normalcy. That’s an unfortunately rare commodity.
Meanwhile, a legislative task force plans to rejigger our K-12 school funding formula. It’s pretty clear, watching its meetings, that panel members yearn to impoverish public schools. I acknowledge that they deny this, but I also hear the contempt that drips from their voices when they talk about Kansas educators. As I wrote in May, we have reason to be afraid.
Again, this is not a new problem. During my work on a book about Kansas opinion writing, I found this prescient passage from a Hutchinson News editorial published on Feb. 24, 1964.
“As clearly as it does concerning representation, the constitution also demands uniform and equal education and uniform and equal taxation in Kansas,” the paper opined.
“We have neither,” it continued. “Some progress has been made lately toward both — with efforts toward school unification, study of a foundation plan of school finance, and a move toward more equal assessment of taxable property. But substantial equality in education requires increased state support of education. And equality in taxation requires shifting the tax burdens from real estate to other forms of taxation based on earnings as the true measure of wealth.”
We have always struggled to fund schools adequately. We have seldom, if ever, done so. Looking for ways to cut back now will propel us even further into the ravine.
Hovering over all this is the constitutional amendment proposal set for an August 2026 vote. It would allow for direct election of state Supreme Court justices. If approved by voters — by no means a sure thing — it would allow radical ideologues to buy justice in Kansas. It would hand over power to the same extremists who have poisoned the Kansas Legislature through gerrymandering and corporate donations. They have skewed our state’s politics so far to the right that they’re unrecognizable to normal people.
Yet another opportunity to veer into the valley of death.
I should note before closing that my mother-in-law is a wonderful woman, loving parent and fantastic grandmother. She just has an extravagant taste for the Southern Gothic.
But sometimes the flatness of our Midwestern landscape and plainspokenness of our everyday idiom can numb us to horrifying realities all around us. Sometimes we need a dash of west Alabama lunacy to comprehend the stakes.
For now, we’re still on the road, however uneasily. I pray we remain that way for the entire trip through the valley of death.

(Photo by Nick Cammett/Getty Images)It might seem like ancient history in Ohio. But it was only two years ago that Republican leaders were trying to make it almost impossible for voters in the highly gerrymandered state to amend the Ohio Constitution.
They issued dire warnings that wealthy “out-of-state special interests” would take control of the Ohio government if the state didn’t make it a lot harder to get amendments, such as those guaranteeing abortion and marijuana rights, into the founding document. The attempt went down in flames, and possibly down the memory hole. 
Just two years later, Republican supermajorities in the Ohio legislature passed — and Republican Gov. Mike DeWine signed — a budget that gives the out-of-state billionaires who own the poorly run Cleveland Browns $600 million for a new stadium.
The budget DeWine signed on June 30 gives the Haslam Sports Group $600 million from the state’s unclaimed property fund. It pays the Browns owners to abandon their current downtown location and build a new stadium 16 miles away in Brook Park. 
Famously burned once by a wealthy owner abandoning the city, Cleveland’s city government is in court fighting the move. And Ohioans with unclaimed property are suing to block the funding method DeWine approved.

Republican officials face a backlash over lavishing money on a team run so ineptly that in 2022 it guaranteed $230 million and traded three first-round draft picks to obtain DeShaun Watson — a quarterback facing numerous accusations of sexual misconduct. Watson served an 11-game suspension with the Browns, and when he finally did take the field, he sucked.
Last year, the team performed abysmally, winning just three games. And its owners, Dee and Jimmy Haslam, seem not to be doing their Republican benefactors any favors with the public.
Just three days after after receiving their controversial $600 million gift from the state, the Haslams bought a $25 million mansion in North Palm Beach, Fla., the Akron Beacon Journal reported. 
The Cleveland Plain Dealer on Monday reported that it truly is a gift that the Tennessee truck-stop moguls are getting. The family — which is worth an estimated $14.4 billion — doesn’t have to repay a dime of the money it will receive from Ohio’s unclaimed funds, the paper reported.
Haslam Sports Group didn’t respond to a request for comment. 
The gift to the Tennessee billionaires came as part of an Ohio budget that is seen as generally favoring the wealthy in a state where more than a quarter of the populace — 3 million people — are poor enough to qualify for Medicaid.
DeWine’s press secretary was asked about the message the Haslams sent with their purchase of a 5,600 square-foot mansion just 72 hours after receiving a $600 million gift from the taxpayers of Ohio. Had the governor effectively allowed out-of-state billionaires to use Ohioans’ money to buy a waterfront palace 1,000 miles from the nearest point in the state?
“We will not be offering comment on this,” Dan Tierney, DeWine’s press secretary, responded. “As you know, this issue is in active litigation.”
Just two years ago, Republican leaders were saying that Ohio’s government needed to be protected from such powerful, out-of-state interests. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
They were pushing an amendment to the state constitution that would have raised the minimum share of votes to pass future amendments from 50% to 60% — a huge additional burden. It would also have raised the signature-gathering requirements just to get an amendment on the ballot so high as to make it all but impossible, critics said. 
The proposed amendment contained a provision that sounded technical, but was logistically daunting. Instead of having to gather verified signatures of 5% or registered voters in half of Ohio counties, they would have had to gather them in all 88, no matter how remote and spread out their populations were.
Making voter-initiated amendments virtually impossible would have concentrated even more power in the hands of Ohio’s gerrymandered legislature, which would have been able to pass laws and initiate amendments the way it always had.
Critics said that would only make a bad thing worse. In recent years, the gerrymandered body has had an impressive track record when it comes to corruption, some of it the centerpiece of a major new HBO documentary about the corrupting influence of dark money on American politics.
Undeterred, Republican leaders called a special election for August 2023 in which the public would vote on a measure that would effectively lock them out of the state constitution. 
Abortion-rights and marijuana-legalization amendments were likely to be on the November ballot. But Secretary of State Frank LaRose claimed the August measure wasn’t aimed at blocking them.
“This is about empowering the people of Ohio to protect their constitution from out-of-state special interests that want to try to buy their way into our state’s founding document,” he said in July 2023.
LaRose’s office didn’t respond when asked whether the secretary had any objection to giving the Haslams — out-of-state-billionaires — $600 million in public money just as they bought a Florida mansion.
As it happened, campaigns on both sides of the amendment issue were mostly funded by out-of-state sources. 
The effort to make it harder to amend the Ohio Constitution failed by a 14-point margin. The abortion-rights and recreational-marijuana amendments passed by similar margins three months later.
The Haslams were hoping for a different outcome. In June 2023, the Knoxville, Tenn., family gave $50,000 to Protect Our Constitution, according to records at the Ohio Secretary of State’s office. That was a group aimed at making citizen-led amendments much more difficult, if not impossible.
The Haslams were also among the biggest contributors to a separate effort aimed at keeping the current crop of Ohio Republicans in power, regardless of what voters want.
Highly gerrymandered Republican supermajorities in the General Assembly have been accused of ignoring voters’ wishes. For example in 2019, they passed harsh abortion restrictions that took effect when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade in 2022. The following year, Ohio voters passed a constitutional amendment outlawing the restrictions by nearly a 15-point margin.
There are two anti-gerrymandering amendments in the Ohio Constitution. But, refusing to give up their gerrymandered supermajorities, DeWine, LaRose and other Republicans on the Ohio Redistricting Commission ignored seven orders from a bipartisan majority of the Ohio Supreme Court to draw more equitable maps.
The idea behind such amendments is to draw congressional and state legislative districts that are competitive. That way, candidates have to listen to voters at least as much as they do party leaders and their wealthy donors.
After she aged off of the court last year, former Republican Chief Justice Maureen O’Connor led an effort to pass an anti-gerrymandering amendment that she said couldn’t be ignored. 
The Haslams were against it. They contributed $100,000 to Ohio Works, a group dedicated to stopping O’Connor’s anti-gerrymandering effort.
Their side won by seven percentage points on a night when Republican Donald Trump won Ohio by 11. Anti-gerrymandering advocates were sent back to the drawing board.
Then, perhaps not coincidentally, the Haslams contributed $120,000 to Ohio’s Republican legislative leaders in the months before they voted to give the out-of-state billionaires a $600 million gift of the state’s money.

(Photo by David DeWitt, Ohio Capital Journal.)Congress set aside $50 billion for rural hospitals and medical providers to allay fears over the billions more in historic cuts to federal health care spending that President Donald Trump signed into law on Independence Day.
But is that bandage big enough to save struggling rural hospitals?
“I have more questions than I have answers,” said Alan Morgan, CEO of the National Rural Health Association, a nonprofit policy group. “No one has those answers yet.”
Morgan noted that the new money for rural health, to be spent over five years, is far less than the $155 billion in rural Medicaid spending cuts over 10 years, as estimated by KFF, a nonprofit health policy and research group.
Experts, hospital leaders, and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle fear that Trump’s signature legislation will particularly gut rural hospitals and clinics, which see an outsize share of patients who are insured through Medicaid, the federal-state public health insurance for people with low incomes. The new law slashes more than $1 trillion from Medicaid over the next 10 years to help pay for tax cuts that disproportionately benefit the wealthy.
States scramble to shield hospitals from GOP Medicaid cuts

The $50 billion addition was an effort by Republican leaders in Congress to win the votes of colleagues within their party who initially balked at supporting such steep cuts to Medicaid and other health services.
In the U.S. Senate, the rural program helped secure the vote of Alaska moderate Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who expressed concern about the law’s impact on health care in her state. About 1 in 3 Alaskans are insured through Medicaid.
Jared Kosin, the president and CEO of the Alaska Hospital & Healthcare Association, said he’s deeply frustrated with the new law’s gutting of Medicaid funding, which he thinks will wreak lasting damage on Alaskans. And Republicans sidestepped potential solutions by just throwing money into a program, he said.
“It’s frustrating in the public realm when decisions like this are made fast and, frankly, carelessly,” he said.
“The consequences are going to fall on us, not them.”
More than half of the law’s cuts to funding in rural areas are concentrated in 12 states with large rural populations that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act to cover more people, according to KFF: Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania and Virginia.
Some GOP lawmakers in Congress have heralded the $50 billion rural program as a health care victory. But it’s still unclear which hospitals, clinics and other providers would receive money and how much.
 How it works

The Rural Health Transformation Program will dole out $10 billion annually from fiscal years 2026 through 2030.
States must apply for their funding by the end of this year, submitting a detailed plan on how it would be used.
The law outlines some ways that states can use the money, according to an analysis of the legislation from the Bipartisan Policy Center:

Making payments to rural hospitals to help them maintain essential services such as emergency room care or labor and delivery.
Recruiting and training rural doctors, nurses and other health workers.
Bolstering emergency medical services such as ambulances and EMTs.
Using new technologies, including telehealth.
Providing opioid use disorder treatment and mental health services.
Improving preventive care and chronic disease management.

Half of the $10 billion each year will be distributed evenly across states that have applied for it. The other half can be distributed by the administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services — currently Dr. Mehmet Oz — at his discretion, based on a state’s rural population and rural health facilities.
Although the program doesn’t replace the amount states are likely to lose, Morgan said it’s still an opportunity to rethink how rural health care is funded. He’d like to see states given flexibility in how they’re able to use the funds, and he hopes they focus on keeping rural communities healthy through preventive care while still helping hospitals keep their doors open.
“If done correctly, it could really change the future course for rural America,” Morgan said. “That is such a tough ask, though.”
 Hardest hit

Kentucky could take the biggest hit from the new law’s reduction in rural Medicaid funding, losing an estimated $12 billion over 10 years, according to a KFF analysis.
Tracking Medicaid patients’ work status may prove difficult for states

The state’s Medicaid department is still waiting for additional federal guidance to understand how the state’s program will be affected, Kendra Steele, spokesperson with the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services, told Stateline in a statement.
“Over 1.4 million Kentuckians rely on Medicaid — including half of all children in our state, seniors and more vulnerable populations — and the passage of legislation on the federal level will have serious impacts for those individuals, rural health care and hospitals and local economies,” she wrote.
Even with the new program, states across the country will have to reevaluate their budgets in light of the cuts, said Hemi Tewarson, executive director at the National Academy for State Health Policy, a nonpartisan group that supports states in developing health care policies.
“Every region is slightly different and there’s not a one-size-fits-all approach,” she said. “Hospital ownership varies [as well as] the types of services that are critical for the community where they’re located. They have to think about new ways to provide those services in a context with fewer resources.”
About 44% of rural hospitals are operating in the red, according to a KFF analysis of Rand Hospital Data, a higher share than the 35% of hospitals in urban areas.
 ‘Rural at heart’

Prior to the bill’s passage, Oz attempted to reassure U.S. House Republicans that their districts could get money from the program even if they weren’t specifically rural, Politico reported earlier this month.










We’re all rural at heart when it comes to money.


– Alan Morgan, CEO of the National Rural Health Association


Pennsylvania Republican U.S. Rep. Rob Bresnahan said money would begin flowing to his district as early as the beginning of next year, telling the Wilkes-Barre Times Leader earlier this month that he met with Trump, Oz and others to secure pledges that hospitals in his district could access the fund. He represents the northeastern corner of Pennsylvania, which includes suburban and rural areas, as well as the cities of Scranton and Wilkes-Barre.
Though the legislation includes guidelines on which facilities or areas qualify as “rural,” Morgan, of the National Rural Health Association, expects a mad dash from lawmakers and providers to claim rural status in order to get a piece of the funding.
“That’s going to be a huge issue — defining who’s rural,” Morgan said. “We’re all rural at heart when it comes to money.”

After almost 12 years, it’s familiar by now, but sadly, the pattern in which Senator Thom Tillis raises hopes that he’ll act with courage and then backs down at the last minute continues to repeat itself in maddening fashion.
The latest incident: Tillis’s utterly inexcusable vote last week to endorse President Trump’s nomination of an embarrassingly unqualified lawyer named Emil Bove for a lifetime appointment to a federal appeals court. Bove is so unqualified and has committed so many questionable acts that more than 900 former Justice Department officials weighed in to oppose him.
After Tillis broke with Trump recently on his disastrous megabill and announced his decision to retire next year, it raised hopes that he was now free – not unlike the late John McCain – to put the good of the country ahead of Trump’s demands.
The bottom line: Unfortunately, as his vote last week showed, Tillis is no John McCain. And that means North Carolinians will have to endure a continuing series of inscrutable votes and policy stances for the next 18 months.

(Catherine McQueen/Getty Images)Amazon turned 30 last week. The retail behemoth’s climb toward today’s more than $2 trillion worth started July 16, 1995, selling one thing: books.
The irony is that’s also about the time the number of people reading books began to decline, a diminution that continues as online shopping and the world wide web are now staples of American life. Bezos knows best?
Fun fact: As we’ve decreased the number of books we read, we’ve increased the number of books the reading police want banned in schools and public libraries. Ten states — Florida, Missouri, Utah, Virginia, Tennessee, Georgia, Oklahoma, West Virginia,Texas and Iowa — have passed legislation that has either banned books or forced school districts and librarians to essentially do the same.
Book bans
We tried to get in on the act closer to home, too. The Nebraska Legislature, the Nebraska State Board of Education and a number of local school boards have entertained attempts to either ban books or make criminals out of librarians who keep safe such unacceptable titles as “The Diary of  a Young Girl,” “Where the Wild Things Are” and any Harry Potter book. The University of Nebraska Board of Regents even wanted prohibitions on the teaching of an idea in college. See the ill-defined critical race theory for details.
A wider lens on these bans brings into focus this reality: A sinister set of modern thinkers wants to create a national culture that reverses years of advances in science, the arts and history. Worse, it wants to rewrite the American story.
For specifics, start with the current leadership at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, who disparage settled science on vaccines, fluoride and measles. One of the great hypocrisies of the HHS evolution is its call for Americans to improve their diets, a worthy goal for any family or nation. 
But when former First Lady Michelle Obama tried to do the same thing in 2010, the forces now questioning proven medical principles were apoplectic. Save the theatrics.
Senate cuts public media
Last week the Senate, with the help of Nebraska’s U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer, who continues to think 49.8% is a mandate, and Sen. Pete Ricketts, both of whom thought it good policy to pull public media funds, undercut the work of PBS, NPR and Elmo and imperil dozens of rural radio stations, which sometimes are an area’s primary access to news, information and emergencies such as weather warnings. 
If the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) was a proven spendthrift or fritterer, perhaps one might have made a case for cutting funds, but nothing to see there. Supporters of the cuts like to argue the $1.1 billion being stripped from the CPB represents only 15% of its total budget. But this argument is not about money.
Here’s why: Congressional accomplices doing the president’s bidding are nicking the CPB because — without providing much empirical evidence — it doesn’t bend to a particular political point of view. Before they plucked some of Big Bird’s feathers and compromised some rural radio stations, they could have at least asked for more than name calling and innuendo.
Aside from diminishing settled science, banning good books, undermining public media — often with disinformation and lies — too many want to return to a 1950s fever dream of America: Before civil rights, before we went to the moon, before the internet, before colossal strides in medical technology and research, before the Human Genome Project, before cell phones, ad infinitum. 

History rewrite
Perhaps the biggest leap backward is the attempted rewriting of our history, editing from school curricula, websites and government agencies some of our unique, American narrative.
To wit: The Department of Defense, sure that DEI was undermining its mission, scrubbed, among others, veteran Jackie Robinson and the Navajo Code Talkers from its noted history. After the public called them out, the DOD reversed course, accompanied by a tortuous explanation. 
The DOGE bros started the process of dismantling the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS), jeopardizing many of the nation’s museums and libraries. Even the Small Business Administration deferred to the moment, removing references, according to the Guardian, “to women, LGBTQ+ individuals and people of color, including facts about American heroes such as Gen. Colin Powell.”
In essence, what is afoot is a remake of the American story, a diminished version of our greatness, which lies in our drive and our diversity … not simply our skin colors, races, religions, ethnicities and geographies but, most importantly, in our freedom of thought and expression. 
I’m sure you can find a book all about it. On Amazon.

These innovations represent a powerful engine for economic development, job creation, and cutting-edge progress—not just globally, but right here in Connecticut.
Yet despite this promise, the lack of consistent federal guidelines continues to hinder responsible innovation in the U.S. Developers, entrepreneurs, and investors face a regulatory gray area that stifles momentum and drives talent overseas. To maintain American leadership in digital finance, we need thoughtful, clear federal regulations that provide a foundation for growth and innovation.
That’s why I applaud legislative efforts like the CLARITY Act (H.R. 3633), which aims to bring regulatory transparency and consumer protection to this emerging space. Policies like this are essential to fostering a fair and competitive environment where innovation can flourish and American companies can thrive.
Connecticut is already showing growing interest in blockchain—from education and workforce training to entrepreneurial ventures and infrastructure development. But without a coordinated federal framework, these efforts are at risk of being left behind.
I urge lawmakers to continue supporting balanced, forward-looking policy that allows the blockchain and digital asset sectors to develop responsibly, while protecting consumers and driving sustainable economic benefits.

(Photo courtesy of Clallam 2 Fire-Rescue)Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson on Sunday visited near the site of a tanker truck crash that spilled thousands of gallons of fuel into a tributary of the Elwha River near Port Angeles. 
His visit came two days after the fuel truck failed to negotiate a turn on Highway 101, veered off the road, and careened down an embankment before landing upside-down in Indian Creek, according to the Washington State Patrol. The creek feeds into the Elwha River.
The overturned tanker was removed from the creek early Saturday morning. Cleanup crews have deployed containment booms to limit the fuel’s flow and absorbent materials to mop it up.
Contamination from the spill disrupted water service to Port Angeles, a city of 20,000 residents, and killed an untold number of fish. 
Ferguson called the crash a “setback” to restoring the Elwha, which saw the landmark removal of two hydroelectric dams in the 2010s. 
“There has been so much work, so much effort, so much investment by so many folks here and many others to make this place the place that it is now, to work on bringing back salmon and to restore this really amazing, amazing habitat,” he said in a press conference along the banks of the river.

The water in the Port Angeles area is safe for bathing, flushing toilets and doing laundry, but shouldn’t be used for drinking, washing dishes and making ice until officials give the OK. The city was distributing free bottled water for drinking and cooking. 
Distribution sites were quickly met with long lines of residents, said Mayor Kate Dexter.
Preliminary testing showed no issues with the drinking water, according to state health officials. Additional results were expected later Sunday.
The PetroCard truck, with a capacity of 10,000 gallons, leaked an estimated 3,000 gallons of fuel into the creek, according to the state Department of Ecology. Most of that was gasoline, and the rest was diesel.
The Department of Ecology responded to the spill a few hours after it happened, sending personnel from the Olympia area, said Alison Meyers, an agency coordinator focused on spill response.
The Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe calls Indian Creek the “rockstar” of the Elwha River, as it’s the most “productive and diverse” of the river’s tributaries, said Matt Beirne, the tribe’s natural resources director. 
Hundreds, if not thousands, of juvenile salmon, bottom-feeding sculpin and lamprey died in the fuel’s wake, he said. Tribal Chairwoman Frances Charles said, “Our hearts sank” at the news.
Ferguson, a Democrat who took office in January, acknowledged this is the first sudden disaster he’s had to jump into action to respond to.
“It’s pretty clear to me,” he said, “the level of preparation that goes into something like this. I don’t think anything, maybe, truly prepares you.”
The river is Port Angeles’ primary source of potable water. After the crash, the city shut down water treatment processing and advised locals to limit their water use. At the time, its reservoirs had enough water for up to 24 hours without a disruption to normal service.
On Sunday morning, the city told water utility customers, both in and out of the city limits, not to drink the tap water amid ongoing state testing that was taking longer than expected. 
The reservoirs had been drawn down, so to maintain water pressure the city had to let in more water. Once the samples show the water is safe, the reservoirs will need to be refilled.
The driver of the truck was taken to a local hospital after the crash but is now recovering at home, said PetroCard President and CEO Laura Yellig. Authorities accused the driver, a 58-year-old man, of negligent driving.
Yellig said her company takes “full responsibility” for the crash and the resulting impacts.
Ferguson planned to remain in the Port Angeles area until at least Monday morning.
“It is heartbreaking to see what’s happened. There’s no two ways around that,” he said. “We’re going to get through this. It’s going to be a challenge.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/fuel-truck-crash-in-river-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-20 18:56:16.818254

“Tangling with Laura Kelly these last few years has taught me I can only do so much from the position I’m in,” Masterson said in an announcement video. “Big change comes from the big seat. It’s time to take the fight to the status quo.”
In the video, Masterson took credit for work in the Legislature on a $2 billion reduction in state taxes and improvements to election security. He said he advanced bills forbidding transgender health care for minors and blocking transgender individuals from taking part in sports teams designated for girls or women. He said he devoted himself to getting the “woke ideology off our college campuses.”
He said Kansas needed a governor capable of reducing property taxes, lowering crime and addressing excessive spending by state government.
“President Trump is breaking the ice dam on the federal bureaucracy,” Masterson said. “We need to take advantage of this amazing opportunity to bring the Kansas economy roaring back and prevent things that are holding us back.”
Masterson, 55, of Andover, has served in the Kansas Senate since 2009 and previously was a member of the Kansas House. He was reelected to another four-year Senate term in 2024 while earning 65% of the vote in his district. That meant he could run for statewide office in 2026 without giving up his seat in the Legislature.
Schwab, the secretary of state and a former member of the Kansas House, greeted Masterson’s announcement by saying Kansas voters deserved “a robust airing of the issues that face our state that the next governor will have to address.” Schwab said Republicans had to nominate a candidate capable of winning.
Masterson has sought to be a conservative counterpoint to Kelly’s vision of centrist governance by mustering votes to override her vetoes, expanding state regulation of abortion and opposing broadening access to Medicaid health services for lower-income Kansans.
The Senate president endorsed diversion of state tax dollars to private education and championed placement on 2026 ballots an amendment to the Kansas Constitution that would allow direct election of Kansas Supreme Court justices. He advocated replacing the state’s three-tier income tax structure with a single tax rate regardless of income. Kansas has adopted a two-rate system.
Masterson placed significance on deepening the Republican supermajority in the House and Senate to help blunt Kelly’s policy agenda. Before the 2025 session of the Legislature, he also collaborated with House Speaker Dan Hawkins of Wichita to reduce Kelly’s influence over state budget recommendations.
At the same time, Masterson has spoken about his ability to work collaboratively with the Democratic governor.
“While we’ve certainly had our differences, I’ve been pleased with our ability to work together across an array of issues,” he said in a January rebuttal to Kelly’s State of the State speech to the Legislature. “While the controversial differences certainly garner the most headlines, the vast majority of our work is bipartisan in nature, and that’s a good thing.”
In that speech, he celebrated election of Trump in 2024 and viewed the president’s victory in Kansas as a mandate to “put Kansans first, control the overreach of government and keep our promises.” Masterson said that included a pledge to lower property taxes. “For too long it’s just been a political talking point,” he said.
During the 2024 and 2025 legislative sessions, however, the GOP leadership placed emphasis on reducing state income taxes and eliminating the state’s sales tax on groceries.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/P3050486-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-07-20 17:56:19.012270

Washington, D.C. has the second largest spike in inventory (+63.6%) followed by Raleigh, N.C. (+56.4%), says the report from the National Association of Realtors. Nationwide, the number of homes for sale is up 28.9%.
Las Vegas Realtors reported last week that at the end of June, 6,992 single-family homes for sale had no offers, a 70% increase from a year ago. The 2,564 condos and townhomes without offers in Southern Nevada account for an 87.6% jump over 2024.
Sales in June were down 7% from a year ago and the average home is staying on the market for more than 30 days, with about 80% selling within 60 days.
While housing stock is up over last year, it remains well below pre-pandemic levels.
“It’s been some time since we had this many homes on the market,” says Jeff Crampton, a Las Vegas Realtor, noting that 6,000 to 10,000 properties for sale is a healthy market.

Two factors, he says, are “keeping buyers on the shelf. One is the interest rates, and the other is the unsettling financial news on our TV every freaking day. Tariffs. No tariffs. War. No war. When people are going to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on something, they want certainty.”
Some borrowers are attempting to cushion the blow of higher interest rates by taking on adjustable rate mortgages, which offer a lower rate for an initial period – usually five years – and increase periodically after that.
The Mortgage Bankers Association reported that for the week ending April 11, 2025, the share of borrowers applying for ARMs rose to its highest level since November 2023.
“Given the jump in rates, more borrowers are opting for the lower initial rates that come with an ARM, with initial fixed rates closer to 6% in our survey last week,” Mike Fratantoni, MBA’s SVP and chief economist, said in a press release.
However, ARMs are riskier than 30-year fixed rate loans, which are set about a point higher.
Experts warn the market’s woes are a harbinger of economic disarray.
“Housing will … soon be a full-blown headwind to broader economic growth, adding to the growing list of reasons to be worried about the economy’s prospects later this year and early next,” Moody’s chief economist Mark Zandi wrote Monday in posts on X and Linkedin. “Home sales, homebuilding, and even house prices are set to slump unless mortgage rates decline materially from their current near 7% soon. “
President Donald Trump is calling for a decrease in the benchmark interest rate, currently at 4.25% to 4.5%, to 1%, a move economists fear would trigger another set of economic woes, including higher inflation.
The inflation rate ticked up in June, pushing the annual rate to 2.7%, the highest since February. The likely cause, experts say, is Trump’s tariffs.
 The price is right?

The U.S. housing market has no shortage of would-be buyers, evidenced by a 25% year-to-year increase in purchase applications, HousingWire reports.  While some sellers are holding out for top dollar, many homes are priced right, experts contend.
“Normally, if a listing is priced too high, you’re not getting showings for it,” observes Crampton. “I’ve had 13 showings for one house, and I’ve had 19 showings for another house, but just one offer between them.”
Utah home prices slowed in 2024 — but housing market still ranks among nation’s most expensive

The dearth of offers, he says, is evidence of a lack of confidence among buyers who are not balking at home prices, but at the long term costs of financing.
Home prices have been “pretty stable so far this year,“ LVR President George Kypreos said in a news release last week, adding the increase in homes for sale “is good for buyers. It should also be prompting sellers to be realistic when pricing their properties.”  Kypreos was not available for an interview.
The median price of an existing single-family home sold in Southern Nevada in June was $485,000. That’s up 1% from the previous month, up 2.1% from last year, and ties the record set during the first quarter.
In Washoe County (excluding Incline Village) the median sales price for existing single-family homes was $616,400 in June, up 3.8% from May and 2.7% from last year. Inventory was up 7.7% from May and 46% from a year ago.
But home prices, which have held up amid sagging sales, “have gone sideways and are set to fall,” projects Zandi of Moody Analytics.
Price reductions last week in Southern Nevada were up 95% over last year, says real estate agent Diane Varney. “We appreciated too quickly during Covid. We’re in a correction. We needed one. ”
Prices, however, remain at record levels. Varney says that’s because the Multiple Listing Service no longer reports seller concessions, resulting in skewed data on sale prices. “If you sell a house for $750,000 and there was a $25,000 to $50,000 concession for repairs, rate buy down, closing costs – anything like that – it’s not going to show up in the sale price at the end of the day.”
Agents, Varney says, get calls from appraisers “all the time” because they need the information to determine the true value of comparable properties.
Even new home builders, who have bought down interest rates as a means of buoying sales, are giving up, according to Zandi.
“It’s simply too expensive,” he wrote Monday. “A big tell is that many builders are delaying their land purchases from the land banks. New home sales, starts, and completions will soon fall.”
Those who are attempting to sell in the current market are likely facing a life-altering event, such as marriage, divorce, or the addition of a child, according to Crampton and Varney.
“It’s not ‘I may want to sell.’ It’s not  ‘if I can get my price I’ll sell, otherwise, I’m going to stay here.’ Those players are out of the game,” Varney says of non-motivated sellers.
Complicating matters, one in five deals is falling out of escrow, she says.
“With the inventory climbing, buyers see another home that came on the market that’s more attractive, or maybe the rates took a spike, and they cancel,” says Varney. “Buyers right now are real touchy.”

U.S. District Court Chief Judge David G. Estudillo granted a preliminary injunction sought by three Catholic bishops, temporarily blocking enforcement of a controversial element in a new state law set to take effect July 27.
Estudillo ruled that requiring disclosure of information priests hear in the confessional infringes on their First Amendment right to practice religion and will force them to violate their sacred vows or face punishment by the state.
The decision means clergy will be added to the state’s roster of professions that must report to law enforcement when they have “reasonable cause to believe that a child has suffered abuse or neglect.”
But the state cannot require Archbishop Paul Etienne of Seattle, Bishop Joseph Tyson of Yakima and Bishop Thomas Daly of Spokane — the three who filed the suit — or any Catholic priest in Washington under their direction to disclose such information they hear in confession.
“There is no question that SB 5375 burdens Plaintiffs’ free exercise of religion,” Estudillo wrote in a 25-page ruling issued four days after a court hearing in Tacoma.
The legislation “places them in the position of either complying with the requirements of their faith or violating the law. The consequences for violating the law are serious and, as Plaintiffs assert, the implications of violating the Sacramental Seal are more serious still,” he wrote.
Attorney General Nick Brown’s office emphasized that the ruling only applies to “the Sacrament of Confession” and that, if clergy learn about abuse in any other setting, the injunction does not change that they will be mandated reporters. Brown did not provide any further comment.
The ruling drew praise from Catholic Church leaders and attorneys who brought the suit.
“By protecting the seal of confession, the court has also safeguarded the basic principle that people of all faiths should be free to practice their beliefs without government interference,” Mark Rienzi, president and CEO of Becket, one of the legal teams, said in a statement.
Jean Hill, executive director of the Washington State Catholic Conference, said Catholic faithful have sought reconciliation with God through the sacrament of confession for centuries.
“This ruling protects that sacred space and ensures that Washingtonians of all religious stripes can live out their beliefs in peace,” she said in a statement.
Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson signed the legislation in early May. Ferguson, a Catholic, has said requiring disclosures about information learned in confession did not give him pause and he was disappointed his church was suing “to protect individuals who abuse kids.”
Mandatory reporters
The law adds clergy to a list that includes school personnel, nurses, social service counselors, psychologists, and many others, who must report suspected abuse or neglect.
A “member of the clergy” is defined in the legislation to cover any regularly licensed, accredited, or ordained minister, priest, rabbi, imam, elder, or similarly positioned religious or spiritual leader.
Violations of the law carry potential penalties of up to 364 days in jail, a $5,000 fine, and civil liability.
The three bishops filed their lawsuit May 29, naming Ferguson, Brown and the prosecuting attorney in each of Washington’s 39 counties as defendants.
Prosecutors for the counties did not take sides in this dispute. Collectively, they agreed to accept a preliminary injunction as long as the plaintiffs did not seek attorney fees from them.
This basically put the counties on the sidelines, said Geoff Enns, a Snohomish County deputy prosecuting attorney.
State attorneys have argued the law can survive a First Amendment challenge because it was tailored to serve the compelling government interest of prosecuting perpetrators of child abuse.
But in his ruling, Estudillo said the state “arguably could have chosen a less restrictive means of advancing its interest” by adding members of the clergy to the list of mandated reporters and providing a narrow exception for the confessional, as other states do.
Attorneys for the bishops have argued the law treats Catholic priests, and the religious activity of confession, differently than other professions that involve confidential conversations. They pointed to House Bill 1171, which also takes effect July 27.
That law exempts attorneys employed by public or private higher education institutions, and employees under their supervision, from their mandatory reporting obligations if the information obtained is related to the representation of a client.
Estudillo agreed, ruling this undermined the state’s argument that it was not singling out the church practice.
“The government interest at issue in both statutes — protecting children from abuse and neglect — is the same. Nevertheless, one law eliminates the privilege for clergy while the other expands the privileges available to secular professionals,” he wrote.
“Ultimately, Washington’s failure to demonstrate why it has an interest of the highest order in denying an exemption to clergy while making such exemptions available to other professionals who work with underserved children … is likely fatal” to the law, the judge added.
Trump administration 
Last month, the U.S. Department of Justice sought to join the legal fight as an intervening party on the side of the bishops. Estudillo granted the request. The Trump Administration also filed a separate request for a preliminary injunction. It is slated for a hearing next week.
Meanwhile, a similar legal battle is unfolding in the U.S. District Court in the Eastern District of Washington. The Orthodox Church of America, along with other churches and individual priests, has sued state officials and county prosecutors, contending the law violates the First Amendment right to practice one’s religion.

We’re not working for our philosophies. And we’re not working for our political parties.” Matt Vasilogambros/StatelineLocal election officials across the country fear the loss of federal support for election security, according to a new survey.
Sixty percent of local election officials expressed some level of concern, a survey by the Brennan Center for Justice found. The center, a left-leaning pro-democracy institute, surveyed 858 officials between mid-April and mid-May.
The concern comes as President Donald Trump has curtailed federal election security work. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, in March halted its election security work. A month earlier, the Department of Government Efficiency task force also fired 130 cybersecurity workers at the agency.
And Trump in April ordered an investigation into Christopher Krebs, a former agency director who had vouched for the security of the 2020 election, which Trump falsely claims was stolen.
Federal cuts mean election officials are going to need more financial support from state and local governments, said Lawrence Norden, vice president of Brennan’s Elections and Government Program. The federal government has the advantage of being able to see the “big picture” and more easily share information with election officials across the country, he said.
“That is going to be difficult for states to replicate,” Norden said. “It doesn’t mean it’s impossible, but they have to start rethinking how they’re sharing information about what they’re seeing with each other.”
Cybersecurity has long been a concern of states — and not just in elections. Only 22 of 48 states that participated in a voluntary 2023 cybersecurity review conducted by federal agencies met or exceeded recommended security levels.
In the Brennan survey, 36% of local election officials said they were very concerned about federal cuts to election security services, while 24% said they were somewhat concerned and 21% said they were a little concerned. Nineteen percent said they were not concerned at all.
Sixty-one percent of local election officials expressed some level of concern over cuts to the federal cybersecurity agency specifically, with 32% saying they were very concerned. The survey had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.

A 10-week experiment offering free foot ferry service between Anacortes and the San Juan Islands drew positive reviews but has room for improvement, according to a post-mortem given to the San Juan County Council.
A separate reexamination of possible new passenger-only ferry routes in the North Sound by a state consultant said large start-up costs would be incurred to launch new walk-on services. The tight budgets at all levels of government cast doubt on whether additional walk-on ferries may cast off anytime soon.
A $1.5 million state grant to San Juan County made the temporary foot ferry possible. The boat trial grew out of frustration with unreliable state ferry service in recent years.
The county can’t afford to continue the walk-on ferry on its own dime, but at least one county councilmember said the concept of car-free transportation to, from and among the scenic islands is worthy of further exploration.
“I would love to see us apply for some additional funding,” Councilmember Jane Fuller said Tuesday. “So we could run it out further in time, get more data and understand more of the implications of this.”
The twice-daily scheduled roundtrips between the three most populous islands and Anacortes ran from April 18 to June 30 using a chartered whale watching tour boat.
As part of the same state-funded pilot project, San Juan County also contracted with another local tour company for on-call emergency interisland water taxi service and paid a retainer to a barge company to keep a commercial truck transport vessel in reserve. Those back-up options in case of lengthy state ferry service cancellations have also wrapped up.
Health and Community Services Director Mark Tompkins said the 49-passenger boat hired for the twice-daily mainland ferry service attracted 2,399 riders over the two-and-a-half-month trial. Nearly two-thirds of riders said they were on leisure trips, with the remainder booked for work, school, errands or appointment reasons. The foot ferry achieved an enviable 100% on-time record, Tompkins reported to the county council Tuesday.
The emergency interisland water taxi was activated nine times this spring and early summer. It made 12 roundtrips between Orcas, Lopez and Friday Harbor, carrying 127 people home or to work who were stranded on those nine days when the Washington State Ferries interisland vehicle ferry unexpectedly went out of service.
“I look at these statistics and, while they’re not tens of thousands of riders, had (the state) ferries not worked, they would be,” County Councilmember Justin Paulsen said in reaction.
County Manager Jessica Hudson said passenger feedback praised the reliability of the daily scheduled service and appreciated the downtown Anacortes terminus, which was walking distance to many businesses and restaurants, unlike the outlying state ferry terminal.
Hudson performed some back-of-the-envelope math in front of the council to estimate the per-passenger cost of the free ferry rides the county provided. It penciled out to about $250 a person per ride, borne by state taxpayers via the governor-directed grant.
Fuller responded that it’s not a surprise that public transportation requires a heavy subsidy, but added that this was instructive about the “order of magnitude” a lightly-used foot ferry would consume.
The true cost of the fare-free ride also gave one-time foot ferry passenger Brian Clark pause. Clark was pleased by the service and the free parking in downtown Anacortes when he used the county’s boat in June to check on a rental property his family owns on Lopez Island.
“They need to get one of those electric hydrofoil ferries that have lower fuel costs,” Clark said in an interview from his home in Seattle this week.
Tompkins said securing a faster ferryboat for the passenger service was a common refrain in the “room for improvement” column. He also said better communication was needed to alert stranded travelers to the availability of the emergency interisland water taxi when it was activated. Some state ferry terminal workers didn’t refer customers there when the interisland vehicle ferry went down.
Other barriers needing attention include the lack of a suitable public dock on Shaw Island for foot ferry service. Also, the limited to nonexistent public transit options for travel on land once arriving at landings other than Friday Harbor present a hindrance to increasing car-free exploration of the San Juans.
Bellingham to Friday Harbor foot ferry gets another look
Earlier pleas from the ferry-dependent San Juan Islands resulted in the 2024 Legislature commissioning a $500,000 study of potential new state-supported passenger-only routes throughout Puget Sound. That report to the Legislature has coincidentally just been publicly released.
The hired consultants who took on the study determined four passenger routes deserved a detailed evaluation:

Bellingham – Friday Harbor
Whidbey Island – Everett
San Juan Islands interisland with two larger vessels
San Juan Islands interisland using a small private operator

The consultant group led by the firm KPFF estimated potential ridership for each foot ferry route, which ranged from a low of 85 commuters daily for the Whidbey Island-Port of Everett workday route. A circular San Juan Islands interisland route was the most attractive, with up to 223 riders estimated per day. The Bellingham to Friday Harbor connection fell in the middle, assuming a seasonal, seven days per week schedule. 
San Juan Cruises already operates one daily round-trip on the Bellingham-Friday Harbor route in summer, geared toward tourist daytrippers from the mainland. It is commercially successful, but the unsubsidized fare of $79 is expensive compared to the state ferry system’s $16.50 walk-on fare from Anacortes to the islands. The state ferries, while often running late, have lots of spare walk-on capacity, although parking at the Anacortes terminal can be a limiting factor at peak times.
The study authors observed that new foot passenger ferry service offers an opportunity to expand connectivity “at a lower capital and operating cost than WSF vehicle ferry service.” But the costs still rise into eight figures when vessel acquisition and landing site improvements are figured in.
The report presented the numbers and caveats but was circumspect in its recommendations. It said ultimately the next steps “will require direction from the Legislature regarding the state’s role” in providing or financing passenger-only services.
Even before the consultant study’s release, WSF leadership indicated it is focused on improving reliability of its existing car ferries and isn’t interested in adding passenger-only routes on top of that.
“We don’t have any plans to add any new routes for WSF,” state ferries chief Steve Nevey told ferry riders during an online town hall in May. “Only the Legislature can add routes.”
Legislature reluctant to take on new costs
The majority of the Legislature’s members appear cool to taking responsibility for new foot ferry routes. In fact, this spring, the lead transportation budget writers tried to phase out the state’s remaining support for locally-operated foot ferries, which flowed to the Vashon Island water taxi and Kitsap Fast Ferries to backfill for reduced state ferry service. Determined lobbying by local ferry advocates managed to keep their state subsidy in place for a year or two longer, even though WSF ferry service to Vashon and Bremerton has recently been restored to pre-pandemic levels.
Legislators are staring at daunting price tags to build new hybrid-electric 160-car ferries to modernize the state’s aging fleet, as well as the tab to install shoreside battery charging infrastructure.
“Passenger service in the future makes sense, but for now we’re focused on the core of WSF service,” state Senate Transportation Committee Chair Marko Liias said near the end of this year’s legislative session.

Speaker Mike Johnson is celebrating massive cuts to foreign aid programs and public media that he successfully navigated through the House of Representatives.
But Johnson’s own political campaign budget just took a modest hit, too — thanks to a thief, according to new federal records reviewed by OpenSecrets.
The Mike Johnson for Louisiana congressional committee lost $9,995.50 on April 28 when an unidentified person swiped one of the committee’s paper checks, which was “reissued to a fraudulent payee, and processed,” Johnson’s campaign wrote to the Federal Election Commission last week.

Federal Election Commission filing
“This was not due to misuse of funds internally,” the campaign committee told federal regulators. “The Committee is currently working with the bank to retrieve the lost funds if possible.”
Greg Steele, spokesman for Johnson’s campaign, told OpenSecrets on Friday that they do not know who stole the check and are “exploring” whether to involve law enforcement.
“We just caught it during our normal reconciliation process at the end of the financial quarter, and the account is locked down,” Steele said.
He added that Johnson’s campaign has had no other theft-related issues since.
While losing $10,000 will barely dent Johnson’s overall political finances — his committee reported more than $6.7 million in cash on hand as of June 30 — the theft is the latest in a series of incidents involving fraudsters hitting high-profile politicians and party committees.
Taken together, federal political committees have lost millions of dollars this decade, an OpenSecrets analysis of federal records and media reports indicates.
Thieves have successfully targeted the political campaigns of President Joe Biden, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), Virginia Democratic Sens. Tim Kaine and Mark Warner, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Tulsi Gabbard, who ran for president as a Democrat in 2020 and now serves as President Donald Trump’s national security advisor.
The campaign committee of Sen. Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) lost nearly $700,000 in 2022, prompting an FBI investigation.
In May and June of this year, Moran’s committee reported two small “unauthorized charges” for purchases at a Target store in Overland Park, Kan., that have since been reimbursed, according to FEC records.
Scammers have also hit the Republican National Committee, Wisconsin Republican Party, Oregon Republican Party, anti-Trump super PAC Lincoln Project and the Democratic-supporting Retired Americans PAC.
In addition to Johnson, OpenSecrets has found evidence of more than a dozen federal political committees experiencing a financial crime against them since the November election, including those of Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) and Reps. Neal Dunn (R-Fla.) and Brittany Pettersen (D-Colo.).
Someone used the National Republican Congressional Committee’s credit card for a shopping spree — the damage: $2,425 — at retailers Canada Goose and Fendi.
The FEC acknowledges that while misappropriation of political committee funds is “not common,” it has “encountered a number of cases.”
If a political committee discovers misappropriated funds, it “must notify law enforcement” as well as the FEC to properly disclose any reporting errors caused by a theft or unauthorized expenditure of campaign money.
The FEC recommends political committees take several proactive steps to avoid theft, including limiting the number of people authorized to sign checks, “carefully controlling” credit and debit cards and placing dollar restrictions on financial account withdrawals.

(Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)WINFRED — Ken Meyer’s boots imprint the fine layer of dust settled over the concrete floor as he walks through South Dakota’s first industrial hemp processing facility.
It’s loud. Fans whirl and machinery grinds. Strips of sunlight cut through the haze.
Piles of dry hemp stalks line one wall. Meyer gestures toward a forklift feeding one of the piles into an industrial contraption. 
On one side of the machine, fiber pours out in tangled ribbons. On another, chunks of the woody core, called “hurd,” tumble into a large sack atop a pallet. Meyer reaches in and raises a handful. 
“We can turn hemp stalks into materials for animal bedding, hempcrete, bioplastics, you name it,” he said. “Right here in South Dakota.”

Meyer has a vision. He said expanding the hemp supply chain in South Dakota will bring more small processing and manufacturing into the state, and pull heat-trapping carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. 
“Hemp absorbs carbon as it grows, and we can lock the carbon into the various materials produced,” Meyer said. “And all that manufacturing could happen here in South Dakota.”
But coordinating the investments, infrastructure, oversight and market development needed to realize that vision is more work than Meyer alone can accomplish with his company, Complete Hemp Processing. 
In Wakonda, John Peterson with Dakota Hemp is not only constructing the state’s second processing facility but is also a hemp farmer. 
“We can’t just have everybody start planting hemp,” Peterson said. “You need the whole chain — growers, processors, and manufacturers — to come online at the same time. And that’s hard.”
Hemp and carbon
South Dakotans have only been growing hemp since 2021. The state is now the No. 1 hemp producer in the country, with 3,700 acres harvested in 2024. To capitalize on hemp’s potential to sequester carbon dioxide and keep it from trapping heat in the atmosphere, millions more acres are needed.
Hemp can grow 16 feet tall in three months. Growing a field of 16-foot-high stalks requires a lot of photosynthesis, which is the way plants absorb carbon dioxide and water to convert sunlight into energy for growth. An acre of hemp stalks absorbs approximately 5.5 tons of carbon per acre each season, according to Brittany McKell, with Hemp Carbon Standard in Canada. She said an additional ton of CO2 per acre is stored in the soil if less invasive tillage practices are used.
Pipeline won’t capture all carbon emitted by ethanol plants

Hemp Carbon Standard works with farmers to quantify the amount of carbon sequestered by their hemp farm and convert that to credits. Those are sold on global, private carbon markets where companies and individuals purchase them to offset their greenhouse gas emissions. The company then shares those profits back with farmers. Peterson recently signed up and earned 367 carbon credits on one year’s harvest, which can be sold for over $100 each. 
While corn stalks can temporarily store up to about 4 tons of above-ground carbon dioxide per acre, most of it is re-released through digestion and decay.

Decay happens to harvested hemp, too. Keeping the carbon in the hemp stalks requires a longer-term carbon storage solution: processing those stalks into long-lasting materials. Hemp’s utility extends to everything from bioplastics and lumber to textiles and insulation. Hempcrete, for example, is a construction material made from hemp hurd and lime that absorbs CO2 as it sets.
Hemp Carbon Standard promotes the use of those products, too, because McKell said they serve as sustainable, less carbon-intensive alternatives that indirectly offset the production of their more carbon-intensive counterparts: oil-based plastics, wood from trees and energy-intensive construction materials. Depending on the product being made, McKell said, the impact of producing hemp-based, less carbon-intensive alternatives prevents another 9 to 18 tons of CO2 from entering the atmosphere, per acre of hemp allocated to the production of the material.
The numbers mean that if 18% of South Dakota’s approximately 18.5 million cropland acres grew hemp every summer, the hemp stalks — not counting the carbon potentially stored in the soil or the material offset of producing less carbon-intensive materials — would remove over 18 million tons of atmospheric carbon per year. That’s as much as a proposal in South Dakota aiming to achieve a similar vision: Summit Carbon Solution’s carbon sequestration pipeline, which would annually capture up to 18 million tons of carbon emissions from 57 ethanol plants in five states. The five-state project has faced numerous regulatory and legal hurdles, along with opposition from landowners refusing to grant access and expressing concerns about potential leaks of toxic carbon dioxide plumes.
Farmers with land crossed by the pipeline would receive easement payments. In hemp production, farmers can capitalize the carbon-storage potential of their crop by selling carbon credits. Hemp also requires no herbicides, unlike other row crops such as corn and soybeans.
Despite its potential, the hemp market faces regulatory challenges. And industrial hemp advocates say getting hemp this far was not easy. 
The fight to legalize hemp
Although hemp was federally legalized under the 2018 farm bill — which defined hemp as cannabis containing no more than 0.3% tetrahydrocannabinol (known as TCH, which results in a high at greater concentrations) — South Dakota did not immediately follow suit.
Early efforts to legalize hemp production at the state level were met with resistance, particularly from former Gov. Kristi Noem’s administration, which expressed concern that legal hemp could lead to broader marijuana legalization. Oren Lesmeister, a rancher and Democratic former legislator from Parade, spent years fighting to get the hemp industry rolling in South Dakota. 
“There was this fear that everyone was going to run out and get stoned,” Lesmeister said. “We had to beat that misconception with education and persistence.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The legal and regulatory barriers fell in several stages. The first major step was ensuring that South Dakota’s laws aligned with federal standards legalizing the crop, something the 2018 farm bill allowed states to do.
Implementation in South Dakota lagged, with hemp cultivation beginning in 2021 after state administrative rules were finalized and approved. Even then, regulatory burdens remained. But Meyer said many of these initial state restrictions have since been scaled back as South Dakota gained experience with the crop.
Meyer said the two major impediments still in place are THC testing requirements and criminal background checks. He hopes those requirements will be loosened in the next federal farm bill. 
Selling a bottom-up vision
Lesmeister sees parallels with corn-based ethanol, which grew into a major industry with help from the federal government. It created a guaranteed market through the Renewable Fuel Standard, which requires refiners to blend billions of gallons of ethanol into gasoline each year or buy credits. The number of corn acres in South Dakota went from about 4 million before the standard was enacted to about 6 million last year.
“Hemp got this far without any of that,” Lesmeister said. “But imagine where it could be with a little help.”
Doug Sombke, president of the South Dakota Farmers Union, sees helping the emerging hemp industry as a better way to sequester carbon than controversial proposals to capture carbon emitted by ethanol plants.
“If you really want to support the climate and agriculture, get that money to the people working the land,” Sombke said.
Bryan Jorgensen is a regenerative farmer and soil health expert from Ideal. He is skeptical that climate change requires government action. But Jorgensen does see industrial hemp as a chance to rebuild rural communities as part of America’s manufacturing base.
“This could localize manufacturing,” he said. “But it takes vision and the will to invest in producers instead of propping up extractive systems.”

By comparison, he sees carbon pipelines as an extension of a flawed farm economy that has become overly dependent on corn and soybeans, partly due to the federal support for those crops.
“We’ve created this monster,” Jorgensen said. “We’ve invested billions in learning how to grow corn, so now we don’t know how to do anything else. And farmers are stuck in a system where they’re not even the ones benefiting.”
Silvia Secchi, a professor at the University of Iowa who studies agricultural and climate policy, agrees.
“We subsidized the corn, not the farmer,” she said. “That’s the problem.”
For now, the few thousand acres of hemp grown in South Dakota pale in comparison to about 6 million acres of corn and 5 million acres of soybeans. But advocates believe that could change rapidly if hemp processors and manufacturers move in, and the U.S. government backs the vision.
“There’s a real opportunity here,” said Karll Lecher, co-founder of Dakota Hemp. “We just need more boots on the ground.”",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Hemp-photo-adjusted-1024x713.jpg,,,2025-07-20 10:57:55.468032

But is that bandage big enough to save struggling rural hospitals?
“I have more questions than I have answers,” said Alan Morgan, CEO of the National Rural Health Association, a nonprofit policy group. “No one has those answers yet.”
Morgan noted that the new money for rural health, to be spent over five years, is far less than the $155 billion in rural Medicaid spending cuts over 10 years, as estimated by KFF, a nonprofit health policy and research group.
Experts, hospital leaders and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle fear that Trump’s signature legislation will particularly gut rural hospitals and clinics, which see an outsize share of patients who are insured through Medicaid, the federal-state public health insurance for people with low incomes. The new law slashes more than $1 trillion from Medicaid over the next 10 years to help pay for tax cuts that disproportionately benefit the wealthy.
The $50 billion addition was an effort by Republican leaders in Congress to win the votes of colleagues within their party who initially balked at supporting such steep cuts to Medicaid and other health services.
In the U.S. Senate, the rural program helped secure the vote of Alaska moderate Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who expressed concern about the law’s impact on health care in her state. About 1 in 3 Alaskans are insured through Medicaid.
Jared Kosin, the president and CEO of the Alaska Hospital & Healthcare Association, said he’s deeply frustrated with the new law’s gutting of Medicaid funding, which he thinks will wreak lasting damage on Alaskans. And Republicans sidestepped potential solutions by just throwing money into a program, he said.
“It’s frustrating in the public realm when decisions like this are made fast and, frankly, carelessly,” he said.
“The consequences are going to fall on us, not them.”
More than half of the law’s cuts to funding in rural areas are concentrated in 12 states with large rural populations that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act to cover more people, according to KFF: Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania and Virginia.
Some GOP lawmakers in Congress have heralded the $50 billion rural program as a health care victory. But it’s still unclear which hospitals, clinics and other providers would receive money and how much.
How it works
The Rural Health Transformation Program will dole out $10 billion annually from fiscal years 2026 through 2030.
States must apply for their funding by the end of this year, submitting a detailed plan on how it would be used.
The law outlines some ways that states can use the money, according to an analysis of the legislation from the Bipartisan Policy Center:

Making payments to rural hospitals to help them maintain essential services such as emergency room care or labor and delivery.
Recruiting and training rural doctors, nurses and other health workers.
Bolstering emergency medical services such as ambulances and EMTs.
Using new technologies, including telehealth.
Providing opioid use disorder treatment and mental health services.
Improving preventive care and chronic disease management.

Half of the $10 billion each year will be distributed evenly across states that have applied for it. The other half can be distributed by the administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services — currently Dr. Mehmet Oz — at his discretion, based on a state’s rural population and rural health facilities.
Although the program doesn’t replace the amount states are likely to lose, Morgan said it’s still an opportunity to rethink how rural health care is funded. He’d like to see states given flexibility in how they’re able to use the funds, and he hopes they focus on keeping rural communities healthy through preventive care while still helping hospitals keep their doors open.
“If done correctly, it could really change the future course for rural America,” Morgan said. “That is such a tough ask, though.”
Hardest hit
Kentucky could take the biggest hit from the new law’s reduction in rural Medicaid funding, losing an estimated $12 billion over 10 years, according to a KFF analysis.
The state’s Medicaid department is still waiting for additional federal guidance to understand how the state’s program will be affected, Kendra Steele, spokesperson with the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services, told Stateline in a statement.
“Over 1.4 million Kentuckians rely on Medicaid — including half of all children in our state, seniors and more vulnerable populations — and the passage of legislation on the federal level will have serious impacts for those individuals, rural health care and hospitals and local economies,” she wrote.
Even with the new program, states across the country will have to reevaluate their budgets in light of the cuts, said Hemi Tewarson, executive director at the National Academy for State Health Policy, a nonpartisan group that supports states in developing health care policies.
“Every region is slightly different and there’s not a one-size-fits-all approach,” she said. “Hospital ownership varies [as well as] the types of services that are critical for the community where they’re located. They have to think about new ways to provide those services in a context with fewer resources.”
About 44% of rural hospitals are operating in the red, according to a KFF analysis of Rand Hospital Data, a higher share than the 35% of hospitals in urban areas.
‘Rural at heart’
Prior to the bill’s passage, Oz attempted to reassure U.S. House Republicans that their districts could get money from the program even if they weren’t specifically rural, Politico reported earlier this month.










We’re all rural at heart when it comes to money.


– Alan Morgan, CEO of the National Rural Health Association


Pennsylvania Republican U.S. Rep. Rob Bresnahan said money would begin flowing to his district as early as the beginning of next year, telling the Wilkes-Barre Times Leader earlier this month that he met with Trump, Oz and others to secure pledges that hospitals in his district could access the fund. He represents the northeastern corner of Pennsylvania, which includes suburban and rural areas, as well as the cities of Scranton and Wilkes-Barre.
Though the legislation includes guidelines on which facilities or areas qualify as “rural,” Morgan, of the National Rural Health Association, expects a mad dash from lawmakers and providers to claim rural status in order to get a piece of the funding.
“That’s going to be a huge issue — defining who’s rural,” Morgan said. “We’re all rural at heart when it comes to money.”

(Photo by Jim Peaco/National Park Service)The U.S. House Committee on Natural Resources on Tuesday narrowly voted in favor of delisting the grizzly bear from the Endangered Species Act, pushing legislation long sought by western state elected officials to the next step in the congressional process.
House Resolution 281, the Grizzly Bear State Management Act of 2025, was introduced by Rep. Harriet Hageman, R-Wyoming, along with Montana’s two Republican congressmen, Reps. Ryan Zinke and Troy Downing.
The legislation directs the Secretary of the Interior to remove the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem population of grizzly bears from the Endangered Species Act, restoring a ruling by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service issued in 2017 during the first Trump Administration.
That rule was later vacated by a federal circuit court, and the agency, under the Biden administration, reversed its stance and recommended the grizzly stay on the list, and under federal jurisdiction.
“The GYE grizzly population has exceeded the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s recovery goals for over two decades,” Hageman said during the committee’s markup hearing. “Since a mere 3% of species listed under the ESA have ever been delisted the ESA desperately needs a success story like the GYE grizzly bear. The grizzly is, in fact, the poster child for how the ESA has failed in terms of what it was intended to do and how it has actually been implemented.”

But Democrats on the committee pushed back against the bill, arguing that the proposal amounted to a political football and could jeopardize the continued recovery of the species.
The court ruling that vacated the 2017 delisting rule cited the federal government’s “failure to consider long term genetic effects on other populations and concerns that the decision was driven by political pressure … instead of the best available science,” ranking member Rep. Jared Huffman, D-California, said.
He said the decision continued the partisan game played with the ESA, ignored consultation with Native American tribes on a culturally significant species, and removed public input from the process.
“To legislatively delist the population located around Yellowstone in Wyoming, Montana and Idaho, from the ESA and then block judicial review, that is not going to lead us down the path of success,” Huffman added. “That’s going to lead us to some really unfortunate consequences.”
Grizzly bears throughout the contiguous states were listed under the Endangered Species Act in 1975 when there were only an estimated 300 to 400 animals left in the wild. Currently, FWS estimates there are roughly 2,314 grizzlies living between Idaho, Montana, Wyoming and parts of Washington.
During the last decade, a saga of proposed delisting actions, lawsuits and petitions have left the fate of grizzly bears overshadowed with questions.
Montana previously petitioned FWS to delist the species in the GYE and the Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem, centered around Glacier National Park and the Bob Marshall Wilderness, but the agency rejected the petition early this year. A similar petition from Wyoming was also rejected in the final weeks of the Biden administration.
Instead, FWS proposed a new comprehensive approach to federal grizzly management, including consolidating grizzlies living in six distinct recovery zones into a single population. That move would have prevented sub-populations, such as the GYE, from being considered for delisting separately from the species as a whole.
Montana officials derided that decision, with Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte, a Republican, saying the administration was embracing a “scorched earth strategy,” in its final days. He added that he looked forward to working with the Trump administration on a new path forward.
Rep. Zinke shared similar sentiments at the time: “Thankfully the political hands pulling the strings at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service are about to be fired and President Trump will no doubt immediately rescind this train-wreck decision.”
Zinke briefly served as Interior Secretary during Trump’s first administration, and was in office when the 2017 delisting was announced.
Zinke’s office did not respond to a request for comment about the committee’s vote on the 2025 rule or questions about preventing judicial review.
But Montana Sen. Steve Daines praised Tuesday’s vote in a post on the social media platform X, formerly Twitter, that “delisting the grizzly bear is long overdue.”
Ahead of the committee vote, more than 50 conservation organizations signed onto a letter urging representatives to vote against the legislation.
“The grizzly bear populations in those locations are stable and growing, but conservationists remain concerned about the geographic and genetic isolation of those populations, the threat of increased human-induced mortality through hunting or predator control if they were delisted and management returned to the states of Montana, Wyoming, and Idaho, and the effects of delisting particular populations on grizzly bears in the rest of the lower-48 states,” the letter states.



Let us know what you think...


 


Chris Servheen, a retired FWS grizzly bear recovery coordinator who petitioned the federal government to consider managing grizzlies as a single population — the plan the agency put forth this year — said in a statement that the efforts to delist grizzlies by congressional actions ignored key components of the ESA.
“The current administration and Congress are working to defund grizzly bear science and monitoring, dramatically reduce funding for federal land management agencies in grizzly range, increase timber harvest and road building in grizzly habitat, and weaken or eliminate the fundamental laws that grizzly recovery depends on like the ESA, the National Environmental Policy Act and the United States Forest Service Roadless Rule,” Servheen said. “At the same time, recreation pressure on public lands and private land development are accelerating rapidly in grizzly habitat putting even more stress on grizzlies. Congressional delisting while the cumulative impacts of these actions are ongoing is irresponsible and will result in immediate declines in grizzly numbers and range.”
During the committee discussion, Rep. Hageman hammered home her argument that the reason environmental groups and previous administrations had pushed to keep the grizzlies listed was for “controlling large swaths of land and water resources. It’s that simple.”
She said that both individual states, and the federal government, have limited resources to spend on issues like endangered species, and they should be allocated to where the need is highest.
“There are species that truly do need our protection and need the resources to be made available so that we can protect them and recover them,” she said. “When we are wasting money on a recovered species, those are resources that cannot be used for that purpose.”
Democrats proposed three amendments to the bill — one to require DOI to follow the new 2025 species assessment issued by FWS that considered all grizzlies in the lower 48 to be considered a single population; another to require more tribal consultation in management decisions for grizzlies; and a third that sought to strip out the prohibition on judicial review in the bill.
All three amendments failed on party-line votes.
On the discussion over judicial review, Hageman said the point of the bill is to carry out the purpose and intent of the Endangered Species Act, and removing the legal provision amounted to a “gift to the radical environmental lobby.”
“Until the bear has returned to state control where it belongs, lawsuits and ever shifting recovery standards will stand in the way activist judges have stood in the way of delisting for far too long,” she said.
Hageman added that when the grey wolf was delisted in 2011, during the Obama administration, a similar provision was put into that legislation.
The committee voted 20-19 along party lines to recommend approval by the full House of Representatives.
Huffman gave notice that he intended to file “dissenting or minority views,” on the measure for the full chamber.
Rep. Russ Fulcher, R-Idaho, and Rep. Pete Stauber, R-Minn, also cosponsored the legislation.

Though the legislation includes guidelines on which facilities or areas qualify as “rural,” Morgan, of the National Rural Health Association, expects a mad dash from lawmakers and providers to claim rural status in order to get a piece of the funding.
“That’s going to be a huge issue — defining who’s rural,” Morgan said. “We’re all rural at heart when it comes to money.”

That description could apply to former President Barack Obama after his speech at the 2004 Democratic National Convention – or, 20 years later, to Michigan state Sen. Mallory McMorrow.
McMorrow has worked with Democratic communications operative Lis Smith, who also served as Obama’s re-election campaign’s director of rapid response and helped propel former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg onto the national stage as a presidential candidate in 2020 though he had only served as the mayor of South Bend, Indiana.
But with the Democratic primary for president in 2028 wide open, McMorrow says that’s where the parallels end.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
She told the Michigan Advance during a recent campaign stop in Flint that, if elected to the U.S. Senate in 2026, she is committed to serving out her full term.
Several rising stars in the Democratic Party have previously been crowned the “next Obama” – including former Vice President Kamala Harris, who did launch a campaign president halfway through her term in the U.S. Senate, the same timeframe as Obama when he was elected president in 2008, but dropped out before a single state had voted.
“I am always flattered. It’s also very strange when people talk about Democratic Party stars like this is a celebrity contest,” McMorrow said. “It’s not. So I’m just going to do everything I can do to win the Senate seat, and we’ll see what happens.”
McMorrow is running in a Democratic field that already includes U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens (D-Birmingham), former state House Speaker Joe Tate (D-Detroit) and former Wayne County Health Director Abdul El-Sayed. On the Republican side, former U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers (R-White Lake) is the only announced GOP candidate.

McMorrow wouldn’t be the only Michigan official to be the subject of speculation as the Democratic Party searches for a leader in 2028.
Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has long been named a potential candidate for president, though she has repeatedly denied interest in the job and the speculation has quieted since the start of President Donald Trump’s second term, with some Democrats expressing frustration over her collaborative approach toward Trump, which landed her unexpectedly in the Oval Office but also garnered a new fighter mission for Selfridge Air National Guard Base.
Since taking office in January, U.S. Sen. Elissa Slotkin (D-Holly) has been profiled by The Atlantic, Vanity Fair, POLITICO and The New York Times and delivered multiple high-profile speeches about the party’s path forward, including the Democratic response to Trump’s first Joint Address of his second presidency earlier this year.
Outgoing U.S. Sen. Gary Peters (D-Bloomfield Twp.) was among those floated as a candidate to be Harris’ running mate in 2024, with strong backing from labor groups, and he has emphasized that his decision to not seek re-election doesn’t mean he’s retiring from the public sphere.
And polls show Buttigieg, a Traverse City resident, as one of the early front-runners in hypothetical Democratic primary matchups.
In the meantime, McMorrow says Democrats who are already in positions of power need to be doing everything they can to stand up to Trump in the present.
“It is completely unacceptable for some of the leaders in my own party to go out giving interviews where they say things like, ‘well, we’re not in power right now, but don’t worry, their polling numbers are coming down, and we’ll get them in the midterms,’” McMorrow said.
“That is heinous to me. As a U.S. senator, you are one of the 100 most powerful people in the entire country. And even if you are not in power with gavels in your hand, in that sense, you still have a platform, you still have a voice.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AMR_0004-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-20 08:57:16.705997

Our state government and many private institutions in our state need major reform.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Carter Neubieser: We haven’t done enough to put working families first.","This commentary is by Carter Neubieser, a Progressive city councilor representing Ward 1 in Burlington.


Vermonters have made clear that they want a fair tax system, union jobs, affordable housing and health care, and an end to a corrupt political system. Folks have been clear that we must do all we can to address pollution and protect our environment — both for our quality of life and economy. It’s clear that Vermonters understand that all of our neighbors deserve the dignity and respect every human being is entitled to.
Vermonts have also been clear on what our communities don’t want.
We don’t want to live in a state with nearly 39,000 households paying more than half of their income for housing.
We don’t want a state where the plan for poverty is to kick 800 people out of their housing, and onto the streets, with no serious solutions put forward.
We don’t want to live in a state where health care premiums have risen 92% since 2018, compared to the national average of 12%. Or where one organization — the UVM Health Network —  controls much of our health care market, leading to all sorts of wasted money and high costs.
We don’t want to live in a state where the federal government will kick tens of thousands of Vermonters off their health care, while cutting taxes for billionaires and their kids.
We don’t want our State Legislature and governor to completely gut public education, while refusing to raise taxes on the wealthiest people in our state. They had the gall to do this, without even taking a roll call vote on the legislation — that way voters don’t know who voted which way.
Our economic and political systems feel stagnant and tired, because they are — our ability to buy a home, make a decent living and provide for our families is disappearing before our eyes.
The good news is that they don’t need to be. The outcomes we are experiencing are the result of bad, sometimes cruel, choices made by politicians and large institutions. Different choices — grounded in fairness, anti-corruption and the needs of Vermont families — will produce better outcomes. 
Our state government and many private institutions in our state need major reform.
Moving forward we must tax those who can most afford it. These folks are about to receive the benefits of the largest transfer of wealth from working people to the wealthy in the history of our nation.
We must reign in the power of the UVM Health Network. We must reorganize our health care system with the goal of delivering quality, affordable care for everyone. We must recognize the importance of accessible care for rural communities.
We cannot rebrand and repeat the failed trickle-down economic policies of the last 50 years. We must instead make historic investments in the creation and maintenance of thousands of permanently affordable housing units, for buyers and renters alike.
We must strengthen — not gut — public education in Vermont. We must recognize the important role our public schools and teachers play in many rural communities across the state.
We must rapidly move to fully staff state government and focus on delivering services as effectively as possible.
We must reform our elections to encourage more participation and choice — not less. We must move rapidly to publicly funded elections and ban dark and corporate money.  
We must do everything in our power to oppose a dangerous Trump administration that will happily suppress political opposition by force and consolidate power in the executive. We must make clear that Vermonters support civil liberties and oppose more regime-change wars abroad.
In this moment, we must build a political movement that elects and supports leaders who are accountable to their neighbors and coworkers, not to other politicians and lobbyists in Montpelier.

(Courtesy Automobile License Plate Collectors Association)If you’re one of Rhode Island’s 471 motorists with a license plate featuring the Pell Bridge and the lighthouse from nearby Rose Island, prepare to brag to your peers that you have the best license plate in the world.
That’s according to the Automobile License Plate Collectors Association. Members of the world’s largest license plate hobbyist group will be in Providence Monday morning to officially award the designation.
It’s the first time Rhode Island has received the honor in the association’s 71-year history, receiving a score of 396 points. Second place went to Idaho, whose “wildlife” plate featuring a bluebird scored 379 points.


Here were the top 10 plates and their scores:

Rhode Island (396)
Idaho (379)
Oklahoma (367)
Wisconsin (362)
Alaska (351)
Kentucky (305)
Colorado (286)
New Mexico (274)
Florida (265)
Newfoundland and Labrador (246)



Every spring, the association offers its members a chance to vote for their favorite plates issued during the previous calendar year — with 23 making this latest cut, including one from Canada and Australia. A representative from the Automobile License Plate Collectors Association did not immediately respond to request for comment.
Rhode Island’s winning plate features a graphic of the Rose Island Lighthouse with the Claiborne Pell Bridge in the background as two Shields sailboats with mainsails marked by the numbers 18 and 70 glide by. The numbers are a reference to the year the lighthouse was completed and first shone its light over Narragansett Bay.
The plate was designed by Ross Cann of A4 Architecture + Planning with support from longtime lighthouse aficionado Jan Slee. Sailboat art was done by Kara Acosta.
First issued last summer, the plates were created under a 2022 law on behalf of the Rose Island Lighthouse and Fort Hamilton Trust, the nonprofit dedicated to preserving the historic and environmental integrity of the 18-acre island, revolutionary-era barracks, and historic lighthouse.
For every $43.50 plate registration, $20 goes back to the nonprofit.

“It takes money to achieve our mission,” Sean O’Connor, the trust’s executive director, said in an interview Friday. “The charity plates are a great fundraiser — and we’re starting to see them more and more on the road.”
But O’Connor acknowledged the slow rollout to get the plates out.
State law requires 600 pre-orders before plates can enter production. Within a year of the enabling legislation, O’Connor said only around 350 had been purchased. So to ensure production of the plates, he said the trust paid the DMV roughly $4,500 on the remaining pre-orders.
That means the fundraiser was actually a net negative.
O’Connor said he is hopeful the recognition by the Automobile License Plate Collectors Association will encourage more drivers to sport one on their vehicles.
“If we get just 500 new orders from July – December, that will result in $10,000 additional revenue for our education programs on Rose Island, as well as on-going maintenance and restoration work of the historic Rose Island Lighthouse, revolutionary-era Fort Hamilton Barracks, and native habitat restoration and bird monitoring in our wildlife refuge,” he wrote in an email.
As of Friday, DMV spokesperson Paul Grimaldi said there were 471 active registrations with the Rose Island plate design.
Gov. Dan McKee will be among those speaking at Monday’s event scheduled for 10 a.m. at the Department of Adminis­tration’s One Capitol Hill building. McKee will be joined by Rhode Island Division of Motor Vehicles (DMV) administrator Walter “Bud” Craddock; Cyndi McCabe, president of the Automobile License Plate Collectors Association; and state Rep. Lauren A. Carson of Newport, and Sen. Dawn Euer, both Newport Democrats.

,Mississippi Today,2025-07-20 11:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,Does Jason White deserve to be cursed or praised? Depends on the issue.,Bobby Harrison,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/07/20/jason-white-curse-praise/,"Column: The dichotomy that is Jason White was on full display during a recent speech. Whether you want to curse him or praise him, the first-term House speaker is taking strong stances.","The dichotomy that is Jason White was on full display during a speech he delivered during a recent lunch meeting of the Mississippi State University Stennis Institute of Government.
Some at the meeting most likely cursed House Speaker Jason White because of his work to eliminate the Mississippi income tax and because of his unapologetic support of sending public funds to private schools.
Darn that Jason White.
But many of the same people would praise the first-term Republican speaker for his past support of expanding Medicaid to provide health insurance for primarily the working poor and for his support of restoring voting rights for people convicted of felonies.
Thanks, Jason White, some might say, perhaps begrudgingly.
But those people should give White some credit. It was no small feat for White to publicly voice support for Medicaid expansion as he campaigned in 2023 to gather the votes to win the speakership. Before then it was rare for a Republican politician in Mississippi to even utter the words “Medicaid expansion.” Theoretically, White could have been putting his political future on the line.
But in 2024 after being elected speaker by his Republican caucus, White made a good faith but ultimately unsuccessful effort to pass an expansion bill. The proposal was defeated for multiple reasons.
But White has not ruled out the possibility of Medicaid expansion being revisited.
He said the state still needs to help struggling rural hospitals and to work to increase the number of Mississippians who have health coverage. And to achieve those goals, Medicaid expansion, despite changes made to the program in the so-called federal “Big Beautiful Bill,” appears to still be the best mechanism to help struggling hospitals and to ensure health care coverage for poor, working Mississippians.
Another proposal that many Republican leaders, including Gov. Tate Reeves, have opposed that White has embraced is restoring voting rights for people who have been convicted of felonies. In Mississippi people convicted of some crimes, even some relatively minor ones, lose their voting rights for life.
White recently said that he supports “addressing barriers to suffrage for those … who have served their time … paid their debt to society, paid all fines and fees. We are looking for a way to remove barriers for those folks to reengage with the community and be able to vote.”
But many of the same people who would support White’s efforts in health care and in expanding voting rights would curse the considerable political capital he spent to pass a bill that is intended to phase out Mississippi’s income tax, which accounts for about 30% of the state’s general fund revenue.
While White has stepped outside of the Mississippi Republican policy boundaries on some issues, he is right in line with many of his Republican colleagues on the issues of tax cuts and even of providing public funds to private schools. As a matter of fact, White admits he is more of an advocate on the private school voucher issue than many of his fellow House Republicans.
White’s background might help explain his diverse political philosophy.
White was elected as a Democrat in 2011 from a rural district where it would have been difficult for a Republican to win. The district was held by a Democrat — Mary Ann Stevens — who was voting with the burgeoning House Republican caucus. White ran as the candidate of the Democrats, who were desperately trying to maintain their House majority. He won, but the Democrats lost.
After that pivotal election, White saw the handwriting on the wall and changed parties. With that party switch, the Republican majority redrew House boundaries to create a district where White could win as a Republican.
But it is reasonable to assume that in many ways, White is still the person he was when he ran as a rural Democrat.
He is still from a poor, rural area where health care is at the top of mind — and where, often, health care is nearly non-existent.
And in his day-to-day activities, White, an attorney, crosses paths with people convicted of felonies who have paid for their mistake and want a chance to reenter society. That reentry for many includes voting.
And yes, there are struggling schools in the rural area where White lives in Holmes County.
Rightfully or wrongfully, White sees private school vouchers as a way for students trapped in struggling schools to have a better chance.
Many believe that it is wrong-headed thinking to take money from the struggling public schools that need all the help they can get, and that may be a reason to curse White. For others, though, his support of Medicaid expansion is a reason to praise him.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/05015952/3X0A7063-scaled.jpg,,,2025-07-20 07:56:35.006229

BURLINGTON — The line for entry at Centennial Field nearly stretches to Colchester Avenue. More than 30 minutes before first pitch, parking spots have evaporated. The smell of sunscreen lingers, kids buzz with the freedom of their outdoor voices and chatter bleeds into the sounds of the ballpark.
Sweaty and patient, they’re all there to catch the Vermont Lake Monsters. 
“Hotdog Hysteria” nights like this, on the first of July, are one of a long list of promotions designed to pull in crowds and keep them coming back, even on nights when the franks are the usual $4. Tonight, they’re just 25 cents, and predictably, the concession line snakes across the park to the bullpen on the other side.

From June to August, if the crowds are any indication, the Lake Monsters have made themselves a must-see event. 
Just a few years ago, the future of baseball in Burlington was far from certain. In 2020, Major League Baseball shrunk its minor league circuit, and teams like the Lake Monsters were left on the outside looking in.
Those changes put a long history in peril: Between 1994 and 2020, the Lake Monsters boasted 132 Major League alumni. The team’s park, leased from the University of Vermont in the summer, was built in 1906 and is one of the oldest in the country. Over the course of 119 years, it hosted multiple Hall of Famers as they made their way to the big leagues.
That’s when Chris English stepped to the plate. A native of Montreal, English led the Nos Amours Baseball Club group that purchased the Lake Monsters in March 2021. With no MLB club providing players, the front office needed to find ways to build a roster — and swiftly. 
One of English’s first calls was to former general manager C.J. Knudsen.

English called once, then again, Knudsen said, with the former manager rebuffing the idea of rejoining the team. 
“Then he called me a third time,” Knudsen said, and the two came to an agreement: Knudsen would come back.
“We had no players,” he said. “It was basically myself, Chris and Morgan Brown, who’s our director of baseball operations, and we were able to rebuild the franchise and rebuild the roster.” 
The franchise’s reinvention as part of a summer league for college players began that first summer in 2021.
“We had 67 different players play for us, 11 Vermonters, and somehow we were able to put together an amazing win streak,” Knudsen said. 
A championship trophy in the team’s inaugural 2021 season in the Futures Collegiate League followed. 
In affiliated minor league baseball, the Major League club has complete control of the coaches and players on the field for its smaller counterpart. 
As an amateur team, the Lake Monsters have enjoyed a newfound flexibility to build rosters on the field that represent Vermont while committing more firmly to partnerships with Vermont businesses off the field, Knudsen said. 
“I think the fans loved it because the level of baseball is much better than when it was a single-A, short season,” Knudsen said. “The guys are all in college. They’re from all across the country, but there’s also some Vermont identity here.”

Baseball in Vermont has seen declining youth participation. Long winters and competing youth sports have made it harder to engage young ballplayers. Knudsen said he understands that community impact is more central than ever to the franchise’s mission — and that now, with the power to choose their players, the Lake Monsters could help revive the game in the Green Mountain State.
“I think that people can identify when they see a person’s name like Wyatt Cameron last year, or Colby Brouillette, you know. Wyatt Cameron’s from Salisbury, Vermont. Colby Brouillette from Georgia, Vermont … people know their names,” Knudsen said. “It gives the opportunity for boys and girls playing Little League Baseball and youth sports to potentially play for the Vermont Lake Monsters because they literally can see it.” 
Since the new ownership came into place, the team has pursued local products for the park: An ice cream stand sources from an Arlington dairy; the franchise formulated its own hot sauce and enlisted a bottler in Barre so fans can take it home.
And this year, for the first time, the ballpark will go by a new name: Delta Dental Park at Centennial Field (a 10-year sponsorship deal, Knudsen said, that will help fund the things fans enjoy).
It has been 20 years since the Montreal Expos moved to Washington, five since professional play left Vermont entirely. “We are celebrating our 31st season here,” Knudsen said. “That’s a long time for a sports franchise to be in business and operate.”
The one constant? The crowds lined up outside.

Sinclair Lewis drew from national and international headlines, but set most of the story among the green valleys of his adopted home state.

Photo via the New York Public Library
Nobel Prize winning author Sinclair Lewis sequestered himself on his Vermont farm during the summer of 1935 and hammered away on his latest novel. He was in a hurry, fearing that real-world events might overtake his narrative.
For his plot, Lewis drew from national and international headlines of the day, but he made the main character a Vermont newspaper editor and set most of the story among the green valleys of his adopted home. For 12 hours a day, seven days a week, Lewis plotted his story and then tapped it out on his portable typewriter, before making copious handwritten revisions to the text. He finished the 498-page manuscript on August 13. It told a story sure to grab the public’s attention. 
The resulting book, “It Can’t Happen Here,” was an instant bestseller. It tells the dystopian story of a populist American politician, Berzelius “Buzz” Windrip, who stokes people’s fears and preys on their patriotism, promising sweeping reforms to return the country to its original values. Windrip defeats Franklin Roosevelt in the Democratic primary and is then elected president. Once in power, Windrip leads a fascist takeover of the United States. He declares martial law to neutralize Congress, which had refused to pass his legislation, and disempower the Supreme Court, which could have blocked his decrees. Windrip’s violent paramilitary force, the Minute Men, suppresses opposition. Windrip seizes control of the media in a way that makes it appear the country still has a free press; he censors some journalists while co-opting others to spread his propaganda. 
In 1935, Lewis, like many Americans, was alarmed by the rise of fascism in Europe, led by Adolf Hitler in Germany and Benito Mussolini in Italy. Lewis was well informed about the situation, hearing firsthand details from his wife, famed journalist Dorothy Thompson, who had been a correspondent in Germany. Thompson had interviewed Hitler when he was still aspiring to power and wrote a dismissive profile. Hitler didn’t forget the slight. After he became German chancellor, he had Thompson expelled from the country. 
American politics had its share of demagogues during the 1930s. Among the most prominent was Louisiana Gov. Huey Long, who promised to obliterate privilege and wealth in order to make “every man a king.” At the same time, Long ran Louisiana with an iron fist while facing credible claims that he committed bribery, election fraud, and voter intimidation; put loyalists into state jobs, profited from ties to oil companies doing business with his state, and even tried to get his bodyguard to kill a political rival. As Lewis wrote his novel, Long was eyeing challenging Roosevelt in the Democratic primary. 
It may be hard now to imagine Roosevelt as politically vulnerable—he would ultimately be re-elected president three times—but in 1935 he was in his first term, America was in the depths of the Great Depression, and his wide-ranging programs had yet to alleviate American suffering.

Vermont served as a sanctuary for Lewis, who yearned to return whenever he was gone too long. 
On a property-buying expedition in Vermont in 1928, Lewis and Thompson visited their New York City landlord’s 300-acre property in Barnard. They were so struck by the stone walls, mixed woodlands and distant view of Mount Ascutney that they offered $10,000 on the spot for the property, which was worth about $3,000, if it were farmed. Their landlord jumped at the offer, leaving the next day for Florida, where he planned to retire.
The Barnard property had two farmhouses; Thompson and Lewis called it Twin Farms and made it their warm-weather base. They would live in the smaller house and renovate the larger as a guesthouse. The couple hired a large staff of locals to maintain the houses and grounds. Thompson invited employees to bring their children to work so her son would have playmates. Seeking a quiet spot away from the children, Lewis shifted his office to the guesthouse. 
Lewis wasn’t a recluse, though. When he wasn’t working, he would often socialize with Vermonters, particularly writers and journalists, and became conversant in the state’s history. Speaking to the Rotary Club of Rutland, he declared his love for his adopted state: “Vermont is the first place I have seen where I really wanted to have my home—a place to spend the rest of my life.”
Lewis sets the opening scene of “It Can’t Happen Here” at a Rotary Club meeting in the fictional Vermont city of Fort Beulah, which he describes as a “comfortable village of old red brick, old granite workshops, and houses of white clapboards or gray shingles, with a few smug little modern bungalows, yellow or seal brown.” Lewis supposedly modelled Fort Beulah after Rutland, though he makes Fort Beulah’s main product granite in place of Rutland’s marble.  

After its publication as a novel, “It Can’t Happen Here” was adapted for the stage. In October 1936, the play ran simultaneously in 21 American theaters in 17 states in productions sponsored by the Federal Theatre Project.  Poster via the New York Public Library
The speakers at the meeting are a cantankerous retired general and a conservative female activist. The general says he doesn’t “altogether admire everything Germany and Italy have done,” but urges the United States to mimic their belligerence toward other countries: “We’ve got strength and will, and for whomever has those divine qualities it’s not only a right, it’s a duty, to use ’em!”
Meanwhile, the conservative activist urges a return to what she considers traditional American values. She is best known for opposing the right of women to vote and calling for women to remain at home and have as many babies as possible. 
Discussing the meeting afterward, the book’s protagonist, Doremus Jessup, the 60-year-old editor of the city’s newspaper, is dismayed to hear a local businessman, banker, school superintendent, and others agreeing with much of what the speakers said. The businessman even praises Hitler. Jessup is incredulous: “Cure the evils of Democracy by the evils of Fascism!”  
While the others seem to relish the prospect of a Windrip presidency, Jessup worries what he would do once in office. “Wait till Buzz takes charge of us,” he says. “A real Fascist dictatorship!”

When Windrip wins, Jessup is forced into the role of opposition, writing editorials against the administration. Things spiral out of control. The government seizes Jessup’s newspaper. When he is caught publishing anti-government pamphlets for a resistance movement called the New Underground, he is thrown into a concentration camp, where he is tortured by the Minute Men. Jessup escapes and flees to Canada. By the end of the book, he has slipped back into the United States, under the alias William Barton Dobbs, to spy for the New Underground. 
Immediately after the book was published, people tried to figure out who was the inspiration for Jessup. Many believed it was Howard Hindley, the longtime editor of the Rutland Herald and a friend of Lewis. It was an entertaining theory, but Vermont author Charles Crane, in his 1937 book “Let Me Show You Vermont,” wrote: “It’s not so, as both Lewis and Hindley declare.”
Crane quoted Hindley as saying, “I’m not at all like Doremus Jessup. I’m…not given to philosophical remarks such as are put into Jessup’s mouth by the author, and certainly I wouldn’t have the guts to go through what Jessup did.”
Most scholars believe that Jessup isn’t modelled after a real-life individual, but instead represents upper middle class, small-town, political moderates who were struggling to figure out how to confront the rise of Fascism. Lewis also seems to speak through the character, expressing his own concerns about current events and fears about the future. 
Lewis’ book mentioned a real-life, one-time Vermont resident who, although little remembered today, played a role in the promotion of fascism in America. 
At one point in the story, Windrip lists people who have inspired him and mentions William Dudley Pelley. During the 1930s, Pelley was a leading American fascist. But before his life took that dark turn, he was a Vermont newspaperman. Born in Massachusetts in 1890, Pelley moved to Vermont in his mid-20s to work for the Bennington Banner newspaper. His job involved the physical production of the newspaper, not writing for it. 
In his spare time, Pelley wrote fiction. He created stories about a fictionalized version of Bennington, which he called Paris, Vermont. The proceeds from his four novels and the many short stories that appeared in popular magazines easily outstripped his $16 weekly salary at the Banner.
A couple of years later, Pelley was able to purchase a St. Johnsbury newspaper called the Caledonian at a steeply discounted price, because it had fallen on hard times. To serve the community properly, Pelley declared, a newspaper “must have no politics and no religion.”  
After only a year in charge, Pelley was ready to move on. The Methodist Episcopal Church hired him to study its missions around the world. His tour brought him to Europe and Asia, where he witnessed brutality related to the Russian Revolution. Pelley believed the false claim that the revolution had been incited as part of a vast Jewish conspiracy. He returned to America deeply anticommunist and antisemitic.
Having sold the Caledonian, Pelley moved to California, where he wrote scripts for the movie industry. But during his time in Hollywood, Pelley said he had a transformative experience. He claimed he had died and gone to heaven for seven minutes. During that time, he said, he met God and Jesus Christ, who told him to help bring about a religious transformation in the United States. Pelley interpreted the instructions to mean he should move to North Carolina and publish a Christian, fascist magazine. 
When the Nazis came to power in Germany in 1933, Pelley was ready, launching a paramilitary group called the Silver Legion in North Carolina. Its members were dubbed the Silver Shirts, inspired by Hitler’s brutal Brown Shirts. 
In 1936, like a real-life version of Buzz Windrip, Pelley ran for president. Unlike Windrip, he only managed to get on the ballot in one state and won 1,600 votes.
Pelley was called before the recently created House Committee on Un-American Activities in 1940 and accused of “fulsomely praising Hitler and of advocating dictatorship, vigilantism, and segregation of Jews.” A federal agent testified that Pelley had told her that he planned to organize a march on Washington, take over the government and implement Hitler’s program.
Two years later, with the United States having entered World War II, the federal government arrested Pelley and charged him with a dozen counts of making false and seditious statements, intent to cause insurrection within the military, and intent to obstruct military recruitment. A federal prosecutor called him “a tool of Axis propaganda.” The jury at his trial in federal court in Indiana convicted him on 11 counts. The judge sentenced him to 15 years in prison.
Pelley’s trial made news around the country. His career was finished and newspapers referred to him as the very thing that Lewis had warned about—a would-be American dictator.

Residents at Genesis HealthCare-run facilities in Vermont have reported numerous care and safety concerns over the years, including violations at two facilities in recent months.

Genesis HealthCare, a prominent nursing home provider in Vermont and one of the largest skilled nursing companies in the nation, filed for bankruptcy last week. 
Genesis currently operates three long-term care facilities in the state: the Bel Aire Center in Newport, the Mountain View Center in Rutland City and the Saint Albans Health & Rehabilitation, a spokesperson told VTDigger.
There are provisions in the bankruptcy filing to ensure staff at all Genesis-owned facilities, including the three in Vermont, retain positions, pay and benefits, for residents to continue receiving care during the court proceedings, and for the company’s vendor agreements to stay in place, according to the spokesperson. 
“There will be no expected impact to patient care as a result of this filing. Our daily operations remain unchanged, and our commitment to those we serve continues uninterrupted,” the spokesperson wrote.
According to bankruptcy documents filed in the Northern District of Texas U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Genesis has racked up between $1 billion and $10 billion in estimated liabilities, including over $700 million in unsecured claims to their 30 highest creditors. This includes $324 million in a real estate loan, over $103 million in deferred payroll taxes to the Internal Revenue Service and over $12 million owed to the New England Health Care Employees Pension Fund. 
Genesis faced challenges due to legacy debt, including “approximately $8 million per month in settlement and defense costs arising from alleged personal injury and wrongful death claims, most of which date back many years,” Genesis’ co-Chief Restructuring Officer Louis Robichaux IV wrote in the court document. 
Genesis skirted bankruptcy in the spring of 2021 after the private equity-backed company RenGen HealthCare provided an influx of capital, according to a case brief filed by Robichaux. RenGen, backed by Pinta Capital Partners, is also aiding Genesis’ “exit plan” through the form of a stalking horse bid, setting a minimum price for the company at auction, Robichaux wrote.
Three New York-based owners planned to take over five of the nine facilities Genesis owned in Vermont in 2020, including Bennington, Berlin, St. Johnsbury, Burlington and Springfield, after financial struggles, Covid-19 outbreaks, neglect cases and safety violations. According to reporting by Seven Days, the New York buyers dropped their bid for the five facilities in 2021 after state scrutiny into their previous management of facilities. 
The Genesis spokesperson wrote that the company has no current ownership stake and is not affiliated with any nursing homes other than the Bel Aire Center, the Mountain View Center and Saint Albans Health & Rehabilitation. 
However, Vermont’s business database shows that limited liability companies registered to six other facilities previously owned and operated by Genesis in Bennington, Berlin, Burlington, Rutland, Springfield and Saint Johnsbury were noted as affiliates or subsidiaries of Genesis in the bankruptcy filings. 
The spokesperson did not say why these limited liability companies were listed in the bankruptcy documents. The Department of Disabilities, Aging and Independent Living did not immediately respond to inquiries regarding the current ownership and operating companies of the six facilities. 
Genesis’ bankruptcy filing comes after the company has faced a number of controversies in recent years.

U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., spoke out against Genesis in 2021, calling the $5.2 million bonus to the company’s top executive amid patient deaths and Covid-19 outbreaks a display of “unfathomable greed.”
In one of the largest nursing home settlements in the state’s history, Genesis HealthCare entered a $740,000 settlement with the Vermont Attorney General’s Office in 2020, which created a patient care coordinator position and mandated at least two years of ongoing monitoring. 
The settlement followed four reports of neglect that resulted in a resident’s death and two residents being hospitalized at the then-Genesis-operated facilities Burlington Health & Rehab, Berlin Health & Rehab and St. Johnsbury Health & Rehab. 
The Vermont Attorney General’s Office sent a letter “identifying some concerns” to Genesis when the settlement ended in 2023, and there is no present ongoing monitoring, according to the office’s Chief of Staff Lauren Jandl. However, Division of Licensing and Protection surveys reveal recent deficiencies at the Mountain View Center and Saint Albans facility. 
In a survey of the Mountain View Center in June, residents said they were questioned by a staff member following a previous complaint and feared they would face retaliation if they spoke out about their concerns with care.
Another resident reported verbal abuse from a licensed nurse assistant after experiencing incontinence, according to the report. The division’s surveyors also found that a resident diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, which affects the body’s ability to regulate temperature, reported inconsistent temperature being set in their room that caused the resident to be cold despite reporting concerns with the heating to staff. 
The division’s report stated that numerous medications, cleaning supplies and food kept past expiration dates were in view as well.
According to a January survey of the Saint Albans Health & Rehabilitation center, the division found the building had numerous environmental safety violations. The report included descriptions of cracks and bare plaster spots on walls, a displaced electric outlet, visible rust and brown stains on a heater and bathrooms with broken or no toilet paper holders and tiles that were caked in unknown substances. On April 2, the division conducted a revisit survey and found the center in compliance. 
Kaili Kuiper, the state’s long-term care ombudsman with Vermont Legal Aid, said the organization has heard complaints from residents at Genesis-operated facilities and other privately run, private equity-backed facilities in the state of poor food quality and staff turnover, which indicate challenges in providing “good quality, patient centered care.” 
Executive Director of the Long-Term Care Coalition, Richard Mallot, said the organization has tracked an increasing “corporatization of nursing home care” in which for-profit, and private equity health care providers cut costs, particularly staffing, at the expense of quality care. 
Mallot said low staffing and a lack of hours nurses have to spend with residents tend to indicate quality of care at nursing homes. Currently, the average nursing staff hours per day for residents in Genesis-operated facilities in the state is below the Vermont average and the expected amount set by the Long-Term Care Coalition.
Sam Piesch, a health policy analyst with the state’s Health Care Advocate’s Office at Vermont Legal Aid, said there is broad consensus and concern regarding increasing private equity ownership of nursing homes due to lack of quality care, staffing level and health outcomes. 
According to data with the Private Equity Stakeholder Project, 26% of nursing homes in the state are run by private equity or private equity-backed companies. With a large aging and elderly population, Piesch said Vermont faces a “dystopian challenge” with lack of viable health care and nursing home ownership and operating options.
Piesch said the state’s existing protections and transparency requirements for private equity ownership in health care and nursing homes are weak. He said Vermont Legal Aid is advocating for a bill, introduced this past legislative session, to increase health care transaction oversight and hopes the bill gains traction next session.
Piesch said the main objective of the bill is to arm regulatory bodies with strong state statutes to act upon when requirements for transactions are not being followed, to “prevent some of the worst harms” that result from the private-equity model in the health care industry from happening in Vermont in the future.

This story by Patrick Bilow was first published in the Stowe Reporter on July 17.
Watch out, Gov. Phil Scott – Dean Roy, a 14-year-old from Stowe, is running for your job.
It started as a bit of a joke with one of Roy’s teachers at Stowe Middle School. If Roy ever ran for office, the joke went, he’d have a campaign manager in his teacher.
Over time, it became less of a joke, and while Roy’s teacher isn’t running his campaign, the rising freshman hit the streets with a few of his peers last week collecting signatures. As of Monday, he had just shy of 100, with almost a year left to reach 500 and make his campaign official.
To be clear, Roy isn’t expecting to oust the Republican governor of nearly 10 years, and he understands when people tell him he’s too young for the job, but Roy is looking at the big picture. He said politics is his lifeblood, and he wants to start proving himself as a viable option for voters now.
Roy is running as part of the Freedom and Unity Party, which emerged in Vermont around 2022. As far as he knows, he would be the youngest third-party candidate for governor in the nation. In 2018, Ethan Sonneborn, a 13-year-old from Bristol ran for governor as a Democrat. Both Sonneborn and Roy benefit from a Vermont election rule that doesn’t set an age limit for running for public office.
Roy is no stranger to the Statehouse. Over the winter, he served as a legislative page in Montpelier, a distinction given to a handful of students throughout Vermont every year. He shadowed politicians, gained an inside look at the legislative process and mingled with a few of Vermont’s top lawmakers.
During one interaction, he challenged Lieutenant Governor John Rodgers on his electric vehicle stance. Rodgers has been outspoken about the negative impacts of the electric vehicle industry and, while their opinions differ, Roy still went a few rounds with Rodgers before they went their separate ways.
Roy’s campaign is centered around affordability and rising property taxes in Vermont, the number one issue facing the state right now, he added. Roy acknowledged the irony that, as a 14-year-old, he doesn’t own a home.
“When a kid in Vermont understands that there’s a housing and affordability crisis, that’s when you know it’s bad,” he said.
Scott might be his opponent for governor, but Roy applauded the work his administration has done to reform education spending in Vermont and reduce property taxes. Roy said H.454, the recently-signed education reform bill, isn’t perfect, and he admitted it might not be great for rural districts like his own, but he thinks the state must take big – and sometimes painful – steps if it’s going to save money for residents.
Roy leans conservative when it comes to finances, and he said a variety of political voices is important to creating good laws. But, like many conservatives in Vermont, he wants to keep it about the money. As for social issues, he believes women have a right to choose and he’s opposed to the way immigrants are being treated in Vermont and across the country.
“This country needs immigration reform badly,” Roy said. “No one should be pulled from the home, and it shouldn’t take decades to become a legal citizen in our country. That’s wrong.”
If elected, he would also work to restore Vermont’s relationship with its neighbors to the north, which has been tested by the President Donald Trump and his administration.
When it comes to hyperlocal issues, Roy said he’s witnessed how short-term rentals have impacted his hometown — those issues exist throughout the state, he added. Roy is a proponent of short-term rental caps and a five-percent tax on those properties statewide.
Part of his motivation for running is to engage his peers – Vermont’s youth – in politics. His friends Charlie Bass, Paul Slesar, JP Rozendaal and Roger Andelin have all been active in his campaign, and he wants to bring in more people.
“We’re all looking for something different,” Roy said, which is part of the reason he’s running as a third-party candidate.
Even if he doesn’t win, Roy wants to stay politically active. He’s currently vying for a letter of recommendation from Bernie Sanders – a political idol to Roy’s – to become a U.S. page in Washington D.C., a highly competitive process.
As for his political candidacy, voters can expect to see Roy on the ballot until he reaches office, he said.
“I want to do great things for the state of Vermont,” he added. “I know I’m young, but I hope I can get my name out there and start building some credibility this year. That way I can run a very serious campaign when it’s time.”

Insurers want higher premiums to cover the usual culprits — rising medical and labor costs and usage — but are tacking on extra percentage point increases in their 2026 rate proposals to cover effects of policy changes advanced by the Trump administration and the Republican-controlled Congress. One key factor built into their filings with state insurance departments: uncertainty over whether Congress allows more generous, covid-era ACA tax subsidies to expire at the end of December.
“The out-of-pocket change for individuals will be immense, and many won’t actually be able to make ends meet and pay premiums, so they will go uninsured,” said JoAnn Volk, co-director of the Center on Health Insurance Reforms at Georgetown University.
Especially if the higher subsidies expire, insurance premiums will be among the first financial pains felt by health care consumers after policy priorities put forward by President Donald Trump and the GOP. Many other changes — such as additional paperwork requirements and spending cuts to Medicaid — won’t occur for at least another year. But spiking ACA premiums, as the nation heads into key midterm elections, invites political pushback. Some on Capitol Hill are exploring ways to temper the subsidy reductions.
“I am hearing on both sides — more from Republicans, but from both the House and Senate” — that they are looking for levers they can pull, said Pennsylvania-based insurance broker Joshua Brooker, who follows legislative actions as part of his job and sits on several insurance advisory groups.
In initial filings, insurers nationally are seeking a median rate increase — meaning half of the proposed increases are lower and half higher — of 15%, according to an analysis for the Peterson-KFF Health System Tracker covering 19 states and the District of Columbia. KFF is a national health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.
That’s up sharply from the last few years. For the 2025 plan year, for example, KFF found that the median proposed increase was 7%.
Health insurers “are doing everything in their power to shield consumers from the rising costs of care and the uncertainty in the market driven by recent policy changes,” wrote Chris Bond, a spokesperson for AHIP, the industry’s lobbying group. The emailed response also called on lawmakers “to take action to extend the health care tax credits to prevent skyrocketing cost increases for millions of Americans in 2026.”
Neither the White House nor the Department of Health and Human Services responded to requests for comment.
These are initial numbers and insurance commissioners in some states may alter requests before approval.
Still, “it’s the biggest increase we’ve seen in over five years,” said analysis co-author Cynthia Cox, a KFF vice president and director of its Program on the ACA.
Premiums will vary based on where consumers live, the type of plan they choose, and their insurer.
For example, Maryland insurers have requested increases ranging from 8.1% to 18.7% for the upcoming plan year, according to an analysis of a smaller set of insurers by Georgetown University researchers. A much larger swing is seen in New York, where one carrier is asking for less than a 1% increase, while another wants 66%. Maryland rate filings indicated the average statewide increase would shrink to 7.9% from 17.1% — if the ACA’s enhanced tax credits are extended.
Most insurers are asking for 10% to 20% increases, the KFF report says, with several factors driving those increases. For instance, insurers say underlying medical costs — including the use of expensive obesity drugs — will add about 8% to premiums for next year. And most insurers are also adding 4% above what they would have charged had the enhanced tax credits been renewed.
But rising premiums are just part of the picture.
A bigger potential change for consumers’ pocketbooks hinges on whether Congress decides to extend more generous tax credits first put in place during President Joe Biden’s term as part of the American Rescue Plan Act in 2021, then extended through the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022.
Those laws raised the subsidy amounts people could receive based on their household income and local premium costs and removed a cap that had barred higher earners from even partial subsidy assistance. Higher earners could still qualify for some subsidy but first had to chip in 8.5% of their household income toward the premiums.
Across the board, but especially among lower-income policyholders, bigger subsidies helped fuel record enrollment in ACA plans.
But they’re also costly.
A permanent extension could cost $335 billion over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
Such an extension was left out of the policy law Trump signed on July 4 that he called the “One Big Beautiful Bill.” Without action, the extra subsidies will expire at the end of this year, after which the tax credits will revert to less generous pre-pandemic levels.
That means two things: Most enrollees will be on the hook to pay a larger share of their premiums as assistance from federal tax credits declines. Secondly, people whose household income exceeds four times the federal poverty level — $84,600 for a couple or $128,600 for a family of four this year — won’t get any subsidies at all.
If the subsidies expire, policy experts estimate, the average amount people pay for coverage could rise by an average of more than 75%. In some states, ACA premiums could double.
“There will be sticker shock,” said Josh Schultz, strategic engagement manager at Softheon, a New York consulting firm that provides enrollment, billing, and other services to about 200 health insurers, many of which are bracing for enrollment losses.
And enrollment could fall sharply. The Wakely Consulting Group estimates that the combination of expiring tax credits, the Trump law’s new paperwork, and other requirements will result in ACA enrollment dropping by as much as 57%.
According to KFF, insurers added premium increases of around 4% just to cover the expiration of the enhanced tax credits, which they fear will lead to lower enrollment. That would further raise costs, insurers say, because people who are less healthy are more likely to grit their teeth and reenroll, leaving insurers with a smaller, but sicker, pool of members.
Less common in the filings submitted so far, but noticeable, are increases pegged to Trump administration tariffs, Cox said.
“What they are assuming is tariffs will drive drug costs up significantly, with some saying that can have around a 3-percentage-point increase” in premiums as a result, she said.
Consumers will learn their new premium prices only late in the fall, or when open enrollment for the ACA begins on Nov. 1 and they can start shopping around.
Congress could still act, and discussions are ongoing, said insurance broker Brooker.
Some lawmakers, he said, are consulting with the CBO about the fiscal and coverage effects of various scenarios that don’t extend the subsidies as they currently exist but may offer a middle ground. One possibility involves allowing subsidies for families earning as much as five or six times the poverty level, he said.
But any such effort will draw pushback.
Some conservative think tanks, such as the Paragon Health Institute, say the more generous subsides led people to fudge their incomes to qualify and led to other types of fraud, such as brokers signing people up for ACA plans without authorization.
But others note that many consumers — Democratic and Republican — have come to rely on the additional assistance. Not extending it could be risky politically. In 2024, 56% of ACA enrollees lived in Republican congressional districts, and 76% were in states won by Trump.
Allowing the enhanced subsidies to expire could also reshape the market.
Brooker said some people may drop coverage. Others will shift to plans with lower premiums but higher deductibles. One provision of Trump’s new tax law allows people enrolled in either “bronze” or “catastrophic”-level ACA plans, which are usually the cheapest, to qualify for health savings accounts, which allow people to set aside money, tax-free, to cover health care costs.
“Naturally, if rates do start going up the way we anticipate, there will be a migration to lower-cost options,” Brooker said.

(Photo by Megan Varner/Getty Images)Since taking office Jan. 20, President Donald Trump has issued executive orders that forced businesses, schools, universities and state and federal agencies to dismantle all diversity, equity and inclusion policies.
Describing Black America as in a “state of emergency,” the National Urban League said the directives show the federal government is “determined to sacrifice its founding principles—equality, liberty, and justice—rather than accept the truth of a diversifying nation and deliver equitable opportunity for all.’’
The National Urban League, a civil rights and advocacy organization focused on economic empowerment of Black and other underserved communities, is scheduled to release its annual State of Black America 2025 report Thursday morning at 8:30 at its conference in Cleveland.
In an executive summary, it credits the Voting Rights Act of 1965 with the “true birth of American democracy.” But the federal government under Trump has “set fire to policies and entire departments dedicated to protecting civil and human rights, providing access to an equal education, fair housing, safe and effective healthcare, and ensuring that our democratic process is adhered to across the nation,” the executive summary said.
Yet despite those actions, Americans bolstered by the civil rights community are pushing back. The group pointed to lawsuits filed across the country by state attorneys general, governors and civil rights groups, including the National Urban League, NAACP Legal Defense Funds and Lambda Legal. As of May 23, 247 cases challenging Trump administration policies had been filed in federal courts.
“There is a state of emergency in Black America, and our report this year is a warning and rallying cry as civil rights protections are being unraveled,” said Marc Morial, National Urban League president and CEO, during a briefing ahead of the report’s release. “Democracy is under siege. What began as what we thought were fringe attacks on racial equity has now become national policy.”

Since 2013, U.S. Supreme Court decisions have struck down portions of the Voting Rights Act that required federal preclearance in communities with a history of racial discrimination before making changes to voting practices, the report notes. And after a 2023 decision that declared affirmative action unconstitutional in college admissions, the National Urban League said the ruling threatens the ability to sue over racial discrimination in voting and to challenge district maps. Other voting-related practices from mail-in ballots and early voting to requirements to provide voting materials in languages other than English are at risk, the group said.
The U.S. Department of Justice Civil Rights Division, once a protection against discriminatory practices, is now seen as a threat to enforcement of civil rights laws that could become a “tool of retribution,” the report summary said. Harmeet Dhillon, a Trump attorney and election denier, was confirmed by the U.S. Senate in April to serve as assistant attorney general of the Civil Rights Division, one of the largest at Justice. Dhillon also opposed the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Act Amendment in an op-ed which would have restored the landmark law, the executive summary said.
The group defended the value of diversity, equity and inclusion, saying that it “protects and advances democratic ideals.” But the Trump administration has targeted colleges, universities and businesses “for simply having the words diversity and inclusion as part of their mission,’’ adding that Michigan and Columbia universities were forced to end their programs.
“In short, DEI policies don’t just level the playing field in education and employment; they fortify democracy itself. By expanding opportunities, ensuring equitable access to information, and creating leadership pipelines, DEI helps guarantee that every American—not just the privileged few— can contribute to the nation’s future,’’ the group said in the summary.
‘Dividing America’
The report also notes how hate and extremist views are more prevalent on social media that began to increase after the COVID-19 pandemic and the acquisition of Twitter (now X) in 2022 by billionaire Elon Musk. The summary said that a day later, right-wing accounts on the platform jumped while those with progressive views dropped. And two years later during the election, accounts of progressive candidates were “banned without explanation.”










In short, DEI policies don’t just level the playing field in education and employment; they fortify democracy itself ... DEI helps guarantee that every American — not just the privileged few — can contribute to the nation’s future.

A study published in February by researchers from the University of Southern California’s Viterbi Information Sciences Institute showed that general hate speech increased by 50% and transphobic slurs increased by 260%. The study analyzed posts between January 2022 and June 2023.
“People have become very adept at misinformation, disinformation. But my mother called it something different: She said it was lying,” Morial said.
One way to counter that, he said, is increasing voter turnout in next year’s midterm elections and in local elections this year such as mayoral races in Atlanta, New York City and New Orleans.
“I think people should host town hall meetings. I think people should make their voices known on social media,” Morial said. “All of this is important to building a bulwark of resistance. What are we resisting? We’re resisting [a] dividing America. We’re resisting an America where the agenda is white supremacy or white nationalism. But it also is the fight for a multiracial American democracy.”
The report includes nearly two dozen contributors such as congressional officials, attorneys and civil rights activists with a focus on the official name of this year’s report: “State of Emergency: Civil Rights, Democracy & Progress Under Attack.”
Beth Lynk, executive director of the When We All Vote initiative established by former first lady Michelle Obama in 2018, wrote an essay in the report entitled, “A Revised Movement for Democracy – On the Ground and in the Culture.”
“Voting rights is the foundation of all other rights in this country,” she said in an interview Monday. “This essay is really a call to action understanding that we can empower Black Americans to shape the next chapter of our democracy, as we always have from the ground up, by reimagining voter education and registration.”
Lynk noted how Maryland has crafted policies to protect voting rights, crediting Del. Jheanelle Wilkins (D-Maryland), chair of the state’s Legislative Black Caucus, who worked with other caucus leaders.
One topic missing from the National Urban League’s executive summary this year: reparations.
For the first time, the Maryland caucus officially endorsed the creation of a Reparations Commission in a bill that passed this year. Maryland became one of the few states in the nation to assess “appropriate benefits” for those affected by “historical inequity.”
But Gov. Wes Moore (D), the nation’s only Black governor, vetoed the bill in May. With the caucus’s backing and a Democratic majority in the General Assembly, legislators and advocates are confident that a veto override will take place when the legislature returns in session.
“We strongly believe that it’s essential to see this commission through [and] bring it to fruition, especially at a time like this as we’re seeing the most grave attacks and threats to our freedoms since Reconstruction,” Wilkins said. “Now is the time for us to boldly go forward here in the state of Maryland around repairing harms, while we continue to fight back around the present attacks on our freedoms.”

(Mary Steurer/North Dakota Montior)When North Dakota state Sen. Ryan Braunberger first introduced a slate of tenant protection bills this year, he knew the odds of passage weren’t in his favor. Braunberger, a Democratic lawmaker in a Republican-controlled legislature who represents a renter-heavy district in Fargo, spent years as a housing advocate — walking tenants through eviction court, helping them navigate late fees and lease violations.
But inside the statehouse, he was an outlier: one of the only legislators who rents his home.
By the end of the legislative session, just one of his five proposals passed. But that one might prove to be a major overhaul of the state’s eviction process.
The bill came together thanks to an unlikely lawmaking alliance: a renter and housing advocate with deep policy knowledge, and a Republican who hadn’t previously focused on eviction law but quickly saw its impact in his district.

Co-sponsored by Republican state Sen. Jeff Barta, the legislation allows tenants to petition to have eviction records sealed after seven years, if they’ve resolved any outstanding rent or damages and stayed eviction-free during that time.
“I didn’t know much about this process, but when Sen. Braunberger reached out to me, I looked into just how much an eviction from years ago was possibly affecting renters and constituents in my district,” said Barta. “As a new lawmaker, you’re still getting settled in, so it was good to dive into an issue that hits home to my district.”
Nationally, North Dakota has joined a slow but steady stream of states that seal or expunge eviction records.
Eviction filings are public and often lack case outcomes or context, yet they’re widely used by screening companies, creating barriers even when tenants win or cases are dismissed. A 2020 study of 3.6 million eviction records across a dozen states by Princeton University’s Eviction Lab found that 22% of the records were ambiguous or falsely represented a tenant’s past.
Black women, especially those with children, are disproportionately affected by evictions. Young children and infants are affected more than any other age group.
Barta noted that many North Dakotans are evicted for financial reasons or may be fleeing domestic violence, and that holding old evictions against tenants prevents them from rebuilding stability.
“That’s really what caught my eye,” Barta said. “I need to be aware of what my constituents are facing. Some people weren’t evicted for being irresponsible. They were fleeing violence or hit by one bad break.”
Grand Forks, which is in Barta’s district, is more than 50% renter-occupied, making it one of the most tenant-heavy in the state, thanks in part to its proximity to the University of North Dakota. Grand Forks has also seen rents climb and vacancy rates tighten, while evictions — sometimes stemming from as little as a few hundred dollars of unpaid rent — can leave permanent marks on a tenant’s record.
“Most landlords wouldn’t even give people a second chance once they saw an eviction on someone’s record,” Braunberger said. “It didn’t matter if the case was from a decade ago or if it had been resolved. That record stuck to them like glue.”
The North Dakota Apartment Association opposed the measure, citing concerns that it could allow sealing of eviction records even when the eviction stemmed from issues beyond domestic violence, such as nonpayment or other lease violations. Lobbyist Jeremy Petron testified that the bill could undermine property managers’ ability to assess tenant risk through background checks.
“Property owners and property managers rely on background checks for decisions on prospective tenant approvals for the safety of neighbors and the property, and the business investment risk,” Petron testified.
Compromises
Passage of North Dakota’s law required not only bipartisanship but also key compromises outside the legislature. Early drafts proposed full expungement, a term that drew sharp criticism from the North Dakota judiciary, which warned the language implied a permanent erasure of legal history without proper oversight.
In response, lawmakers worked with the state Supreme Court and housing groups to shift toward sealing records instead, a more limited measure than expungement.
Most states tend to seal records rather than expunge them.
North Dakota’s Administrative Rule 41, which governs access to court records, is now being updated to reflect the new law. Sealed eviction records will be categorized as confidential, but they won’t be deleted outright. And not all evictions will qualify: Tenants must have no further evictions within seven years, and must resolve any unpaid rent or damages related to the original filing.
“After talking with the Supreme Court and apartment associations, we landed on a compromise: sealing,” Braunberger said. “It preserves judicial records while still giving tenants a fair shot at moving on.”
Sara Behrens, a staff attorney with the State Court Administrator’s Office, said the final version addressed the court’s concerns.
“Without these amendments, any eviction could be sealed following seven years regardless of further evictions or outstanding judgments,” she said. “That was a serious flaw we were able to correct.”
Bills seek to add protections for North Dakota renters

Despite North Dakota’s Republican supermajority, the legislation passed with overwhelming support: 35-12 in the Senate and 88-5 in the House. Both Barta and Braunberger attributed the success to North Dakota’s relatively open political culture.
“Even though we have a supermajority, there’s not a ton of separation,” Barta said. “We talk. We listen.”
Braunberger echoed that sentiment. “If I want any policy to move, I have to collaborate,” he said. “That’s almost a given here.”
Yet the sealing law was only a partial win in a broader tenant rights agenda for Braunberger. Three other bills — ranging from caps landlords can impose on late rent fees to investigations into tenant-landlord matters — failed to gain traction. Braunberger said he plans to reintroduce some of them next session.
“It’s a civil matter, so people don’t have a right to counsel,” Braunberger said of tenant legal proceedings. “That’s something I’d love to change. No one should lose their home without legal help.”
Both lawmakers pointed to next steps beyond legislation. Barta emphasized the need for better communication and education to help tenants understand leases, rights and processes. Braunberger wants more incentives for mediation, saying it can reduce financial losses for both landlords and renters and keep disputes out of court.
Elsewhere
Last year, Idaho, Maryland and Massachusetts enacted laws to seal certain eviction records from public scrutiny and from tenant screening companies. Massachusetts’ law just went into effect in May, while Maryland’s law is scheduled for October.
In Indiana, a new law allows courts to seal eviction filings automatically in three circumstances: dismissal of the case, judgment in favor of a tenant or reversal on appeal. The automatic sealing reduces the burden on tenants to petition on their own.
Hawaii, Kansas, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania and South Carolina are among states that introduced eviction-sealing laws this year. Those bills, which still await passage in both legislative chambers, vary on the conditions of sealing.
This June, Nevada Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo vetoed two high-profile tenant protection bills. One would have automatically sealed certain eviction records, and another sought to slow the state’s fast-track summary eviction process.
In his veto of the eviction sealing bill, Lombardo said it was “lopsided, red-tape laden, and would have disastrous consequences on Nevada’s housing market.”
He argued the bill would overburden courts, eliminate judicial discretion and “risks punishing” property owners by shifting procedural responsibilities onto them.
Pennsylvania’s proposal, which would keep fault-based eviction records public for seven years, would limit access to records of no-fault evictions, in which a landlord asks a tenant to move out for reasons such as wanting occupancy or to sell the property. It passed the House by 105-98, thanks to a few Republican votes.
Kansas’ proposal would offer automatic expungement after two years unless debts remain, and South Carolina’s bill would seal all eviction records in circumstances in which an eviction case is filed but doesn’t lead to an actual eviction order within 30 days, or six years after a case was closed.
North Dakota’s bipartisan success with its new sealing law positions the state as one with lawmakers finding common ground on housing problems.
“We have a housing crisis,” Braunberger said. “Some areas can’t even attract employers because there’s no place for workers to live. Until we fix that, housing policy isn’t just social policy, it’s economic policy.”

(Halle Parker/Verite News)SHREVEPORT — When Robert Smith met his future girlfriend in 2010, he wanted to take things slowly. For Smith, no relationship had been easy in the years since he was diagnosed with the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV. People often became afraid when they learned his status, even running away when he coughed.
The couple waited months to have sex until Smith felt he could share his medical status. To prepare her, Smith said, he took his girlfriend to his job in HIV prevention at the Philadelphia Center, a northwestern Louisiana nonprofit that offers resources to people with HIV, which also provided him housing at the time.
Finally, he revealed the news: Smith was diagnosed with HIV in 1994 and started taking daily antiviral pills in 2006. The virus could no longer be detected in his blood, and he couldn’t transmit it to a sexual partner.
Smith said his girlfriend seemed comfortable knowing his status. When it came to sex, there was no hesitation, he said. But a couple of years later, when Smith wanted to break up, he said, her tone shifted.
“She was like, ‘If you try to leave me, I’m gonna put you in jail,’” recalled Smith, now 68. “At the time, I really didn’t know the sincerity of it.”
After they broke up, she reported him to the police, accusing him of violating a little-known law in Louisiana — a felony called “intentional exposure to HIV.” He disputed the allegations, but in 2013 accepted a plea deal to spend six months in prison on the charge. He had a few months left on parole from a past conviction on different charges, and Smith thought this option would let him move past the relationship faster. He didn’t realize the conviction would also land him on the state’s sex offender registry.
For nearly two decades, Smith had dealt with the stigma associated with having HIV; the registry added another layer of exclusion, severely restricting where he could live and work to avoid minors. Not many people want to hire a sex offender, he said. Smith has been told by the local sheriff’s office he’s not allowed to do simple things, like go to a public park or a high school football game, since the conviction.
“I’ve been undetectable for 15 years, but that law still punishes us,” Smith said.
Louisiana is one of 30 states with criminal penalties related to exposing or transmitting HIV. Most of the laws were passed in the 1980s during the emergence of the AIDS epidemic. Since then, several states have amended their laws to make them less punitive or repealed them outright, including Maryland and North Dakota this year.
But Louisiana’s law remains among the harshest. The state is one of five that may require people such as Smith to register as a sex offender if convicted, a label that can follow them for over a decade. And state lawmakers considered a bill to expand the law to apply to other sexually transmitted infections, then failed to pass it before the session ended.

Meanwhile, people with HIV also face the threat that federal funding cuts will affect their access to treatment, along with prevention efforts, supportive services, and outreach. Such strategies have proved to slow the HIV/AIDS epidemic, unlike the laws’ punitive approach.
The tax and domestic policy law previously known as the “One Big Beautiful Bill” will likely affect HIV-positive people enrolled in Medicaid by reducing federal support for Medicaid and restricting eligibility. About 40% of adults under 65 with HIV rely on Medicaid.
The Trump administration proposed in its fiscal 2026 budget request to eliminate HIV prevention programs at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and to cancel a grant that helps fund housing for people with HIV. The Ryan White HIV/AIDS program, the largest federal fund dedicated to supporting HIV-positive people, also faces cuts. The program serves more than half of the people in the U.S. diagnosed with HIV, including in Louisiana, according to the health information nonprofit KFF.
Public health officials maintain that state laws criminalizing HIV exposure hurt efforts to end the HIV epidemic. Epidemiologists and other experts on AIDS agree that the enforcement of such laws is often shaped by fear, not science. For example, in many states that criminalize HIV exposure, people living with HIV can face heightened criminal penalties for actions that can’t transmit the virus, such as spitting on someone. The laws further stigmatize and deter people from getting tested and treatment, undermining response to the epidemic, experts say.
At least 4,400 people in 14 states have been arrested under these laws, though data is limited and the actual number is likely higher, and the arrests aren’t decreasing, according to analyses by UCLA’s Williams Institute.
“ Some people think it’s an issue that’s gone away, and that simply isn’t the case,” said Nathan Cisneros, a researcher at the Williams Institute.
In Louisiana, a 2022 Williams Institute analysis found at least 147 allegations reported to law enforcement under the state’s HIV law from 2011 to mid-2022. Black people made up nearly three-quarters of the people convicted and placed on the sex offender registry. Most were Black men, like Smith. At the time of the analysis, Black people made up about two-thirds of HIV diagnoses in the state.
“ We see over and over that Black people are disproportionately affected by the HIV epidemic and disproportionately affected by policing and incarceration in the United States,” Cisneros said.
Nationally, other marginalized groups such as women, sex workers, the queer community, or people who overlap across more than one group are also disproportionately arrested and prosecuted under similar criminalization laws, Cisneros said.
Ensnared in the system
Louisiana’s law hinges on the requirement that if a person knows they have HIV, they must disclose their HIV status and receive consent before exposing someone to the virus.
Louisiana District Attorneys Association Executive Director Zach Daniels said these cases don’t come up often and can be difficult to prosecute. Daniels said the intimate nature of the cases can lead to little evidence in support of either side, especially if the accuser doesn’t contract HIV.
When it comes to talking about one’s sex life, Daniels said, “there are often no other witnesses, besides the two participants.”
Louisiana’s law is written so that “intentional exposure” can occur through “any means or contact.” That includes sex and needle-sharing, practices known to transmit the virus. But the language of the law is so broad that actions known not to transmit the virus — like biting or scratching — could be included, said Dietz, the statewide coordinator for the Louisiana Coalition on Criminalization and Health, an advocacy network founded by people living with HIV that has opposed the law.
The broad nature of the law creates opportunities for abuse, as the threat of being reported under the law can be used as a coercive tool in relationships, said Dietz, who goes by one name and uses they/them pronouns. Such threats, Dietz said, have kept people in abusive relationships and loomed over child custody battles. Dietz said they’ve supported people accused of exposing their children to HIV in ways that are not medically possible.
“ ‘Any means or contact’ could be just merely being around your kids,” they said.
The prosecutors’ organization still supports the law as a recourse for emergency responders who, in rare instances, come into contact with blood or syringes containing the virus. In one recent high-profile case in New Orleans, the law was used against a local DJ accused of knowingly transmitting HIV to several women without informing them of his status or using a condom.
The person accused of violating the law, not the accuser, must prove their case — that they disclosed their HIV status beforehand. Without a signed affidavit or tape recording, courts can end up basing their decisions on conflicting testimonies with little supporting evidence.

That’s what Smith alleged happened to him.
After his relationship ended, he said, he remembered being called into a meeting with his parole officer where a detective waited for him, asking about his former relationship and whether his girlfriend had known about his HIV status.
Smith said yes. But that’s not what she had told police.
Verite News could not find a working phone number for Smith’s former girlfriend but corroborated the story with the incident’s police report. His attorney at the time, a public defender named Carlos Prudhomme, said he didn’t remember much about the case, and court documents are sealed because it was a sex offense.
In court, it was her word against his. So when he was offered six months in prison instead of the 10-year maximum, he switched his plea from not guilty to guilty. But he said he didn’t know his new conviction would require him to register as a sex offender once he got out — worsening the stigma.
“When people see ‘sex offender,’ the first thing that comes to their mind is rape, child molester, predator,” Smith said. “This law puts me in a category that I don’t care to be in.”
He has tried to make the most of it, despite the expense of paying fees each year to re-register. After being rejected from jobs, he started a catering business and built a loyal clientele. But he said he’s still stuck living in a poorly maintained apartment complex primarily inhabited by sex offenders.
“I understand their strategy for creating this law to prevent the spread, but it’s not helping. It’s hurting; it’s hindering. It’s destroying people’s lives instead of helping people’s lives, especially the HIV community,” he said. “They don’t care about us.”
The case for reform
Since 2014, there has been a nationwide effort to update or repeal state laws that criminalize HIV nondisclosure, exposure, or transmission. A dozen states have changed their laws to align more closely with modern science, and four have gotten rid of them completely in hopes of reducing stigma and improving public health outcomes, according to the Center for HIV Law and Policy.
Sean McCormick, an attorney with the center, said these changes are influenced partly by a growing body of evidence showing the laws’ negative consequences.
McCormick said the laws offer a “clear disincentive” for people to get tested for HIV. If they don’t know their status, there’s no criminal liability for transmission or exposure.
A 2024 survey by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and DLH Corp. researchers found that after California updated its HIV criminalization law in 2018, respondents were more likely to get tested. Meanwhile, survey respondents in Nevada, which still had a more punitive law on the books, were less likely to get tested.
There’s no one-size-fits-all solution, McCormick said. His center works with HIV-positive people across the country to determine what legislative changes would work best in their states.
Texas was the first to repeal its HIV law in 1994.
“As a person living with HIV in Texas, I’m deeply appreciative that we don’t have an HIV-specific statute that puts a target on my back,” said Michael Elizabeth, the public health policy director for the Equality Federation.
But Elizabeth points out that Texans living with HIV still face steeper penalties under general felony laws for charges such as aggravated assault or aggravated sexual assault after state courts in Texas equated the bodily fluids of a person with HIV with a “deadly weapon.”
Louisiana activists have pushed lawmakers in the state to amend the law in three ways: removing the sex offender registration requirement, requiring transmission to have occurred, and requiring clear intent to transmit the virus.
“Our strategy, as opposed to repeal, is to create a law that actually addresses the kind of boogeyman that they ostensibly created the law for: the person who successfully, maliciously, intentionally transmits HIV,” said Dietz with the Louisiana Coalition on Criminalization and Health.
In 2018, a bill to narrow the statute was amended in ways that expanded the law. For example, the updated law no longer had any definition of which actions “expose” someone to HIV.
In 2023, state lawmakers created a task force that recommended updating Louisiana’s law to align with the latest public health guidelines, limit the potential for unintended consequences, and give previously convicted people a way to clear their record.
Lawmakers in the state House pushed forward a bill this year to criminalize other sexually transmitted infections, including hepatitis B and the herpes simplex virus. That bill died in the Senate, but it spurred the creation of another legislative task force with a nearly identical mission to that of the first.
“ This state has no idea how closely we just dodged a bullet,” Dietz said.

In the meantime, the Louisiana coalition is helping Smith petition the state to take his name off the sex offender registry. Louisiana law allows people to petition to have their names removed from the registry after 10 years without any new sex crime convictions. Smith expects his case to be approved by the end of the year.
Despite the difficulty of the past 12 years, he said, he’s grateful for the chance to be free from the registry’s restrictions.
“It’s like a breath of fresh air,” Smith said. “I can do stuff that I wanted to do that I couldn’t. Like, go to a football game. Simple stuff like that, I’m going to be ready to do.”

An occasional look at Connecticut’s remarkable people, places and things
On its surface, the Connecticut River can be deceptive. On a sultry, partly overcast afternoon in early July, the river appeared to be in no rush to complete its meandering 410-mile journey to Long Island Sound.
Under the water, however, forces were at work that grabbed the attention of ferry Captain Blaise Clemente.
“This current’s unbelievable today. Sorry, Sal,” Clemente called out to his first mate as the two worked in tandem to turn their tug, the “Cumberland,” so that it faced into the river for the next crossing to Glastonbury. The mate, Sal Carta, stood alongside on a barge handling the ropes while Clemente got a feel for the tides, which can shift up to 2 feet even 50 miles inland.
Each trip across the river takes Clemente about four minutes. It’s one he’s made hundreds of times a week for the last two decades since he joined the crew of the nation’s oldest continuously operated ferry service.
“You do anything 300,000 times, you know, you get it down,” Clemente said as he approached the landing slip. “But you have to be more cautious here. You don’t want to bang in, you don’t want to hit the pilings. You don’t want to jar anybody.”
Before he took this job in 2004, Clemente owned a brokerage operating on the floor of the Boston Stock Exchange — he still carries the city’s distinctive accent — while filling his spare time on a lobster boat on Massachusetts Bay. But if he had hoped for a more relaxing career on the water, the reality proved a bit more challenging.
“It has its own tension,” he said. “Some days we do between 80 and 100 crossings a day, and every single one, it’s safety. You get three cars and 18 passengers, and regardless of how long the trip is, your license is at risk every single time you cross, so you have to have a good crew.”
Clemente, who serves as the ferry’s master captain, splits the route with two other captains, along with two mates and a summer intern. During the off season, the crew works on maintaining the boats for the next season, use up their vacation time and, when the weather requires, take turns driving snow plows for the state Department of Transportation.
“There’s certainly a lot of maintenance that has to be done, and during the coldest months of the year, for only a four-month period, it’s hard to do,” said Paul Costello, who served as a ferry captain for seven years before taking another job at the Department of Transportation last November. “You can’t put the boats inside and work on them, so you’ve got to work around the weather.”

When it opened in 1655, the Rocky Hill-Glastonbury Ferry was one of several private raft-and-pole operations that were used to transport people and livestock across the growing colonies. Its slightly younger sibling, the Chester-Hadlyme Ferry, began operations in 1769. (The state’s first bridge crossing Connecticut River opened in 1808 between Enfield and Suffield.)
The number of ferry crossings in Connecticut peaked at around 30 near the end of the 18th century, according to ConnecticutHistory.org. Over time, rafts gave way to boats that were pulled by ropes, horses and eventually steam engines. As more permanent bridges were built, however, the number of ferries dwindled until the DOT eventually took over the last three remaining river crossings between 1915 and 1917. Shortly afterwards, the state closed Bissell’s Ferry in Windsor due to its dwindling use.
Since then, the ferries’ role in providing transportation has continued to evolve.
The current setup for the Rocky Hill-Glastonbury crossing, known as “towing on the hip,” consists of a tugboat that is secured to the side of a barge — the “Hollister III” — that carries cars, bicycles and passengers on foot. The Chester-Hadlyme Ferry, meanwhile, uses a single vessel, known as the “Selden III.”
Clemente estimated that roughly 90% of his passengers today are sightseers or infrequent customers — including the occasional traveler, following a GPS, who’s surprised to see the route leading onto a boat. The number of regular commuters has dropped since the pandemic, he said, when the ferry service shut down for several months.
The ferry operates annually between April 1 and Nov. 30, though its opening is sometimes delayed due to high waters, as was the case earlier this year. Fares are $5 per vehicle ($6 on weekends) and $2 for pedestrians and cyclists. Starting last year, passengers could purchase tickets through an app, Token Transit.
Beyond serving as a novelty for tourists and the occasional waylaid driver, the ferry also offers a convenient commuting option for a small number of residents on each side of the river. Without it, a 4-minute crossing becomes a 13-mile trek on highways that can take 20 minutes or more — without traffic.

“I usually come around 4:30 p.m., when everyone’s coming home from work,” said Lisa Lankton of Rocky Hill, who takes the ferry about four times a week to visit her grandchildren in Glastonbury. “It cuts out so much traffic. That time of day, going over the Putnam Bridge and going over [Interstate] 91 is a lot longer.”
Lankton added that while on the ferry, she has a few minutes to catch up on a book or simply enjoy being on the water. “Sometimes I’ll get carried away and I’m like, ‘Oh, we’re there already!'”
The ferry has also become a source of local pride, which swells up whenever leaders in Hartford — during occasional periods of belt tightening — propose cutting the service. Even more modest proposals to raise revenues from the ferries, including selling ads, have prompted pushback.
The yearbook of nearby Rocky Hill School even takes its name, “The Cumberland,” from the tug that drives the ferry.
“They talk about putting in a bridge every once in a while,” said Mark Packard, whose family has lived in the area since before the ferry opened three centuries ago. “I don’t know if you’ve ever been over here in South Glastonbury, but it’s a little chunk of farmland that hasn’t changed much in a very long time. [We’re] not interested in having a bridge with all kinds of cars coming through.”
As a kid growing up in Rocky Hill, Sandy Doran said she would take the trip every few weeks with her friends or while running errands with her family. 
“We would take our bikes and go take the ferry,” she said. “My sister had riding lessons in Glastonbury, so she and I would go over there, and I would wait through her lesson and then we’d head back.”
Decades later, she still takes the ferry on outings with her 10-year-old grandson, Henrik.
“This is such a unique experience,” she said during a recent trip. “Not every town has a nice ferry that goes from town to town.”
It costs the state roughly $1.4 million a year to operate both ferries, with roughly $900,000 of that coming from federal funds, according to the DOT. Total ridership last year surpassed 100,000 passengers and 45,000 vehicles.
Last year, the department also announced plans to upgrade the landing sites on either side of the river — in Rocky Hill and Glastonbury — by installing fencing, a new gate system and sidewalk and lighting improvements for pedestrian access. The project is expected to cost $600,000, to be completed during the upcoming off season.
For Clemente, the value of the ferry is more that a measure of its ridership or a line item on the budget.
“We’ve never lost a boat, we never lost a car off the deck, we’ve never had a collision, we’ve never had any of that,” the captain said. “You know, obviously we can’t handle the volume of a bridge, but I don’t believe that’s why this ferry is here. It’s to service the local community. It’s been doing so for 370 years.”

Crossing the river, Clemente and his fellow captains have to steer the barge in a sweeping arc, both to avoid a large sandbar on the Glastonbury side and so that they come into the slip at a perpendicular angle in case they need to back up. “At low water and low tide, you’ve got to be on your toes,” he said.
Still, Clemente said, the biggest hazard on the river comes from other boaters, particularly on the weekends.
“Rocky Hill’s boat launch is probably the best on the river, and it gets busy,” he said. “You have to keep a proper lookout.” 
The crew’s summer intern, Makaela Wasik, recently returned for her third season in the ferry service. In the winter, she attends school at Central Connecticut State University, but she also hopes to get her own captain’s license one day.
Her biggest surprise on the job? “Honestly, how many people don’t know how to use a parking brake,” she said with a laugh.
Robert Laughlin, the executive director of the Glastonbury Historical Society, is a relatively recent convert of the ferry. Growing up in the area, he said he’d frequently drive past the landing area. But it wasn’t until after moving back to Glastonbury during the pandemic that he actually ventured on board.
On the deck of the “Hollister III,” Laughlin discovered “beautiful” views of the river and “a nice little seafood place” on the other side, the Ferry Grill, serving lobster rolls, fried calamari and other creations. Now it’s a trip he makes every so often.
“I call it my mini vacation,” Laughlin said. “A four-minute cruise across the Connecticut River.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/CROSSING-CT-FERRY-0711-DE-420-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-20 05:56:12.692669

(Max McCoy/Kansas Reflector)Now that her killer has been sentenced to life in prison, what is there left to say about the death of Zoey Felix?
We must do more.
The 5-year-old Topeka girl was raped and murdered at a Topeka homeless encampment in October 2023. Her killer was Mickel Cherry, then 25, a family acquaintance she called “uncle.” Cherry, who confessed to police and later struck a plea deal with prosecutors to avoid the death penalty, was given 50 years in prison July 15 by a Shawnee County district judge.
From the start, the case has been gut-wrenching.
It’s also been difficult for me to write about, because the suffering of children gets to me in the way other tragedies don’t. When I was a young reporter I covered deaths involving children, and they always left me shaken. Some were deliberately killed, others died in house fires or car wrecks. My reaction got so bad that I couldn’t pass one of those ubiquitous “Prevent Child Abuse” billboards without shedding tears.
With the Zoey Felix case, it’s not just the horrific way in which she died, but the revelations about the multiple failures by the people and agencies Zoey should have depended on for help that get to me.
There was, according to court filings, the unstable and violent family life, a home where there was no water or electricity, a mother who abused substances, and a father who eventually brought Zoey to live in a homeless encampment in a wooded area in southeast Topeka. The family had declined requests from child protective services for help, and the state did not press the issue. About the only kindness she experienced in her short life was from neighbors, who worried about her roaming the streets at all hours and sometimes provided her with food and clothing.
Perhaps most damning of all were multiple investigations by the Kansas Department for Children and Families into Zoey’s welfare, none of which resulted in removing her from the environment. According to a filing by Cherry’s defense counsel, DCF determined that Zoey had only a slightly higher than average risk of being hurt or suffering other lasting “negative effects.” In September 2023, the department sent investigators out seven times, but they were unable to locate the family and the case was closed.
Zoey was killed Oct. 2.
“Had the agencies responsible for Z.F.’s safety taken action by communicating, verifying information, and pursuing protective custody, her trajectory could have been different,” wrote Peter Conley, a deputy defender in the Kansas Death Penalty Defense Unit, in a memorandum to the court asking for concurrent, instead of consecutive, 25-year sentences. “She would not have been forced to live in a tent in the woods, nor left in the care of a traumatized person (Cherry) unfit to care for her.”
Her death, Conley argued, was avoidable.
While Cherry bears the ultimate responsibility for his actions, Conley said, he did not create the systems that failed him — and Zoey — in similar ways.
Conley described Cherry as a “developmentally delayed” individual who grew up in a physically and emotionally abusive home and who did not receive the help he needed from Texas child services. He had been passed to 17 foster homes, been in two psychiatric hospitals, had no high school degree, and had been diagnosed as a child with retinitis pigmentosa, an incurable genetic eye disease.
“Mickel could have and should have had interventions such as physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy,” according to the court filing. “Medicaid would have covered this expense. He should have also been receiving more regular counseling and psychiatric visits given his traumatic childhood and the number of adverse childhood events he experienced.”
Conley argued the trauma and failures experienced by both Mickel and Zoey were similar.
“Mickel has lived an extraordinarily difficult life where he was first abused by his parents and then by the system in place to protect children like him,” he said in the filing. “The same system in Kansas allowed Z.F. to fall through the cracks to allow her to be in a position of being babysat by a developmentally delayed homeless man from Texas.”
Zoey’s death resulted in a statewide conversation about child victims of violent crime. In October 2023, I attended a candlelight vigil in downtown Topeka in memory of murdered children. At that time, one-third of all homicide victims for the year — 10 in all — had been children.
There was a clamor in the wake of Zoey’s murder about improving the state’s child protective services, whose administrative errors resulted in the girl not getting the help she needed. Recently, I asked the Kansas Department for Children and Families whether there had been any meaningful reforms since 2023.
“The safety and well-being of every child under the care of the Kansas Department for Children and Families is the top priority of the agency,” Jenalea Randall, DCF’s director of public and government affairs, wrote in an email. “Unfortunately, Zoey Felix’s story reflects systemic challenges and the need for resources to help families that go beyond any one agency — such as assisting the homeless population.”
After Zoey’s death in 2023, the DCF undertook an internal review resulting in policy revisions to provide guidance to child protection specialists and supervisors on when to contact law enforcement in cases when the well-being of a child may be at risk and the family cannot be located.
“During the 2024 Kansas Legislative session, the agency worked to pass HB 2628, which ensures the public receives timely information about tragic cases such as this one,” the email said.
That measure, aimed to allow the release of information about individual cases where there is pressing legislative and public interest, became law in 2024.
“DCF also sponsored legislation during the session that would have made it easier for families like Zoey’s to access additional services, decreasing the likelihood of this situation happening again,” she wrote. “Unfortunately, the Kansas Legislature did not take up those measures.”
This month, Randall said, DCF began contacting families every day of the week, including weekends and holidays, when there was a report from law enforcement that a child could be a victim of abuse or neglect.
“DCF continues to look for ways to increase transparency and better support families, especially those who are homeless,” she said.
Progress had been made, she asserted, and the department remains committed to working with other agencies and partners to “strengthen the state’s safety net and ensure all Kansas families get the assistance they need.”
But is any of this meaningful reform?
It’s good public relations, I suppose, but declaring goals and intent is short of providing evidence of meaningful change.
Kansas families aren’t getting the assistance they need. It only takes a walk around most Kansas towns to realize the state’s safety net is fraying badly. From the woman sitting on the curb outside the local Walmart panhandling to buy food to the homeless individuals, mostly men, moving their camps ever deeper into remote areas to avoid the bulldozing of tent camps too near trails and parks, there’s ample evidence that people are hurting.
There were 534 individuals experiencing homelessness in Topeka as of January 2025, according to local government reports. That’s an increase of more than 100 over the 2023 figures. Of the most recent count, nearly 1 in 5 were under the age of 18.
Being unhoused places children in particular immediate peril and may have lasting physical and psychological effects. The number of homeless students in Topeka and Shawnee County schools is estimated to be between 750 and 1,000, far higher than the January 2025 “Point in Time” homeless count.
There are, to be sure, services offered in Topeka and across Kansas for students and families experiencing homelessness. Some of those initiatives are new, including a “one-stop” multi-agency resource center called “Let’s Help” at 245 S.W. MacVicar Ave.
But such initiatives require homeless individuals be amenable to help. Unfortunately for Zoey, her family could not or would not seek the help they needed, and the state’s child protective services failed to act when she needed them most.
Nothing will bring Zoey back.
There is little to say about the manner of Zoey’s death that has not already been documented in news reports or court filings. The public wouldn’t have learned her name had she not been the victim in a capital murder case. It disturbs me now — just like looking at that billboard long ago — that her name is forever linked to collective societal failure for which she paid the ultimate price. But the dead are beyond our help. To honor Zoey’s memory, we must aid the living.
Our communities — the services they provide, their appearance, the joy and the suffering that occurs in their homes and on their streets or at tent camps hidden away from public view — are ultimately expressions of our collective values. Too often our desire is to look away, to ignore the failures of compassion in our midst, to close our eyes to the unhappiness around us. If Zoey’s death has moved you, then give your time and your money to those agencies in the community fighting hunger, homelessness and neglect. And the next time you encounter a situation in which a child in your presence is in need of help, do not turn away.
Be like the neighbors in Zoey’s block.
Provide food or water or clothes if you can do so safely. Summon the help from any of the agencies available, including DCF. Call the police if there is reason to believe the child is in immediate danger. Do this in Zoey’s memory.
The tragedy is not just the way in which Zoey Felix died, but in the years denied her. Those years will now presumably be spent in prison by Cherry, who received consecutive sentences for the rape and murder and will serve at least 50 years before he is eligible for parole.
His eye disease will, according to the memorandum filed by his defense attorneys, progress. He will probably go blind during his incarceration.
It is not justice. It is simply an unhappy fact in the jumble of unhappy facts of an unhappy life. As his defense attorneys said in their court filing, Cherry never stood a chance.
Neither did Zoey.
But the living children in need among us do.

Earlier in my career I may have been the guy you heard, both on WHCN/Hartford and later on NBC.  When I started in radio in 1967, AM Top 40 was king and FM was just getting started.  But in 1961 the FCC decreed that all radios should have both AM and FM bands… and that FM should broadcast in stereo. And no longer could station owners just simulcast their AM programs on their FM stations: FM programming had to be different.


Thus was born “Progressive Album Rock” on FM, usually programmed by long-haired LP fans.  That was me, again.  Within years radio listening went from predominantly AM to majority FM thanks to better audio quality and changing musical tastes.
Today the AM band is filled with syndicated political talk, foreign language shows and sports.  Only a handful of stations have real news departments (think WTIC, WICC here in Connecticut).
Then came the all-electric car.  Because of their wiring Teslas and such could not have AM radios due to interference.  What to do?
Well, Congress is expected to pass a law requiring AM radios in all cars.  The bill has hundreds of co-sponsors, including the entire Connecticut delegation.  No wonder:  pols love being interviewed on AM stations.
“But AM radio is effectively aging out, with less than a 20% market share.  And many news / talk stations have transitioned to FM where there are far more listeners,” (think WINS in New York City) says former station consultant Steve Goldstein of Westport.
Goldstein left radio years ten years ago to become a podcasting consultant.  He also teaches at NYU and says not one of his students listens to AM.  Most don’t listen to FM, either, preferring streaming services like Pandora and Spotify or on-demand media like podcasts. “AM radio is going the way of the phone booth and fax machine,” he laments.
So why save AM radio in the car when folks aren’t listening?  And what will be left on FM to tune into?
If your listening habits tend toward the NPR stations at the lower end of the FM band you’re in for disappointment.  Congress has just voted to claw back (“rescind”) $1.1 billion from funds previously allocated to CPB, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting which funds both PBS television and NPR radio stations.
In the case of Connecticut Public Radio (WNPR) we’re talking about a 10+% budget cut.  That will probably mean layoffs and less local programming for shows like “Colin McEnroe.” 
At WSHU they say they’ll need to raise an additional $500,000 to make up for the loss.  Elsewhere in the U.S. it’s estimated that as many as 80 NPR stations will just go dark.
Your mail is already crowded with funding appeals, not just from public broadcasters but from other non-profits also losing federal funding.  With so many hands outstretched, how will donors prioritize their gifts?  Feeding the hungry or keeping the airwaves alive?
So Congress giveth (renewed life to AM radio) and taketh away (cutting PBS and NPR). The media world (and listeners) will adapt. 
Now, if only I could find my old eight-track tape player.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/wnpr-hq.jpg,,,2025-07-20 04:56:27.180586

(Courtesy of AGP)LINCOLN — A new soybean crushing facility that owners say brings a $700 million investment to Nebraska’s David City and will support 80 jobs is set to launch commercial operations by the end of August.
On a site that spans nearly 275 acres, the Ag Processing Inc. plant at full speed is expected to process 50 million bushels of soybeans and produce 700 million pounds of refined soybean oil. Such byproducts are used for animal feed, cooking and biofuel.
The operation about an hour northwest of Nebraska’s capital city, will be the 11th soybean processing location for AGP, an agribusiness headquartered in Omaha and owned by local and regional cooperatives representing farms and producers across the U.S. 
A spokesman said the latest plant location, announced in 2022, was chosen largely for proximity to cooperative members, a reliable supply of soybeans, workforce and transportation access. Infrastructure was another factor, said AGP’s Michael Dolch, as the grounds include 2.5 miles of paved roads and nearly 13.6 miles of rail track.

“As a cooperative, AGP’s mission is to add value to our members’ soybeans by processing the beans into meal and oil, selling those products in the open market, and returning the earnings to our local owners,” Board Chair Dean Thernes said in a statement. 
He said David City adds to AGP’s midwestern processing capabilities and improves its competitive edge in domestic and international markets for the growing industry. The cooperative’s last soybean processing plant opened six years ago in Aberdeen, South Dakota.
State leaders including Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen joined AGP members and industry representatives on Thursday for a ceremonial grand opening.
Pillen talked about Nebraska’s reliance on agriculture and said the new plant would consume more than 15% of the state’s soybeans grown.
“AGP’s processing facility is creating fantastic opportunities for our soybean farmers and bringing rewarding careers to David City,” he said. “This plant … improves the basis for local markets and puts more cash in producers’ pockets.”
AGP managers credited local support for helping the project to materialize.
“With the amount of rail track on site, AGP will load a unit train of 110 cars every three to four days. We will be able to hold a loaded unit train, receive an empty unit train and continue to build a third unit train of soybean meal,” said Lou Rickers, chief operations officer.

At the heart of our statewide economic development efforts is the goal of growing Nebraska’s tax base, because the best and most sustainable paths to reducing the tax burden on Nebraska families run through expanded economic growth, private-sector investment and job growth.
To achieve this, Nebraska must become more competitive focused on economic growth. While we are home to nationally significant industries, including manufacturing, agriculture, construction and financial services, these sectors are rapidly evolving.
Companies are investing in automation, data analytics and artificial intelligence-driven processes, and they are making location decisions based on where innovation is embraced and where the policy environment supports growth. Increasingly, we are seeing companies, including those with existing footprints in Nebraska, choose to grow in other states that offer more competitive incentives and greater speed to market.
The next permanent DED Director must champion a pro-growth agenda that prioritizes business attraction and retention, modernizes incentive tools and site-readiness programs, reimagines our state’s marketing and seeks innovative ideas to utility infrastructure enhancements.
To assist this new director, we recommend having an industry-respected entity undertake a comprehensive economic competitiveness assessment of Nebraska to assist in evaluating the state’s current economic and workforce landscape — eyeing opportunities and challenges.
Having the Nebraska Department of Economic Development work with other stakeholders on growing new high-wage, high-skilled, high-demand jobs is not only critical to Nebraska’s economy, but also generates the kinds of opportunities young people seek.
Transformations underway in agriculture, manufacturing, health care and financial services demand new skills, new technologies, and new thinking, qualities that define our emerging talent base. By creating the right economic environment, we can ensure that our state remains a place where younger Nebraskans can find rewarding careers, build their futures and stay closer to home.
We are encouraged by Gov. Jim Pillen and other state leaders focusing on making Nebraska stronger. As organizations engaged in the daily work of growing our economy, we stand ready to support the administration’s next permanent DED director in building a more competitive, prosperous and opportunity-rich Nebraska through a new pro-growth agenda.
Together, we can ensure our state is not only open for business but positioned to lead in a rapidly changing economy.

In 2021, Polanco had been working alone with another female officer in a high-risk male unit when an agitated inmate suddenly turned violent, targeting her co-worker. Stepping in to protect her, Polanco tried to restrain the inmate on her own — and was brutally assaulted.
She suffered multiple stab wounds to her back and face, a broken jaw, fractured ribs and lasting nerve damage. After relearning basic functions in the wake of the attack, Polanco now stands as a vocal opponent of CoreCivic’s plans to reopen its former prison as an expanded immigration detention center.
“After what I went through there, to put immigrants that have worked hard and haven’t even probably done anything serious and to put them in that type of environment — that’s going to be a danger to them,” Polanco said. “You had high-risk people in there dying. So what’s going to keep an immigrant from dying in there now? What’s the difference?”

Polanco was among the roughly three-dozen people who participated in a “pots and pans” march Saturday in Leavenworth. The demonstration was organized by the CoreCivic Opposition Group of Leavenworth.
According to a press release, the group’s primary concerns include a lack of public transparency, bypassing of standard public processes, broken economic promises to the local community and CoreCivic’s national record of abuse. CoreCivic didn’t respond to a Kansas Reflector request for comment.
Critics of CoreCivic point to a track record marred by chronic understaffing, inmate deaths and unsafe working conditions during the facility’s previous operations from 1992 to 2021 under CoreCivic management.

In a 2021 executive order, President Joe Biden directed federal agencies to end contracts with privately run prison facilities. The prison closed that year after its contract with the U.S. Marshals Service expired.
However, the facility’s proposed reopening as a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center avoids that executive order, which only applies to criminal, not civil, detention. ICE gave CoreCivic a no-bid federal contract worth $4.2 million a month.
But the city of Leavenworth said CoreCivic would need to apply for a special use permit to reopen the facility, and sued the company to block the reopening.
Leavenworth District Judge John Bryant issued an injunction that prevented CoreCivic from accepting ICE detainees at the facility.

Polanco wasn’t alone in her experience. Former corrections officer William Rogers also spoke to the dysfunction of the facility and the toll it took on employees.
“What brings me here is to try to keep other folks, not just detainees but employees, from suffering and seeing what we had to see,” Rogers said. “It’s a big deal when this many people get up on a Saturday morning and we all have something we’d rather be doing, but they chose to be here.”
In addition to members of the CoreCivic Opposition Group of Leavenworth and former CoreCivic employees, demonstrators included community advocates and nuns from the Sisters of Charity of Leavenworth.
“CoreCivic has shown over the years that it does not respect or care for its employees or the people in its prisons,” said Sister Jean Panisko. “We’re asking that people be respected, given due process, access to immigration lawyers, and afforded all the rights guaranteed by our Constitution. That’s our stand — because we care about our God-given rights.”

Ashley Hernandez, organizing and policy coordinator for the Sisters of Charity Leavenworth Office of Justice, Peace and Integrity of Creation, emphasized the importance of the march’s symbolism.
“The pots and pans march is about waking up our neighbors,” Hernandez said. “When we make noise together, people listen. Residents need to know who is trying to set up shop in their backyard.”
As legal battles continue and public pressure mounts, community members say their goals remain simple — to prevent history from repeating itself.
“I think that (people) right now think they’re alone, but they need to stand strong through all of this,” Polanco said. “You got a voice, speak out.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/DSC08928-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-19 23:06:07.323182

The fire that tore through Gabriel House, killing 10 residents and injuring more than 20 others, wasn't just a tragic accident; it was a catastrophic failure of a system that promised safety and delivered a death trap. 
The post In Fall River, our promise to the elderly went up in smoke  appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","THE SMELL OF smoke should never be the last thing a person experiences in their own home. Yet for residents of the Gabriel House assisted living facility in Fall River, that nightmare became a reality last week.  
The fire that tore through their building, killing 10 residents and injuring more than 20 others, wasn’t just a tragic accident; it was a catastrophic failure of a system that promised safety and delivered a death trap. 
Gov. Healey’s emergency safety orders for all 273 assisted living residences in Massachusetts are a necessary first step. But let’s be clear: They are an admission of a colossal failure. Why did it take bodies being carried from a smoldering building to mandate that evacuation routes be posted on a resident’s door? Why did it take a fatal blaze for the state to demand that facilities simply report the age of their fire safety systems? 
These aren’t just uncomfortable questions. They are an indictment. 
For too long, we have mistaken compliance paperwork for a culture of safety. We trusted that profit-driven facilities and overstretched state agencies were upholding their end of the bargain. The fire at Gabriel House burned that illusion to the ground. 
The fact that the state must now order facilities to communicate safety plans to families reveals a terrifying gap in transparency. The mandate for immediate fire safety assessments confirms what many have feared: that the agencies tasked with oversight may have been flying blind, unaware of the crumbling infrastructure and inadequate protocols inside the very buildings they were supposed to monitor. 
This isn’t just about one facility. It’s about a statewide system where the well-being of our parents and grandparents has been subordinated to bureaucratic convenience and the bottom line. The COVID-19 pandemic already exposed the fragility of our elder care systems. We learned nothing if we are now facing a fire safety crisis that was just as predictable and just as deadly. 
If we are serious about preventing the next Fall River, our response cannot end with the governor’s press conference. Real reform is not a suggestion box; it is a set of non-negotiable demands. The industry’s pledges of cooperation are welcome, but trust must be earned through action, not press releases. We must demand: 
·  Aggressive, Unannounced Inspections. End the charade of facilities self-assessing their way to a passing grade. We need surprise inspections with real teeth and steep, public fines for non-compliance. 
·  Mandatory Staffing-to-Resident Ratios for Evacuations. A perfect evacuation plan is worthless without enough staff to execute it. We must establish and enforce staffing levels sufficient to get every resident out in a crisis, not just on a sunny afternoon. 
·  A “Safe Buildings” Fund and Mandate. The state must create a fund to help older facilities modernize with critical upgrades like sprinkler systems, while also mandating that all facilities meet modern fire codes within a strict timeframe. No more grandfather clauses for safety. 
·  A Public Safety Dashboard. Every family has the right to know the safety record of a facility before they entrust their loved one to its care. All inspection results, violations, and staffing levels must be published online in an easily accessible database. 
Implementing these, and other, reforms could be achieved without wasting time for more study. An Assisted Living Commission, established in last year’s long-term care reform law, is due to report within weeks, although its draft report is largely silent on life safety recommendations. The commission should not worry about its August 1 reporting deadline if it gets this issue right. Attorney General Andrea Campbell is on the cusp of releasing new assisted living consumer protection regulations that could easily address issues responsive to the Fall River tragedy. There’s no reason to delay and both actions would be fitting memorials to the victims of the fire. 
The residents of Gabriel House were more than statistics. They were mothers and fathers, grandmothers and grandfathers. They were people who trusted the Commonwealth to keep them safe in their final years. We broke that trust. 
We cannot bring them back. But we can honor their memory by ensuring no other family has to receive that horrific phone call. The true test of our leadership will not be in the flurry of activity last week, but in the sustained, relentless oversight months and years from now, long after the cameras have moved on. 
The ashes in Fall River are a stain on our conscience. The wake-up call has sounded. We cannot afford to hit snooze again.

A key office charged by Congress with coordinating the federal government’s work against human trafficking was gutted July 11, the latest in a string of cuts across different agencies to the government’s work on an issue that Republicans have long hailed as a top priority.
The cuts at the State Department’s Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons (TIP) decimated a team that worked to combat labor and sex trafficking abroad and helped coordinate domestic efforts across other agencies, including the departments of Justice, Health and Human Services, and Labor.
The so-called “reduction-in-force” at the State Department came amid a maelstrom surrounding the Trump administration over its handling of federal investigations into sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who died in prison while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges in 2019. Officials have said he died by suicide, but his death sparked new conspiracy theories that were fueled by President Donald Trump, who at one point maintained a friendship with Epstein. When this month the Justice Department said there was no Epstein client list, after previously promising to release it, many who had supported Trump and Attorney General Pam Bondi were angered, in part because they believed the client list would reveal new truths about Epstein.
Republicans have for years made human trafficking a key issue, pushing for legislation to boost law enforcement and support for victims and telling voters that combating trafficking was a major priority.

This report was originally published by The 19th. The Illuminator is a founding member of The 19th News Network.

For Secretary of State Marco Rubio, anti-trafficking work has been a centerpiece of his policy agenda. Rubio cosponsored bipartisan legislation to help domestic trafficking survivors during his time in the Senate and as recently as May discussed his concerns about a rise in human trafficking in an unstable Haiti. He criticized former President Joe Biden’s immigration policy by saying it “empowered” child trafficking into the United States.
Bondi, too, has long been an advocate of local and federal efforts to combat human trafficking, making it a key focus of her tenure as Florida’s attorney general. She went on to lobby on behalf of a Christian anti-human-trafficking advocacy group and the Qatari government on anti-human-trafficking efforts.
People working on human trafficking issues in the federal government and for advocacy groups on the front lines of that work in the United States and abroad have been surprised at the pullback. The administration’s attention to the issue during Trump’s first term and the ascent of high-profile advocates to the Cabinet gave them the impression that their work would be shielded from the kinds of cuts they were seeing elsewhere.
Instead, funding and staffing for human trafficking work has taken sizable hits.
“We really thought that the broad, bipartisan nature of the issue of trafficking was going to provide some protection for our office. All Americans are against trafficking — Republicans, Democrats, everybody,” said Cindy Dyer, the former ambassador-at-large under Biden to monitor and combat trafficking in persons at the State Department. The office she oversaw had close to 90 full-time staffers. It lost about a dozen to the Trump administration’s voluntary resignation program earlier in the year, and, last Friday, about half were dismissed. The remaining were demoted, Dyer said.
The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The office’s work spanned a broad range of human trafficking issues, including sex trafficking, which disproportionately affects women, girls and LGBTQ+ people, and forced domestic labor, which also disproportionately affects women and girls. Dyer is now the chief program officer at the McCain Institute at Arizona State University, which promotes democracy and human rights across the world.
“We really thought that broad bipartisan support we have had for 25 years — ever since the Trafficking Victims Protection Act passed in 2000 — would provide us some protection, and it did not. And I think people are really both surprised and disappointed,” said Dyer, who also worked in the Justice Department in the George W. Bush administration.
Gov. Landry makes leadership change at Children and Family Services

The most recent reauthorization of the law was approved in 2017, during the first Trump administration. The law charged the TIP office with producing an annual report that was due to Congress on June 30; this year’s report has been delayed without explanation. Last week’s cuts severely impacted the team working on that report, which is widely considered a critical global assessment of human trafficking prevention work.
Before those staffing cuts, the office had also paused the disbursement of grants for nongovernmental organizations working on human trafficking. The 19th could not confirm the current status of those grants.
Varina Winder, who worked as the chief of staff in the Office of Global Women’s Issues at the State Department during the Biden administration, said she was dismayed by the pullback on work to uphold global human rights, including stopping trafficking at TIP.
“If you can’t empower the office that is literally ending human slavery, what does that say about your larger ambitions about the value proposition of humans in this administration?” she said.
Martina Vandenberg of the Human Trafficking Legal Center said federal work to combat human trafficking falls into four buckets: the State Department’s global work, prosecution at the Justice Department, federal funding for outside groups and immigration policy. Every area has taken a hit since the start of the administration, Vandenberg said.
“We have grave concerns,” said Vandenberg, whose anti-trafficking advocacy group connects trafficking survivors with pro bono representation. “It is distressing to see U.S. anti-trafficking programs decimated by an administration that rode to victory, at least in part, on claims that it would combat human trafficking.”
The Human Trafficking Legal Center published an analysis of federal data this week showing that visas for victims of human trafficking who cooperate with law enforcement to arrest and prosecute traffickers are being issued at record-low levels, despite a growing backlog.
At the Labor Department, the Trump administration in March put an end to close to 70 programs and more than $500 million in grant funding that the agency was using to combat child labor and human trafficking in countries that have trade agreements with the United States. The funding helped ensure foreign governments were fighting human trafficking while also protecting U.S. jobs, The Washington Post reported at the time. The office that managed the funding was also tasked with producing a congressionally mandated report that, in part, outlined goods produced with child labor.
“To have this administration cut funding so significantly has just been a huge blow to the progress that has been made over the last several decades,” said a federal government employee familiar with this work who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of fear of retaliation.
“Within the anti-trafficking movement and in the government, we were hoping that we would be protected in some way since during Trump’s first administration, there was more funding for anti-trafficking then than there had been in previous administrations even. And Ivanka Trump took a really strong interest in the issue,” the employee said. In his first term, the president’s oldest daughter made the issue central to her portfolio and hosted a summit at the White House.
“We’ve just seen a huge shift in this administration, and honestly, it’s sent shock waves through the community,” the employee said.
On Thursday night, Trump said he would authorize Bondi to request from a federal court the grand jury testimony from Epstein’s trial. It was a reversal from her previous position on what she would release, though it is still unclear what transcripts the courts could approve to be made public.
Reps. Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, and Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican, have been trying to force a floor vote on releasing the complete Epstein files. Several far-right Republicans have signed on to the discharge petition effort so far, including Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene, Eli Crane, Lauren Boebert and Max Miller.
Discharge petitions are a procedural maneuver that circumvents House leadership and the powerful Rules Committee to force a floor vote. They’ve rarely been successful because they require a majority of House members’ signatures to kick off. Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, managed to kill the last one raised in April, which would have let new parents vote by proxy while away from the Capitol.
But Khanna said he’s confident that the petition will move forward: “We have the votes.”
“Moms being allowed to vote in the House is important,” he said of the failed discharge petition effort, then added: “But the release of the Epstein files to the MAGA base matters 100 times more to them. I think it’s a totally different situation in terms of the intensity of scrutiny. … The base cares so deeply about this.”
Next week, a group of high-profile Republicans are expected to gather at the Capitol for the annual International Summit Against Human Trafficking put on by the Conservative Political Action Conference, the group behind the annual gathering of right-wing activists and politicians.
“This pivotal event upholds CPAC’s steadfast dedication to eradicating modern-day slavery by uniting survivors, legislators, advocates, and law enforcement from both domestic and international communities to drive bold solutions,” the announcement for the event reads. The group said earlier this month that Trump’s investments in immigration enforcement in the “one big beautiful bill” will “hit traffickers where it hurts by taking away the shadows they exploit.”
Just days later, Freedom Network USA, one of the leading anti-trafficking groups in the country, is planning to hold a webinar on World Day Against Trafficking in Persons “to break down how the Trump administration’s heinous attacks have impacted human trafficking survivors.”

But is that bandage big enough to save struggling rural hospitals?
“I have more questions than I have answers,” said Alan Morgan, CEO of the National Rural Health Association, a nonprofit policy group. “No one has those answers yet.”
Morgan noted that the new money for rural health, to be spent over five years, is far less than the $155 billion in rural Medicaid spending cuts over 10 years, as estimated by KFF, a nonprofit health policy and research group.
Experts, hospital leaders and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle fear that Trump’s signature legislation will particularly gut rural hospitals and clinics, which see an outsize share of patients who are insured through Medicaid, the federal-state public health insurance for people with low incomes. The new law slashes more than $1 trillion from Medicaid over the next 10 years to help pay for tax cuts that disproportionately benefit the wealthy.
The $50 billion addition was an effort by Republican leaders in Congress to win the votes of colleagues within their party who initially balked at supporting such steep cuts to Medicaid and other health services.
In the U.S. Senate, the rural program helped secure the vote of Alaska moderate Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who expressed concern about the law’s impact on health care in her state. About 1 in 3 Alaskans are insured through Medicaid.
Jared Kosin, the president and CEO of the Alaska Hospital & Healthcare Association, said he’s deeply frustrated with the new law’s gutting of Medicaid funding, which he thinks will wreak lasting damage on Alaskans. And Republicans sidestepped potential solutions by just throwing money into a program, he said.
“It’s frustrating in the public realm when decisions like this are made fast and, frankly, carelessly,” he said.
“The consequences are going to fall on us, not them.”
More than half of the law’s cuts to funding in rural areas are concentrated in 12 states with large rural populations that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act to cover more people, according to KFF: Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania and Virginia.
Some GOP lawmakers in Congress have heralded the $50 billion rural program as a health care victory. But it’s still unclear which hospitals, clinics and other providers would receive money and how much.
 How it works

The Rural Health Transformation Program will dole out $10 billion annually from fiscal years 2026 through 2030.
States must apply for their funding by the end of this year, submitting a detailed plan on how it would be used.
The law outlines some ways that states can use the money, according to an analysis of the legislation from the Bipartisan Policy Center:

Making payments to rural hospitals to help them maintain essential services such as emergency room care or labor and delivery.
Recruiting and training rural doctors, nurses and other health workers.
Bolstering emergency medical services such as ambulances and EMTs.
Using new technologies, including telehealth.
Providing opioid use disorder treatment and mental health services.
Improving preventive care and chronic disease management.

Half of the $10 billion each year will be distributed evenly across states that have applied for it. The other half can be distributed by the administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services — currently Dr. Mehmet Oz — at his discretion, based on a state’s rural population and rural health facilities.
Although the program doesn’t replace the amount states are likely to lose, Morgan said it’s still an opportunity to rethink how rural health care is funded. He’d like to see states given flexibility in how they’re able to use the funds, and he hopes they focus on keeping rural communities healthy through preventive care while still helping hospitals keep their doors open.
“If done correctly, it could really change the future course for rural America,” Morgan said. “That is such a tough ask, though.”
 Hardest hit

Kentucky could take the biggest hit from the new law’s reduction in rural Medicaid funding, losing an estimated $12 billion over 10 years, according to a KFF analysis.
The state’s Medicaid department is still waiting for additional federal guidance to understand how the state’s program will be affected, Kendra Steele, spokesperson with the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services, told Stateline in a statement.
“Over 1.4 million Kentuckians rely on Medicaid — including half of all children in our state, seniors and more vulnerable populations — and the passage of legislation on the federal level will have serious impacts for those individuals, rural health care and hospitals and local economies,” she wrote.
Even with the new program, states across the country will have to reevaluate their budgets in light of the cuts, said Hemi Tewarson, executive director at the National Academy for State Health Policy, a nonpartisan group that supports states in developing health care policies.
“Every region is slightly different and there’s not a one-size-fits-all approach,” she said. “Hospital ownership varies [as well as] the types of services that are critical for the community where they’re located. They have to think about new ways to provide those services in a context with fewer resources.”
About 44% of rural hospitals are operating in the red, according to a KFF analysis of Rand Hospital Data, a higher share than the 35% of hospitals in urban areas.
 ‘Rural at heart’

Prior to the bill’s passage, Oz attempted to reassure U.S. House Republicans that their districts could get money from the program even if they weren’t specifically rural, Politico reported earlier this month.
Pennsylvania Republican U.S. Rep. Rob Bresnahan said money would begin flowing to his district as early as the beginning of next year, telling the Wilkes-Barre Times Leader earlier this month that he met with Trump, Oz and others to secure pledges that hospitals in his district could access the fund. He represents the northeastern corner of Pennsylvania, which includes suburban and rural areas, as well as the cities of Scranton and Wilkes-Barre.
Though the legislation includes guidelines on which facilities or areas qualify as “rural,” Morgan, of the National Rural Health Association, expects a mad dash from lawmakers and providers to claim rural status in order to get a piece of the funding.
“That’s going to be a huge issue — defining who’s rural,” Morgan said. “We’re all rural at heart when it comes to money.”

He represents the northeastern corner of Pennsylvania, which includes suburban and rural areas, as well as the cities of Scranton and Wilkes-Barre.
Though the legislation includes guidelines on which facilities or areas qualify as “rural,” Morgan, of the National Rural Health Association, expects a mad dash from lawmakers and providers to claim rural status in order to get a piece of the funding.
“That’s going to be a huge issue — defining who’s rural,” Morgan said. “We’re all rural at heart when it comes to money.”

(Photo by Nathaniel Herz/Northern Journal)State regulators approved a price hike for Anchorage electric consumers less than a year ago, with the exact impacts to members’ bills depending on their area of the city. 
Another increase went through in February, boosting bills by an estimated 5%.
Now, bills could rise another 4% in the coming months — a step that utility leaders, in part, are blaming on unusual warmth last winter.
Chugach Electric Association, cooperatively owned by its more than 90,000 Anchorage area members, typically sees higher demand in winter stemming from more lighting, indoor cooking and electric heating. 
But this past winter, the seventh-warmest in Anchorage in a century, Chugach recorded a 4% decline in sales, utility executives said at a pair of recent meetings — meaning that the utility didn’t collect all the revenue it expected from its previously approved price hikes. Responding to a January wind storm also cost Chugach some $1 million.
Board members are expected to vote on whether to submit the latest increase to regulators at a meeting later this month.
“The main driver that we’ve seen that’s really pushing on sales, at this point, is weather,” Matt Clarkson, Chugach’s top attorney, said at a board committee meeting last week.
 
Inside the ‘titanic’ legal case that will help determine Alaska’s energy future: an analysis

	Other trends are contributing to a longer-term sales decline, according to Chugach spokeswoman Julie Hasquet. Anchorage’s population has stagnated, and consumers are increasingly conserving power and using more energy efficient appliances, she said. Inflation has also put pressure on the utility’s budget.
But Chugach has also documented a consistent trend of warming temperatures that appear to be linked to declining demand and thus sales. Since 1953, the number of heating degree days — a measurement of how cold it is — has fallen by 14% in Chugach’s service area, the utility said in follow-up correspondence with regulators.
Chugach maintains a 10-year sales forecast, which is reviewed annually, according to Hasquet. “We are not weather forecasters, but we review historic and long range weather, as well,” she wrote in an email. 
One of the considerations driving the potential new increase, said Hasquet, is the need to preserve Chugach’s credit rating — affirmed at an ‘A’ grade by one agency earlier this week.
Keeping that grade, Hasquet said, ensures that the utility can borrow money at favorable rates for anticipated major investments — whether in liquefied natural gas imports infrastructure or large-scale renewable developments.
The warming trend in Anchorage is expected to continue, as the winter season is when temperatures are rising the most in the state, according to Rick Thoman, a specialist at the Alaska Center for Climate Assessment and Policy.
“There’s no reason to think winters will not continue to warm in most of the state, I think, including Southcentral,” Thoman said, referring to the region that includes Anchorage. “The warm end is creeping up — but not nearly as fast as the loss of the really cold weather.”
The warm winter also affected Matanuska Electric Association, the cooperative based in the Mat-Su region north of Anchorage, according to spokeswoman Julie Estey.
The utility recently filed a quarterly adjustment with state regulators to boost its base rates by 3% — an increase Estey said was higher than normal. Conversely, the previous year’s colder winter allowed the cooperative to delay increases that were expected earlier, she added.
In Fairbanks, the local utility, Golden Valley Electric Association, didn’t experience similarly declining sales last winter because of its “larger industrial load,” President Travis Million wrote in an email.

(Photo: Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)A day after declaring a state of emergency in the region, Governor Josh Stein toured flood-stricken Chapel Hill and spoke with residents and local business owners still reeling from recent damage.
A Chapel Hill native, Stein returned to his hometown Friday to console residents who lost their homes to flooding from Tropical Storm Chantal and pledged to seek relief for the region as well as work toward resilience against future disasters. Chantal, which brought as much as 12 inches of rain to some areas, killed at least six people in North Carolina.
At a press conference in Kipos Greek Taverna, among the businesses in Chapel Hill’s Eastgate Crossing closed indefinitely due to flood repairs, Stein said the recovery process is still in the “damage assessment phase” but he hopes that the disaster declaration will help yield federal assistance. Eastgate Crossing is less than three miles from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill’s main campus.

“I know this place exceptionally well, and it hurts my heart that these business owners who invested their blood, their sweat, their tears, their capital into building successful small businesses just to have it washed away in a single day,” Stein told reporters. “That’s what’s crazy, is that a few hours of rain can completely turn lives upside down.”
Stein said that if damage proves great enough, the state will go to FEMA seeking federal disaster assistance. On Thursday, he declared a state of emergency for Alamance, Caswell, Chatham, Davidson, Durham, Forsyth, Guilford, Lee, Moore, Orange, Person, Randolph, and Wake counties over the damage brought by Chantal on July 6 and by subsequent severe storms in the following days.
He also expressed concern that the Trump administration has stopped providing funding through its Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program — funds that would typically go toward shoring up communities like Chapel Hill and neighboring towns against flooding.
Attorney General Jeff Jackson joined 19 other attorneys general Wednesday in suing over withheld BRIC funds. That program was also the subject of controversy in the wake of Hurricane Helene, when it came to light that the state lost out on an estimated $70 million in preparedness funds due to outdated building codes. “We’re in court right now to try to get that spigot turned back on,” Stein said.
He added that he hopes the legislature will also provide support to the counties hit hardest by Chantal. Stein said he has reached out to legislative leaders and has spoken with a number of local legislators as well to try to rally aid for the region.
“My hope is that these businesses get back in operation as quickly as possible,” Stein said. “I’ve been inside two stores, I’ve heard about a third from another owner. They’re already in there cleaning, they’re taking sheetrock off the wall, they’re bringing in new electrical. They are going to work as fast as they can so they can welcome customers here in Chapel Hill.”
Residents at Camelot Village described floodwaters that rose five feet high sweeping the community and forcing them to await rescue by boat. Shelton Stokes, who lived in his home for seven years prior to the flood, said he drove out just as the waters began to rise. A tree collapsed near the entrance of the community just after he left, blocking other vehicles from making it out.
“We just lost our security, everything we worked hard for, and we just need to get that back. We’ve got community, even though they’re at the hotel, we’ve got our community there,” Stokes said. “Everybody’s chipping in, everybody — trying to get everybody out, trying to get the older folks out of the windows, everybody did their job.”




Kirby Saunders, the Orange County Emergency Services Director, said forecasts did not prepare them for the severity of the flooding that would come. “We got notice about an hour before the heaviest rains started that it was going to be a really, really heavy rain — that’s unfortunate that we didn’t have that opportunity to bring in additional resources.”
Saunders praised the work of public safety officials as well as town and volunteer responders, noting that they were able to carry out more than 70 swift water rescues the night of the flooding. He said the lesson is to get serious about flood mitigation before more lives are lost, adding that developments like Camelot Village, located on a flood plain, “should never have been constructed.”
“How do we remove people and things that are critical to our communities from harm’s way, especially when we have the knowledge that it’s going to happen?” he said. “We don’t know when it’s going to happen, but we know it’s going to happen.”
Other officials in attendance included Sen. Graig Meyer (D-Orange), Rep. Allen Buansi (D-Orange), and Chapel Hill Council Member Amy Ryan.

Meyer said he hopes to help deliver aid to resident when the legislature reconvenes later this month, likely as part of a broader relief Helene-focused package that also addresses the damage already brought by this year’s hurricane season. He expressed regret that small businesses will likely not receive direct aid, however, as the state constitution is interpreted by some to prevent allocating funds directly to private entities.
“We can provide assistance to the local government bodies for things like addressing the flood mitigation or for trying to help Hillsborough with their water and sewer system and moving some of that. We generally have not been able to be the ones who will take care of small businesses,” Meyer said. “With Chantal, we have significant need for small business assistance, and if the feds aren’t going to do that, then I’m not entirely sure where these businesses are going to get the support that they need and deserve.”
He also took aim at the Trump administration for pulling federal funds away from climate and resilience programs, including the National Weather Service’s forecasting tools.
“Clearly, there’s a correlation here in Texas and other places between them pulling money out of the National Weather Service and then people getting hit by unexpected, devastating weather events,” Meyer said. “We’re not able to warn people, but to me, the bigger concern is we’re not able to take on the challenge of addressing climate change as a whole.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/P7182601-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-19 23:06:07.323182

Wisconsin is among at least nine states that have received requests from the U.S. Department of Justice for voter information, raising concerns among election officials about how the Trump administration will use the data. (Morry Gash/The Associated Press)The U.S. Department of Justice is seeking the voter registration lists of several states — representing data on millions of Americans — and other election information ahead of the 2026 midterms, raising fears about how the Trump administration plans to use the information.
The DOJ is also demanding Colorado turn over all records related to the 2024 election, a massive trove of documents that could include ballots and even voting equipment. The Colorado inquiry, the most sweeping publicly known request, underscores the extent of the administration’s attention on state election activities.
At least nine states have received requests for information over the past three months, according to letters from the DOJ obtained by Stateline. Some states also received emails from a DOJ official last week asking for meetings to discuss information-sharing agreements.
The department’s focus on elections comes after President Donald Trump directed U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi in March to seek information about suspected election crimes from state election officials and empowered her to potentially withhold grants and other funds from uncooperative states.
For years, Trump has advanced false claims about elections, including the idea that the 2020 election that he lost was stolen. Now back in power, his administration is taking a new level of interest in how states — and even local authorities — administer elections.
Last week, a political operative approached several Republican county clerks in Colorado to enlist them in election integrity efforts in light of Trump’s sweeping March executive order overhauling elections administration. One clerk told Stateline the operative claimed to represent the White House.
“Whatever the Trump administration tries to pull is very unlikely to be successful,” Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold, a Democrat, said in an interview, calling Colorado elections very secure. “With that said, do I think they are trying to undermine our elections at large in this country? Absolutely.”
DOJ has sent letters to Alaska, Arizona, Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, New York, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, in addition to the request to Colorado.
The letters have typically asked election officials to describe how they register voters and work to identify duplicate registrations and individuals not eligible to vote, such as people with felony convictions and those who have died. The Washington Post earlier Wednesday reported on the letters; Votebeat and NPR previously reported on some of the letters as well.
Most letters also ask about each state’s process for flagging noncitizen applicants. Noncitizen voting is against federal law and incredibly rare, but Trump and his allies have promoted false claims about its prevalence. The Trump administration is also conducting a general crackdown on illegal immigration.
The letters call on election officials to turn over voter registration lists, which in some instances contain data on millions of residents in their states. This request has raised the most concerns, with some experts saying it’s unclear exactly why the DOJ wants the information.
“They don’t make much sense as law enforcement investigations. That makes me think that there’s some other purpose,” said Justin Levitt, who served as senior policy adviser for democracy and voting rights in the Biden White House and is now a law professor at Loyola Marymount University.
While many states make their voter registration lists available to the public, Levitt emphasized the data could still be largely off-limits to the federal government. Federal privacy law sometimes restricts how the government can use data that’s publicly obtainable. The DOJ may need voter information in some individual circumstances, but “that’s not blanket permission to go vacuuming up data.”
The DOJ didn’t respond to questions for this story.
Federal laws restrict the federal government’s ability to centralize information on Americans, said David Becker, executive director of the nonpartisan Center for Election Innovation & Research. Even if states provide voter registration information to the public, they often redact sensitive information.
In Orange County, California, the DOJ sued local election officials in June, seeking unredacted voter registration information, such as Social Security numbers and driver’s licenses, as part of an investigation into noncitizen voting.
More than 350 election officials from some 33 states participated in a conference call about federal actions on Monday hosted by Becker, who was previously an attorney in the DOJ Voting Rights Section during the administrations of Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. He said the interest in the call shows the level of uncertainty and anxiety over the current “federal imposition” on election administrators.
“The DOJ seems dead set on acquiring personal information on voters, including driver’s license numbers, Social Security numbers and dates of birth — records that are highly protected under federal law and under state law and which state election officials are sworn to protect,” Becker said.
 
Sweeping Colorado requests
In Colorado, the amount of data the DOJ wants is enormous. On May 12, Harmeet Dhillon, an assistant U.S. attorney general in the DOJ’s Civil Rights Division, sent a letter to Griswold, the secretary of state, asking for access to “all records” related to the 2024 election.
Federal law requires state election officials to preserve records related to elections for 22 months. Typically, the rule ensures records are preserved in case any lawsuits are filed over an election. In the letter, Dhillon referred to a complaint against Griswold’s office alleging noncompliance with records retention laws, but provided no details.
Experts on election administration who spoke to Stateline expressed shock at the scope of the demand to Colorado. The request encompasses a vast trove of material, potentially including ballots.
“The amount of records being requested from a place like Colorado … it’s really, really significant in terms of the volume of materials that are required to be retained,” said Neal Ubriani, a former voting rights litigator at the DOJ during the Obama and first Trump administrations and the current policy and research director at the nonpartisan Institute for Responsive Government.
Colorado elections have previously drawn Trump’s attention. Former Mesa County Clerk Tina Peters, a staunch Trump supporter, is serving a nine-year prison sentence after a conviction in state court for allowing unauthorized access to voting equipment in 2021.
On May 5 of this year — a week before the Dhillon letter to Griswold — Trump posted on social media that Peters should be released, calling her a “political prisoner.” Griswold noted the timing.
“I think the bigger picture is Donald Trump is continuing to try and rewrite the 2020 election and destabilize the ’26 and ’28 elections,” Griswold told Stateline.
The Colorado Secretary of State’s Office responded to the DOJ by providing copies of the state’s master voter file and voter history file. All of the information provided is also available to the public.
Some Colorado Republican county clerks in recent days have also been approached by Jeff Small, a political operative who worked at the U.S. Department of the Interior during the first Trump administration. Stateline and Colorado Newsline spoke to three GOP clerks who said they had spoken to Small last week.
Steve Schleiker, clerk of El Paso County, which includes Colorado Springs and is the most populous county in the state, said that on July 9 he received a text and call from Small, who introduced himself in a voicemail as someone who “works for the White House.”
Schleiker said that when he called back, Small said he wanted to build relationships with clerks because the Trump administration was unhappy with progress on the president’s elections executive order. He later connected Schleiker with a Homeland Security official who wanted to test the security of El Paso County’s election systems, said Schleiker, who added that he opposed the request.
Weld County Clerk Carly Koppes said she also heard from Small, but that Small told her he wasn’t under contract or being paid for the calls. Small indicated he was making the calls on behalf of former colleagues, Koppes said.
Small, a former Capitol Hill chief of staff who now works for a Colorado-based government affairs firm, didn’t return a call to his office on Wednesday. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that the agency works with local partners to ensure elections remain safe.
“We don’t disclose every single conversation we have with them,” an unidentified DHS spokesperson wrote in an email.
Matt Crane, executive director of the Colorado County Clerks Association, said he was aware of 10 clerks approached by Small. He noted that every clerk approached by Small hails from a county that uses Denver-based Dominion Voting Systems.
While Dominion is widely used in Colorado, it’s also been the subject of election conspiracy theories. A former candidate for county sheriff in southwest Colorado was arrested in June, accused of firebombing a clerk’s office. Colorado Public Radio reported the suspect, according to law enforcement, had spoken publicly about trying to get rid of the county’s Dominion machines.
“I think the really important thing to say here is that it was Republican clerks who stood up to a Republican administration and said, ‘No, we’re going to follow the law,’” Crane said.
The intent of the efforts by Small and the federal government “has been muddied up it seems,” Montrose County Clerk Tressa Guynes said. Based on her conversations with other clerks, she said, it appeared Small represented one thing to other clerks and then “represented maybe a watered-down version by the time it got to me.”
Guynes said Small wanted to discuss Trump’s elections executive order. She said Small asked whether she would be willing to support a federal task force’s efforts in an advisory role.
“I said absolutely I will advise,” Guynes said. “I said I’m frankly glad that they’re finally reaching out to the boots on the ground, the people who actually conduct the elections, instead of listening to those who have never conducted a Colorado election.”
 
Letters to other states
As Colorado grapples with the most far-reaching request, other states are choosing how to respond. In Wisconsin, the state election commission responded to a DOJ request for the voter registration list with instructions on how to request public voter data.
Arizona Secretary of State Adrian Fontes, a Democrat, responded on June 2 — after DOJ in a May 20 letter told the state to ensure voter registration applicants provided a driver’s license number, if they have one, instead of a partial Social Security number. The DOJ also wanted Arizona to check voters against a state database to look for noncitizens.
Fontes replied that Arizona complies with federal law and conducts checks using a state motor vehicle division database.
“We are focused on dealing with DOJ in a good faith manner while ensuring we are following the letter of federal and state laws,” Fontes spokesperson JP Martin wrote in an email to Stateline.
More recently, Arizona received a letter July 10 from DOJ about implementation of Trump’s elections executive order. Rhode Island Democratic Secretary of State Gregg Amore also received an email about the order the same day, according to a copy provided to the Rhode Island Current.
In the email, Scott Laragy, principal deputy director in the Executive Office for United States Attorneys, asks for a call to discuss a possible information-sharing agreement to provide DOJ with information on individuals who have registered to vote or have voted despite being ineligible, or those who have committed other forms of election fraud.
The email echoes the language in Trump’s elections executive order, which calls for DOJ to reach information-sharing agreements with states. While much of the order, which focused on proof of citizenship in elections, has been struck down in federal court, provisions related to information sharing remain.
The executive order directs Bondi, the U.S. attorney general, to prioritize enforcement of federal “election integrity laws” in uncooperative states. It also requires her to review grants and other DOJ funds that could be withheld from states that resist.
Some states have already struck deals with the Trump administration. Indiana Republican Secretary of State Diego Morales announced an agreement last week with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services allowing the state to access a database to verify the citizenship of registered voters. Alabama Republican Secretary of State Wes Allen has signed a similar agreement.
“With your cooperation, we plan to use this information to enforce Federal election laws and protect the integrity of Federal elections,” Laragy wrote to Rhode Island.

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)In the past few years, a certain segment of South Dakota society has become adamant about making specific improvements in the way we live.
Is this a citizen quest for more education funding? No. Is it a movement to put often overlooked Native American issues at the front of the state agenda? No. Is it a grassroots effort to revamp the way South Dakotans pay taxes? No.
This effort is aimed at cleaning up the state’s elections. “Hold on,” you might say. “I didn’t know there was a problem with our elections.” Well, there isn’t. But that isn’t keeping the issue from being front and center at the Legislature and in county commission meetings across the state.
In the last legislative session there were more than 50 election-related bills introduced. About half of those had to deal with “election integrity” in the areas of voter qualification, technology and security. That’s a great deal of attention being paid to a part of government that, in the past, has been noted for working just fine.
Legislature seeks tighter limits on voter qualifications with host of ‘election integrity’ bills

Some of these bills may be duplicates. It has become a practice in the Legislature to introduce similar bills in the Senate and in the House. That way, if cooler heads prevail in the Senate, there’s still a similar bill in the House, where bad ideas go to flourish.
Spurring on the quest for election integrity is an entity called South Dakota Canvassing Group. The group’s mission statement is on its website: “We are a volunteer organization working to restore free, fair, transparent and secure elections in South Dakota, now and for future generations.”
Their work to “restore” elections in South Dakota implies that voting here has gone off the rails. If the Canvassing Group wants to ferret out corruption and illegalities in elections, they’re best off moving to another state. South Dakota, with a history of fair elections, doesn’t need their help.
According to a story by The Dakota Scout, many of the election integrity chasers in this state got their inspiration at a three-day event in Sioux Falls. It turns out that their North Star, their inspiration, their muse, is none other than Mike Lindell. He’s not just the My Pillow guy; he’s the My President’s Election was Stolen guy.
Lindell was, and continues to be, one of the staunchest supporters of the idea that Donald Trump was somehow cheated out of victory in the 2020 election. At his 2021 “Cyber Symposium” in Sioux Falls, Lindell spent so much time offering false claims about Dominion Voting Systems throwing the election to Joe Biden that he was recently sued for defaming one of the company’s executives. The jury awarded the executive $2.3 million in damages.
Some bills backed by the Canvassing Group were approved by the Legislature and signed by the governor: assigning a federal-only ballot to people who don’t live permanently in the state, changing the definition of resident eligibility, designating county voter registration files as public records, changing the process for challenging someone’s residency status, increasing the penalty for voting illegally, placing citizenship status on driver’s licenses, and sending a constitutional amendment to voters clarifying that a person must be a U.S. citizen to vote in the state.

However, just as Lindell continues to spout his falsehoods about the 2020 election, look for the Canvassing Group to keep up the pressure on legislators for more election integrity laws that aren’t needed. On its website, the top issue on the group’s want list is an effort to make Election Day a holiday. In the last session, this came to the Legislature in a bill sponsored by Dell Rapids Republican Tom Pischke.
Pischke explained to the Senate State Affairs Committee that a holiday was needed because in some communities there are not enough poll workers nor enough polling places. He said he hoped to work on solutions to those problems without legislation, asking the committee to table the bill.
Creating a Tuesday Election Day holiday might free up more people to work on the elections, but it could just as easily cut down on voter participation. Instead of looking ahead to how they’ll mark their ballots, citizens could just as easily be looking ahead to using a vacation day on Monday to create a long weekend.
South Dakota has a long history of running fair, accurate elections. For all their finger-pointing and hand-wringing, the Canvassing Group and the legislators who indulge them can’t change that. Election integrity legislation amounts to nothing more than solutions in search of problems, trying to fix a system that doesn’t need fixing.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/591A8322-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-19 23:06:07.323182

Line 5 stretches from Northwestern Wisconsin to Sarnia, Ontario, including a 4.5 mile stretch on the lakebed where Lake Huron and Lake Michigan meet. The pipeline transports more than 22 million gallons of crude oil and natural gas liquids through the Great Lakes daily, raising concerns amongst environmental advocates, who warn that an oil spill would carry catastrophic consequences.
Enbridge identified gaps in the pipelines protective coating in 2014, and the pipeline was later dented in three places by an anchor strike in 2018. The pipeline company later reached an agreement with the state to consolidate the dual pipelines currently operating in the Straits of Mackinac into a new segment housed in a concrete-lined tunnel and buried below the lakebed, in hopes of containing any potential oil spills.

In order to move forward with the project, Enbridge needs approval from three agencies, the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy, the Michigan Public Service Commission and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
While EGLE and the Public Service Commission have both approved permits for the project, a 2024 settlement between Enbridge, EGLE and the Bay Mills Indian Community requires the company to redo its water resources permit using the results of new wetlands surveys.
EGLE opened public comment on the company’s revamped wetlands protection and Great Lakes Submerged Lands permits on July 17, with the comment period to remain open through Aug. 29, 2025.
The department will also host two meetings throughout the public notice period: an information session on Aug. 12 in a Q&A format regarding the application and EGLE’s review process and a formal public hearing on Aug. 19, where comments will be taken for the record. Additional comments can be submitted online.
During this period EGLE said it would review the application and information provided by the applicant, collect and consider public comments, continue tribal consultations and continue coordinating with other agencies and partners.

During the public notice period, EGLE said it’s common for the department to request applicants to consider additional modifications to the project and provide additional information in response to the ongoing review and in coordination with other state agencies and parties.
“Enbridge’s commitment to safeguarding the Great Lakes, natural resources, and communities continues to drive our work behind building the Great Lakes Tunnel, and locating a new, replacement section of the Line 5 pipeline inside the protection of the tunnel, deep under the lakebed,” Enbridge Spokesperson Ryan Duffy said in an email.
“We support and welcome the public comment process now underway. Public and stakeholder input is essential to the process and we look forward to hearing feedback and answering questions,” he said.
As EGLE opens public comment on the permits, members of the National Wildlife Federation are demanding the department conduct a full review of Enbridge’s proposed drilling area as required by the Great Lakes Submerged Lands Act, pointing to concerns of tunnel collapse, explosion and pollution during the construction of the Line 5 tunnel.
“The Great Lakes Submerged Lands Act is in place to safeguard the Great Lakes and our natural resources from unnecessary projects that cause harm,” Beth Wallace, the federation’s Great Lakes climate and energy director said in a statement. “Any attempt to shortcut or narrow their review will only benefit the interest of big oil, could open a wide door for other extractive industries, and would undermine the legal standards meant to protect our public waters.”

(Mary Steurer/North Dakota Monitor)How do you get students to remember what they learn? According to Gladys Hawk, a citizen of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, you tell them a story.
Hawk is one of dozens of tribal elders featured on the North Dakota Department of Public Instruction’s Teachings of Our Elders website, which now boasts more than 350 videos.
In an interview played for educators at the Department of Public Instruction’s annual Indian Education Summit in Bismarck on Friday, Hawk spoke of the bedtime stories her grandmother would tell her in Lakota growing up. 
Hawk said at the end of each tale, her grandmother would tie in an important life lesson.
“She would say, ‘And that’s why I want you to be good — don’t be like this one in the story,’” said Hawk. “We have to listen to what our elders have to say, because usually they’re teaching us something important.”
Sharla Steever and Scott Simpson, who worked on the videos for North Dakota’s Native American Essential Understandings project, shared Hawk’s interview as one example of how attendees can integrate Native culture and history into the classroom.

“You can pull those stories in any time you want, if you want to focus in on a concept or a theme or something historical that the elder is speaking about,” Steever said of the Teaching of Our Elders videos.
Steever said in her experience, storytelling helps to create a sense of community in the classroom. Kids tend to retain information if they have a personal anecdote to connect it to, she said.
Under a law adopted by the state Legislature in 2021, K-12 schools in North Dakota are required to teach Native history. The website is one of a number of resources the Department of Public Instruction’s Office of Indian and Multicultural Education has developed that can support schools in this area, Steever said.
She said the Department of Public Instruction is still doing interviews with elders from time to time. However, it can be difficult to arrange.
While the agency likes to give elders who participate a stipend, there’s not a ton of funding available, Steever said.
“There’s never really been a budget for that,” she said. The department also has to squeeze in time for the interviews around its other work, she added.

Steever said she’s working on an additional set of video interviews with Sisseton-Wahpeton Oyate elders.
Haiden Person, a recent graduate from Bismarck High School and the conference’s youth speaker, said Friday that teaching more Native American culture and history in schools is key to combatting anti-Indigenous racism.
“They don’t know it’s wrong, you’ve just got to teach them,” said Person, a citizen of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe.
Person recently graduated from Bismarck High School and plans to attend United Tribes Technical College in the fall. Person said mental health is an issue close to his heart, and that he plans to become a psychiatrist.
The summit also welcomed Daniel Kish, an expert in human echolocation — using sound to locate objects — and president of World Access for the Blind, for a keynote address.
Kish has been blind since he was a year old. He said he gained the ability to echolocate because his parents wanted him to be self-sufficient despite his disability. He now helps teach the skill to other blind people.
“It’s an ability that provides you with awareness of the environment that’s way out beyond the length of your cane,” he said.
He said a broader goal of his is studying how people develop a sense of personal identity and agency. Kish said he appreciated hearing Person talk about mental health and the importance of leaning on others in your community.
“Haiden had it right, don’t be afraid to ask for help,” Kish said.

The same urgency, fresh-thinking and spirit being applied in other areas must drive school reform.","Students head to class in a 2022 file photo. A new book that divided Democrats over issues such as housing and transportation has not yet filtered down to school reform, but it needs to, writes Kalman Hettleman. (Photo by Michael Loccisano/Getty Images)A few weeks ago, I proposed mandatory summer school for low-performing students. I should have also prescribed summer reading for all interested in public policy and politics: the book “Abundance” by Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson, leading writers at the New York Times and The Atlantic respectively. It’s that good.
But not so good for liberals. In their No. 1 bestseller, they write, “Over the course of the twentieth century, America developed a right that fought the government and a left that hobbled it.”
They show, in voluminous detail, how liberals are chiefly responsible for the nation’s failure to build and grow in housing, environmental protection, transportation and health. Well-intentioned efforts to bring about reform in these areas have led to laws, lawsuits, regulations and other bottlenecks. Liberals believe in government, they add, “and then pass policy after policy hamstringing what it can actually do.”
In 2023, metro areas in San Francisco, Boston, New York and New Jersey together didn’t issue as many housing permits as Houston, where the median home costs around $300,000; in San Francisco, it’s $1.7 million.
On the environment, Klein and Thompson write, “well-meaning laws to protect nature in the twentieth century now block clean energy projects needed in the twenty-first.”  Another writer for The Atlantic (who has called Democrats “The Great Defenders of the Status Quo”) points out that environmental impact statement requirements have “ballooned from about 10 pages to hundreds, a process that now takes four years on average.”
On transportation, despite an all-out campaign since 1996 by California governors and U.S. presidents for high-speed rail across California, little has been built. “In the time California has spent failing to complete its 500-mile high-speed rail system,” Klein and Thompson write, “China has built more than 23,000 miles of high-speed rail.”
California is a poster child for our nation’s paralysis on infrastructure, but other politically blue states and cities have been just as bad, as “Abundance” documents.

And at the national level, witness the ill fate of President Joe Biden’s groundbreaking actions to build semiconductor manufacturing capacity and infrastructure. When he left office, writes veteran journalist Jonathan Chait, “only a fraction of the funds were spent … and of those, hardly any yielded concrete results.” Biden, and the nation, have paid a catastrophic political price.
It’s hardly a surprise that “Abundance” blowback has been swift, fierce and fratricidal. Chait describes “The Coming Democratic Civil War” over the abundance agenda. “[It] has set off clanging alarms on the left — it is a direct attack on the constellation of activist organizations … that control progressive politics and have significant influence over the Democratic party.”
David Dayen, editor of the progressive magazine The American Prospect, has called the abundance agenda an attack on basic democratic rights. Housing and environmental activists claim the role of communities in decision-making would be destroyed.
Of special note, Chait lists Maryland Gov. Wes Moore as among the top Democratic officials (New York Gov. Kathy Hochul and Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro among them) to be receptive to the abundance agenda.
Keep in mind, too, that Klein and Thompson (and Chait) are staunch liberals. (And on a personal note, I am a democratic socialist and ardent fan of Bernie, Elizabeth, AOC and the New York City phenom Zohran Mamdani.)
What does all the “Abundance” controversy have to do with public education? It’s not discussed in the book. But the leader of a prominent centrist education group thinks: “Nowhere is an abundance mindset more urgently needed than in K-12 education … It challenges the progressive status quo and calls for outcome-focused, innovation governance that produces rather than merely regulates.”
I have problems with “innovation” as a guiding principle for school reform (in my view, we need less innovation and more effective management of, and funding for, evidence-based best practices). But the idea of a different mindset is compelling.
How might that play out? In what ways are liberals sometimes their own worst enemy in public education? Why is it generally conceded that Democrats have lost the political high ground on public education to Republicans?
For one thing, liberals have failed to tack from the left to the center on popular issues like school choice (even with tax credits and vouchers excluded). For another, liberals have done little to nothing to assure that national, state and local school funding is well spent (the subject of my recent commentary).
It also means that ideological progressives have favored decentralization of school policy to the point of resistance to (a) national and state efforts to promote accountability and (b) evidence-based practices, most notably the science of reading.
Of course, on education, don’t be fooled for a minute: Missteps by Democrats are a minuscule fraction of what Republicans are doing to undermine public education altogether.
Turning back to the book, one flaw is that it does not propose corrective political actions. Though “Abundance” mentions general goals like zoning reform for housing and expedited permitting for infrastructure, Klein and Thompson concede that “Abundance” is “A Lens, Not a List.”
We can’t let it go at that. Liberals must fill in the political blanks. A turning point may have occurred June 30, when California ”rolled back a landmark law that was a national symbol of environmental protection before it came to be vilified as a primary reason for the state’s severe housing shortage and homelessness crisis.” “We’ve got to get out of our own damn way,” Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) said.

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)A group that advocates in favor of Alaska’s nonpartisan judicial system has filed a lawsuit against Gov. Mike Dunleavy, alleging that he illegally appointed a member to the board that nominates candidates for the state’s judicial vacancies.
The suit, filed Wednesday in Anchorage Superior Court by Alaskans for Fair Courts, claims Dunleavy violated the constitution and state law when he picked John W. Wood — also named as a defendant — for a public seat on the Alaska Judicial Council.
Under the state constitution, the council consists of three non-attorneys picked by the governor and three attorneys selected by the Alaska Bar Association. In addition, whoever holds the office of chief justice of the Alaska Supreme Court sits as the council’s chair.
The council accepts applications for judicial vacancies, vets those applicants for merit using nonpartisan metrics, then submits a list of nominees to the governor for final selection.
Wood was picked for a non-attorney seat on the board but is a former attorney, making him ineligible to serve, the suit alleges. In addition, the suit says Wood is ineligible because he held a “position of profit” with the state when appointed in May.
State records show Wood has served as a state contractor, receiving more than $132,000 this year. The most recent payment is listed as June 6.
Alaskans for Fair Courts also claims that Wood is ineligible because he has not been confirmed by the Legislature. 
Wood was appointed during this year’s legislative session, but after lawmakers had voted on confirmations for the year, the suit claims, meaning that Wood’s appointment should not be considered a recess appointment subject to confirmation next year.
“If the governor were to appoint a (judge) nominee selected by a judicial council that is not properly constituted … the resulting legal deficiency … could subject actions taken by the new judge to challenge by litigants,” the suit claims.
It asks that the Anchorage Superior Court issue an order declaring that Wood is ineligible, and that his appointment is void.
In a written statement, Attorney General Treg Taylor said the state hasn’t yet been served with the lawsuit and can’t comment on the merits.
About the timing issue, Taylor said, “The Governor has the ability to appoint three members to the Judicial Council, and the Alaska Bar Association appoints the other three members to provide a 50/50 balance on the Council. The Council then nominates judges for the Governor’s selection with any ties on the Council being broken by the Chief Justice. It is important that the Council have this balanced perspective as it moves forward with its work. Having to wait almost a full year before seating a Governor’s appointee, as the Alaskans for Fair Courts argues, upsets that balance and doesn’t seem so fair.”
Dunleavy has seemingly violated the state constitution’s judicial nomination process before. 
In 2019, he failed to appoint a judge under the timeline required by the constitution, which was part of the basis of a failed attempt to recall him from office. In 2021, he called for the council to add a nominee in addition to the three it had forwarded to him for a seat on the Supreme Court. The constitution does not allow governors to appoint someone from outside of the council’s list of nominees. He ultimately did by the constitutional deadline in that instance.

Then the raids happened,Alexei Koseff,,,,,https://calmatters.org/justice/2025/07/marijuana-immigration-raid/,"Federal agents arrested hundreds of workers after immigration sweeps at a California cannabis company, stoking fears that President Trump might target the marijuana industry.","In summary
Federal agents arrested hundreds of workers after immigration sweeps at a California cannabis company, stoking fears that President Trump might target the marijuana industry.


After massive federal raids last week at two Southern California cannabis farms, the United Farm Workers posted an urgent message to its social media accounts. Because weed remains illegal under federal law, the union advised workers who are not U.S. citizens to avoid jobs in the cannabis industry, even at state-licensed facilities.
“We know this is unfair,” the United Farm Workers wrote Monday, “but we encourage you to protect yourself and your family.”
The immigration enforcement operations at the Camarillo and Carpinteria facilities of Glass House Farms, one of the state’s largest licensed cannabis companies, have unsettled California’s legal industry, which feels more vulnerable than it has since voters approved recreational weed in 2016.
The chaotic scene has brought to the forefront simmering concerns that weed farms could become an easy target as President Donald Trump ramps up deportations, because simply working in the industry could provide the criminal pretext to arrest even a legal immigrant.
It has also resurfaced for many industry veterans traumatic memories of raids during the “war on drugs,” raising alarms that the Trump administration may be hardening its stance against what remains a federally illegal substance.
“There is a sense that the community has gotten a little complacent in our legalization bubbles,” said Caren Woodson, senior director of compliance and licensing for Kiva Brands and the board president of the California Cannabis Industry Association. “We’re definitely in a moment of uncertainty.”

The fears of California cannabis growers had largely faded in recent decades, since voters legalized medical marijuana in 1996 and its recreational use in 2016. The legal market was nearly $4.9 billion last year and employed an estimated 83,000 people, though its growth is precarious as it struggles to compete with a stubbornly robust illicit industry.
But any sense of ease was snapped by the immigration raids last week, which were tied to alleged labor violations by Glass House Farms. Federal authorities ultimately reported more than 360 arrests of people they suspected of being in the country illegally and the recovery of 14 immigrant minors. Glass House Farms did not respond to emailed questions.
“There is absolutely heightened risk working for a cannabis facility. It shouldn’t be that way,” Woodson said. “Folks should be aware of that risk and we should be prepared as an industry to manage that risk.”
The Trump administration has not given an indication whether those operations were an isolated incident or a reflection of shifting enforcement priorities on cannabis. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration did not respond to emailed questions.
Advocates had hoped that Trump might finally lead the way on loosening federal restrictions on cannabis. Yet since suggesting during his campaign last fall that he would downgrade the classification of weed so that its medical uses can be more easily studied, Trump has made no moves toward rescheduling.
Other developments signal that momentum may be moving in the opposite direction. During his confirmation hearing, Trump’s nominee to lead the DEA would not commit to removing cannabis from the list of serious narcotics, and there is an ongoing effort in Congress to block its reclassification.

“We can’t take anything for granted,” Steph Sherer, executive director of the advocacy group Americans For Safe Access, warned industry members on a video call last week following the raids. “We’ve gotten dependent on this broader layer of support for medical cannabis that’s being tested right now.”
She suggested that growers learn how to read a search warrant, have a criminal lawyer on retainer and plan how they would pay for bail.
Not everyone believes it’s time to panic just yet. Some local members of the cannabis industry have noted that Glass House’s facilities are surrounded by other weed farms that were not raided by federal authorities, which could mean the operation was entirely unrelated to drugs.
The California Department of Cannabis Control subsequently confirmed that it was actively investigating a child labor complaint against the company.

A new state audit found that caused the agency to skip in-person inspections, even when workers were injured.","In summary
Nearly a third of Cal/OSHA positions were vacant last year. A new state audit found that caused the agency to skip in-person inspections, even when workers were injured.


California’s worker safety agency is under-inspecting workplaces after accidents and worker injuries, failing to enforce labor regulations in a way that “may undermine” them because it does not have enough employees to do the inspections, a state audit found. 
In a review of the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health published Thursday, state auditors found understaffing was a primary factor leading inspectors to skip in-person inspections of worksites even in cases where auditors found — and division managers agreed — it was likely warranted. 
Nearly one-third of the division’s 800-plus positions were vacant last year, a rate that is even worse in some district offices and among some of the staff responsible for inspections and enforcement. 
“When it does perform inspections, Cal/OSHA’s process has critical weaknesses,” state auditor Grant Parks wrote. 
The weaknesses, he wrote, included inspectors failing to review employers’ required injury prevention plans, document notes from interviews with workers, initiate inspections quickly and ensure employers had addressed alleged hazards before closing a case file.
State law allows Cal/OSHA to inspect workplaces in-person proactively, after accidents or in response to a complaint. But it only mandates inspections for workplace deaths or “serious” accidents, generally defined as those requiring inpatient hospital care or resulting in “serious permanent disfiguration.”
Enforcement staff first determine if the complaints are valid, and then often choose to inspect “by letter” instead, which involves writing to employers asking them to investigate the complaints themselves and document how they’ve addressed hazards. 
Last year out of more than 12,000 complaints, the agency found 87% valid; staff inspected just 17% of those workplaces in person rather than investigating “by letter.” Out of 5,800 workplace accidents, the agency deemed 42% serious enough to send an inspector. 
Auditors found staff didn’t always investigate a complaint or inspect a worksite when they should have.
In one case, a union representative filed a complaint saying that construction workers were riding on heavy machinery on the road with no seat belts, and another worker was hanging off the side of the vehicle, in danger of falling and being hit in oncoming traffic. Cal/OSHA declined to investigate because the incident was on a public road and therefore outside the agency’s jurisdiction. But the audit found the agency should have opened the complaint because workers were riding in a company vehicle — activity covered by workplace safety regulations.
Auditors reviewed another complaint from a kitchen worker who was taken to the ER by ambulance, possibly from heat illness. The worker reported poor ventilation, broken air conditioning and temperatures that reached 90 degrees indoors. Despite agency policies requiring on-site inspections for serious hazards involving current employees, and for any heat-related complaints, Cal/OSHA sent the employer a letter. Auditors reviewing the case records found the employer had not responded. 
Serious injuries investigated by letter
The audit also highlighted two injuries that Cal/OSHA said weren’t “serious” enough to inspect in person; in one, a worker was cut by a chainsaw, requiring surgery and an overnight hospital stay, and in another a worker was knocked out when hit in the head and suffered a skull fracture, but was not formally admitted to the hospital. 
In the chainsaw case, managers told auditors the worker was wearing protective equipment so there was less reason to suspect workplace violations. In general, the audit found that managers overwhelmingly reported understaffing as the reason for not inspecting.
The agency, the audit noted, doesn’t have a complaint form on its website. To file a complaint, workers must call or email a Cal/OSHA district office, or fill out a complaint form on the federal OSHA website.  
The audit places further pressure on Cal/OSHA and its beleaguered parent agency, the Department of Industrial Relations, to deal with a trenchant staffing problem that advocates and lawmakers say renders some of the strictest worker protections in the nation toothless. 
It comes a year after a similar audit of the Labor Commissioner’s Office, also a part of that department, which found workers complaining to the agency about wage theft were waiting more than two years on average to get their claims resolved — six times longer than the time required by law. 
Both audits were ordered by state lawmakers, who are by now familiar with the understaffing complaints. One bill this year would require the department to study how to make more appealing career paths for the inspector positions, some of which require engineering degrees.
Stephen Knight, director of the advocacy group Worksafe, called the audit’s findings “really disappointing.”
“It confirms that California’s promise to hold employers accountable remains unfulfilled,” Knight said. “There’s a lot of good solid detail and suggestions in the audit, nothing they couldn’t have figured out beforehand. Certainly what it would require is resources and political leadership that sides with workers over corner-cutting employers.”
The problem is urgent, he said, noting workplace accidents have killed three teenagers in California just the past two weeks: one who fell into a meat grinder at a burrito factory in Los Angeles County and two who died in a fireworks warehouse explosion in rural Yolo County.
The workplace agency has been the subject of several investigations in recent years. Last year the Sacramento Bee found the division of Cal/OSHA that recommends cases for criminal prosecution was so understaffed it couldn’t even consider cases in which workers suffered severe but nonfatal accidents, such as ones that caused paralysis. CalMatters last year reported that the agency’s inspections and citations of heat-related hazards had plummeted since the pandemic, despite the rising risks of extreme heat for outdoor workers. 
In a letter dated June 27 responding to the audit, Department of Industrial Relations director Katrina Hagen wrote that the department “has been working to address structural and process issues, as well as recruitment and retention issues,” including studying the agency’s pay and job responsibility levels. Hagen wrote that Cal/OSHA’s vacancy rate had dropped to 12% this year; the auditor responded they hadn’t seen up-to-date data showing that. 
Hagen also wrote that Cal/OSHA is working on making an online complaint form, and said the agency is getting a new case management system that will flag cases that should have gotten an in-person inspection, but didn’t. Both upgrades, she wrote, are expected in 2027.
‘What’s the point?’
The audit also questioned Cal/OSHA’s practice of reducing the fines it issued to employers after citing them for safety violations. Employers often appeal citations, a process that can take years to resolve, and the fines or violations can be reduced during settlement conferences, but the auditors wrote that the reasons aren’t always documented. In a four-year period reviewed by auditors, the average reduction was more than half the original fine. 
Assembly Labor Committee Chair Liz Ortega, a Hayward Democrat who requested the audit last year, slammed the practice. 
“This Cal/OSHA standard operating procedure can stop TODAY,” she wrote in response to a query from CalMatters. “Injuries won’t abate until there are consequences. If Cal/OSHA won’t do it, we should get  someone who will.”
She said she wanted to see the agency increase its referrals for criminal prosecution to 5% of serious cases this year, and called the investigations that don’t include in-person inspections “fake.”
“Sending a letter!!!” Ortega wrote. “What’s the point?”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/070125-Farmworker-Harvest-LV-CM-54.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-19 23:06:07.323182

Generations of survivors of the federal government’s nuclear testing program and the state’s uranium mining industry have waited for years for recognition from the United States as they watched their friends and families die from cancers.
The 1990 federal Radiation and Exposure Compensation Act — created to provide restitution to people sickened by exposure to radiation and uranium — excluded New Mexico’s downwinders and post-1971 uranium miners, and expired last year after years of lobbying for expansion by victims and New Mexico’s elected leaders. New Mexico Democratic U.S. Sen. Ben Ray Luján, for instance, began introducing RECA legislation when he was first elected to the U.S. House in 2008, and did so so every year since.
Just last month, Luján, other members of the state’s congressional delegation and long-time advocates held a news conference to call for RECA’s renewal once again. Over the years, the coalition calling for RECA’s expansion and extension has grown across states and become a bipartisan effort. In the end, Republican U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri got it over the finish line as a provision in President Donald Trump’s massive tax and spending bill.
Advocates and New Mexico officials say while RECA’s passage is worthy of celebration, more remains to be done.
“It was quite a relief, because we’ve waited so long,” said Tina Cordova, founder of the Tularosa Basin Downwinders Consortium, during a news conference last week. The documentary film First We Bombed New Mexico highlights Cordova’s 20-year fight for justice for New Mexico’s downwinders. “Honestly, the acknowledgement is long past due,” she said. “But I also want to recognize…that we’re not there yet. We still have a lot of work to do.”
RECA’s two-year expansion “will not be long enough for us to get everybody enrolled that should be enrolled,” Cordova said. The bill also provides $100,000 lump sum payouts but no longer includes health care coverage. “We will take the win, and we will continue our fight,” Cordova said. “And we will also never forget that there are some very important people that have been left out: the people of Guam, the people of Colorado, the people of Montana, the remainder of Arizona and Nevada.” While grateful New Mexico was included, she said, “we will continue to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with our sisters and brothers from those places who we’ve come to love.”
Luján and Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) last week also sent letters to U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi and Secretary of Labor Lori Chavez-DeRemer urging both to issue guidance quickly for RECA given the short timeline for compensation.
Later on Wednesday, a sign dedication will take place at the entrance to the Trinity site, placing a marker there “acknowledging the sacrifice and suffering of the people of New Mexico as a result of the Trinity bomb,” Cordova said. A mass in the evening in Tularosa will include the annual candlelight vigil and reading of the names of the people who are no longer here. Source will have coverage from both events.
In advance of the 80th anniversary, Luján issued a statement about the anniversary, characterizing it as “eight decades of pain, loss, and injustice for the victims still living with the fallout of nuclear testing and uranium mining…As we reflect on the lasting harm caused by these tests and the government’s negligence, we must renew our commitment to the people still suffering today. That means doing everything we can to help them access the compensation they deserve. Together, we will keep fighting to make sure no one is left behind.”

Tina Cordova has relived the death of her father, Anastacio, many times over. In speeches before a handful of people, in phone conversations with reporters and when Luján commemorated her father on the Senate floor of Congress on March 7, 2024.

Anastacio’s story starts in Tularosa in 1945. He was just 4-years-old when the federal government detonated the first atomic bomb in the Jornada Del Muerto desert 45 miles away. Like many people living there, he drank water from open cisterns, ate local crops and hunted wildlife for food — all likely contaminated with ash from radioactive fallout.
Cordova’s voice only shakes a little as she recounts his death from 12 years ago: He whittled away to 125 pounds, the pain he was in, the months on a feeding tube. He was diagnosed with two rare oral cancers and prostate cancer — all compensable under RECA, except the program excluded the New Mexicans living downwind from the first-ever bomb.
Cordova, 64, said her dad’s death also gave her clarity. She’s a cancer survivor herself and founded the Tularosa Basin Downwinders Consortium in 2005 to advocate for southern New Mexicans impacted for generations by the legacy of Trinity.
“I chose to do this work. I know it’s my life’s work. I know I’m suited to do this work, and I’m grateful that I’ve had this opportunity,” she told Source NM.
  Tina Cordova attends an interfaith service remembering the Trinity Test on Sunday, July 13, 2025. ‘The government never warned us afterwards, never said we should be concerned,’ she told attendees. ‘But today, we have acknowledgement, and we have the beginnings of going back to the government for more, and we will do that.’ (Danielle Prokop/Source NM)
With the recent extension of RECA, her father will finally be recognized as a downwinder and her mother may finally receive compensation on his behalf.
“My dad should still be here;$100,000 pales in comparison to who he was, and who he used to be to us,” she said. “I don’t want to sound ungrateful, I don’t want to minimize what it means, but that’s not justice. That’s the beginning of justice — it’s a step forward in the right direction.”
Cordova said she’ll take the fight back to Congress to expand benefits to states and territories that were left out and require the government to pay to cover health care costs for people exposed.
She said that in the last year, her niece was diagnosed with thyroid cancer and her youngest brother with kidney cancer.
“This just doesn’t end for us,” Cordova said. “These are the people that we can never stop fighting for. These are the people that we can never allow to be forgotten, to just basically be treated as the human collateral damage.”
 Larry and Arlene Juanico

Just under the mesa, past the horno outside of Arlene Juanico’s childhood home, lie the remains of the Jackpile uranium mine, once the largest in the world. Nearly 60 miles outside of Albuquerque, the holes appear on Laguna Pueblo lands between the red and white striated mesas, nearly abutting the little village of Paguate.

With the rush for nuclear arms during the Cold War and the domestic expansion of nuclear power, the federal government was seeking to purchase uranium. A thick belt of ore snaked from Navajo Nation lands through Grants and into Laguna Pueblo. The mine operated from 1951 to 1984, marring the landscape. Tracks from the trucks wind through the valley. Entire mesas now have a terraced effect from the strip-mining. After the rain, there comes the smell: a sharp, metallic smell of uranium.
Life in the village before the closure was punctuated by blasts from the mine site, scattering light yellow dust across the landscape.
“When they blasted, everything shook, our homes rattled,” she said. “Often the ladies would run out to get the laundry, get whatever meat or fruit would be drying in the yards.”
Like her father and brother  — who later died from cancers — Arlene Juanico worked at the mine. She drove the water truck on the narrow roads, making good money at what she thought was a good job for a single mother. Her husband Larry Juanico also worked at the mine, then transferred to the Bluewater Mill, where the ore was processed into yellowcake uranium, with minimal safety precautions. People packed uranium into 55-gallon drums with their bare hands. He’d have to clean bins by climbing into them and scrubbing them with a brush, no masks, no suits.
Since they worked after 1972, the Juanicos and other uranium miners and millers did not qualify for RECA, even as many died or were sickened by exposure from radiation. But even now, the recognition or compensation from RECA is paltry to the devastation left by the mine, he said.
“Our people, our animals, our culture, our way of life are all affected by what’s happened here. The money part of it is good, but it’ll only last for a certain amount of time,” Larry Juanico said. “After all that’s gone — we’ll still be dealing with this.”
After the mine’s closure, the waste it left behind leaked uranium and other metals into the surface water and released radon, a cancer-causing gas, into the air and people’s homes. Clean up by the federal government remains unfinished.

The Juanicos said federal efforts to restart uranium mining in the area are insulting to the people sickened by exposure.
“They haven’t been taking care of us, but they want to start new mines,” Arlene Juanico said. “That will force the next generation to still fight for what the federal government still hasn’t lived up to.”
 Paul Pino

Paul Pino, a retired schoolteacher, was in a daze for several days after Congress passed RECA on July 3, saying the July 4th weekend passed in a haze.
“I’m feeling two very different things,” he said. “On one hand, totally ecstatic, like over the moon, the best feeling of victory and happiness I’ve ever had in my life. On the other, I feel terrible for the people who’ve been left out from the bill; they needed the compensation also.”

Pino was born nine years after Trinity, but his mother, big brother and two older sisters were living on his family’s Carrizozo ranch, only 54 miles from the test site. His mother survived bouts of skin cancer, but died from bone cancer – selling her pickup to pay for her funeral costs just before her death. His older brother Greg died from stomach cancer, while one sister had breast cancer and the other suffered from several brain tumors.
“It was 100% devastation to my family,” he said.
Pino joined the steering committee at the Tularosa Basin Downwinders Consortium to fight for compensation for New Mexicans impacted by Trinity.
“All my life, plus more, people in New Mexico still have been waiting for some peace,” he said. “They got it on the 80th anniversary. It’s better late than never, you know?”
Pino performs a song titled “It Ain’t Over ‘til We Win,” about the downwinders’ struggle. He recently changed the lyrics of the last line: “Yeah we won, and it’s still not over.”
“But that’s all right,” he said. “You know it’ll be a good fight.”
 Phil Harrison

Uranium mining was supposed to be a good job, not a death sentence. But for hundreds of people on the Navajo Nation, it was just that, said former uranium miner Phil Harrison.
“There was no warning of the dangers,” Harrison told Source NM. “They took advantage of us.”

Harrison, 74, is an advocate with the Uranium Radiation Victims Committee, a grassroots group formed in the 1970s as rising deaths and injuries rose among Navajo Nation uranium workers. He grew up in Cove, Arizona where 32 Ker-McGee Corporation mines operated from the 1940s to the 1980s. He was an underground uranium worker and remediated sites near Tuba City.
He lost his father at age 44 to lung cancer, after 20 years working in the mines. His father was part of a spate of men on the Navajo Nation dying from lung diseases and various cancers, 400 former uranium workers died in Cove and Red Valley alone.
“It wasn’t just the miners. Spouses and children who were also getting contaminated and exposed to radiation,” he said.
The grassroots group was one of the first to file lawsuits seeking compensation from the federal government, which led to Congress establishing RECA in 1990 and expanding the program in the 2000s.
The two-year window for the RECA expansion offers little time to collect the necessary documentation and visit doctors, sometimes out of state. For former uranium workers who are now eligible, that could mean difficulties since many rely on oxygen, are hospitalized or rely on assisted living and family caretakers.
“We have to get started right away,” he said. “Time is of the essence.”
 Bernice Gutierrez

Bernice Gutierrez, 80, nearly shares a birthday with the Trinity Anniversary, born in Carrizozo only eight days before the blast. Her family moved to Albuquerque just a few years after the test, but health concerns followed. Gutierrez documented 41 members of her family experiencing some form of sickness, including 23 members with cancers. Seven have died as a result, including her son from pre-leukemia in 2020.

She’s documented health issues among downwinders and their descendants post-Trinity test for more than a decade, volunteering with the Tularosa Basin Downwinders Consortium.
Gutierrez called the passage “bittersweet,” as the short extension of RECA came inside a bill that cuts food assistance and medical care programs for low-income residents, which New Mexico relies heavily on.
“If the Medicaid cuts come to pass, it’s going to put people here in a world of hurt,” she said.

Gutierrez said there’s only two short years to extend the program, while trying to enroll folks who never qualified before, meaning a lot of work for the volunteers ahead.
“It was not the victory that we had hoped for, but one that we’re happy to get. It’s a starting point for us, but a point that we will continue working on to change,” Gutierrez said.

The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development is preparing to shut down seven major investigations and cases concerning alleged housing discrimination and segregation, including some where the agency already found civil rights violations, according to HUD records obtained by ProPublica.
The high-profile cases involve allegations that state and local governments across the South and Midwest illegally discriminated against people of color by placing industrial plants or low-income housing in their neighborhoods, and by steering similar facilities away from white neighborhoods, among other allegations. HUD has been pursuing these cases — which range from instances where the agency has issued a formal charge of discrimination to newer investigations — for as many as seven years. In three of them, HUD officials had determined that the defendants had violated the Fair Housing Act or related civil rights laws. A HUD staffer familiar with the other four investigations believes civil rights violations occurred in each, the official told ProPublica. Under President Donald Trump, the agency now plans to abruptly end all of them, regardless of prior findings of wrongdoing.
Four HUD officials said they could recall no precedent for the plan, which they said signals an acceleration of the administration’s retreat from fair housing enforcement. “No administration previously has so aggressively rolled back the basic protections that help people who are being harmed in their community,” one of the officials said. “The civil rights protections that HUD enforces are intended to protect the most vulnerable people in society.”
In the short term, closing the cases would allow the local governments in question to continue allegedly mistreating minority communities, said the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retaliation. In the long term, they said, it could embolden local politicians and developers elsewhere to take actions that entrench segregation, without fear of punishment from the federal government.
HUD spokesperson Kasey Lovett declined to answer questions, saying “HUD does not comment on active Fair Housing matters or individual personnel.”
Three of the cases involve accusations that local governments clustered polluting industrial facilities in minority neighborhoods.
One concerned a protracted dispute over a scrap metal shredding plant in Chicago. The facility had operated for years in the largely white neighborhood of Lincoln Park. But residents complained ceaselessly of the fumes, debris, noise and, occasionally, smoke emanating from the plant. So the city allegedly pressured the recycling company to close the old facility and open a new one in a minority neighborhood in southeast Chicago. In 2022, HUD found that “relocating the Facility to the Southeast Site will bring environmental benefits to a neighborhood that is 80% White and environmental harms to a neighborhood that is 83% Black and Hispanic.” Chicago’s mayor called allegations of discrimination “preposterous,” then settled the case and agreed to reforms in 2023. (The new plant has not opened; its owner has sued the city.)
In another case, a predominantly white Michigan township allowed an asphalt plant to open on its outskirts, away from its population centers but near subsidized housing complexes in the neighboring poor, mostly Black city of Flint. The township did not respond to a ProPublica inquiry about the case.
Still another case involved a plan pushed by the city of Corpus Christi, Texas, to build a water desalination plant in a historically Black neighborhood already fringed by oil refineries and other industrial facilities. (Rates of cancer and birth defects in the area are disproportionately high, and average life expectancy is 15 years lower than elsewhere in the city, researchers found.) The city denied the allegations. Construction of the plant is expected to conclude in 2028.
Three other cases involve allegations of discrimination in municipal land use decisions. In Memphis, Tennessee, the city and its utility allegedly coerced residents of a poor Black neighborhood to sell their homes so that it could build a new facility there. In Cincinnati, the city has allegedly concentrated low-income housing in poor Black neighborhoods and kept it out of white neighborhoods. And in Chicago, the city has given local politicians veto power over development proposals in their districts, resulting in little new affordable housing in white neighborhoods. (Memphis, its utility and Chicago have disputed the allegations; Cincinnati declined to comment on them.)
The last case involved a Texas state agency allegedly diverting $1 billion in disaster mitigation money away from Houston and other communities of color hit hard by Hurricane Harvey in 2017 and toward more rural, white communities less damaged by the storm. The agency has disputed the allegations.
All of the investigations and cases are now slated to be closed. HUD is also planning to stop enforcing the settlement it reached in the Chicago recycling case, the records show.
The move to drop the cases is being directed by Brian Hawkins, a recent Trump administration hire at HUD who serves as a senior adviser in the Fair Housing Office, two agency officials said. Hawkins has no law degree or prior experience in housing, according to his LinkedIn profile. But this month, he circulated a list within HUD of the seven cases that indicated the agency’s plans for them. In the cases that involve Cincinnati, Corpus Christi, Flint and Houston, the agency would “find no cause on [the] merits,” the list reads. In the two Chicago cases and the one involving Memphis, HUD would rescind letters documenting the agency’s prior findings. Hawkins did not respond to a request for comment.
The list does not offer a legal justification for dropping the cases. But Hawkins also circulated a memo that indicates the reasoning behind dropping one — the Chicago recycling case. The memo cites an executive order issued by Trump in April eliminating federal enforcement of “disparate-impact liability,” the doctrine that seemingly neutral policies or practices could have a discriminatory effect. Hawkins’ memo stated that “the Department will not interpret environmental impacts as violations of fair housing law absent a showing of intentional discrimination.” Four HUD officials said such a position would be a stark departure from prior department policy and relevant case law.
The reversal on the Chicago recycling case also follows behind-the-scenes pressure on HUD from Sen. Jim Banks. In June, Banks, a Republican from Indiana, wrote a letter to HUD Secretary Scott Turner and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin in which he criticized the administration of President Joe Biden’s handling of the case as “brazen overreach.” Noting that the Chicago plant would supply metal to Indiana steel mills, Banks asked the Trump appointees to “take any actions you deem necessary to remedy the situation.” Banks did not respond to a request for comment.
That case and others among the seven had also received scrutiny from other federal and state agencies, including the EPA and the U.S. Department of Justice. The EPA declined to say whether it was still pursuing any of the cases. The DOJ did not respond to the same inquiry.
The case closures at HUD would be the latest stage in a broad rollback of fair housing enforcement under the Trump administration, which ProPublica reported on previously. That rollback has continued in other ways as well. The agency recently initiated a plan to transfer more than half of its fair housing attorneys in the office of general counsel into unrelated roles, compounding prior staff losses since the beginning of the year, four HUD officials told ProPublica.
The officials fear long-lasting ramifications from the changes. “Fair housing laws shape our cities, shape where housing gets built, where pollution occurs, where disaster money goes,” one official said. “Without them, we have a different country.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Eric-Turner-HUD-nominee-700x483-1.jpg,,,2025-07-19 23:06:07.323182

This story was originally reported by Grace Panetta of The 19th.  Meet Grace and read more of her reporting on gender, politics and policy.
A competitive U.S. Senate race is shaping up in Michigan, where Democratic Sen. Gary Peters’ retirement has opened up a seat in a key swing state.
The top contenders for the Democratic nomination are Rep. Haley Stevens, who was first elected to the U.S. House in 2018, and state Sen. Mallory McMorrow. McMorrow is seen as a rising star in the party who went viral and gained national attention in 2022 for a rousing, impassioned floor speech she gave rebuking a Republican lawmaker who, in a fundraising email, baselessly accused her of wanting to “groom” kindergarteners and “teach that 8-year-olds are responsible for slavery.”

Also running in the Democratic primary are state Rep. Joe Tate, former speaker of the Michigan House, and Abdul El-Sayed, the former Wayne County health director and 2018 candidate for governor.
On the Republican side, former Rep. Mike Rogers, who narrowly lost the 2024 Senate race to now-Sen. Elissa Slotkin, is running again. GOP Rep. Bill Huizenga is also expected to jump in the race.
Michigan is a perennial presidential battleground state: President Donald Trump won it in 2016, former Democratic President Joe Biden put the state back in the Democratic column in 2020 and Trump flipped it back in 2024. But over the last 30 years, the state has consistently elected Democrats to the Senate — the last time the state sent a Republican senator to Washington was 1994.
The state has long been a pipeline for women Democratic leaders, from former Sen. Debbie Stabenow and Rep. Debbie Dingell to Slotkin; Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a potential 2028 presidential candidate; Attorney General Dana Nessel; Rep. Hillary Scholten; and prominent progressive Rep. Rashida Tlaib. Rep. Lisa McClain, the Republican Conference chair in the House, also hails from Michigan.

If either Stevens or McMorrow wins the primary and the general, Michigan would add to the number of states represented in the Senate by two women simultaneously. There are currently four such states — Minnesota, New Hampshire, Nevada and Washington.
Republicans currently control the Senate by a three-seat majority, 53 to 47, and Senators serve six-year terms, meaning a third of the Senate is up every election cycle. For Democrats to win back the chamber in 2026, they’d need to hold competitive seats in states like Georgia and Michigan while flipping four GOP-held seats in Maine, North Carolina and even more Republican-leaning states like Ohio, Iowa, Nebraska and Texas.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/AMR_1009-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-19 23:06:07.323182

A 2025 survey of local election officials found concern about federal cuts to election security. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)Local election officials across the country fear the loss of federal support for election security, according to a new survey.
Sixty percent of local election officials expressed some level of concern, a survey by the Brennan Center for Justice found. The center, a left-leaning pro-democracy institute, surveyed 858 officials between mid-April and mid-May.
The concern comes as President Donald Trump has curtailed federal election security work. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, in March halted its election security work. A month earlier, the Department of Government Efficiency task force also fired 130 cybersecurity workers at the agency.
And Trump in April ordered an investigation into Christopher Krebs, a former agency director who had vouched for the security of the 2020 election, which Trump falsely claims was stolen.
Federal cuts mean election officials are going to need more financial support from state and local governments, said Lawrence Norden, vice president of Brennan’s Elections and Government Program. The federal government has the advantage of being able to see the “big picture” and more easily share information with election officials across the country, he said.
“That is going to be difficult for states to replicate,” Norden said. “It doesn’t mean it’s impossible, but they have to start rethinking how they’re sharing information about what they’re seeing with each other.”
Cybersecurity has long been a concern of states — and not just in elections. Only 22 of 48 states that participated in a voluntary 2023 cybersecurity review conducted by federal agencies met or exceeded recommended security levels.
In the Brennan survey, 36% of local election officials said they were very concerned about federal cuts to election security services, while 24% said they were somewhat concerned and 21% said they were a little concerned. Nineteen percent said they were not concerned at all.
Sixty-one percent of local election officials expressed some level of concern over cuts to the federal cybersecurity agency specifically, with 32% saying they were very concerned. The survey had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.

(Courtesy of Sam Eckler/UNO Gateway)OMAHA — The student commission in charge of elections at the University of Nebraska at Omaha invalidated this year’s winning ticket and disregarded the will of UNO’s student voters — an act almost inconceivable in U.S. elections but far more common on college campuses.
The short version: The candidates making up The Torch ticket defeated the opposing Unify UNO ticket by 33 votes, in a spring election with near-record turnout of 1,580 students. However, prior to the vote count’s release, Unify UNO requested that the student-run Election Commission disqualify 50 votes for The Torch.
UNO’s five-member student Election Commission went a step further and eliminated every vote The Torch received. That means Unify UNO assumed the mantle of student leadership at UNO – and the prominent advisory spot that the university has on the NU board of Regents — despite losing the popular vote.
Why votes were tossed
Why was the student body’s vote thrown out? The commission decided that private messages between students shared by The Torch created a false, libelous image of their opponents, causing students to believe Unify UNO candidates were puppets of the UNO administration and working to defund student organizations.
Although The Torch appealed, calling the messages an “expression of concern, not actionable libel,” the commission didn’t budge, anointing Unify UNO.
After the unusual election result, some students say they are wary of the new leadership. One student called the election egregious. Another called Unify UNO’s actions “not truly democratic.” The former chief of staff of the student body resigned in protest amid the fallout.
To top it off, the UNO Office of Student Life has opened an investigation to see if the final vote count was leaked to either ticket before the public release of the tally following what some described as an eerily specific request to throw out 50 student votes.
It’s happened before
However odd, student election shake-ups aren’t unique to UNO, having occurred on other campuses nationally. At Florida Atlantic University this spring, an election commissioner threw out every vote received by a group that won in a landslide because they handed out 50 T-shirts promoting the campaign on student union grounds.
Similarly, 10 years ago at the University of Kansas, student election results were overturned because one group gave out free Chipotle to prospective voters. The incident is cemented in KU history as “burrito-gate.”
UNO itself has faced close, controversial elections in the past, undergoing a near-identical turnout and down-to-the-wire vote in 2018. That year, one ticket was accused and later admitted to forging student signatures to reach the ballot.
Despite the forgery, the election commission refused to throw out the student body’s vote and declared the offending party the winners. One election commissioner at the time described the request to throw out student votes “pretty dang petty.”
Student reaction
UNO political science student Elaine Arko followed this spring’s election closely, saying she was “upset” about the decision to invalidate The Torch. Although Arko said the group broke some rules, she said she feels “the Election Commission is ignoring the student body.”
“I did think The Torch violate[d] what was in the rules for the election,” Arko said. “But is it fair for the Election Commission to basically decide the election because of that? Imagine if, in this past presidential election, some other body just decided that Kamala Harris won when it was clear that Donald Trump had won. People would be so upset over that.
“So why are we expected to go with it?”
Arko relayed the gravity of such decisions to the democratic process, saying student government elections may not carry the same consequences as local or national elections, but they’re “still important.”
Randy Adkins, a UNO political scientist who studies political campaigns and elections, said the effect on the perception of whether democracy has been upheld “depends on whether all parts of the process are followed.”
“The administration of elections is something that those who do the job take very seriously,” Adkins said. “Sometimes, however, things happen, and when that does, we can make changes to the law that will prevent issues from happening in future elections.”
Push for changes
Nate Ostdiek, who served as UNO’s chief of staff, said such changes are urgently needed at UNO. Ostdiek said he resigned amid concerns over then-student body president Ishani Adidam’s refusal to disclose information to this year’s election commission that he believed could have impacted the commission’s decision.
Appointed by student government leaders, the five election commissioners underwent a lengthy interview process to reach their positions. The process focused on communication, organization and integrity, said Camden Carmichael, who served on the UNO Election Commission this spring.
Carmichael said the group places a “heavy emphasis” on conducting fair, unbiased elections, with checks and balances to ensure a level playing field.
However, Ostdiek said he believed the Election Commission lacked a “measure of consistency” in its decision. He called for UNO’s Election Commission to set standards of evidence for allegations to be proven – and to require that complainants reach a higher threshold before invalidating a ticket or a vote.
Election Commission members declined to tell The UNO Gateway more about their decision beyond the reasons they laid out in writing: that they believed The Torch deliberately attempted to destroy Unify UNO’s reputation through false narratives.
Ostdiek said the decision left the student body lacking answers — another student government election ending with questions.
“In my opinion, I don’t think that election by invalidation is a proper way [to end an election],” Ostdiek said. “I don’t really think it was fair.”

[[...]","Nathan Heffel and Grace Hood rehearse their Colorado Public Radio public affairs program in Centennial, Colo., in 2017. (Andy Cross/The Denver Post via Getty Images)The U.S. Senate narrowly approved on July 16, 2025, a bill that would claw back federal funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which distributes money to NPR, PBS and their affiliate stations. The $9 billion rescission package will withdraw $1.1 billion Congress had previously approved for the CPB to receive in the 2026 and 2027 fiscal years. In addition, it makes deep foreign aid cuts. All Democrats present voted against the measure, joined by two Republicans: Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. The House, which approved a previous version, voted early Friday in favor of the Senate’s version of the bill.
 
What will happen to NPR, PBS and local stations?
NPR and PBS provide programming to local public television and radio stations across the country. The impact on them will be direct and indirect.
Both NPR and PBS receive money from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, an independent nonprofit corporation Congress created in 1967 to receive and distribute federal money to public broadcasters. More than 70% of the money it distributes flows directly to local stations. Some stations get up to half of their budgets from the CPB.
But NPR and PBS receive much of their funding from foundation grants, viewers’ and listeners’ donations, and corporate underwriting. And local public radio and TV stations also get support from an array of sources besides CPB.
Only about 1% of NPR funding, and 15% of PBS funding, comes directly from the government via the CPB. However, once local radio and television stations lose federal funding, they’ll be less able to pay NPR and PBS for the programs they produce.
The nearly 1,500 public media stations in the U.S. rely on a mix of NPR, PBS and third-party producer programming, such as American Public Media and PRX, for the programs they offer. Local stations also produce and air regional news and provide emergency broadcasts for the government.
In rural areas with few broadcast stations and spotty cellphone coverage, public broadcast stations are vital sources of information about important community news and updates during emergencies. Federal support is essential for the programming and day-to-day operations of many local stations and allows for the maintenance of equipment and personnel to operate these vital community resources.
We believe that stations in communities that most need them, especially in rural locations, would be hit especially hard because they rely heavily on CPB funding.
 
Why are Republicans taking this step?
Public broadcasting has long been a target of conservative Republicans. They say that with a highly diversified media landscape, the public no longer needs media that is subsidized by federal dollars. They also claim that public broadcasting has a liberal bias and taxpayers should not be required to fund media that slants to the left politically.
 
Why is public media necessary when there’s news on the internet?
As journalism revenue has plummeted, public broadcasting has remained a vital source for news in communities across the nation. This is especially true in rural communities, where economic and political pressures have threatened the survival of local journalism.
In addition, with much online news coverage placed behind paywalls, public radio and television plays an important role in making quality journalism available to the American public.
 
Why did Congress approve these funds 2 years ahead?

Public broadcasting has gotten roughly $550 million per year from the federal government in recent years. The CPB has always approved and designated those funds two years in advance, due to a provision in the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967, after Congress has voted to provide that money. The CPB then has distributed that funding primarily through grants to PBS and NPR affiliate stations to support their technical infrastructure, program development and audience research.
 
What are the consequences for Native communities?
Dozens of Native American stations are at risk of closing once the CPB is defunded. Native Public Media, a network of 57 radio stations and four TV stations, is a key source of news and information for tribal communities across the nation and relies on CPB support.
U.S. Sen. Mike Rounds, a South Dakota Republican, publicly stated that he secured an agreement with the White House to move $9.4 million in Interior Department funding to two dozen Native American stations. But there is no provision related to this promise within the legislation.

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Gov. Mike Dunleavy has vetoed a bill that would allow paramedics and other licensed emergency responders to provide treatment to injured police and rescue dogs.
Current state law permits non-licensed people to treat injured “operational canines,” but licensed providers are forbidden from helping because doing so would be considered veterinary medicine and a violation of their license. 
House Bill 70, from Rep. Calvin Schrage, I-Anchorage, was inspired by the death of an Alaska State Trooper canine during a 2017 police chase in Wasilla.
The Alaska House approved the bill by a 32-8 vote on April 28, and the state Senate followed suit with a 20-0 vote on May 20.
Some veterinarians lobbied against the bill, and in his veto message, the governor sided with those veterinarians, saying that the “veterinary community warns this approach blurs scopes of practices, increases liability exposure, and duplicates services already available.”
“Given the rarity of canine field emergencies, expanding state authority in this area is neither necessary nor prudent,” the governor wrote.
By phone, Schrage said he was “obviously disappointed” by the governor’s decision.
“This bill, in my view, was a common-sense piece of legislation to remove some red tape currently preventing our first responders from providing life-saving care to our police search and rescue dogs. And I thought it would have been a useful tool for our first responders to have, given that we have seen some of these critical first responder dogs actually pass away in traumatic circumstances in the past,” he said.
The veto of HB 70 could be overridden if 40 members of the 60-person Legislature agree to do so during the first five days of a special legislative session scheduled to begin Aug. 2 in Juneau.
Schrage said he isn’t sure whether he will seek an override.
“Overrides are a sensitive topic and fairly complicated, as we have a very limited opportunity to take those up, and I don’t want to bring a bill up that there isn’t broad support for overriding, so we’ll have to have further conversations on that topic and see how this plays out,” he said.
Of the 33 bills passed by the Legislature this year, the governor has vetoed seven and issued line-item vetoes to budget bills. Two passed bills have not yet been sent to his desk. Two others are awaiting his action. The remainder have become law.
Of the seven vetoes, one was sustained during the regular session and another was overridden. The five remaining vetoes, plus line-item budget vetoes, will be subject to consideration during the special session.

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)The U.S. House of Representatives voted overnight Thursday to strip more than $1.1 billion in previously budgeted money from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, putting the future of many of Alaska’s small public radio stations in doubt.
Among the congressional Republicans voting for the cut was Alaska Rep. Nick Begich III. The 216-213 vote means a proposal to cancel $9 billion in funding for foreign aid and public broadcasting will advance to the desk of President Donald Trump, who requested the cancellation.
Earlier in the week, Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, voted in favor of the cancellation in the Senate. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, voted against it. It passed through the Senate on a 51-49 vote. 
The cut will affect federal spending in the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1, but radio stations in the 49th state have already begun planning to lay off staff and cut programming.
A handshake deal organized by Sen. Mike Rounds, R-South Dakota, will transfer $9.4 million from the Interior Department to some public radio stations that serve Alaska Native and American Indian communities, but it isn’t yet clear how the money will be shared and which stations will receive it.
In 2024 — the most recent for which numbers are available —public media stations statewide received $12 million in Corporation for Public Broadcasting grants. 
Many of Alaska’s stations rely on federal funding to operate.
Though the effects of the cut will be disproportionately large in Alaska, Begich voted in favor of a prior version of the cancellation as well as the final version this week.
In a written statement, Begich said technology has advanced since the development of radio and Alaskans have embraced cellphones and satellite communications, and public radio is not as important as it formerly was.

(Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate)FAYETTEVILLE — A federal judge said he will decide soon whether to block implementation of a new state law requiring the display of the Ten Commandments in public schools, following a nearly nine-hour hearing Friday.
Act 573 of 2025 requires that “a durable poster or framed copy of a historical representation of the Ten Commandments” be “prominently” displayed in public school classrooms and libraries, public institutions of higher education, and public buildings and facilities maintained by taxpayer funds. 
Seven multifaith families with children in Arkansas public schools filed the lawsuit in federal court last month against the Fayetteville, Springdale, Bentonville and Siloam Springs school districts.
Arkansas parents file lawsuit over state law requiring Ten Commandments in schools

The complaint argues the new law violates the First Amendment’s protection of religious freedom. The law’s supporters contend the Ten Commandments have historical significance because they influenced the nation’s founders and the country’s legal system.  
The families asked the court to declare the law unconstitutional and requested a preliminary injunction that would apply only to the four Northwest Arkansas school districts. Attorneys for the state on Friday asked that if a preliminary injunction is granted, it be narrowly tailored to the affected students.
U.S. District Judge Timothy Brooks said he will issue a ruling before the law’s Aug. 5 effective date. 
Brooks has also yet to rule on two motions to dismiss the case, one from the school districts and one from Attorney General Tim Griffin, who was allowed to intervene in the case.  
“I will continue to vigorously defend Act 573,” Griffin said in a statement Friday evening.
The Northwest Arkansas school districts argued in a brief in support of their motion to dismiss that, according to the law, they’re not required to have displays of the Ten Commandments unless the districts or their school boards receive voluntary donations of funds or displays that comply with the law’s specifications. The districts said they had no plans to implement displays in the coming year because no donations, monetary or otherwise, have been made to the schools. 
In his motion to dismiss, Griffin argued that the plaintiffs lack standing. Because the plaintiffs have not yet seen these displays, their alleged injury is based on speculation, he said.
Arkansas Deputy Solicitor General Noah Watson echoed those comments Friday, arguing Brooks should not issue a preliminary injunction because it’s “guesswork at this stage” that plaintiffs will be harmed. It’s unknown if the districts will have posters or in what context they’ll be displayed, he said.
The plaintiffs’ attorneys argued there are efforts underway by third parties to make the posters available to districts.
Although the law becomes effective Aug. 5, the school districts argued there’s no deadline to comply because they can only comply if and when they receive contributions or displays. The law has no penalties for lack of compliance because some districts may never be able to comply, the brief states.
Districts’ attorney Marshall Ney said Friday that the districts aren’t trying to take “a vigorous position” on the law, and just want to return to educating students. 
“They want to teach the kids, they don’t want to be in this firestorm on an issue like this,” Ney said. “This is just a distraction for the school districts.”
The plaintiffs are represented by the American Civil Liberties Union of Arkansas, the ACLU, Americans United for Separation of Church and State, and the Freedom From Religion Foundation, with Simpson Thacher & Bartlett serving as pro bono counsel.

After Friday’s hearing, ACLU of Arkansas Legal Director John Williams told reporters that the danger of the new law is it aims to instill particular religious values.
“We think it’s exclusionary to tell certain students that because you don’t belong to this particular religion, that you’re excluded,” Williams said. “So we think it’s important to protect those rights of people who don’t believe in this version of the Ten Commandments.”
By mandating a Protestant version of the Ten Commandments be displayed, the law violates the First Amendment’s Establishment Clause prohibition against adopting an official position on religious matters, plaintiffs’ attorneys argued. 
They also said the law violates the First Amendment’s Free Exercise Clause, which guarantees that “Congress shall make no law … prohibiting the free exercise [of religion].” 
The Ten Commandment displays unconstitutionally coerce into religious observance students who will feel pressured into suppressing their own beliefs to avoid potential disfavor, plaintiffs’ lawyers argued. The law also impedes parents’ ability to guide their children’s religious development. 
Attorneys for the state repeatedly argued the law mandates a “nonsectarian” version and historical representation of the Ten Commandments.
Similar arguments were made during legislative hearings this spring. Sen. Jim Dotson, R-Bentonville, and Rep. Alyssa Brown, R-Heber Springs, sponsored Act 573, but the merits of the legislation were largely presented in committee by WallBuilders, a group “emphasizing the moral, Christian, and constitutional foundation on which our nation was built,” according to its website. 
Steven Green, the director of Willamette University’s Center for Religion, Law and Democracy who served as an expert witness at Friday’s hearing, said that, according to his research, the Ten Commandments were not foundational to the country’s founding documents or legal traditions. They contain values and principles about right and wrong that can be found in other societies and are not unique to the Ten Commandments, he said.  
Though attorneys disagreed on the historical nature of the Ten Commandments, they all agreed they do have religious ties. When Brooks questioned Arkansas legislators’ decision to approve the law, the state’s attorneys said they could not comment on the Legislature’s intent beyond the text of the law.
Brooks said it seemed “pretty obvious” that the Ten Commandments address ethics and moral issues, so it seems logical that the purpose is to aid in the moral development of students. 
“Why is that so hard to acknowledge?” he asked. 
Parents have filed lawsuits against laws similar to Arkansas’ in Louisiana and Texas. A federal appeals court blocked Louisiana’s law last month. Plaintiffs in that case are represented by the same counsel as the Arkansas lawsuit.

The new manufacturing facility for large solid rocket motors will be located in Camden, where L3Harris subsidiary Aerojet Rocketdyne has operated since 1979. Estimated cost will be about $500 million, the company said.
The facility will add roughly 50 new jobs, an Arkansas Economic Development Commission press release said.
In a post on X, formerly Twitter, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the state “is proud to build the arsenal of democracy and protect our country and allies!”
The AEDC release also noted that L3Harris representatives met with Arkansas officials during Sanders’ trip to the Paris Air Show in June to secure the expansion.
A trip Sanders made to the Paris Air Show in 2023 resulted in an announced construction of a $33 million missile factory in Camden that is a joint venture between Raytheon Technologies and Israel-based Rafael Advanced Defense Systems.
According to an L3Harris press release, the planned rocket motor facility will have “more than 20 buildings across 110 acres” and will add more than 130,000 square feet of manufacturing space to the company’s existing 2,000 acre production site.
The company anticipates the added facilities will “provide a six-fold increase in manufacturing capacity.” It expects construction on the expansion to start this year, with first production slated for 2027.
The expansion is part of L3Harris’ modernization program following its acquisition of Aerojet Rocketdyne and the U.S. government’s attempts to develop an expanded homeland missile defense shield dubbed Golden Dome, according to Reuters.
U.S. Rep. Bruce Westerman, a Republican who represents the Camden area, applauded the move, calling it “Great news” for his district in a post on X.
“This expansion in Camden will continue to solidify the Natural State’s mark in defense manufacturing. Support many hardworking Arkansans, and maintain our nation’s position as a global leader in aerospace and defense,” he wrote.

Officials who oversee the Wyoming Game and Fish Department heeded the requests of houndsmen who’ve asked wildlife managers to ease up heavy hunting pressure on the big cats.
The post Game and Fish commissioners shrug off pressure, reverse hike in hunting Laramie Mountains lions appeared first on WyoFile .","Last winter in Cheyenne, Rep. Jeremy Haroldson told stories of seeing more mountain lions in the high country near his home: the Laramie Mountains.  
The Republican pastor from Wheatland recounted personal sightings of the stealthy large carnivores while testifying in support of a bill that sought unlimited, year-round mountain lion hunting — effectively stripping the Wyoming Game and Fish Department of the authority to manage the species. The proposal, led by Pinedale Republican Rep. Mike Schmid, ran into overwhelming opposition and died early in the legislative process. 
Five months later, the Game and Fish Department held a “special meeting” in Wheatland — where Haroldson lives — “in an effort to address community concerns” related to the lions, according to a press release.  
Draft regulations for Wyoming’s mountain lion hunt that were up for discussion at the meeting called for increases in the two hunt areas that sprawl over the Laramie Range, where Haroldson reported seeing an uptick in lions. 
Despite those concerns, the Wyoming Game and Fish Commission on Wednesday took the rare step of overriding a hunting season proposal brought to them by the department. The rescission of the quota hike was a motion from Commissioner John Masterson, a Casper attorney.

“To my friends at the department, especially those who are experts, I respect your work. I’m not throwing it out the window,” Masterson said during the Casper meeting. “But [in] those two areas, [the increase] just gives me the heebie-jeebies.” 
Masterson didn’t otherwise seek to amend Wyoming’s mountain lion regulations, which have tilted toward heavier and heavier hunting over the past two decades. But his motion to undo planned changes in the Laramie Mountains was unanimously agreed to by other commissioners. 
The commission’s undoing of planned lion hunting hikes in the Laramie Range came after Masterson and others heard from houndsmen who run their dogs in the region. Dan McRady, vice president of the Wyoming Houndsmen Association, told commissioners that in his “home range” between Laramie and Cheyenne, he went from finding plenty of cats to watching them get “hammered” in the years after COVID. 
“They were killing everything they were catching,” McRady said. 
Aaron Kirlin, a Wheatland outfitter, suggested to commissioners that the planned quota hikes in the Laramie Mountains were rooted in anecdote. 
“I think a lot of these proposals come from pressure from landowners that have seen pictures on trail cams of multiple cats at a water tank, or something along those lines,” Kirlin said.

But from his point of view, there’s a “concerning” lack of animals. Houndsmen are putting 1,500 miles on vehicles between cutting lion tracks, he said. 
Haroldson, the state representative, told WyoFile that he didn’t take the Game and Fish Commission’s decision to maintain the status quo and undo the Laramie Mountain lion hunting hikes personally. 
“My goal is not to have a fight with Game and Fish,” he said. “But at the same time …  I’d love to see a lot more boots on the ground and less computer programs telling us what the cats are doing.”

Haroldson’s overall aim in wanting to target more mountain lions is to help mule deer, he said.
“I think that it’s just vitally important that we preserve, protect and defend our mule deer populations at all costs,” he said. 
But Game and Fish’s data-packed triennial mountain lion report suggests that Wyoming’s heavy hunting of the big cats might be hurting deer by driving down the average age of lions on the landscape. Mountain lion biologist Justin Clapp explained to commissioners how that could be so. 
“Younger animals tend to almost exclusively eat deer,” Clapp said. “These cats that are 2, 3, 4 years old in the Casper area, 60-70% of their diet was mule deer, which is expected. As we shift toward 5-, 6-, 7-, 8-year-old cats, almost 70% of their diet was elk.”

The law went into effect immediately, with the rate for the rest of 2025 set at the 10% maximum, as 7% plus inflation equaled 10.8%. 
Going forward, the Department of Commerce will announce the annual rent limit each July. The timing is based on the release of inflation data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Rent hikes of any degree aren’t allowed in the first year of a tenancy under Washington’s landmark law. But landlords can set rent however they please when the tenant moves in.
The cap doesn’t apply to all homes. For example, new construction is not covered for its first 12 years. Public housing authorities, low-income developments, and duplexes, triplexes and fourplexes in which the owner lives in one of the units are also exempt.
For manufactured homes, increases are capped at 5%.
If a landlord raises rent above the caps without an exemption, the renter must give the landlord a chance to fix the error or can terminate their lease with 20 days’ notice. A tenant or the state attorney general can bring litigation to enforce compliance. The attorney general can recover up to $7,500 per violation.
The legislation was one of the most divisive this session in Olympia. Progressives had initially pushed for a hard 7% limit, but ran into opposition from moderate Democrats. 
Democrats hope the compromise provides a modicum of predictability to renters. Republicans fear it’ll chill development and price out small landlords who won’t be able to keep up with maintenance costs without the flexibility to raise rents as they wish.
Under the law, the limit on rent increases will remain in effect until 2040.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/apartments-tacoma-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-19 23:06:07.323182

“All these kids that have Medicaid will have more difficulty having access to vital treatment that will help them become more independent,” said Cathy Martinez, president of the Autism Family Network in Nebraska.
“We’re either going to pay it on the front end, doing these therapies necessary to their success, or on the back end for care provision when you don’t gain skills through their ABA therapy programs.”
Martinez commented Friday as officials with the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services discussed plans to, on Aug. 1, adjust Medicaid reimbursement rates for providers of applied behavior analysis services.
Also known as ABA, the therapy and support helps youths with autism spectrum disorder and other developmental and social communication delays function better in society.
 Highest in nation

State officials say Nebraska currently has the highest reimbursement rates of any state ABA program — leading to an increase in state expenses of more than 2,000% since 2020. Five years ago, Nebraska Medicaid paid about $4.6 million for ABA services and last year the amount soared to $85.6 million.
DHHS, which is a code agency under the governor’s supervision, has said previously it wanted to re-examine and set new guardrails so services can be sustainable, as federal auditors were scrutinizing states’ behavioral health programs to ferret out possible misuse, fraud and inefficiencies.

Steve Corsi, DHHS chief executive, said Friday that state leaders “fully understand this is an important service” and said they were “unequivocally committed” to ensuring families have “access to necessary services.”
But he said his agency is obliged to be aligned more with neighboring states, and said that even with the adjustments, commonly billed ABA rates for services remain higher than the national average and median. 
Corsi said the ABA changes follow a comparative analysis and were in the works prior to the Trump administration. He said they had “zero” to do with budget woes facing the state.
“Even if we had an excess,” he said of state funds, “this is still the right thing to do.”
 Defending the change

Corsi led a news conference Friday to defend the adjustments, contending that the changes would not result in “a lapse of care for clients or their families.” He said the press conference was spurred by inquiries from families and advocates and what he described as misinformation from some sources.

Medicaid-eligible youths served in Nebraska have grown from about 169 in 2020 to about 1,150 three years later. Experts say the number of affected youths nationally has grown: One in 31 youths has autism spectrum disorder, a developmental disability with challenges ranging in social communication to repetitive behaviors.
Supporting DHHS at the conference was Drew Gonshorowski, the state agency’s Medicaid and Long-Term Care Director, and Károly Mirnics, dean and director of the Munroe-Meyer Institute, a large provider of ABA services.
A DHHS spokesman said that while the new rate schedule is effective Aug. 1, providers could still try to negotiate rates with one of the state’s three managed care organizations, which contract with Nebraska to manage health care benefits for Nebraskans enrolled in Medicaid.  


Autism in Nebraska


Based on national diagnosis rates, Nebraska potentially has 17,300 youths on the autism spectrum.
Nebraska has the capacity to serve 26% of youths who could be diagnosed.
ABA providers are called behavior analysts. Nebraska has 600 licensed behavior analysts and 1,668 registered behavior technicians who must be supervised by an LBA.

Martinez said that as of Friday, she knows of no rates that have been negotiated. She was critical of the one-month public notice that DHHS gave on the rate cut, but said that families and advocates have been calling their state senators, DHHS and Gov. Jim Pillen’s office.  
“Rather than talking to families and providers on the impact of cuts, they decided to implement it without public notice or a public hearing,” Martinez said. “We believe if Governor Pillen really knew the impact to our kids around the state he would not have allowed such a huge cut to services.”
 State ‘overcorrected’

Mariel Fernandez of the Council of Autism Service Providers, which represents members across the nation, said the “writing was on the wall” that cost reductions were coming. She acknowledged that Nebraska’s reimbursement rate, in a few service areas, was out of whack and that a change was appropriate.
But, she said, DHHS “overcorrected” with other announced changes. The reductions range from 28% to 79%, she said, depending largely on the training and expertise of the provider and whether the service is provided on an individual or group level.
Fernandez said state officials should consider the difficulty in recruiting ABA behavioral health care and other talent to the state, as well as “the cost to do business” in Nebraska.
The national council on Friday was wrapping up a survey of about 100 providers, Fernandez said, asking if they would remain part of the Nebraska network with the new rates. She said about 74% indicated they are not sure, and another 10% said they would not.
Fernandez said some member organizations indicated they would look at cost-cutting measures, including lower compensation for employees. Advocates worry that would push analysts and technicians out of the state.
“If those folks quit, it will impact everybody, not just children with Medicaid.” she said.

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)Even though he may never get the opportunity to use his new web development and coding skills outside of the prison walls, one North Dakota inmate says he is grateful for the opportunity to learn and perhaps inspire others.
“Education is the most powerful weapon, which you can use to change the world,” Simon Jacobson said, quoting former South African President Nelson Mandela during his remarks to the other participants in a prison coding program. “I send my deepest respect, regards and gratitude to The Last Mile team as a whole for the life-changing impact that they are doing throughout our country.”
On Friday, Jacobson was one of 10 prisoners who received coding and web development certificates during a ceremony at the North Dakota State Penitentiary.
Jacobson, currently serving a life sentence at the North Dakota State Penitentiary after pleading guilty to murder, kidnapping and robbery charges in 2014, was the teacher’s assistant for the program.
“I’m making sure I take a firm stance on doing the right thing and showing these men, doing the right thing is what a man does,” he said.

The program participants completed one of two six-month programs in web development fundamentals or server and data technology training through The Last Mile, a nonprofit that provides opportunities for justice-impacted individuals through education and technology training. 
Eric Rick, program facilitator for The Last Mile, said the recidivism rate for graduates of the program is under 5% and 75% of the program graduates are employed within six months of their releases. The recidivism rate for all inmates in the state prison system is about 37%, according to the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.
“The Last Mile exists to unlock potential and break the cycle of incarceration,” Rick said. “It is changing lives through technical education and reentry support.”
Rick said the participants take 30 hours of training per week with much of their instruction coming through textbooks, video modules and remote instructors who graduated from the program as former inmates themselves.
“I’m just so proud,” he said. “I’m sad to see them go, but we start another class in August, so we just keep this ball rolling.”
The Last Mile program is operating in 19 prison facilities across eight states, he said. In North Dakota, up to 12 participants are chosen each year from dozens of applications.
Rick said he is hopeful they can expand on some opportunities for program graduates in coming years to get them using their skills through other work programs before they are released.

Davion Burris, another graduate of the program, will be eligible for parole in 2027 and said being able to take this class gives him hope for his future. He said the support network they built among the program participants was essential for them having success.
“We go at our own pace, but depending where the next person is at, they can help you with where you are at,” Burris said. “Certain people remember certain things better and in that aspect we all feel like a group of family.”
He said he hopes to continue his multimedia training in the future and learn more about audio and video production.
Jacobson said he wants to stay involved in the program to help others because it can be overwhelming at times.
“The amount of lines of code you have to go through starts off at 50 to 100 lines of code,” he said. “And then pretty soon your projects are thousands of lines of code, dozens of folders you have to pick through and debug every time you build something, so it’s definitely a tough process.”
Vicki Johnson, Jacobson’s friend for more than 15 years, traveled from Billings to watch him receive his certificate.
“He was trying to make me cry and it almost worked,” Johnson said. “He’s fantastic and just a people person. Very charismatic, loving and kind, and he’s changed his life so very, very much.”
Support from people outside of prison is important because it helps the program participants push through the difficult moments of prison life and helps hold them accountable for the improvements they are trying to make, Jacobson said.

“I got people counting on me. I got people supporting me and feeding into my dream and vision that I want to build for myself,” he said. “It’s critical to me.”
The Last Mile program is funded through the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act and administered by the U.S. Department of Labor.
“It’s been such an honor to walk alongside you during this part of our journey,” Jacobson said as he concluded his remarks to the other participants. “Go forth and ignite the world. Hallelujah. Education has taught me that the greatest investment we can make is in personal relationships and the development of the folks around us … rise, shine, grind and repeat.”

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)Idaho Attorney General Raúl Labrador and two Idaho county prosecuting attorneys agreed to not prosecute some Idaho doctors for referring patients out of state for abortions, under a new legal agreement published in federal court Thursday.
The settlement concludes a lawsuit that challenged a legal opinion from Idaho’s top legal official that said medical professionals who refer or prescribe abortion pills to pregnant patients across state lines are subject to criminal penalties under Idaho’s strict abortion ban.
Federal judge B. Lynn Winmill closed the lawsuit Thursday following the agreement, which protects a regional Planned Parenthood affiliate organization and two Idaho doctors.
In 2023, Labrador issued a legal opinion upon request from Idaho lawmaker Rep. Brent Crane, R-Nampa, on behalf of anti-abortion clinic Stanton Healthcare. In the opinion, Labrador said abortion pills are included in the state’s strict abortion ban law, States Newsroom reported.
Soon, Planned Parenthood Great Northwest, Hawaii, Alaska, Indiana, Kentucky, and the two Idaho doctors sued over Labrador’s opinion. Labrador later recalled the opinion.
Idaho is surrounded by several states where abortion is legal, including Washington, Oregon and Montana. Historically, Idaho physicians referred patients to clinics in those states if they need care that is unavailable in Idaho, such as termination for medical reasons related to fetal anomalies or complications that put a pregnant patient’s health at risk.
 Labrador: ‘We do not have the authority to prosecute referrals for out-of-state services’

Under the recent agreement, Labrador along with two Idaho local prosecutors — Ada County Prosecuting Attorney Jan Bennetts and Valley County Prosecuting Attorney Brian Naugle — will not enforce Idaho’s abortion ban against the organization and two doctors for out-of-state referrals.
In a statement, Labrador said the agreement “avoids unnecessary litigation and protects Idaho taxpayers from further costs.”
“Idaho’s strong pro-life laws remain fully in effect, and we remain proud to defend the rights of mothers and their unborn children,” Labrador told the Idaho Capital Sun. “This settlement simply affirms what our office already made clear in court: We do not have the authority to prosecute referrals for out-of-state services.”
In December 2024, a federal appeals court panel upheld an injunction by a lower federal court in Idaho that blocked Labrador from prosecuting Idaho medical professionals for out-of-state abortion referrals, the Sun previously reported.
In a statement, the Planned Parenthood affiliate CEO, Rebecca Gibron, said the agreement “brings much-needed clarity, compassion, and relief to both patients and providers.”
“It ensures that health care providers in Idaho can continue doing what they are trained and ethically bound to do — offer accurate information and help patients access the care they need, even if that care is out of state. In a state where abortion is banned, those referrals can be lifesaving,” she said.
 Agreement protects referrals out of Idaho for abortion, abortion pills

The agreement blocks enforcing Idaho’s abortion law for “referring a woman across state lines to an abortion provider,” the federal judge wrote.
That includes “informing about, counseling about, recommending, providing a referral for, scheduling an appointment for, informing about sources of funding for, or otherwise advising or assisting an individual in learning about or obtaining, an abortion …”
The ruling also protects that activity for out-of-state “consultation for abortion pills where that abortion will be performed or the out-of-state prescription will be filled outside the borders of Idaho where it is legal to obtain such abortion or prescription for abortion pills.”
The agreement does not have an end date.

(Screengrab from livestream)Leaders of Arkansas’ public broadcasting stations on Friday said they’re focused on how to deal with the loss of federal funding approved by Congress this week but revealed few details of their plans.
  West Doss, chairman Arkansas PBS Commission
“We’d rather not be in this situation,” Arkansas PBS Commission chair West Doss said. “We think we’ll be able to handle it.”
Doss said he didn’t know yet whether the funding loss would lead to staff or programming cuts or both. The funds — about $2.5 million in the current fiscal year — represents about 15% of Arkansas PBS’ annual budget, he said.
The U.S. House passed the Rescission Act of 2025 early Friday that rescinds $9 billion in previously approved funding for public broadcasting and some foreign aid programs. Public media accounted for $1.1 billion of the total. President Donald Trump was expected to sign the measure. 
Arkansas’ share of those funds was $3,187,528 this fiscal year, according to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting’s budget request.
  Mark Smith, station manager, KASU in Jonesville
“These cuts hit our communities right where it hurts,” said Clint Schaff, general manager of KUAF in Fayetteville. “Our neighbors who depend on KUAF’s vital community service are set to lose nearly $193,000 in annual federal funding —16% of our operating budget.”
Jonesboro’s public radio station, KASU, will lose about 20% of its budget, General Manager Mark Smith said. The Corporation for Public Broadcasting provided $164,555 in fiscal year 2024.
The rescinded funds “will have a significant impact on programming” and staff, Smith said. The station has one full-time employee whose salary is covered by the federal money, he said.
“We’re continuing to assess what the overall impact will be and formulating a plan,” he said. It’s too early to tell whether Arkansas State University, which holds the station license, will be able to make up the shortfall, he said.
  Daniel Breen, news director, Little Rock Public Radio
Little Rock Public Radio News Director Daniel Breen said the station’s plans are still in flux, and despite the loss of about 10% of its budget, “we will continue to serve as a public resource for the community, amplifying their stories that normally wouldn’t be heard.”
CPB’s funding request to Congress showed KUAR received about $234,000 in current fiscal year. The station is part of the University of Arkansas at Little Rock.
Public media is “a lifeline for smaller, rural stations, often located in areas which would be news deserts otherwise,” Breen said. “At a time when local news across the board is struggling, it’s sad to think what a reduction in service will mean for those communities.”
  Clint Schaff, general manager, KUAF in Fayetteville
KUAF’s Schaff said the University of Arkansas-supported station is “a resilient mid-market operation that will work to survive this challenge,” but he fears smaller stations throughout the public media network could be forced to go dark.
“KUAF’s service will be as strong as the support it gets from the community it serves — our communities need listeners who are able to donate monthly to do so, for existing contributors to dig deeper, for charitable organizations and foundations to step up, and for universities and other institutions to invest in this vital community resource,” Schaff said.
The Hot Springs Documentary Film Festival also will be affected by the rescission. The festival gets the majority of its funds from a $160,000 CPB grant. It also received a $20,000 grant from PBS.

When Darcie Melvin started coming to Companions in Wholeness nearly four years ago, she said she was dealing with a substance abuse disorder. At first, she was just grateful for the food at the Rutland day shelter — then she got to know the staff.
“I was kind of at my wits’ end,” Melvin said. “This place has truly become like a family to me.”
Over the course of several years, the day shelter helped Melvin with bills, to furnish her apartment and connect her with other services. Melvin said she’s now been in recovery for about 16 months, but she still comes in regularly to volunteer and has slowly stopped needing to accept offers of free food.
However, the shelter now faces uncertainty as it announced plans to lay off every paid worker on Aug. 2, after federal grants froze and state ones were not renewed in the spring. Four employees plan to keep working, unpaid, to keep the organization open.
“It would be a terrible thing,” Outreach Coordinator Linda Allen said of a possible closure.
Allen is among the four employees who plan to keep working without pay, citing a deep sense of obligation to the organization’s regulars. 
People in the organization’s crowded main room on Thursday said the facility had been a cornerstone of their recovery — and sometimes survival. But Executive Director Ellie McGarry has been left with few options after losing both of her major public funding streams.

Companions in Wholeness is open Monday through Thursday, 6:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. Apart from serving meals to about 150 people per day, it offers clothing, climate control, rest areas and appointments with service providers. In August, the schedule is set to shrink to three hours a day, offering one meal rather than two.
The loss of funding comes as the demand for Companions in Wholeness has been steadily growing over the past few years. McGarry said the latest round of evictions from the state’s motel voucher program produced acute pressure on shelter services.
The situation was already severe. A 2024 report found that Rutland County’s unhoused population had increased by a factor of seven since 2019. Statewide, the rate of homelessness still ranked fourth worst in the nation last year.
Companions in Wholeness is part of the United Methodist Church in Rutland. It even operates out of the church’s physical space — staff push the altar aside to transform the room into a shelter just hours after Sunday services. Melvin said the connection with the church had been important for her.

Companions in Wholeness is trying to expand and move to a larger church space, McGarry said. The organization also plans to become an independent entity and change its name to Rutland Neighbors.
But the building is not McGarry’s main worry. She had hoped for a total of $260,000 in grants to carry the shelter’s growing burden this year. None of it came through. The organization requires about $20,000 per month to operate, she said. Right now, it has $10,000 in the bank.
The federal Emergency Food and Shelter Program, which the organization used to receive funds from, was frozen this spring. The program was administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which did not respond to requests for comment. 
At the same time, the Housing Opportunity Grant Program through the Vermont Department for Children and Families did not choose to award a payment to the organization, despite doing so each of the past two years.

Lily Sojourner, director of the department’s Office of Economic Opportunity, said the Housing Opportunity Grants originally were intended to support overnight shelters. Given that BROC Community action, a nonprofit primarily serving Bennington and Rutland counties, has plans to open such a shelter in Rutland this fall, the state directed more significant financial support to that project.
Eric Maguire, the project director for the new BROC Community Action shelter, said the facility likely will be up and running by November or December. The program expects to house 10 people to start, with high barriers to admission, requiring people to be sober and lack other housing alternatives. Maguire said having a sober, overnight shelter in the city is critical given the community’s current housing and substance use needs.
Companions in Wholeness does not allow entry to people who are disruptive or visibly under the influence, but McGarry said she welcomes people whom she knows to be dealing with substance use disorders. 
Brooke Kurutza — a 31-year-old from Barre who has been coming to Companions in Wholeness for four years and had substance use disorders at various points in her life — said she has been experiencing homelessness since she was 18. 
“This place is everything to me,” she said.
Kurutza said a new shelter would greatly help the community, as Rutland’s Open Door Mission, where she currently stays, is full.
Both services are necessary, she said. Overnight shelters often require people staying there to leave fairly early in the morning, while places like Companions in Wholeness allow people to eat, rest and seek shelter from the elements during the day.
Ronald Jones has been going to Companions in Wholeness since it opened in 2018 and said he eats all his meals there. He said he is worried what restricted hours and resources will mean for people who rely on the organization.
“It’s going to do damaging things,” he said.
Companions in Wholeness plans to host a bowling event in Rutland on Sept. 14 to fundraise the necessary resources to continue operations, according to a statement Friday.
“It’s taken me 39 years to find people like this,” Melvin said through tears. “I don’t want to lose it.”

Through June, at least 92 children had died or nearly died, according to the state’s Office of the Family and Children’s Ombuds. That’s up from 78 in the first six months of 2024. These incidents stem from causes such as drug exposure, abuse and neglect. They also include expected medical deaths if the family had some involvement with child welfare.
The figures only capture cases the state Department of Children, Youth and Families is aware of. The agency oversees Washington’s child welfare system.
Some Republicans have blamed a recent state law for putting kids at greater risk. But state officials say there isn’t a definite link between that law and many of the incidents.
The highly potent opioid fentanyl has driven increases in fatalities and near-fatalities for the state’s children in recent years. Last year, over two-fifths of the episodes were tied to accidental drug ingestion and overdose. Such incidents were very rare in 2017 and 2018.
So far this year, 20 of the cases involving children ages 0 to 3 stemmed from accidental fentanyl exposure, according to the ombuds data. There were 33 such cases in all of 2024.
“These are the ones where, usually, it’s a younger child accidentally picks up some foil and puts it in their mouth or a tablet and ingests it,” Patrick Dowd, the head of the agency watchdog, told the Department of Children, Youth and Families oversight board Thursday.
In light of this spike, state lawmakers in 2024 passed legislation requiring courts to more strongly weigh the presence of opioids in the home when deciding whether a child should be removed and placed into foster care.
State officials also point to increased economic stress over the past few years as a contributor to the incidents, and say that may only increase as the impacts of tariffs and cuts to social safety net programs are felt.
“It is not necessarily going to be better before it’s worse,” said Sen. Claire Wilson, D-Federal Way, the co-chair of the oversight board, “and so we really have to think about what that looks like and how we leverage resources and support.”
Growing frustrations
The 2021 Keeping Families Together Act raised the bar for taking children away from their parents and favored placing them with other relatives over foster care. The idea was that removal from their homes can cause them major problems later in life. 
The legislation passed with strong bipartisan support in the Legislature. But now Republican lawmakers in particular are souring on the law.
Rep. Chris Corry, R-Yakima, said if he could take back any of his votes since joining the state House in 2019, this would be it. 
“It’s either being completely misapplied or when the law was passed, it was misrepresented to myself and members of the Legislature because this was not ever in my mind where we keep children with drug-addled parents,” said Corry, who has fostered children.
But the ombuds office didn’t recommend changes to the Keeping Families Together Act, enshrined in House Bill 1227, to the oversight board.
“We did not find in many cases a certain point where, if only 1227 had not been enacted, then the department would have filed” for removal, Dowd said.
Instead, the ombuds suggested the state expand treatment services for pregnant women and mothers, increase efforts to engage fathers and look into allowing children to stay in their guardians’ homes under court-ordered state supervision.
The agency has taken steps to respond to the alarming trend. 
For example, the state now requires “safe child consults” for all child welfare cases involving opioid use and a child younger than 3. These reviews help determine whether officials will allow a child to go home or petition a judge for care elsewhere. The department has also increased training for caseworkers on neglect and medically complex cases.
Republicans have also been frustrated over the state’s defunding of the only medical facility in western Washington focused on caring for drug-exposed newborns. Most of the babies cared for at the Pediatric Interim Care Center in Kent were exposed to fentanyl or methamphetamine before birth. 
The Department of Children, Youth and Families, in a statement Friday, said it’s “not possible or appropriate” to point to a single cause driving this year’s rise in child fatalities.
The agency attributed the increase largely to synthetic opioids like fentanyl, parental stress, “an increase of families with high needs, and the complexities of cases and the systems involved.”
Last year saw a slight decline in the overall number of fatal and near-fatal incidents, with 140 child deaths and near deaths compared to 147 in 2022. 
Of those whose deaths last year were related to maltreatment, like abuse or neglect, 42% were part of an open case with the Department of Children, Youth and Families at the time of their death. Another nearly 40% had a case closed in the prior 12 months. 
Of the 38 maltreatment deaths in 2024, more than half of the children were under one year old.

There are nine radio stations affiliated with National Public Radio and four television stations that are part of the Public Broadcasting Service in Missouri media markets, along with some smaller community radio stations, that receive funding from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. Funding from Congress goes to the corporation, which then distributes money to the stations.
Those broadcasters received about $7.6 million in community service grants in federal fiscal year 2024, the most recent completed year, according to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. 
“This vote weakens one of the most trusted civic institutions in America,” Kyle Felling, general manager of KBIA in Columbia, said in a news release. “Stripping away already-approved funding puts the work we do every day at risk — reporting trusted facts, delivering emergency alerts, and connecting our community.”




 Emergency fund drives


KBIA, the NPR station operated by the University of Missouri Journalism School, launched a drive for a “Resiliency Fund” to raise $500,000.
KCUR, the NPR station in the Kansas City market, will run a drive through Monday, and perhaps beyond, to raise $500,000
Community radio station KOPN in Columbia, which is not an NPR affiliate, launched an emergency drive with a goal of $40,000.
KCPT, the Kansas City public television station, also launched an emergency drive but did not state a goal on its website.





Missouri U.S. Sen. Eric Schmitt, who handled the rescission bill in the Senate, said on Fox News Friday that he was proud to be the one leading the fight to eliminate public broadcaster funding.
“We got the federal government out of the business of subsidizing NPR and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting,” Schmitt said. “They are woke, biased, and ideologically captured. They don’t deserve tax dollars.”
Since President Donald Trump sent a request for cuts of $9.4 billion from current spending to Congress in June, the stations have been using their websites and airwaves to seek extra donations and mobilize listeners.
The final 216-213 House vote came Friday morning, just after midnight. Every Republican member of the Missouri delegation voted for the cuts except U.S. Rep. Eric Burlison of Springfield, who was absent. The state’s two Democratic House members voted against it.
The Trump administration’s well-telegraphed intent to cut funding for public broadcasting had boosted station fundraising even before the vote, Felling said. An annual May fund drive, he said, raised more than three times the amount it did a year ago.
“After the cuts overnight, I’ve seen my inbox flooded with messages of support and contributions,” Felling said via email. “The community recognizes the importance of what we do, the value of independent and trusted reporting.”
At KCUR, the emergency fund drive began at 7 a.m. Friday and will continue at least through Monday, Karen Campbell, director of institutional giving and communications, said in an email. Along with the direct cash grant the station lost, it will have to pick up costs previously covered by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, she wrote.
The response so far, she said, has been very positive.
“While we are buoyed by this support and the kind words that accompany these gifts, we know that we have a long road ahead,” Campbell wrote.
Dylan Martin, executive director of community radio station KOPN in Columbia, said the lost federal funding is about 40% of the station’s cash budget. The station has always been lean, he said, with two paid staff currently.
In addition to lost cash, there are new costs, he said.
“In addition to grant funds, CPB had negotiated and paid for music licensing fees for broadcast and internet streaming for qualified CPB recipients,” Martin said. “As a station that broadcasts a significant amount of diverse music, KOPN will have to cover this in addition to the shortfall of grant funds.”
At Ozarks Public Broadcasting in Springfield, which combines operations for KSMU radio and KOZK-TV in Springfield, General Manager Rachel Knight went on the air Friday morning to explain the impact. The cut is about $1.3 million total, she said, approximately 10% of the radio station budget and one-third of the television budget.
“Like we’ve been saying over the last several months as we knew this was looming, these won’t be invisible cuts,” Knight told the audience. “I mean, we operate so efficiently right now that there’s nothing easy to cut.”
The stations have not launched formal emergency fundraising campaigns, Knight said in an email to The Independent, but the public is calling to give.
“Our phones have stayed busy this morning and web pledges are coming in fast,” Knight said. “We’re hearing frustration and disappointment from our audience in Congress’ decision to defund public media. They want to see our services continue and are stepping up with additional support.”
St. Louis Public Radio, operating with the call letters KWMU, will lose about $575,000 —  about 6% of its annual revenue — and face the same increased costs for pooled programming and services previously provided by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the station said in a news release.
“Public media has always served as a pillar of democracy, with broad support that transcends party lines,” interim General Manager Jess Luther said in the release. “Our elected leaders’ decision to rescind this funding dangerously diminishes the free flow of information, especially to communities that have few other sources of news and emergency alerts. When we say this is dangerous, we mean it literally.”
In addition to KOZK in Springfield, the PBS stations in Missouri are KMOS in Warrensburg, KCPT in Kansas City and KETC in St. Louis.
KMOS is an important resource for a region where 70% of the audience is rural and 17% have no internet access, General Manager Josh Tomlinson said.
“First and foremost, while the federal funding for public media is gone KMOS is not,” he said.
The federal funding represents about 40% of the station budget, he said.
“I can’t rule out the loss of programming or other services but we are not taking a panicked approach. Instead we are looking at everything strategically,” he said. “The community’s response has been remarkable.  We have heard from hundreds of viewers who have offered support and many more have contacted lawmakers on our behalf.”
For KCPT, the loss is about 13% of the station budget, according to an online statement about its emergency fund drive.
“For nearly 60 years, Kansas City PBS has been a trusted source of education, culture, and connection,” Kliff Kuehl, president and CEO of Kansas City PBS said in the online statement. “This loss of funding is a significant challenge, but we have always been powered by the people we serve and we will continue to inform, inspire and connect.”  
In a message to viewers on its website, KETC President and CEO Amy Shaw thanked viewers for donations and advocating for the station with messages to Congress. The cut is about $1.8 million, she said, about 13% of the budget.
“This was not the outcome we hoped for and fought for,” Shaw said. “However, Nine PBS’s commitment to serve the St. Louis region remains stronger than ever.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-07-18 22:58:14+00:00,CT Mirror,"Diquat among most commonly used aquatic herbicides in CT, documents show",John Moritz and Angela Eichhorst,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/18/ct-diquat-hydrilla/,Recent plan to use diquat on hydrilla in the Connecticut River set off viral opposition campaign. But its use is common across the state.,"Before it became a flash point in a viral debate over the use of herbicides on the Connecticut River, the chemical diquat was widely used for years to treat lakes and ponds across the state, public records show.
The vocal criticism of diquat dibromide began earlier this summer when the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers announced plans to renew and expand its studies using the herbicide at several points along the river to combat the invasive weed hydrilla, which has alarmed both officials and environmental advocates with its rapid spread throughout the river’s watershed.
Those plans quickly became the subject of social media posts accusing public officials of planning to “poison” the river and acting in secrecy to avoid public scrutiny. Many critics noted that diquat is banned in the European Union and the United Kingdom, and questioned why it appeared to be suddenly under consideration for use in Connecticut.
But a review of hundreds of permits issued by the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection in recent years shows that diquat is among the most common herbicides used to treat lakes and ponds for invasive species such as hydrilla, water chestnut and Eurasian watermilfoil.
This year alone, the state agency has issued 188 permits authorizing the use of diquat, the records show. That amounted to roughly two-thirds of all permits issued by the agency this year for aquatic herbicide treatments. Over the previous three years, more than 765 permits were issued. 
In addition, diquat is commercially available as an ingredient in several household landscaping products, including Roundup.
In statement this week, DEEP said the permits “reflect common, permitted, regulated aquatic vegetation management practices, performed by licensed third parties.”
“DEEP evaluates each application based on site-specific ecological and public health considerations, ensuring that permitted treatments align with best practices for protecting water quality, aquatic ecosystems, wildlife, and human health,” the statement read.
The chemical’s widespread use, however, hasn’t tempered the blowback aimed at the Army Corps of Engineers and other public agencies over planned treatments on the Connecticut River. Chris Webby, a self-described conspiracy theorist and rapper from Norwalk, roused much of the current opposition by sharing videos about the plans with his more than 100,000 followers.
In response, multiple officials this week described being inundated with angry phone calls, emails and voicemails from people demanding a halt to the use of diquat — as well more threatening messages.
“The vast majority are people letting us know they saw this online, mostly from social media posts, and they’re angry,” said one recipient of the messages, who did not want to be identified for fear drawing more hostility. “A few are using more direct language that has crossed some lines.”
Webby did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday.
Residents expressed anger about the use of diquat in the Connecticut River at a press conference in Deep River on July 18. “There’s no expert here. It’s a bunch of political bullshit,” the man said. “I want to know if you’re gonna keep spraying diquat without us knowing,” the woman said. Both declined to give their names, citing dissatisfaction with the Connecticut Mirror’s reporting on this issue. Credit: Dana Edwards / CT Mirror
In a previous interview with the Connecticut Mirror, Webby acknowledged his own lack of expertise on the subject but said he became passionate about the issue after watching videos on social media purporting to show the harmful effects of diquat spraying on a lake in Texas. Others critics have pointed to recently published research suggesting that exposure to diquat can damage the digestive system, particularly from consuming food grown using the herbicide.
Longtime environmental advocates who are supportive of the Army Corps’ efforts along the Connecticut River say they, too, share a skepticism over the use of herbicides in many instances. But, they said, the Army Corps leaders assuaged their concerns through a careful study of the river and the methods used to deploy the chemicals.
“Concerns about diquat are valid,” Alicea Charamut, executive director of the Rivers Alliance of Connecticut, said. “It’s a powerful chemical, but like most chemicals, the way it’s used makes all the difference, especially when comparing its use in agriculture to aquatic settings.”
Charamut attempted to alleviate some of the public’s concerns about the specific use of diquat to combat hydrilla in the river at a press conference hosted by state and federal officials in Deep River on Friday. She was joined by U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal — who helped secure $5 million in federal funding for the Army Corps’ project last year.
“I welcome different points of view on this topic, but right now we are deluged with a lot of misinformation from people who have suspicions and doubts,” Blumenthal said. “We’re here to dispel those doubts and say we must stop hydrilla before it kills other wildlife, habitat, environmental and ecological life.”
After hearing from all the speakers, several protesters began to shout questions and insults at Blumenthal and other officials, accusing them of ignoring studies on the health effects of diquat. Others said they wanted to hear directly from the Army Corps, which was not present at the press conference.
One woman, who gave her name only as Katherine M., pushed around a toddler in a stroller as she asked whether it would be safe for the child to swim in water that had been treated with diquat. 
Mason Trumble, deputy commissioner of environmental conservation at DEEP, responded that the agency requires any users of aquatic herbicides to post signs nearby letting people know when it is safe to swim, fish or use the water for irrigation purposes.
“They don’t really know exactly how unsafe it is,” the woman told reporters afterward. “If you read the studies and you look at the information out there, it’s not secret.”

Prior to the press conference, the Army Corps of Engineers announced that it had no immediate plans to resume its studies using diquat in the river despite having permits in place to do so at three locations. A spokeswoman, Beth Gosselin, said the agency would wait until the end of an extended public comment period in mid-August to determine its next steps and would provide additional public notice before beginning any herbicide treatments.
“We remain committed to transparency and will continue to proactively engage with the public and our stakeholders,” Gosselin said in statement. 
While the Army Corps’ project is on hold, many Connecticut communities and property owners are still able to deploy the herbicide — with permits from DEEP, which require periodic reapplication. 
Sightings of those treatments, however, may have spurred some of the recent backlash. 
Earlier this week, Webby and others shared a video of two men in a fanboat spraying chemicals across a small pond. Webby said the video was taken in the town of Berlin, and he used it to accuse officials of lying about about their plans to delay the use of herbicides.
The Corps’ publicly-available plans, however, make no mention of any treatments in Berlin, which is not located along the river. In addition, officials have said the Corps’ methods involve injecting liquid diquat underneath the water, rather than spraying it above the surface. 
An analysis of the video by CT Mirror determined that it was filmed in Berlin at Paper Goods Pond, one of two areas where the town had previously notified residents of its plans to spray diquat and other herbicides.
The treatment, which was permitted by DEEP, took place on July 11 and was not associated with the Army Corps’ studies.
Officials in Berlin did not respond to a request for comment this week, but in a subsequent Facebook post responding to “recent comments and concern,” town officials provided more information about the project, which began several years ago following surveys, water tests and research into different treatment options.
“The project has been ongoing for several years and conditions are improving,” the post said. “An increase in fish and wildlife has been documented as a result of the management program… We are aware that false and out of context information is being shared online, but is important to rely on factual information, data collection, state and federal agencies, and expert scientists.”
At Paper Goods Pond on Thursday, Berlin resident Bill Grem III said he’d been fishing at that spot for years with his grandson. He said he’d noticed crews in the past spraying herbicides, and he’d seen posted signs stating when it was safe to resume fishing. He said he trusted the public advisories, and had not noticed any adverse ecological effects. 
As if to prove the point, he showed off a photo of his grandson proudly holding a large bass he had caught from the same pond.
“The fish aren’t dying,” he said. “It’s just something they have to do.”

(Getty Images)Increased scams aimed at defrauding food assistance recipients prompted the Arkansas Department of Human Services to create a new fraud prevention section of its website, the agency said Friday.
Available at ar.gov/snapfraud, the web section includes a series of preventive tips that Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program recipients should follow to help protect their accounts as well as a new form where victims of SNAP fraud can report stolen benefits to DHS.
“We are continuing to support all efforts to bring the perpetrators of this fraud to justice and to ensure that SNAP accounts are secure,” said Mary Franklin, director of the Division of County Operations within DHS, said in a press release.
While the department cannot replace lost or stolen SNAP benefits, the new centralized resource for submitting fraud reports will help officials identify trends that might help investigations into these crimes. Victims are encouraged to also report any fraud to law enforcement.
DHS is working with state and federal partners as well as the current Arkansas Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) card vendor, Conduent, to explore ways that SNAP accounts can be protected from future fraud attempts.
“We need Arkansans who receive SNAP benefits to take steps to prevent this unauthorized access,” Franklin said. “Most importantly, they should immediately set a new four-digit PIN that only they know, and continue to change the PIN every month. This simple step goes a long way in locking scammers out.”
SNAP recipients can reset their pins by calling the EBT Customer Service line at 1-800-997-9999 and follow the prompts to reset their PIN. This is an important step to take before new benefits are added to cards, which typically occurs beginning around the 4th of each month.
DHS offered SNAP recipients tips on protection themselves from scammers:

Set a PIN known only to them and not commonly used
Keep the PIN secret; do not share with anyone outside the household.
Check EBT account regularly for unauthorized charges. Change the PIN immediately if any are found.
Check card readers to make sure nothing is overlayed or attached to the swiper or keypad to avoid “skimming.”
Never reveal the PIN to anyone. DHS will not reach out via email, social media or text to ask for a PIN.
Avoid saving an EBT card as a payment method for online shopping.

SNAP provides food assistance to eligible households to cover a portion of a household’s food budget, and benefits are distributed through an EBT card. SNAP benefits can be used to buy eligible food items for eating at home. Additional information about the program is available at humanservices.arkansas.gov/u/snap

(City of Oakdale)One of four Central Louisiana law enforcement leaders arrested this week for their alleged involvement in an immigration fraud scheme is still on the job, our news partners at KPLC-TV report. 
Oakdale Police Chief Chad Doyle has not submitted his resignation, according to city officials . He is alleged to have created false police reports for Chandrakant “Lala” Patel, a local businessman who federal investigators said paid police $5,000 for each foreign national they would add to the reports as a crime victim. 
That status would make them eligible for a U-visa, which are available to immigrants who are victims of crime or can assist in the prosecutions of criminals.
Along with Doyle, an indictment from the U.S. attorney for Louisiana’s Western District implicates Oakdale City Marshal Michael Slaney, Forest Hill Police Chief Glynn Dixon and Glenmora Police Chief Tebo Onishea in the scheme that prosecutors say put U-visas in the hands of 25 immigrants. 
Louisiana State Police have also arrested Alison Doyle, the police chief’s wife and an Oakdale city employee, charging her with two felony counts of malfeasance in office. It stemmed from an investigation into “unethical conduct in the municipal property bidding process.” 
In a social media post, state police said they obtained information from federal investigators involved in the Patel investigation. It revealed that Alison Doyle reportedly conspired with Patel to “manipulate the bidding process for two city-owned properties.” 
Alison Doyle is not mentioned in the federal indictment, which includes a sizable list of personal property, bank accounts and vehicles belonging to the five defendants that are eligible for forfeiture should they be tied to the offenses detailed.
According to KPLC, Alison Doyle left her job with the city in May. The police chief has not responded to calls from the station.
Chad Doyle’s elected term as police chief runs through the end of 2028.

The company also has a lease off the Delmarva coast, but is not nearly as far along in the permit-approval process as US Wind. (Photo courtesy of Ørsted)The Maryland Department of the Environment is defending the permit it issued to a wind farm proposed off the coast of Ocean City, after a challenge from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
The Thursday letter from Maryland Secretary of the Environment Serena McIlwain also said the state would not be reissuing the permit, as the EPA requested, because the state had not made a mistake that needed correcting.
The EPA had contended that when Maryland issued the permit to Baltimore-based company US Wind, it identified the wrong process for citizens to file appeals.
Amy Van Blarcom-Lackey, EPA administrator for Region 3, which includes Maryland and other mid-Atlantic states, contended in a July 7 letter that any appeals challenging the air pollution permit issued to US Wind should be filed to the clerk of the EPA’s Environmental Appeals Board.
But Maryland argues that its permit would need to be appealed through the state courts, which would involve filing a challenge at the appropriate circuit court — in this case in Worcester County.
Notably, the due date for a state court challenge has already passed. It was set for July 14 — about a month after MDE issued the permit, according to MDE’s website.
“Long-settled procedure dictates that state-issued permits are appealed under State law, not Federal law,” McIlwain’s letter says.
Trump’s EPA flags a problem with offshore wind permit issued by Maryland

That letter also cites written decisions issued by the EPA’s appeals board, including one that stated that the board “lacked jurisdiction” to evaluate this type of permit.
“MDE will not re-issue the permit and will continue to follow the proper state procedures to consider appeals,” McIlwain concluded, near the end of the roughly two-page letter.
In an emailed response, the EPA stuck to its guns. An EPA spokesperson said the agency had notified MDE that the final permit decision “contains an error, with clear guidance on next steps. But they don’t seem to care about complying with legal requirements.”
The MDE website for the US Wind project originally referenced both the state appeals procedure and the EPA process, but McIlwain said that information had been “included at EPA’s request. It has been removed, and language has been added clarifying that the Federal appeals process does not apply.”
Authority to issue Clean Air Act permits like the one for US Wind is delegated to the state from the EPA — the basis of the federal agency’s claim for jurisdiction for appeals. That authority, specifically for permits on the outer continental shelf, was re-certified in early 2024 under the Biden administration.
The US Wind project, which is planned about 10 miles from Ocean City’s shoreline, is the wind project that is closest to construction in this region. The company, which leased the area in 2014, received a key permit from President Joe Biden’s (D) Department of the Interior at the end of 2024.
Final buildout of the project is still years away, but it calls for construction of 121 wind turbines, up to four offshore substations and one meteorological tower, according to the state’s website. When complete, the project could generate 2,200 megawatts of energy, enough to power up to 718,000 homes, according to the federal Bureau of Ocean Energy Management.
Practically since its inception, the project has faced fierce opposition from local officials in the resort town, who cite concerns that beachgoers would lose a pristine ocean view if the turbines were visible from shore.

Since President Donald Trump (R) took office for his second term, offshore wind projects have landed in his crosshairs. Earlier this week, Trump announced that wind and solar projects would undergo increased scrutiny under his administration.  Trump’s “Big, Beautiful Bill” also rescinds tax credits for renewable energy projects that do not begin construction by next July.
In April, Trump appointed Blarcom-Lackey to lead the EPA’s Mid-Atlantic office. She succeeded Marylander Adam Ortiz, who moved to a deputy secretary role at MDE.
Two other companies have offshore leases in the vicinity of Ocean City and the Delaware beaches — Ørsted and Equinor. While Ørsted received its first lease area around the same time as US Wind, Equinor won its auction last year. Neither project have received its federal permits from the Interior Department’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management.

Article Summary

The Cook County Democratic Party, one of the most powerful political organizations in the state, chose to back Rep. Margaret Croke, D-Chicago, in her bid to be the next state comptroller.
The comptroller endorsement sparked an intraparty fight, with House Speaker Chris Welch on one side and Senate President Don Harmon on the other.
The party made no endorsement in the race for U.S. Senate.

This summary was written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.


CHICAGO — At a union hall on Chicago’s South Side, a powerful Democratic Party organization decided who to endorse in the March 17 primary in one key statewide race.

The Cook County Democratic Party Central Committee decided Friday to back Rep. Margaret Croke, D-Chicago, in her bid for Illinois comptroller, the state’s chief financial officer.

That decision sparked conflict between Illinois House Speaker Emanuel “Chris” Welch and Senate President Don Harmon, who backed different candidates.

In the race for U.S. senate however, the party declined to endorse. It’s the first open Senate election in the state since 2010.

“I think the party made the correct decision in making no endorsement in the U.S. Senate race,” Harmon told Capitol News Illinois. “It’s a marquee race with terrific candidates and I’m sure the voters will be able to make an informed decision without an endorsement.”

But Harmon objected to the party’s endorsement in the comptroller’s race, sparking a protracted closed-door debate.

Ultimately, Croke bested a list of competitors that included state Sen. Karina Villa, a member of Harmon’s caucus in Springfield.

While an endorsement from the Cook County Democrats does not guarantee a win, it is a major step for a campaign in Illinois.

Cook County has about 40% of the state’s population, and its Democratic Party has been a dominant political force for decades. Beyond the potential for turning out votes in the state’s most populous county, an endorsement from the Cook County Democrats can be a litmus test for support from state-level Democrats.

The group of party insiders considering who to endorse includes Welch and Harmon — both from suburban Cook County — and the committee that oversees statewide endorsements is chaired by state Rep. Bob Rita, D-Blue Island.

Additionally, influential Democrats in the General Assembly, like Rep. Kam Buckner, D-Chicago; Sen. Laura Murphy, D-Des Planes, and Sen. Elgie Sims, D-Chicago, were all present for the meeting.

Party backs Croke for comptroller  

The race for comptroller, which opened up this week after sitting comptroller Susana Mendoza announced she was not seeking reelection, sparked a clash between several of the state’s most powerful politicians.

Five candidates asked for the party’s backing. Croke, Lake County Treasurer Holly Kim and Villa, D-West Chicago, were the favored candidates going into the meeting. Champaign County Auditor George Danos and former state Sen. Rickey Hendon also presented at the meeting.

Welch spoke at length in favor of Croke during the slating meeting, adding that he was “very happy to support” Croke. Croke is close to Gov. JB Pritzker, having worked in the Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity and on his first campaign.

Meanwhile, Harmon backed Villa.

During discussions over comptroller candidates, Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle also noted she believed it is “really important for this party to support a Latino for statewide office.”

In a private session and on a very narrow vote, the subcommittee that recommends statewide endorsements backed Croke. Back in the public session, Harmon fought to try and reject the recommendation.

“We have a slate that does not have any representation from the Latino Caucus, no representation from the Asian Caucus, no one from outside the city of Chicago. I think this is the problem,” Harmon said.

This sparked another closed-door debate after which Croke emerged with the ultimate endorsement, something that “disappointed” Harmon.

“I worry that the party was more divided than evidenced by the final outcome,” he said. “But it’ll be up to the voters.”

No endorsement for U.S. Senate 

After Dick Durbin, Illinois’ current senior U.S. senator, announced his retirement, several candidates quickly popped up to replace him at the end of his final term.

The three frontrunners so far are Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton, U.S. Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi and U.S. Rep. Robin Kelly.

Several other candidates are in the race and three spoke to party insiders Friday: Christopher Swan, Kevin Ryan and Jump Shepherd. Kelly did not appear at Friday’s meeting, instead having an ally speak on her behalf following travel issues after a late night of voting in Washington.

In the end, the Cook County Democrats didn’t endorse any of them, setting up a contentious primary fight between a current statewide office holder, the one-time state party chair and a man who has nearly 10-to-1 funding advantage.

Durbin, meanwhile, plans on mostly staying out of the race. The retiring senator said Friday that there are three good candidates in the race. While he said he hasn’t “ruled out completely” endorsing someone, he probably won’t.

“I’m not likely to endorse in the race,” Durbin said. “I may in some other races but not that one.”

Governor, other endorsements 

The governor couldn’t make the meeting due to a family commitment. In his stead, Pritzker’s running mate Christian Mitchell addressed the collection of party insiders. In a brief speech, Mitchell echoed many of Pritzker campaign talking points.

But when the floor was opened to questions, Mitchell started taking heat.

Mitchell, who oversaw Pritzker’s cannabis legalization efforts early in the governor’s first term, once tweeted that he was “stunned at the level of ignorance” at a Chicago City Council meeting, something that multiple alderpeople in attendance on Friday took exception to.

“I don’t recall using that term, but if I did, I apologize,” Mitchell said when questioned by Chicago Ald. David Moore.

Mitchell also faced heat from Chicago Ald. Raymond Lopez, who pressed him on the administration’s relationship to the Latino community. Several Chicago alderpeople also interrogated Mitchell over the administration’s plans on Chicagoland transit, Chicago Public Schools and the closure of manufacturing plants on Chicago’s South Side.

But Mitchell did have his fans in the audience, with one committee member noting that Mitchell’s appearance at a fundraiser helped increase donations, something Mitchell said he wanted to replicate.

“I want to go everywhere, I want to be everywhere,” he said.

The party voted to endorse the Pritzker-Mitchell ticket, which faces no serious challengers within the Democratic party.

Attorney General Kwame Raoul, Treasurer Michael Frerichs and Secretary of State Alexi Giannoulias also received endorsements.

Lujan Grisham floats idea of protecting state lands in state law, while celebrating year one of a conservation legacy fund.","A coalition released a report on and celebrated the first year of New Mexico's Land of Enchantment Legacy Fund. (Courtesy photo)New Mexico officials and conservation groups gathered in Silver City earlier this week to celebrate investments in projects they say will address conservation, watershed issues and mitigate climate change — despite federal cuts to environmental programs.
In 2023, lawmakers approved Senate Bill 9 creating the “Land of Enchantment Legacy Fund,” an investment fund to provide recurring revenues for land, water, agriculture and outdoor recreation projects. The fund now sits at $382.9 million, and provides $12.5 million to 10 state agencies as grants.
July marked the first year of the fund’s payout, supporting 185 projects in New Mexico’s 33 counties and 10 tribal communities. Some of the projects included: addressing soil issues in Socorro; planting crop cover in Taos; and building trails in Carlsbad. Other priorities that received funds: agricultural programs to counter noxious weeds; wildlife surveys in every county; and watershed restoration from fire damage and historic buildings protections. View an interactive map of all the projects here.
New Mexico conservation groups issued a report on the fund’s inaugural year that totaled its positive impact on 64,905 acres of public and private land, but also noted that all of the projects included a  federal funding match, and all of the state agencies faced challenges as a result of federal funding upheaval. “While most grants are secure, some still face uncertainty,” the report said.
While celebrating the fund’s achievements at an appearance in Silver City, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham also referenced the potential threats public lands in New Mexico could face under the current federal administration.
A previous version of the GOP’s spending bill in the Senate would have allowed the sale of 21,000 square miles of public lands in New Mexico to private buyers, sparking protests at the Western Governor’s association. The proposal was later scrapped on procedural grounds, but members of the New Mexico Congressional delegation say the fight isn’t over.
As such, Lujan Grisham in her comments floated enshrining protections from selling federal public lands in a special session, saying that while Republicans “didn’t achieve it, but they’ll do it again.” 
“I think we ought to have a special session and just put in state law: ‘No, thank you. We can’t do it here,’” she told the crowd.  And if somehow they can, we get every right of first refusal.”
In a written statement, the governor’s Director of Communications Michael Coleman clarified that the governor would not call a special session exclusively for public lands.
“She is strongly considering calling a special session to deal with Trump administration budget cuts and public safety concerns,” Coleman wrote. “Public lands could be placed on a call with those other issues.”
Coleman said Friday the timing for a prospective special session “remains unclear.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/TTR30893-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-19 23:06:07.323182

(Photo courtesy of DNR's YouTube channel)The Iowa Department of Natural Resources participates in a global network that uses small tags and antenna receivers to track migratory patterns of birds, bats and insects, and it has recorded 607 detections of 340 individuals from 39 bird species in the state since 2021. 
These figures come from the department’s annual report, which shows the Motus Wildlife Tracking Network continues to expand each year in Iowa.
According to a DNR annual report, Iowa is an “important” migratory corridor and has some of the highest numbers of migrating birds – up to 1 billion in some years – during the fall season. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The “vision” for the program in Iowa is to have a 42-station, Motus “fence” from the Missouri River to the Mississippi River to “maximize” detection of north-south migrating species through the state. 
The DNR report said Motus stations in any location provide valuable insight into migratory patterns. 
Right now, there are 32 Motus stations in Iowa and more than 2,200 stations across the globe.  

Motus tags weigh 3% or less of the bird’s body weight and have a battery lifespan of around 400 days, which means both fall and spring migrations are tracked with a single tag. 
The tags emit a signal that is detected by the Motus stations when a bird flies near the station. 

DNR also expanded the program in 2024 by tagging birds that breed in Iowa, including 27 wood thrushes. 
Wood thrush is considered a Species of Greatest Conservation Need in Iowa and in 25 other states because the population has declined across North America by more than 50% in the past 50 years. 
DNR tagged the birds at nine different sites as part of a regional Motus collaboration to track the birds and gain important knowledge on wood thrush habits that could help with their conservation. 
According to a press release from DNR, the project showed two wood thrushes from Iowa and a number from other states, were detected at the same Motus station in Belize this winter.
“This high detection rate indicates that this particular area of Belize is an important migratory corridor for the species at large, and that habitat conservation efforts in this region are necessary and valuable to Wood Thrush no matter where they breed,” the release said. 



Of the 27 tagged in Iowa last summer, 14 returned to the state during spring migration, according to the data.  
Some birds fly over a number of Motus stations during their migrations, like wood thrush 88620, which DNR reported was tagged at Brown’s Woods park in Des Moines before traveling through Missouri, down to José Cardel in Mexico. The bird then returned to Brown’s Woods park via Texas and then Missouri. 
DNR has tagged 10 more wood thrushes this year and hopes to continue the work to further understand the birds and “improve conservation efforts.” 
Individuals can support the Motus project by donating to cover the cost and maintenance of the antennae, or by hosting a Motus on their property. Information on applying to host can be found on the Motus website. 
Protect birds from reflective windows 
As fall migration season starts up in August, Iowans can take a couple of steps, some as simple as turning off the kitchen light at night, to keep birds from hitting windows. 

Cats and windows are the top human-related causes of mortality to birds in North America. And it’s not just skyscrapers that take out birds as they fly through a region. 
The Bird Collision Prevention Alliance reports more than 1 billion birds die from window collisions annually, and the American Bird Conservancy reported 44% of collisions occur with homes and buildings three stories tall or shorter. 
Birds can’t see windows, so reflections on a window, or a light on inside a window at night  can make it look like a habitat the bird can fly through. 
The best way to give birds a heads up? Decals, parachute-cord curtains, screens and even tempera paint can all be used to deter birds from trying to fly through a window. 
  There are a number of window treatments that can deter birds from window collisions. Top left: UV tape added to the outside of a window. Top Right: UV dots on the outside of a window. Bottom left: cord added to the outside of a window. Bottom right: the view from inside the treated window. (Photo illustration courtesy of DNR)
DNR suggests placing decals or cords about 2 inches apart on a window to make sure the birds don’t try to squeeze through any perceived gaps. Curtains and blinds inside can help, but the best solutions are placed outside of the glass to ensure the birds can see them. 
A large majority of bird migration happens at night, which is why turning the lights off at night can significantly reduce bird collisions. 
DNR recommends going dark between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. during peak migration months, which are April and May in spring and August through October in the fall. 
BirdCast also offers location specific, night migration forecasts and alerts for those more interested in knowing when, where and how many birds are flying overhead.

(Photo by Robin Bravender / States Newsroom)New Mexico’s senators in Congress have joined two dozen others in an effort to protect the private information submitted by undocumented people who came to the U.S. as children in order to receive protection from deportation.
U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich on Thursday announced that he and U.S. Sen. Ben Ray Luján, along with 24 other senators, have introduced the Protect DREAMer Confidentiality Act, which would prohibit the U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security from divulging to immigration authorities information disclosed in someone’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) application.
“I call on Congress to quickly take up and pass my legislation to make sure Dreamers are able to stay in school, keep working and contribute to our economy, and remain in their homes and neighborhoods,” Heinrich said in a statement.
The bill would also block DHS from referring anyone with deferred enforcement protections under DACA to any law enforcement.
Under the legislation, DHS could still share the information with national security and police agencies in order to identify or prevent fraud, and to investigate felony crimes, as long as they aren’t related to the applicant’s immigration status or for “particularized national security purposes.”
Approximately 825,000 people have received protection from deportation under DACA since 2021, according to Heinrich’s office.
“We need to ensure that Dreamers’ private information is not weaponized against them and is protected — full stop,” Heinrich said. 
In a news release, Heinrich’s office noted that DACA recipients have contributed an estimated $140 billion to the U.S. economy and $40 billion in federal, state and local taxes.
The bill’s introduction comes as the federal Internal Revenue Service is building a database of taxpayer records, including home addresses, to help ICE find and deport people, ProPublica reports. The Trump administration has also provided immigration authorities with Medicaid enrollees’ personal data.
Earlier this year, New Mexico enacted a new state law that prohibits the state Motor Vehicle Division employees from disclosing driver’s license data to any entity that would use it to enforce federal civil immigration laws, among other data protections.
“Dreamers in New Mexico and across the country are frontline health care workers, teachers, firefighters, police officers and scientists,” Heinrich said. “These inspiring young people are Americans in every sense of the word except on paper, and they want nothing more than to be productive members of their communities. Unfortunately, the Trump Administration doesn’t care about any of that and is indiscriminately sharing the private information of Dreamers.”

(Photo by Katherine Kealey/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Iowa’s public broadcasting networks are considering downsizing as they prepare for millions in lost funding included in the rescissions bill sent to President Donald Trump just after midnight Friday.
Every member of Iowa’s all-GOP federal delegation in the U.S. House and Senate voted in favor of the package, which cancels $9 billion in total previously approved spending, as it went through Congress this week to meet a Friday deadline. The cuts included in the bill are for foreign aid, including for projects through the now-closed U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), in addition to public broadcasting.
The measure cuts $1.1 billion for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which provides funding for National Public Radio and the Public Broadcasting Service as well as hundreds of local public stations throughout the country. Iowa Public Radio expects to lose roughly $1 million and Iowa PBS $3.5 million because of the rescissions bill, which covers the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 as well as the following year.

Myrna Johnson, executive director of IPR, said the state’s public radio service is looking at “a steep hill to climb in order to fill that gap” from the federal funding cuts. That funding will mean IPR will be asking its listeners and the community for more donations and assistance, but will also mean budget cuts.
The loss of $1 million, roughly 10% of IPR’s budget, will mean the radio network likely cannot fill open positions — including a reporter and music production position — and may have to consider “downsizing our office and studio footprints” of the four offices currently throughout the state, Johnson said.
“It just takes away the richness of what we have to offer to our listeners in terms of coverage of the state, (and) in the live music opportunities that we can share with our listeners,” she said.
The reduction will also mean taking out funding from critical infrastructure maintenance, Johnson said. While IPR typically sets aside a portion of its budget each for maintenance and updates of infrastructure, like transmitters, antennas and transmission lines at the state’s 27 stations, she said that funding will be reduced this year.
Iowa PBS General Manager Andrew Batt said the $3.5 million cut will be “the largest one time cut in public money to Iowa PBS in our 55-year history.”
While specific programs and services at will be impacted by the rescission cuts have not yet been determined, he said these federal funds have historically helped Iowa PBS maintain its statewide network of nine broadcast towers and pay for local programming including coverage of the state fair, high school state championship spots as well as acquiring national science, nature and children’s programming.
Batt said it’s difficult to know the full impact the funding cuts will have on “a half-century system when it is rescinded 60 days before the federal fiscal year,” but that the budget shortfalls will be “challenging.” Many of the difficulties caused by the lost funding may not be immediately seen by Iowa PBS viewers, he said, but will have limit the public broadcasting system’s ability to create and air programs that viewers care about.
“It could be six months, nine months before that programming starts to dry up,” Batt said. “So a lot of this work is that this federal defunding is immediate in the next 60 days, but the ramifications have cascading effects for six months, two years down the line, in some cases, before some people see them.”
Volunteer reading service also may be affected
The cuts may also have an impact on other organizations that work with the state’s public broadcasting networks, including the Iowa Radio Reading Information Service. The nonprofit, known as IRIS, is a service of volunteers who read aloud news published in newspapers and other written outlets so that Iowans with visual impairments can access their local news. IRIS broadcasts are transmitted throughout the state using the Iowa Public Radio and PBS broadcast systems — a service that could be affected by the cuts to these public broadcasting networks, Maryfrances Evans, the IRIS director, said.
Iowa Public Radio charges IRIS a “minimum fee” to carry its signal, Evans said — a relationship that allows IRIS to continue reaching Iowans, she said, as the organization is a small nonprofit with little budget and only one full-time employee, herself.
“Increasing those costs to us to carry our signal would be understandable, but it would be very difficult for us,” Evans said. She also added that reduced funding for maintenance could mean Iowans who rely on IRIS may face difficulties accessing the news, saying “if they are not able to keep their infrastructure up to speed, then they go down, we go down.”
IRIS provides an important service for thousands of Iowans with impairments and disabilities that affect their ability to read, Evans said — many of whom are elderly, or who live in areas without an internet connection.
“For a lot of people, they ask, ‘why can’t people just, you know, use their computer? Why can’t you just get text to speech on your computer and listen to articles that way?’ Well, again, we forget people who don’t have internet, or can’t afford it if they had it, or don’t have a computer, or whatever,” Evans said. “There is a large population of our elder brothers and sisters who would not be able to access the news without IRIS. The newspaper remains the best way to get hyper-local information in these small towns, — it’s your paper. … So absolutely, we are the only way for people who can’t see the paper to hear about the local things happening in their town.”
IPR is unlikely to have to make changes to its relationship with IRIS, Johnson said, but added that this service is one example of why public broadcasting systems are vital to the state. Another, she said, is managing the state’s emergency alerting system.
“We manage the system, the testing system, for the state of Iowa, so other stations then sort of pick up that signal,” Johnson said. “There are ways that we serve the public that are kind of behind the scenes, but that we’re very proud of.”
Some of Iowa’s federal delegation made statements in support of the funding cuts to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson said in a statement she was proud to support Trump’s effort to “end the culture of unchecked wasteful spending in Washington” by cutting funding going toward certain foreign aid efforts and for “Left-wing propaganda at NPR and PBS.”
Speaking on the U.S. Senate floor, U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa also spoke in support of the cuts to public broadcasting. She said “too often, these programs are partisan propaganda” on public broadcasting stations like NPR and PBS.
“NPR and PBS have a right to say whatever the heck they want, but they don’t have a right to force hardworking Americans to pay for their political propaganda being masked as a public service,” Ernst said.
Johnson said she believes NPR and public broadcasting stations throughout the country have “great editorial integrity” and report on stories that present both sides of an issue.
“I think everyone is trying to put media in buckets of sorts, of points of view,” she said. “And our goal is not to fit in any of those buckets.”

From 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. Thursday, members of United Nurses and Allied Professionals (UNAP) Local 5098 —w hich represents roughly 2,500 nurses, case managers and technical and support staff at the two hospitals — voted to ratify the agreement. 
“After a difficult series of negotiations, we are pleased to have reached an agreement that provides our members with a better contract,” Frank Sims, a registered nurse and president of Local 5098, said in a statement Thursday night.
The parties began to discuss a new contract in January, and talks stretched to 30 sessions in all. The previous contract expired on March 31.
Sims said the new deal includes wage increases, a lump-sum bonus, enhanced job security, and stronger rules around employee safety and workplace violence. He added that the union was “pleased” to approve the agreement after having rejected Brown Health’s “last, best, and final” offer when it arrived on June 6.  
“While this contract agreement is a step in the right direction, the future of health care in Rhode Island remains uncertain,” Sim said. “Our union will continue fighting every day to ensure the hard working nurses and health professionals at Rhode Island Hospital and Hasbro Children’s Hospital are protected and treated fairly, so we can retain and attract qualified nurses and health care professionals to care for our patients.”
The union voted to authorize a strike on June 23. But the strike never materialized, and the two parties forged a memorandum of understanding on July 3. That cleared the way for the successful ratification vote on Thursday. 
The hospital was also “pleased” with the deal, according to a statement issued Thursday night, about an hour and a half after the union released their own.  
“This outcome reflects the dedication and hard work of both bargaining teams and reaffirms our shared commitment to supporting our caregivers, advancing patient care, and strengthening our hospital for the communities we serve,” wrote Sarah Frost, chief of hospital operations and president at Rhode Island and Hasbro.
The hospital said Thursday it offered a market-competitive proposal that includes cost-of-living adjustments and competitive benefits plus other perks, for a package totaling $50 million over three years. 
The new contract will expire on March 31, 2028.

(Elise Plunk/Louisiana Illuminator.)The long-controversial Mid-Barataria Sediment Diversion project was officially canceled Thursday, bringing to an end the battle over the largest and most expensive effort to build land along Louisiana’s sinking coastline. 
The Louisiana Coastal Restoration and Protection Authority confirmed the project would no longer be moving forward in a statement on Thursday. CPRA chairman Gordon Dove, in a phone call Friday, added that while CPRA “remains committed to coastal restoration,” the keystone project would be ended in its current form.   
Proponents of the Mid-Barataria Sediment Diversion emphasised the wealth of scientific research that went into the planning for the axed project, as well as the urgency of stemming Louisiana’s rapid wetlands loss with the nearly 20 square miles of land the project expected to build over the next 50 years. 
Political battles over the increasing cost of the nearly $3 billion plan and its impact on industries such as oyster harvesting were key elements that led to the eventual death of the project. Those in the oyster industry laud it as a victory for their livelihoods, while environmentalists and scientists lament the loss as a massive backwards step for coastal restoration. 
“ We needed Mid-Barataria, frankly, many decades ago. It was a really big deal that it was under construction finally, and we had the resources to do it. And now all of that is cast aside,” said Amanda Moore, senior director of the Gulf Program at the National Wildlife Federation. 
Over a football field of land is lost along the coast every 100 minutes, attributed to a wide variety of factors including sea level rise, subsidence and overengineering of sediment-carrying rivers such as the Mississippi. Sediment diversions aim to reconnect the river with wetlands and mimic the way it naturally used to build land. 
“The need has not changed. There’s only one thing that has changed and that is the political landscape, so that is what ended this project,” said James Karst of the Coalition to Restore Coastal Louisiana. 
For Karst and many others, the cancellation of the project didn’t come as a surprise. Gov. Jeff Landry openly opposed the project, saying its impact on Louisiana fisheries would “break our culture,” as his administration took steps to slow its progress. 
“We kind of knew it was going to get canceled,” said Peter Vujnovich, a third-generation oyster harvester based in Port Sulphur, adding that he’s “glad” for fewer “negative impacts on people that make a living out and about on the water.”
Vujnovich said his hopes for the success of future coastal restoration projects “depends on how they move forward. He added that he wants to see the forces who planned the Mid-Barataria project more actively involve communities and “include everybody,” like oyster harvesters, in future efforts. 
The project’s budget did set aside $400 million to mitigate impacts to local communities, including the oyster industry, though many opponents felt it wasn’t enough. 
“Hopefully, they’ll learn from this,” Vujnovich said. 
Mitch Jurisich, chairman of Louisiana’s Oyster Task Force, gave a “hallelujah” in response to the project’s death. He credits Landry’s involvement as a turning point in the effort to sink the Mid-Barataria coastal restoration plan. 
“Gov. Landry and chairman Gordy Dove with CPRA, they joined forces with us,” he said. “They basically turned the tide by stepping in with us.”
In a statement announcing the cancellation, the Trustees Implementation Group responsible for overseeing the funds provided for the project said CPRA determined “the project is no longer viable due to multiple factors, including the suspension of a federal permit by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and ongoing litigation.” 
Construction of the project started in 2023, but it faces lawsuits from Plaquemines Parish and oystermen trying to halt it. In April, Dove ordered a pause on all work related to the project. A few weeks later, the Army Corps of Engineers suspended one of its permits. 
In a letter to CPRA, the corps said it suspended the permit for a variety of reasons, including a shift in the state’s commitment to the project, the ongoing lawsuits and claiming the state “deliberately withheld” information the corps needed for its environmental impact statement. 
The last factor instigated a social media firefight between Landry and former Gov. John Bel Edwards, with an X post from Landry harkening the issue to a real-life “John Grisham” novel exposé and balking at the high cost. 
The project was already funded with $3 billion set aside in the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Trust, which came from the settlement from the BP oil spill disaster that devastated the Gulf Coast and the industries it supports in 2010. 
In the past, Dove has suggested a smaller, cheaper version of the diversion, which could include channeling the Mississippi’s sediment and fresh water at a rate anywhere from 5 to 30 times less than the 75,000 cubic feet per second called for in the Mid-Barataria plans.
“We haven’t heard any complete replacement plan … I think when you’ve got a problem of this magnitude, going with a smaller, less effective tool to do the work, you gotta think about whether that makes sense,” Karst said.
Jurisich said he is in favor of a smaller diversion. 
“We may look at a small freshwater diversion here or there, just to kind of nourish the newly created land. But you know, we killed the beast that was going to kill us, and that’s the best,” he said. 
The state has already authorized more than $600,000 for the Mid-Barataria diversion, and the remainder will now be used to close out the project. The rest of the money will return to the Deepwater Horizon trust to be used for future coastal restoration projects, which will need to go through a new approval process. 
Moore, with the National Wildlife Federation, said by canceling the Mid-Barataria project, the state is not only losing arguably the most important project in its Coastal Master Plan to fight land loss, but also the decades of planning and resources that went into it. 
 ”Time is something that is really worrisome to us because it took us decades to get a project like this moving forward,” she said. “And for Louisiana’s coast, I think you’re gonna be looking at least a decade or more if you’re gonna see something else come through.”",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_8626-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-18 17:58:06.323537

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota Public Broadcasting is bracing for potential cuts and layoffs after Congress canceled $1.1 billion in previously approved nationwide funding for public media.
The federal funding went to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which distributes money to local stations. SDPB depends on $2.2 million in annual funding from the corporation, which is about 20% of SDPB’s budget. State funds account for a little more than half of SDPB’s budget, while fundraising, private donations and other sources make up the rest.
Because the federal funding was previously approved, SDPB was counting on it to arrive in the months ahead.
“I don’t think it’s realistic to raise an additional $2.2 million on 75 days’ notice,” said Ryan Howlett, CEO of Friends of SDPB, a nonprofit that raises money for SDPB. He added that donor support increased in recent weeks.
US House sends bill to Trump yanking funding for NPR, PBS, foreign aid; SD congressman votes yes

SDPB provides non-commercial public radio and television across South Dakota. In addition to news coverage, the organization provides live video and audio feeds of legislative and state government meetings, educational content, cultural programming, high school activities broadcasts, and emergency alerts across the state.
The congressional legislation, which President Donald Trump is expected to sign into law, also cancels $8 billion in foreign aid. It’s the second time in more than three decades that Congress approved a presidential recission request. 
Julie Overgaard, SDPB executive director, said if funding isn’t replaced, the organization will reduce staff by 20 to 25%. South Dakota Public Broadcasting employs about 60 people, meaning up to 15 people could lose their jobs.
Overgaard said she was raised on “Sesame Street” and “Mr. Rogers’ Neighborhood” in a “poor rural household” in northwest Iowa. She said public broadcasting is what readied her for school, since she didn’t have access to the same resources as more affluent, urban areas of the state.
Overgaard said the cuts will have “real, long-lasting, damaging impacts” on South Dakota. Trump and some congressional Republicans have accused National Public Radio and the Public Broadcasting Service of bias in their news coverage. 
“I don’t think this is about bias in media,” Overgaard said in an SDPB interview. “I think this is about trying to shutter and change people’s access to information, to public safety, to education, to things that make a big, big difference.”
Rounds, Johnson explain support for recission
The three members of Congress from South Dakota, who are all Republicans, each voted in favor of rescinding the funding for public broadcasting.
Sen. Mike Rounds announced his support after securing a handshake deal earlier this week with the White House budget director to transfer $9.4 million to Native American radio stations in rural areas across 11 states.
In a statement to South Dakota Searchlight, Rounds said SDPB and tribal stations both provide critical alerts and public safety information for the state. But he said tribal radio stations receive up to 92% of their operating budgets from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.
“These rural tribal stations that provide potentially lifesaving alerts would not survive without assistance from the federal government,” Rounds said. “SDPB receives financial support through donations to Friends of SDPB that assist with their operating costs.


Let us know what you think...


 

Rounds also said in a press release that with “nearly $37 trillion in federal debt, we must preserve essential services but also take meaningful steps to reduce wasteful spending.”
Overgaard said she was surprised to see Rounds rally funding for tribal radio stations but not other rural broadcasters.
Native Public Media CEO Loris Taylor wrote in an editorial that the organization is grateful for Sen. Rounds proposing alternatives, but said the solution found “is neither administratively feasible nor fiscally sustainable in the short term.”
Rep. Dusty Johnson “understands the importance of public broadcasting in South Dakota,” said spokesperson Kristen Blakely, and he applauded Rounds’ effort to help tribes. Johnson said in an interview with C-SPAN this week that he had concerns about the impact on rural and reservation areas of the state. Rounds’ deal made adjustments regarding those concerns, he said. 
The office of Senate Majority Leader John Thune did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
SDPB doesn’t expect state to fill funding gap
SDPB escaped then-Gov. Kristi Noem’s proposed $3.6 million cut in state funding this winter. State dollars pay for the infrastructure and engineering of the public media network. Friends of SDPB largely pays for national programming, while grants from the corporation support local programming.
Lawmakers on budget committee reject Noem’s public broadcasting cut

Overgaard said there was resounding support from the public and Legislature for SDPB during the legislative session.
“If you take away one leg of our three-legged stool, it puts a lot of pressure on the other two legs to pick up the slack,” Overgaard said.
State Rep. Jack Kolbeck, R-Sioux Falls, sits on the legislative budget committee and fought against the proposed state cut. The committee will meet next week, where Kolbeck hopes to hear more about how the federal cuts will affect SDPB.
“I listen to SDPB a lot,” Kolbeck said. “I’m not in favor of them getting to the point where they can’t operate.”
Overgaard doesn’t expect the state or its taxpayers to “be forced or make up for the decisions our congressional delegation made.” She plans to advocate for public media funding in the upcoming federal budget process and seek other funding sources, such as donations and grants.
“I know it’s going to be another tight budget year. I will not be asking or expecting them to come up with $2 million,” Overgaard said of legislators. “We will have to solve that ourselves.”

(Photo by Anna Paige/Fargo Forum pool photo)A jury of nine men and three women on Friday convicted Democratic Sen. Nicole Mitchell of felony burglary and possession of burglary tools, concluding a case that has roiled the closely divided Minnesota Senate for over a year.
The jury deliberated for just over three hours Friday and asked no questions of the judge.
Mitchell faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison for the burglary charge. She faces a maximum sentence of three years in prison for the burglary tools conviction.
The verdict will almost certainly change the makeup of the state Senate, where Democrats currently hold a 34-33 majority. If Mitchell resigns, she’ll be replaced in a special election in what has been a solidly blue district in the past decade. If not, the Senate can expel her with a two-thirds vote, but they are not scheduled to come into session until next year. Only Gov. Tim Walz can call a special session.
Senate Majority Leader Erin Murphy, DFL-St. Paul, called on Mitchell to resign, for the first time, once the verdict was reached Friday: “Sen. Mitchell has told colleagues that she intended to resign if found guilty of this crime, and I expect her to follow through on that pledge. Our caucus remains focused on the issues that matter to Minnesotan families and communities.”
Carol Mitchell, whose house Nicole Mitchell entered without permission and is the stepmother of the accused, was in the courtroom Friday to witness the verdict, her first presence since she testified Tuesday. She hugged her son after the verdict was read.
Throughout the five-day trial, the state asserted that Mitchell, a first term senator, was intent on stealing her late father’s possessions from her stepmother when she broke into Detroit Lakes the home in April 2024. Prosecutors’ main evidence was that she told police officers as much during her arrest.
The senator said on the witness stand that she drove the 220 miles from her home in Woodbury to her stepmother’s Detroit Lakes home to conduct a welfare check. Mitchell testified in her own defense Thursday, saying she has witnessed her stepmother’s mental decline because of Alzheimer’s disease, and that she she was concerned that Carol Mitchell wasn’t receiving the attention and care she needed.
Mitchell said she lied to police about her intentions — and made up wanting to steal her father’s possessions — to allay her stepmother’s paranoia.
“The defense has repeatedly classified this as a welfare check. You’ve seen all the evidence, the time of night, the outfit, the tools. What does your reason and common sense tell you?” Becker County Attorney Brian McDonald asked the jury in his closing statement.
Mitchell’s explanation of lying to police to refrain from exacerbating Carol’s paranoia defied common sense, McDonald said.
Mitchell has admitted she entered the home without permission her defense said she would have pleaded guilty to a trespassing charge. But she has unequivocally denied stealing anything from the home, and multiple police officers testified that they didn’t find anything in Mitchell’s possession that was stolen property.
Under Minnesota law, a person doesn’t need to steal anything to be convicted of burglary, however. The law requires that a person enter a dwelling without permission with the intent to commit a crime of theft.
McDonald argued that Nicole Mitchell would have stolen her father’s flannel shirt and other possessions, but she was accosted by police.
“Of course she didn’t have anything on her. She got interrupted,” McDonald told the jury.

Carol Mitchell was in the courtroom Friday to witness the verdict, her first presence since she testified Tuesday. She hugged her son after the verdict was read.
Dane DeKrey, Mitchell’s defense attorney, told reporters he had “no idea” whether Mitchell will resign from the Senate. DeKrey said the biggest hurdle for the defense during the trial was the footage from police officers’ body-worn cameras and what Nicole Mitchell told police during her arrest. When asked if Mitchell’s attorneys will appeal the verdict, DeKrey said, “I imagine the answer is yes.”

(Senate webcast)TOPEKA — The federal government has renewed efforts to gather personal data of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program recipients in Kansas, giving the state a July 30 deadline to respond.
The Kansas Department for Children and Families received the request on July 9, said spokeswoman Jenalea Randall. 
“We are still reviewing the published notice in order to understand the intent behind this request and how the data will be used,” she said. “Our obligation to maintain these records in confidence is paramount, and they may only be disclosed to the USDA for specific program-related reasons.” 
U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins sent the letter to states, once again demanding private information about SNAP recipients, including Social Security numbers and home addresses, to be turned over by July 30. 
The information was necessary to comply with President Donald Trump’s executive order that each federal agency access data from all state programs that receive federal funding, Rollins said in the letter. 
Nationally, the demand is being challenged in court by students, SNAP recipients, the Electronic Privacy Information Center and MAZON: A Jewish Response to Hunger. On Thursday, the group filed a motion asking for a restraining order to stop the latest attempt at data collection while the lawsuit is pending, according to a press release. 
The Trump administration initially asked for the data in May, and DCF denied it. In a letter to a third-party data provider, DCF’s Carla Whiteside-Hicks, director of economic and employment services, said the agency has an obligation to maintain the records in confidence. 
“At this time, we are unsure as to the reason for the USDA’s request. As such, we are unable to consent to your turning the information over,” she wrote.
Plaintiffs in the lawsuit contend that in a sworn declaration dated May 30, a top USDA official at the agency promised it would not move forward without following federal laws.
Instead, the agency made this new demand, which the plaintiffs in the case said violates the Privacy Act, Paperwork Reduction Act and the Administrative Procedure Act.
“This Administration is trying to work the system,” said Madeline Wiseman, counsel at the National Student Legal Defense Network, in a press release. “After promising in court to follow proper procedures, USDA’s actions out of the courtroom continue to demonstrate a disregard for the legal requirements that limit its ability to collect and use this data. This lawlessness must be stopped.”
Randall said a hearing in the lawsuit is set for July 23, 2025, to address the temporary restraining order the plaintiffs have requested.
The Trump administration, through the Department of Justice, also is attempting to access other sensitive data from voter registrations, according to Stateline. 
So far, no requests have been made in Kansas, said Whitney Tempel, spokeswoman for Secretary of State Scott Schwab. 
“While we’ve had discussions with the Department of Justice about general voter roll maintenance, they have not requested access to our voter data,” she said in an email. “We explained Kansas’ voter roll maintenance to DOJ, how we remove for death, non-citizen, felony, moving, etc.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/brookerollinsmay62025-1024x598.jpg,,,2025-07-18 17:58:06.323537

Both of New Jersey’s U.S. senators and all nine New Jersey House Democrats oppose the move to house detained immigrants at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, with most of them signing a statement Friday calling the plan an “inappropriate use of our national defense system and military resources.”
“Using our country’s military to detain and hold undocumented immigrants jeopardizes military preparedness and paves the way for ICE immigration raids in every New Jersey community. We have the greatest military in the world and using it as a domestic political tool is unacceptable and shameful,” the statement reads.
The news surfaced this week via a letter U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth sent to Rep. Herb Conaway (D-03), whose district includes the base, commonly known as Fort Dix. The letter was first reported by NJ Spotlight News.
Hegseth’s letter says detaining immigrants at Fort Dix will not negatively affect military training, operations, readiness, or other military requirements. The federal government also intends to house detained immigrants at an Army camp in Indiana.
The move could represent a massive expansion of immigrant detention in New Jersey. Earlier this year, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement began housing detained immigrants at a 1,000-bed facility in Newark. Immigrants picked up by ICE are also held at a private jail in Elizabeth.
A new federal spending bill signed into law by President Trump earlier this month increases funding to carry out Trump’s immigration agenda, with $45 million alone for new detention facilities.
It’s not clear how many detainees the federal government intends to house at Fort Dix. More than 11,000 Afghan refugees lived there temporarily four years ago after their chaotic evacuation from Afghanistan.
Immigration advocates have expressed concerns about the conditions inside ICE detention centers, and say the Fort Dix plan is part of a strategy to remove public oversight of Trump’s deportation push.
“Unlike New Jersey’s two private detention centers, Fort Dix will operate entirely under federal control, shielding it from accountability and making it nearly impossible for advocates, attorneys, and families to monitor conditions or support detained individuals,” the New Jersey Alliance for Immigrant Justice said in a statement.
New Jersey officials also raised opposition to a reported Biden administration plan in 2023 to relocate some of the tens of thousands of asylum seekers living in New York City to the Atlantic City airport.

Susan Valdés speaking at the Cuban Club in Tampa's Ybor City on July 18, 2025. (Photo by Don Kruse for the Florida Phoenix)TAMPA — Although it’s been more than seven months since Hillsborough County state Rep. Susan Valdés flipped to the Republican Party, that departure remains raw with some of her former Democratic colleagues, as emotions spilled out Friday during a discussion of the just concluded Florida legislative session.
“The thing is, unfortunately, the Democratic Party left me a long time ago,” she said when asked by a member of the audience at the Tampa Tiger Bay meeting whether she would have left the Democratic Party if it had held the majority in Tallahassee — something that hasn’t been the case in nearly three decades.
What Valdés didn’t say, though, was that her conversion to the Republican Party in Demember, shortly following the 2024 elections, came just a week after she lost a bid to chair the Hillsborough County Democratic Executive Committee.
The New York City-born daughter of Cuban immigrants who has represented an Hispanic-leaning district in western Hillsborough County since 2018, Valdés alleged that Hispanics were “always an afterthought” in the Florida Democratic Party. Right now, only two Hispanics serve in the Democratic caucus: Osceola County Rep. Jose Alvarez and Orange County Rep. Johanna López.
 No regrets
“If the Democratic Party were in the majority, and they would still be behaving the way that they were behaving without paying attention to the needs of the Hispanic community, yes, I’d change as well,” she maintained. 
Valdés boasted that by switching to the Republican Party of Florida, she was able to accomplish “in four months what I was not able to accomplish in seven years.” She referred specifically to her ability as a member of the majority to pass a bill (HB 1105) ending the certificate of completion given to lower-performing students in place of a diploma — a longtime goal for her going back to her years serving on the Hillsborough County School Board.
Valdes called it a “participation trophy” that essentially told students “Thank you — and you have no future.”
Democratic House Leader Fentrice Driskell, sitting to the immediate right of Valdés during the discussion, fired back immediately.
“I think it’s very unfair to voters to have asked for their vote one week to be a member of the Democratic Party and the next week or two to switch that,” Driskell said. “I think regardless of how it felt to me personally as a friend and a leader, it’s about what’s fair to the voters, and I think just also, you know, the Democratic Party is a broad coalition, and I just want to reject the sentiment that the Hispanic community was an afterthought. Absolutely not.”
Driskell added that she had worked with Valdés to build up a Spanish language media and communications strategy. Valdés countered that since she left the party, that communications program no longer exists.
She added that, as a Republican, she was able to bring “millions of dollars back to the district.” That comment triggered Tampa Democratic Rep. Dianne Hart.
“If you’re in the Democratic Party and you’re in the superminority and you have an opportunity to move over to the majority, of course you get more money,” she said. “Do you have any idea what kind of money Democrats were able to bring home from Tallahassee? Darn near nothing.”
Hart mentioned that Valdés had worked with her on criminal justice reform over the years, saying she would have hoped that with Valdés now a Republican she could have helped influence the governor when it came to a measure Hart sponsored (HB 181) that passed unanimously this session. It would have allowed a limited number of state inmates to receive early release from prison. DeSantis vetoed the proposal, saying that it “would likely result in making Florida’s parole system more lenient.”
“Not a single time did you even reach out to try and see if you can help, but you were in that position [as] vice chair as a member of the Budget Committee,” Hart said.
Staying above the fray
The two other Democrats on the dais, Tampa Bay area Rep. Michele Rayner and Sen. Darryl Rouson, opted not to engage directly on Valdés’ party switch.
“I think that the conversation can become unhelpful when we begin to personalize it, because, at the end of the day, there is an affordability crisis in the state of Florida,” Rayner said.
“I believe that when the voters elected me, they elected me to be effective. They elected me to bring results, and not just go up and run my mouth,” said Rouson, who has served in the Legislature since 2008. “I have found a way to remain a Democrat but work both sides of the aisle.”
Valdés’ flip to the Republican Party was followed just a few weeks later by another House Democrat, Rep. Hillary Cassel, jettisoning the party and reducing the number of Democrats in the 120-member to just 33. Cassel will face the voters for the first time next year in her district as a Republican, but Valdés is term-limited in her House District 64 seat. She has not said publicly whether she is considering another run for office in 2026.

Crawford County and County Judge Chris Keith filed a notice of appeal and a request to stay the monetary judgment on Thursday in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Arkansas. Keith and the county were among the defendants, along with Arkansas’ 26 prosecuting attorneys, in 18 plaintiffs’ challenge of two sections of Act 372 of 2023.
U.S. District Judge Timothy Brooks permanently blocked the challenged sections in December, determining they violated the First Amendment. In addition to giving city and county governing bodies authority over library content, Act 372 would also have altered libraries’ material reconsideration processes and created criminal liability for librarians who distribute content that some consider “obscene” or “harmful to minors.”

Crawford County Library will foot the bill for lawsuit over segregation of LGBTQ+ children’s books

 

Crawford County and Keith were among the defendants that lost a separate lawsuit over library content in September. U.S. District Judge P.K. Holmes ruled in favor of three parents who claimed the Crawford County Library’s segregation of LGBTQ+ children’s books into separate “social sections” violated the First Amendment.
The case was reassigned from Holmes to Brooks, who ordered the defendants to pay the plaintiffs nearly $113,000. The Crawford County Quorum Court voted unanimously in April to accept the library’s governing board’s offer to pay the fees. The board was among the defendants along with Keith, the county, the quorum court and county library director Charlene McDonnough.
In May, Brooks ordered the defendants in the Act 372 case to reimburse the plaintiffs $441,646.49 in total.
“At this time, the Plaintiffs and Crawford County have been unable to reach a settlement for the fees and costs,” the county’s attorneys wrote in Thursday’s motion to stay the execution of the payment. “Therefore, Crawford County will appeal the award of attorney fees and costs.”

Crawford County stay 
Twice last year, the Crawford County defendants asked Brooks to dismiss them from the Act 372 lawsuit. Brooks denied the motions, ruling that the county and Keith would be responsible for implementing Act 372 if it went into effect and if appeals of challenged material reached the county government.
Attorney General Tim Griffin appealed the ruling on behalf of the rest of the Act 372 defendants in January.
Crawford County officials cited Act 372 as a reason to maintain the library’s “social sections” of LGBTQ+ children’s books that only adults could access. McDonnough’s predecessor, Deidre Grzymala, created the sections as a “compromise” after public outcry between December 2022 and January 2023, a few months before Act 372 became law.
In May, Grzymala sued Crawford County and a member of the library board, alleging defamation and breach of contract over her February 2023 resignation and severance package.

The incursion of parasitic fly into Mexico has interrupted livestock border trade for the last several months and is poised to continue. (Danielle Prokop / Source NM)The nation’s largest border crossing for livestock between the U.S. and Mexico — in Santa Teresa, New Mexico — will not reopen as planned Monday, and is indefinitely delayed after further detection this month of the parasitic New World screwworm.
The crossing has been closed since May 11 when U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins announced the immediate suspension of live cattle, horse and bison imports through the U.S., following the detection of the pest in southern Mexico states of Oaxaca and Veracruz, about 700 miles from the border. After the May closures, the USDA released a plan in early July to pursue staggered reopenings of livestock border crossings, which would have opened Santa Teresa on July 21.
However, unexplained cases detected further north in Mexico than expected re-closed all border crossings, New Mexico Department of Agriculture Secretary Jeff Witte told Source NM. While the ongoing closure’s direct impact on New Mexico agriculture is small, it has big implications for beef nationwide.
“Most of the cattle that come in through Santa Teresa end up going to other states’ feed lots or pastures, destined for places like Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska,” Witte said via a telephone interview. “At one time there were trucks from 17 different states picking cattle up.”
The movement of the parasitic fly, previously eradicated from the U.S. for the last several decades, has disrupted international cattle trade through New Mexico, Arizona and Texas in the last several months. The screwworm’s name references the maggot’s behavior of burrowing into the flesh of a living animal, sometimes causing serious or fatal damage to livestock, wildlife and pets. Human cases, while rare, have been documented.
The USDA also announced the construction of an $8.5 million facility to raise sterilized flies to prevent further breeding in the wild, located at Moore Air Base in Mission, Texas and an additional $21 million for producing more sterile files at a facility in Metapa, Mexico. USDA also said it would further increase monitoring and data-sharing with Mexico officials along the border.
However, Mexico’s agricultural agents detected a new case farther north in Veracruz, just 370 miles away from the border on July 7, prompting USDA to scrap the reopening plan.
“The United States has promised to be vigilant — and after detecting this new NWS case, we are pausing the planned port reopening to further quarantine and target this deadly pest in Mexico,” Rollins said in a written July 9 statement. “We must see additional progress combating NWS in Veracruz and other nearby Mexican states in order to reopen livestock ports along the Southern border.”
Daniel Manzanares, the director of the Santa Teresa international crossing, told Source NM that USDA has not said when the reopening will happen.
The crossing is privately owned by the Unión Ganadera Regional De Chihuhua Co-op, often moving cattle from Northern Mexico — in Chihuahua and Sonora — into U.S. feed lots. The pest has not been detected in the northern portion of Mexico, but cattle still can’t cross.
In prior years, about 270,000 animals would have crossed through the border by now, Manzanares said. This year, with the closures, only one third, or 74,000 have made it across, necessitating lay offs of half of the 32 hired hands for transporting cattle.
“It’s just severely impacted all kinds of industry down here, from the truckers that drive to the buyers, the cattle brokers, we’ve laid off employees that won’t come back,” he said. “It’s just breaking a lot of people.”

More than two weeks since the attempted rollout, VTBuys, a digital platform intended to radically simplify how the state contracts and pays bills, is not yet live.

The launch of a sweeping new system for Vermont government contracting stumbled earlier this month when state IT staff discovered “security-related issues” and other bugs during its rollout, internal emails reviewed by VTDigger indicate. 
The botched debut means state employees are left managing day-to-day operations using a contingency plan. The staff team implementing VTBuys has urged workers across departments to hold off on non-urgent invoices, stop working with new suppliers if possible, and delay new contracts, according to the emails. The stopgap protocols require documenting a variety of processes that will need to be re-input once the new system rolls out.  
VTBuys is a joint project of the Vermont Department of Buildings and General Services — which houses the state’s Office of Purchasing and Contracting — and the Vermont Agency of Digital Services, which takes a leadership role on state IT projects. 
The new digital platform is intended to modernize the way Vermont state government works with vendors, creating a single streamlined interface for bids, contracts and payments. The system “will be a single-stop shop for businesses to register as suppliers, submit all paperwork, sign up for bid notifications, and complete all of their transactions with the state,” as described by the department on its website 
In an interview, Wanda Minoli, commissioner of the Department of Buildings and General Services, called the initiative “a radical change in how we pay bills and do contracts.”
She described this month’s hiccups as routine. 
 “You’ll have that with every project,” Minoli said. “This is a good thing, not a bad thing.”
The massive redesign of how the state works with vendors began in 2019. The state inked a $6.4 million contract with multinational company KPMG for the project, with an additional “software solution service” contract valued at $595,000 per year, Minoli said. 
The Agency of Digital Services maintains a public-facing dashboard with details about state IT initiatives. The interface had listed the VTBuys implementation cost at about $17.2 million. But when VTDigger inquired, an agency spokesperson said the implementation cost was actually half that, and the dashboard has since been changed. The project is listed as 17 months behind an “initial completion date.” 
The House Committee on Energy and Digital Services crafted a law this year requiring more detailed information on ongoing projects moving forward.

Early on, the VTBuys project hit a number of delays as BGS responded to emergencies, first related to the Covid-19 pandemic and then the 2023 flooding, which damaged 22 state buildings in Montpelier. Repairs to those buildings have been a top priority for Buildings and General Services, according to Minoli. 
As the combined Building and General Services and Agency of Digital Services team got closer to launch this year, they set a July 1 target. The idea was that by coinciding with the new fiscal year, the change would be less disruptive, Minoli said. 
But the day of the rollout, the implementation team discovered immediate problems. 
“Due to a technical issue, the VTBuys rolling ‘go live’ will not begin today,” the team wrote to state employees on July 1. “We will share the revised timeline for our rolling launch as soon as possible.”
More than two weeks later, the timeline still isn’t clear. Minoli declined to share when the new system might go live. 
On July 11, the project team conveyed additional issues about the launch to employees across state government. 
“After careful consideration of the ongoing challenges with the deployment and delays in achieving a successful go-live of the VTBuys system, the State executive leadership has made the decision to discontinue all efforts related to the production deployment of the system,” wrote Stacy Gibson-Grandfield, director of the Agency of Digital Service’s enterprise project management office. 
The new goal was restoring the previous financial management system called VISION.
“State IT staff are now directed to focus on reverting functionality back to VISION without delay,” the email said. “Restoring VISION to its normal function is our top priority, ensuring that business offices can operate seamlessly … to avoid any financial impacts.”
On July 14, state IT leaders said security issues had been resolved, but bugs remained. Minoli said Wednesday that seven out of 12 bugs identified had been fixed. 
Despite the rocky start, Minoli remains optimistic about VTBuys. She said once the system is operational, vendors will no longer have to re-input the same information over and over, and disparate processes will be consolidated into one platform.
“It is going to change how we can do business,” the commissioner said.

With a June unemployment rate of 2.8%, unchanged from last month, Montana has now seen nine straight years of rates under 3%, and four years below 3.4%.
The governor’s office and Department of Labor and Industry continue to laud the low seasonally adjusted unemployment rate, as it had only dropped below 3% on three occasions since the rate started being measured in the 1970s.
The statewide rate is a full 1.3% below the U.S. average for June.
“With more Montanans working now than ever before and historically low unemployment, we’re seeing the results of our pro-jobs policies,” Gov. Gianforte said. “This month marks a new record stretch of four years of low unemployment and reinforces Montana’s reputation as one of the nation’s best places to live, work, and raise a family.”
Gianforte first took office in January 2021, a month that saw unemployment at 4% statewide — down from a COVID-pandemic high of 11.9% in April 2020, but higher than pre-pandemic numbers. Unemployment dropped for nine consecutive months, and has remained below 3.4% since July 2021.
The state said the labor force in Montana decreased by 752 workers last month. Data shows the state has lost 500 jobs during the month with losses in retail and wholesale trade, private education, healthcare, administrative and support services, and federal government employment.
Fifty of the state’s counties currently have unemployment rates below 4%, but only six of them have seen net job gains during the last year year, according to data from the Department of Labor and Industry.

Chuck Grassley is second from the right. (Official White House Photo by Daniel Torok)This week in the nation’s capital, President Donald Trump signed a fentanyl reclassification act led by Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, Iowa legislators cheered the passing of a federal rescission bill through Congress and House members helped send a $832 billion defense appropriations bill through the GOP-led chamber.
The Grassley-led HALT Act permanently reclassifies fentanyl-related substances as a Schedule 1 drug. In February 2020, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration issued a temporary scheduling order reclassifying fentanyl-related substances to Schedule 1. Congress has since extended this order a total of 10 times. 
The act has received criticism from advocacy groups such as the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights stating that classwide drug rescheduling may exacerbate incarceration rates and sentencing. 
The president’s signing of the HALT Act Wednesday was attended by several Iowa officials including Grassley, Attorney General Brenna Bird and Rep. Randy Feenstra. 
“The HALT Fentanyl Act is now the law of the land, marking a major victory in America’s fight against fentanyl,” Grassley said in a press release. “By permanently classifying fentanyl-related substances as Schedule I, the HALT Fentanyl Act will save American lives and prevent deadly fentanyl knockoffs from making their way into Iowa communities.”
“This bill is a huge win for Iowa and the entire country,” Bird said in a press release. “As a mom and prosecutor, I am deeply aware of the devastating effects fentanyl has had on our communities. And as Attorney General, I hear about this issue from Iowans regularly.  
“I applaud President Trump for signing into law the HALT Fentanyl Act and taking decisive action to keep fentanyl and other poisonous substances out of our country.” Feenstra stated. “In conjunction with our work to secure the border, this legislation will help law enforcement confiscate dangerous drugs, combat the drug cartels, and save lives.”
Rep. Ashley Hinson stated: “This bill will help end the scourge of the opioid epidemic that has taken too many American lives — we will continue working together to get dangerous drugs off our streets & ensure dealers are punished for their crimes.” 
Rep. Zach Nunn also stated he “proudly cosigned” the HALT act for its ability to “crack down on traffickers,” keep “deadly substances off our streets” and ensure consistent penalties for fentanyl distributors. 
Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks stated in a press release: “As an original cosponsor in the House, I was proud to help lead the fight to get this bill across the finish line. With this law in place, we’re going on offense. We’re giving law enforcement what they need to crack down, take control, and stop this poison from claiming more lives.”
Miller-Meeks also reintroduced a bipartisan bill Thursday requiring social media companies and other communication service providers to alert law enforcement officials when illegal drug distributions occur on their platforms.
Iowa legislators praise cuts to foreign aid, public media 
All of Iowa’s delegates voted in favor of Trump’s rescission bill to axe $9 billion in previously approved funding for programs including the U.S. Agency for International Aid, The Corporation for Public Broadcasting and National Public Radio.
The rescission bill passed both chambers of Congress Friday with a vote of 51-48 in the Senate and 216-213 in the House. This marks the second time in over three decades Congress has approved a presidential rescission request.
Ernst praised the cuts to USAID, citing “abuses” such as an alleged $148,000 sent to a pickle-maker in Ukraine through USAID and $20 million spent on Sesame Street programming in Iraq.
“If we are ever going to get serious about our debt crisis, Congress needs to pass a rescissions bill like this every single week,” she stated in a press release.
Hinson responded to the bill with a statement on X: “President Trump is the first president to actually deliver on real savings for the American people and end the culture of wasteful spending in Washington.”
Grassley took to X as well to state “Fed govt is $36 TRILLION in debt Last night Sen Republicans voted to roll back DC’s out of control spending.” He added that Republicans plan to build on the provisions in the “big, beautiful bill” going forward. 
Miller-Meeks called the rescission cuts a one of two “big wins for the American people” in an X post. She also cheered the passing of a defense appropriations bill increasing military spending. 
Democrats in both the House and Senate voted against passing the rescission bill. Several Democratic legislators criticized the rescission bill for cutting funding from public broadcasting that will impact rural news sources and withdrawing U.S. support from countries in need.
Ernst spearheads amendment to defense appropriations bill
Ernst led an amendment to the defense appropriations bill to require all defense spending be posted on the public website USAspending.gov. 
This amendment will directly target “Other Transaction Agreements” which are flexible spending agreements not subject to standard acquisition laws and requirements.
“I am ending Pentagon bureaucrats’ game of hide and seek with your tax dollars,” Ernst stated in a press release. “Americans have a right to know where their hard-earned dollars are going. I’ve long been working to make the Pentagon more transparent and accountable and will continue to work to review the hidden receipts.” 
The expansive defense bill passed through the House with a split vote of 221-209 on Friday. It allocates nearly $832 billion for provisions such as: 

Basic pay increase for all military members by 3.8% starting 2026
Codifies Trump’s executive order to end military diversity, equity and inclusion programs
$13 billion for missile defense and space programs
$7 billion for “classified space superiority programs.”
$2.6 billion for hypersonic missiles.
$1.15 billion for counterdrug programs
$500 million for Israeli Missile Defense
$500 million for Taiwan Security Operative 

Miller-Meeks responded to the provisions in a press release stating: “This bill gives our troops the pay raise they deserve and the resources they need to defend this country.” 
The bill moves to the Senate for reconciliation.
Cedar Rapids to receive infrastructure funding from Grassley-backed bill
Cedar Rapids is set to receive $25 million in federal funding through the Grassley-backed Infrastructure and Jobs Act of 2021. 
The funding is allocated for a “flood resiliency project” and road improvements on highway I-380.
“I’m happy to announce that the City of Cedar Rapids is receiving a $25 million award to improve its flood resilience and infrastructure,” Grassley said in a press release. “You can imagine how important this funding is for Cedar Rapids, after the city has been hit by devastating floods. These federal dollars will be put to good use to strengthen the Cedar Rapids community.”

(Screenshot via KET)Cuts to public broadcasting that cleared Congress early Friday morning will cost KET funding for most of its original programming and a fourth of its workforce, said the head of Kentucky’s statewide public television network.
 “KET has begun the difficult process of determining what must be reduced, suspended or ended due to the significant loss of CPB funding,” said Shae Hopkins, KET executive director and CEO, in a release Friday afternoon.
Republican President Donald Trump pushed Congress to end funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, or CPB, including rescinding more than $1 billion that Congress already had approved.
Hopkins said $4.2 million from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting has paid for “the majority of KET’s productions and 25% of KET’s total workforce.”
“For nearly 55 years, CPB funding has been the primary source of support for KET’s local productions and related services,” said the release.
Kentucky’s lone Democrat in Congress, U.S. Rep. Morgan McGarvey of Louisville, was the only member of the state’s delegation to vote against the measure. 
Republican U.S. Reps. Andy Barr, James Comer, Brett Guthrie, Thomas Massie and Hal Rogers voted in favor of $9 billion in cuts, most of which came from foreign aid.
U.S. Sens. Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul approved the bill when the Senate passed the rescissions package Thursday, ahead of a Friday deadline.
One cost-cutting step KET already has taken is canceling its coverage of this year’s annual Fancy Farm Picnic in West Kentucky next month. The gathering typically brings the state’s high-profile elected officials and candidates together in front of a crowd. KET’s coverage included broadcasting their speeches statewide.
  Casey Parker-Bell, left, and Renee Shaw hosted KET’s coverage of Fancy Farm in 2023. The network is not covering Kentucky’s most famous political event this year because federal funding cuts have wiped out its budget for original programming.

KET’s Hopkins said: “While extremely disappointed, we are heartened by the outpouring of support from across the Commonwealth. And although we know there are changes to come, KET remains steadfastly committed to the people of Kentucky and providing trusted, educational programs and services.”  come
The federal funding cuts will also affect public radio stations across the country. Louisville Public Media sent an email to supporters Friday morning that said the bill cuts “$376,000 from our budget TODAY.” The money funded local journalism, emergency alert systems during storms and cultural programming. 
“This final vote effectively ends federal funding for LPM, our sister stations throughout Kentucky and the public media system nationwide – after bipartisan support for almost 60 years,” the email said. “But this will not be the end of Louisville Public Media.” 
LPM and its sister outlets are collecting donations from supporters in hopes of making up for the loss of the federal funding. 
Some Kentucky Democrats slammed the public media cuts. McGarvey said on X ahead of the House vote that “public broadcasting saves lives.”

That’s the general advice from state officials when it comes to enjoying New Hampshire’s beaches.

That’s the general advice from state officials when it comes to enjoying New Hampshire’s beaches. The state provides resources for summer swimmers looking to avoid unscenic surprises from bacteria and toxic algae, but with hundreds of waterbodies, officials often rely on residents to report problems.
The New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services maintains an online tool, updated daily, called the Healthy Swimming Mapper, which tracks advisories for fecal bacteria at public beaches and harmful algal blooms across state waters.
The system’s flagged active fecal bacteria advisories collected from sampling at the following spots:

Ellacoya RV State Park Beach in Gilford since July 16
Northwood Town Beach since July 17
Corcoran’s Pond Beach in Waterville Valley since July 17

Bacterial contamination from sources like stormwater runoff or failing septic systems triggers advisories when levels exceed state safety standards. Meanwhile, toxic cyanobacteria blooms pose more serious health threats.
“A bloom can manifest in minutes,” said Amy Smagula, chief aquatic biologist at NHDES. “That’s why we really rely on that ‘look, check, report.’ Because there are so many more eyes out there than we have staff biologists.”
This year’s bloom activity appears typical for mid-July, with the department having received about 50 reports of harmful algal blooms statewide, according to Smagula.
“We’re normal from that standpoint,” she said. “It seems quieter this year because Lake Winnipesaukee didn’t have that early season bloom like they did in 2024.”
The state takes a measured approach to issuing warnings, reserving them for significant lake-wide events rather than isolated bloom reports that appear on the swimming map online.
“A lot of times we receive a notice of a possible bloom from a shoreline resident where they’re observing a little bit of material in front of their dock or beach, and that’s not necessarily representative of the whole lake,” Smagula explained. “Rather than raising an alarm when there’s no need for alarm, because blooms can be very isolated, we put out a message to the lake residents that say we’ve observed a bloom and let us know if you start to see it in other places.”
For beach bacteria issues, daily retesting continues until levels drop back to safe standards. Cyanobacteria bloom warnings typically last about a month but can range from a week to several months depending on conditions, according to the department.
The mapping system allows folks to search for specific locations, check current conditions, and sign up for email alerts for particular waterbodies and statewide updates. Weekly resampling continues from May 15 until Oct. 15 for any lakes under cyanobacteria warnings.
Those blooms are popping up in New Hampshire and in other states more often these days, especially during the summer, due to climate change-driven warming and pollution.
Another cause for blooms? Boat wakes that erode the shoreline and disturb the lake bottom, especially when done too close to shore and in too shallow of water, according to Andrea LaMoreaux, president and policy advocate for NH LAKES.
Trouble signs to spot for: weird/unusual discoloration, floating mats of algae, or scummy surface films.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency warns cyanobacteria can cause a range of problems for humans, including headaches, fevers, skin rashes, respiratory symptoms, upset stomachs, seizures, liver and kidney damage, and even death. Cyanobacteria can also be fatal for dogs that drink contaminated water or lick themselves after a good swim, according to NHDES.
When in doubt, maybe find another swimming spot. To report potential water issues, people are urged to fill out a form on the department’s website or call the Harmful Algal Bloom Program at 603-848-8094. 
If you or your pets get sick, you can submit an illness report to help the state track waterborne sicknesses (after seeing a doctor or veterinarian, of course).",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/cyanobacterianew-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-18 17:02:01.836250

(Courtesy of South Dakota Department of Corrections)South Dakota lawmakers will gather in September to decide whether to replace the state penitentiary. 
On Friday, Gov. Larry Rhoden issued an executive proclamation calling a special session of the Legislature for Sept. 23.
The news comes a little over a week after the governor’s Project Prison Reset task force voted to endorse a 1,500-bed complex on undeveloped land in northeastern Sioux Falls. 
Prison task force picks Sioux Falls, caps price at $650 million for 1,500 beds

The group recommended a price cap of $650 million, which is roughly the amount that has been set aside for prison construction over the past three years, potentially allowing the state to pay cash for the project rather than taking on debt. 
The cap is around $75 million less than consultants and work managers said would be necessary for a project of that size during the task force’s final meeting on July 8, but the group decided that a higher price wouldn’t earn legislative support. 
Spending bills require the support of two-thirds of lawmakers. The final spending push for an $825 million prison on a controversial Lincoln County site failed to clear that hurdle in February.
In a letter to Rhoden requesting the special session, Lt. Gov. Tony Venhuizen, who leads the prison task force, said compromises were necessary to find an answer that would appeal to the Legislature and ease overcrowding in the state’s Department of Corrections facilities.
“The task force’s unanimous vote for its recommendation demonstrates that we have found a good site for a new penitentiary and a strong path forward,” Venhuizen wrote.
The new prison, if approved by lawmakers, would replace the oldest parts of the state penitentiary in Sioux Falls. That building was initially constructed in 1881, prior to statehood.

(Photo by Aaron Bolton for KFF Health News) The Montana Legislature voted to override Gov. Greg Gianforte’s veto of a bill that would use state funds to reimburse counties some of the cost of holding inmates in local detention facilities while awaiting mental health evaluations or treatments. 
House Bill 643, brought by Rep. Tracy Sharp, R-Polson, was seen by many as a stop-gap measure to address rising costs to counties that have seen increased mental health issues arising in civil and criminal cases. 
The law provides a one-time appropriation of $6 million for the Department of Public Health and Human Services to reimburse counties for holding individuals awaiting a DPHHS evaluation, or have been committed to DPHHS and are awaiting an open bed at a mental health facility. The reimbursement rate from DPHHS would be $133.88 per day in fiscal year 2026.  
Gianforte vetoed the bill, citing its cost to Montana taxpayers and lack of long-term solution. 
“This issue requires a permanent, comprehensive solution, but House Bill 643 only applies an expensive Band-Aid,” Gianforte wrote in his veto letter. 
But the Legislature, which voted overwhelmingly 99-1 and 48-2 in the House and Senate respectively during the session, disagreed with the governor. 
A veto override poll sent to lawmakers closed on July 14 with 67 representatives and 34 senators voting for the legislation — the exact number required to usurp the veto pen. 
“This was a very bipartisan bill, it had support across the entire state,” Sharp told the Daily Montanan. “It was intended to help all the counties in the state dealing with the issue of having to hold people for the Department of Public Health and Human Services.”
Sharp said that commissioners from various counties had approached him before the legislative session and pointed out that the state makes similar reimbursements through the Department of Corrections, if there is a waiting list to get into a state-run prison, but not for mental health services. 
According to the bill’s fiscal note, DPHHS said the waitlist for individuals who need DPHHS evaluations or beds at state facilities averages between 100 and 125 — a number not projected to decrease in the next few years. Those individuals are held in county detention centers, sometimes for several months. 
Travis Ahner, the Flathead County Attorney, told the Daily Montanan that one inmate currently housed in the county detention center had been sentenced to DPHHS custody in mid-October, but had yet to leave the county. 
In the more than 270 days since his sentencing, the county would be owed more than $37,000 in reimbursements were HB 643 currently in effect. The same inmate had also waited for several months for a DPHHS evaluation — spending even more time in the county jail at the expense of the county. 
Ahner said that there are several inmates in the county’s detention facility awaiting evaluations by DPHHS, and “a couple” who have been committed, but have yet to be transported to new facilities.
“It would free up a lot of money,” Ahner said. “The county’s other expenses are still being accrued. It takes money that we have been spending on these particular inmates, and we won’t have those expenses on the books.”
But Ahner, and Sharp, both acknowledge that while the funding will help counties short-term, it doesn’t address the state-wide problem of limited facilities for inmates who need mental health services. 
“There’s nothing in this that specifically says you’re going to get evaluations faster, or that you’re going to get a placement faster or additional beds,” Ahner said. 
Sharp told the Daily Montanan that he hopes the interim period will allow DPHHS and lawmakers to gather data that can be used next legislative session to determine the best path forward. 
“The Governor isn’t incorrect when he says it’s kind of a temporary fix,” Sharp said. “But it will allow us to return in 2027 and see where we are, what we need and see if we will need to take money from the general fund in future to support counties while DPHHS continues to work on long-term solutions with the state’s mental health facilities.” 
“This is me saying, ‘Hey, while we’re working on fixing this, let’s do something to pay for the situation counties are dealing with,’” he added.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)In a swing through Nashville to highlight immigration crackdowns, Kristi Noem called the city’s mayor undeserving of office, accused a local university of obstructing justice and pledged a more visible immigration enforcement presence on the city’s streets.
Noem, secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, spoke to reporters Friday to highlight what Trump administration officials are calling the “worst of the worst” among immigrants with criminal histories.
She spotlighted the arrests of four unnamed men in Tennessee whom, she said, are illegal immigrants tied to gangs or terrorism and accused of crimes that include homicide, promoting prostitution and child rape. 
“President Trump has been focused ever since he’s been in office on making America safe again,” Noem said. The president, she said, promised “to make sure we’re going after the worst of the worst every single day, to get the murderers, the rapists, the child pedophiles and pornographers off of our streets and out of the country.”
Noem then pivoted to take aim at Nashville Mayor Freddie O’Connell.

O’Connell updated a longstanding policy requiring city personnel to report interactions with federal immigration agents to the mayor’s office, requiring notice within 24 hours instead of three days required under the previous policy. O’Connell implemented the policy update after immigration raids swept up nearly 200 people in May.
Nashville, like the majority of Tennessee jurisdictions, has also not opted into formal cooperation agreements with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a point of contention with state Republicans leaders, who have offered incentives to enter into the agreements, and Trump administration officials, who have encouraged more such local partnerships.
“I’m specifically calling out the mayor of Nashville,” Noem said. 
“By his rhetoric and by what he is requiring his city employees to do, and by not having the backs of these ICE officers, he is allowing more children to be trafficked, more children to be victimized and more families to suffer because of his actions and politics,” she said.
“He doesn’t deserve to be mayor. He doesn’t deserve to be in office,” said Noem, who also called O’Connell’s actions “shameful.”
Noem also took aim at Belmont University, a private Christian institution in Nashville with about 9000 students.
Townhall, a conservative website, this week accused the school of sheltering undocumented students and subverting a Trump administration ban on campus diversity initiatives. 
“We’re seeing obstruction against federal immigration law by Belmont University,” Noem said Friday.
“As you know, they’ve openly said that they will house illegal immigrants on their campus and do that in defiance of the federal government,” she said.
A Belmont spokesperson on Friday said, “we are aware of comments from government officials and maintain that the university is in compliance with federal laws.”
O’Connell’s office did not immediately respond to questions about Noem’s remarks.
Kilmar Abrego Garcia to remain jailed in Tennessee as judge weighs arguments on release

Noem also weighed in on the criminal case against Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was brought to Nashville to face two human smuggling charges after a Trump administration attorney admitted the Maryland father of three had wrongly been deported to El Salvador. 
Calling Abrego a “monster,” Noem said the case against him was “overwhelming” and said she hopes the federal judge presiding over the case, Waverly Crenshaw, Jr. “does the right thing and brings this man to justice.”
Crenshaw is currently weighing a motion by federal prosecutors to keep Abrego, a Salvadoran national, detained pending trial while Abrego’s attorneys in a separate case are fighting the Trump administration over its plans to deport him to a “third country.”
Noem promised Nashville residents they could soon see more immigration enforcement, pledging “dozens” of new agents now that Trump has signed into law the “big beautiful bill,” which includes substantial increases in the budget of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. 
“What the people of Nashville will see is obviously more individuals and agents, but they’ll also see more training and equipment,” she said without detailing what types of equipment.

“Dozens more officers and agents will be here in the Nashville area,” she said.
The media also served as a target for Noem’s criticism on Friday for promoting what she characterized as “false narratives” about the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement activities. 
Asked by a journalist about the targeting of immigrants based on “skin color,” Noem sharply snapped back:
“That has been another false narrative that has been put out there in the media that I absolutely want to throw back at you and say that is absolutely false, and don’t you dare say that again,” she said.

Article Summary

A new study shows there are barriers to upward mobility in Illinois, especially for women and people of color.
People who grow up in lower-income families tend to earn less as adults than those from wealthier families, even after earning similar degrees and going to work in similar fields.
Educational attainment and career choices are still the biggest factors that influence future earnings.

This summary was written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.



For generations, America has been thought of as the land of opportunity, a place where anyone who worked and studied hard could grow up to achieve any goal they set for themselves.

That idea has had especially strong roots in Illinois, the “Land of Lincoln,” where a young man born in a log cabin on America’s frontier rose from rail-splitter to self-taught lawyer and president of the United States.

But a new study suggests that the American dream is still more elusive for some people in Illinois than for others, and that the pathway up the economic ladder is not easily scaled.

The study, entitled “Precarious Prospects,” tracked a cohort of millennials from Illinois – more than 340,000 students from the senior classes of 2008-2012 – from graduation, through their post-secondary careers and into young adulthood.

The study was a joint project conducted by the Illinois Workforce and Education Research Collaborative, or IWERC, the Discovery Partners Institute, the University of Illinois, and the University of Chicago Consortium on School Research.

It found that educational attainment is still a strong predicter of a person’s future earnings as an adult. So too is the industry that a person chooses for a career.

Other factors can also influence a person’s ability to complete a higher education degree, including their race, ethnicity and gender.

Class-based barriers

The study also found that a person’s own economic background – whether they grew up rich or poor – also strongly influences their future earnings. Students who grew up in higher-income households tended to earn more than those who grew up in lower-income families, in part because students from higher-income families were more likely to complete a college degree than lower-income students.

But perhaps most surprisingly, the study found that even among those who earn similar degrees and go to work in similar industries, a student’s own economic background influenced their future earnings. That is, students from lower-income families tend to earn less than those from wealthier families, even after they went on to earn similar credentials.

Further, the study found, among students from lower-income families, Black and Latino students and women tended to earn less than their white and male counterparts.

“The racial and gender disparities obviously are real, and there's a lot of research showing that, but I don't think it's all that's going on,” Sarah Cashdollar, associate director of IWERC and a lead author of the report, said in a podcast interview with Capitol News Illinois.





“One thing is that the same degree, such as a bachelor's degree, can have a very different payoff depending on the college that the student went to,” she said. “And there's research that's found students from higher income families are more likely to go to colleges that have things like many internship opportunities or other work-based learning. More advising, more networking opportunities. And for some fields, those things are essential to landing a good job.”

“There's also research showing that higher income students have greater access to social networks in general that can provide those connections,” she said.

Education and career choice

Among all the factors the study examined, educational attainment had by far the largest impact on a person’s future earnings. It found there was a gap of nearly $40,000 a year in earnings for someone with an advanced degree compared to someone with only a high school diploma.

The study also found that regardless of what type of degree or credential a person earns, the industry in which they work has a big impact on their future earnings.

“For certificates and associate’s degrees, we see higher earnings for construction, for mechanic and repair technologies,” Cashdollar said. “So these are things like auto mechanics, HVAC techs, electricians, and also precision production. … These are all areas that tend to have unions, and they also have been experiencing higher demand due to lower supply in recent years, and so there's some upward wage pressure in those in those occupations.”

“And then for the bachelor's, there are many, many industries that offer higher earnings,” she said. “Two of the highest earnings were engineering and computer and information sciences.”

But the gaps between people with similar degrees from different economic backgrounds was still significant – $3,753 annually for those with less than a bachelor’s degree, and $5,028 for those with a bachelor’s degree or higher.

Still to come

The Precarious Prospects study was the first of a two-part research project made possible through a data sharing partnership between the Illinois Department of Employment Security, the Illinois Student Assistance Commission, the Illinois State Board of Education and Illinois State University.

Cashdollar said the second phase of the project, due to be published later this year, will focus on those students who manage to succeed in climbing the economic ladder, despite the barriers they face.

“To give a preview, we found that there were pathways at all levels of education toward higher earning careers, but they were predominantly concentrated in bachelor's degree pathways and even higher masters and doctoral and professional (programs).”

Free.,Some frozen federal funds for schools released to states by Trump administration,Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/some-frozen-federal-funds-schools-released-states-trump-administration,,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump’s administration confirmed Friday that it’s releasing funds that support before- and after-school programs as well as summer programs, a portion of the $6.8 billion in withheld funds for K-12 schools that were supposed to be sent out two weeks ago.The administration has faced bipartisan backlash over its decision to freeze billions of dollars that also go toward migrant education, English-language learning, adult education and literacy programs, among other initiatives. Those other funds apparently remained stalled on Friday, and Democrats, a key Republican appropriator and school leaders called for them to be released as well.The funds that will be released total $1.3 billion, according to Democrats on the Senate Appropriations Committee, and are intended for the 21st Century Community Learning Centers initiative.The Education Department says the program “supports the creation of community learning centers that provide academic enrichment opportunities during non-school hours for children, particularly students who attend high-poverty and low-performing schools.”A senior administration official said the programmatic review for 21st Century Community Learning Centers has concluded and funds “will be released to the states.”“Guardrails have been put in place to ensure these funds are not used in violation of Executive Orders,” the official added. Pressure from GOP senatorsThe announcement came after 10 Republican senators sent a letter to Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought on July 16 urging him to release the $6.8 billion in funds to states.West Virginia GOP Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, who led the letter, said in a statement Friday that “21st Century Community Learning Centers offer important services that many West Virginians rely on.”“This program supports states in providing quality after-school and summer learning programs for students while enabling their parents to work and contribute to local economies,” said Capito, who chairs the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies.Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, who leads the broader Senate Appropriations panel, also signed the July 16 letter, along with: Sens. Katie Britt of Alabama, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, John Boozman of Arkansas, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, Deb Fischer of Nebraska, John Hoeven of North Dakota, Mike Rounds of South Dakota and Jim Justice of West Virginia.While Collins said in a Friday statement she is glad she and her colleagues were able to work together to “effectively urge the Administration to get these funds released,” she noted that “there is more funding that still needs to be disbursed.”“I will continue to work to ensure it is delivered swiftly so educators can prepare for the upcoming academic year with certainty and Maine students and families have the resources they need to succeed,” she said.July 1 notificationThe Education Department notified states of the freeze just a day before July 1, when these funds are typically sent out as educators plan for the school year, saying the funds were under review.A slew of congressional Democrats and one independent pushed back on the funding freeze.Thirty-two senators and 150 House Democrats urged Vought and Education Secretary Linda McMahon in two letters dated July 10 to immediately release the funds they say are being withheld “illegally.”A coalition of 24 states and the District of Columbia also sued the administration over the withheld funds.The rest of the school moneySen. Patty Murray of Washington state, the top Democrat on the Senate spending panel, called on the Trump administration to release the rest of the frozen funds.“After we spoke up — and after weeks of needless chaos — the Trump administration is now releasing funding for after school programs while continuing to block billions more in funding for our students, teachers, and schools,” Murray said in a statement Friday.“Every penny of this funding must flow immediately,” she said. “Whether or not parents know the afterschool program they depend on will exist should not depend on whether Republicans will push back against Trump’s lawlessness — he should simply get the funding out, just as the law requires him to do. I am going to keep pushing until every dollar goes.”David Schuler, executive director of AASA, The School Superintendents Association, expressed similar concerns in a statement Friday.“While we’re pleased to see crucial dollars going to afterschool programs which are vital for students across the nation, the bottom line is this: Districts should not be in this impossible position where the Administration is denying funds that had already been appropriated to our public schools, by Congress,” said Schuler, whose organization helps to ensure every child has access to a high quality public education.“The remaining funds must be released immediately — America’s children are counting on it.”",,,,2025-07-18 17:02:01.836250

In a news release, Democrats Charlie Cavell and Kristen Nelson said they were withdrawing from participation in the majority caucus, and called it a significant step for realigning the board’s focus on ethical leadership, transparency and public accountability.
A spokesperson for Oakland County deferred comment to the board and its chair, David Woodward.
Woodward did not respond to a message seeking comment on Friday.
The board has 19 seats representing the county and 12 of those seats are occupied by Democrats. Cavell was first elected to the board in 2020, while Nelson has served since 2018. Both said they do not plan to leave the Democratic Party, as their values have not changed.
In a statement, Nelson said she and Cavell could no longer remain part of the caucus structure, one that “resists reform and enables centralized control at the expense of good governance.”SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“The public expects honesty and accountability from its elected officials, not political maneuvering behind closed doors,” Nelson said.
The release noted that there has been a months-long internal effort to strengthen ethics oversight, increase transparency in decision-making and to expand inclusion within the board’s leadership process.
“This is about standing up for democratic principles and creating a government residents can trust,” Cavell said in a statement. “We’re choosing to act on our values – and to build a healthier, more accountable government from the ground up.”
The pair elaborated that there has been growing public concern about the concentration of decision-making power with the board and a perceived lack of openness in the handling of public funds and appointments. The board recently spent as much as $300 million on two new buildings while cuts to appropriations for basic needs were on the horizon, and Cavell and Nelson said there were increases of 100% or higher, in some cases, to assessing contracts with local cities and townships.
Additionally, there was a recent scandal that involved a three-year, $450,000 technology staffing contract, which was canceled after it was revealed that the company was owned by a current Oakland County employee – raising conflict of interest concerns – The Oakland Press reported this week.
Both Cavell and Nelson said it was their intention to collaborate more with like-minded colleagues on both sides of the aisle and to continue serving on committee assignments.
“This is not a break from our values. It is a return to them,” Nelson said. “Oakland County residents deserve a commission that works for them, not for itself. In the weeks ahead, we’ll be increasing the pressure on County leaders to advance blocked ethics, financial disclosure and transparency policies introduced months ago.”
